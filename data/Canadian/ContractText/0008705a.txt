(Industrial accidents are, of course, covered by Workers’ Compensation and not by this policy). This benefit continues to age 70, if still crewing on Company vessels

The prices for halibut shown above are for trips with less than 500 pounds of halibut. Trips in excess of 5 00 pounds will be adjusted upward according to market prices less any elated costs for large volume shipments, but in no case will be less than shown above. However, the halibut must be properly washed, cleaned and iced to receive prices over and above these stated prices.
The above prices are fixed during the term of the agreement. Where market conditions could stop fishing or cause restrictions on a species at the above prices the Company will notify the Union two weeks in advance of ceasing operations or restricting a species or requesting a price change.
The Company expects crew members to cooperate in landing well iced and properly gutted, defect free fish and generally to continue to strive for quality improvements in order to hold and enlarge on the number of customers so important to continued operations and the welfare of all participants in this industry.

QUALITY GRADING PROGRAM FOR TRAWLER CAUGHT GROUNDFISH
Fish shall be graded, at the time of discharge, as Grade "A", Grade "B", Grade "C" or Reject according to
the following procedures:
1.	At-Sea Fish Handling Practices
To qualify as Grade A the following requirements shall be met:
(i)	All fish shall be properly penned and shelved. To qualify as properly penned and shelved, the shelf boards shall be arranged according to a company approved shelving plan as posted on each vessel. The shelf boards should be resting on the shelf streaks (strongbacks) at the time of discharge and there should be no indication that the shelf boards rested on ice. Fish will not under any circumstance be downgradedfor improper shelving caused by reasons that are beyond the control of the fishermen such as: penboards buckling from the weight of fish and ice, stanchionsbeing distorted, shelf streaks improperly installed by shore personnel, etc.
(ii)	All fish shall be properly iced. Proper icing is achieved when each shelf of fish is encased in ice on all sides, top, and bottom and ice is mixed through the fish at time of discharge. Heavy layers of ice and layers of fish with no ice mixed through the fish shall not be considered proper icing. Fish shall not be downgradedfor poor icing if the company fails to remove contaminated ice or ice that is more than 2 trips old.
(iii)	Fish flesh shall be 3.3 degrees Centigrade (38 degrees Fahrenheit) or less but not frozen at the time of discharge.
(iv)	All fish shall be properly washed so that they do not contain sand, mud, gravel, any sea bottom debris or extreme amounts of blood at time of discharge.
(v)	All fish that are required to be gutted shall be cleanly gutted so that the gut content shall be less than 1 % by weight at the time of discharge. Fish that contain more than 1 % gut content by weight shall not qualify as Grade "A". All fish shall be properly ripped so that they are not ripped beyond the anal opening to ensure the fish are suitable for machine processing and so that they are not ripped on the side so as to affect fillet yield or the product in which the fillet can be packed.
All turbot, grenadier and all flatfish except greysole shall be properly bobtailed so that proper bleeding is assured and so that fillet yield is not affected. Tails shall not remain attached to the fish in any single days catch, providing 10% or less of the fish have the tails attached the fish shall qualify as Grade "A". When more than 20% of the fish have the tails attached the fish shall not qualify as Grade "A" and there shall be a weight deduction for tails that remain attached to the fish.
25
(vi)	Boxed or containerized fish shall be properly filled and stacked so that the weight of one container is not resting on the fish in another container.
In the application of all of the above standards in borderline cases the benefit of doubt shall always be given to the fish qualifying as Grade "A". Fish that do not meet the above requirements shall be downgraded to Grade "B" provided they are wholesome and satisfy other standard requirements.
The purpose of the above standardsis to ensure all fishermen use good at-sea fish handling practices to ensure that they land the maximum amount of top grade fish. In application of these standards fish shall not be downgraded for any reason that is beyond the control of the fishermen themselves.
26
NATIONAL SEA PRODUCTS LIMITED
FISH WEIGHING AND RECEIPT PROCEDURES
1.	All fish shall be unloaded directly from the trawler through existing unloading systems and weighed over scales approved and stamped by the Department of Weights and Measures and monitored regularly by the Union.
2.	Scales shall not be adjusted upward or downward to allow for any factors and shall balance at zero (0) all year round.
3.	The Weighmaster shall record the actual weight and specie contained in each lot of fish before tripping scales or allowing the removal of each lot of fish, and make available to the Union, if requested, a copy of the original record.
4.	Gross weight shall be the total weight that passes over the scales or the total weight passing over scales plus anything culled out prior to tallying weight.
5.	Deductions from gross weight may be made for the following reasons:
(a)	ice and water
(b)	undersize fish
(c)	inedible species
(d)	green spots
(e)	congenital defects not including normal infestation by worms
6.	Deductions to be made from the gross weight shall be arrived at in the following manner:
(a)	for ice and water - random samples, minimum of five (5) per drift, to determine appropriate percentages;
(b)	for undersize fish - random samples, minimum of five (5) per shift to establish appropriate percentage to be deducted from gross weight. Where practical the foregoing percentage shall be checked against the actual weight ofundersized fish culled out on the production line anywhere from trawler to cutting line, to ensure that the percentage is reasonably accurate. Where this comparison is made and carried out to completion, and the results do not coincide, the actual weight culled out will be used for making deductions from gross weight;
(c)	for inedible species - (i) random samples, minimum of five (5) per drift, to establish the appropriate percentage to be deducted from gross weight, or (ii) the actual weight of such specie culled out on the production line;
(d)	for green spots - these fillets shall be culled out, weighed and converted back to dressed fish on the basis of a standard twenty-eight percent (28%) yield;
(e)	for congenital defects not including normal infestation by worms - in the same manner as green spots
27
7.	Deductions for reasons outlined in 5(d) and 5(e) herein, which amountto five percent (5%) or more of gross weight, will be certified in writing by a Federal Fisheries Inspection Officer provided one is readily available and is willing to do so.
8.	In any dispute over quality at time and point of discharge, the opinion of the Federal Fisheries Inspection Officer shall prevail providing the Officer is available and willing to express his opinion subject to arbitration as herein provided.
9.	If all fish are processed before the trawler is settled, the deduction will be the actual amounts found. If the trawler is settled before all fish are cut, the deduction will be based on the percentage found up to the time of settlement.
10.	The Company will endeavour to ensure that quality does not suffer as a result of any of its actions. An allegation by the Union that the Company has failed in this regard may be dealt with without disruption through grievance and arbitration.
11.	The receipt shall show the net processable fish as per species and size, the deductions from gross weight for items 5(a) to 5(e), and the reasons for same.
12.	With respect to boxed or containerized fish the following shall apply:
(a)	For each species boxed or containerized fish, the contents of a minimum of 10% of the boxes or containers, randomly chosen, shall be applied to the entire catch as the basis for settling the trip.
(b)	With respect to quality dockside grading, a sampling procedure similar to that used for penned fish shall be applied to the sample boxes in A above, as the basis for determiningthe quality grades.
