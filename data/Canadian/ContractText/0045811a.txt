NOTES APPLICABLE TO JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
1.	Employees in any job classification will perform any jobs or duties to which they may be assigned. Each "job classification" may include a wide variety of different jobs, tasks and duties, some of which may cross job classification lines. Maintenance, housekeeping and lubrication duties may be required of any employee. Employees who either perform maintenance duties or assist in performing maintenance duties will be paid at the rate of their own regular job classification. There is no contractual obligation for establishing light duty job classifications.
2.	There are no minimum crew or job manning requirements. The Company has the sole right to determine the number of employees in any job classification as well as the right to determine crew size in the plant or any portion thereof, provided there is no violation of any appropriate government legislation. Classified jobs may be filled, vacated or permanently discontinued at the Company's discretion.
3.	If employees within the bargaining unit do not possess the necessary skills to fill a vacancy, the Company may fill such vacancy by hiring from outside.
4.	Non-employee, contract labour may be used to supplement the Company's workforce. Such contract labourers will not be used if any employee is in a layoff status unless such laid off employee either cannot be immediately contacted, or if contacted, the employee rejects the opportunity to perform the available work.
5.	Lab employees may be required to have a minimum education level as determined by the Company. This may include a requirement for post secondary education in courses related to Quality Assurance and/or related experience.
6.	Safety is everyone’s responsibility. Employees’ job responsibilities include their personal safety and collectively, that of their fellow employees.
Section 4.02	Shift Differentials
2nd or 3rd Shifts - A shift differential is paid in addition to an employee's regular straight time hourly rate if he is scheduled and working on either the 2nd or 3rd shift. The 2nd shift differential is 700 per hour. The 3rd shift differential is $1.00 per hour. The 4th shift or swing shift differential is $1.00 per hour.
Note 1:	If an employee is scheduled on a 2nd or 3rd shift and is involved in a
continuous work period requiring him to work on more than one shift, then the shift on which he has been scheduled establishes the shift differential, if any, for all hours worked during the continuous work period. An employee who is scheduled on the day or 1st shift does not qualify for shift differential pay even though he works on the 2nd
-5-
or 3rd shifts. Shift differentials are not applicable to call-ins or call-backs unless such an assignment continues on into the employee's regularly scheduled 2nd or 3rd shift. If an employee is on a regular schedule which requires him to overlap 2 shifts, then the shift on which he is scheduled the greatest number of hours determines the shift differential, if any. Should he be scheduled an equal number of hours on 2 shifts, then the higher shift differential will apply.
Note 2:	Shift differentials are not added to an employee's base rate for purposes of
computing overtime, or for any unworked hours for which the employee is paid such as holidays, jury duty and funeral leave.
Section 4.03	Rates Of Pay - Temporarv Transfers
A - If an employee is temporarily transferred for Company convenience to a lower-rated job classification, he will continue to receive the rate of pay for his regular job classification until the transfer is made permanent
B - If an employee is temporarily transferred by the Company to a higher-rated job classification, he will receive the higher rate of pay. However, it does not apply to employees who may relieve for breaks or who may be supplementing the workforce performing various tasks or jobs performed by employees in other job classifications.
Section 4,04	Rates Of Pay - Permanent Transfers
An employee who is permanently transferred to a lower-rated job classification will receive the lower rate at the time he begins work in the lower-rated job. If he is permanently transferred to a higher-rated job classification, he will receive the rate of the higher-rated job after he has completed his training and trial period and can satisfactorily perform the duties of the job with no more supervision than is required by other employees on the same job.
Section 4.05	Rates of Pay - Supervisor Relief and Lead Person
A - An employee assigned as a Relief Supervisor shall be paid an hourly rate which is $1.25 above the highest rate of the employees working on the shift for which he is responsible.
B - An employee assigned as a Lead Person shall be paid an hourly rate which is $1.00 above the highest rate of the employee working on the shift for which he is responsible.
C - Supervisor Relief or Lead Person assignments may be filled at the Company’s discretion, subject to the employee’s willingness to accept such assignmenL Lead Persons may be used in any department where lead duties are desirable. Lead Persons will perform regular duties in addition to their lead duties. Supervisor Relief and Lead Person assignments may run for indefinite periods of time and may be filled or vacated at the Company’s discretion.
-6-
Section 4.06
Temporary Employees
Temporary employees may be hired as determined by the Company to supplement the workforce. Such employees will not be entitled to benefits under this collective Agreement nor will the provisions of this collective Agreement apply to them. Such temporary employees will not accrue seniority as a result of such temporary employment. Temporary employees are not considered probationary employees even if the temporary assignment exceeds the probationary period. Individual temporary assignments will not exceed 160 work days per contract year.
Note 1:	Regular employees who are on layoff will be offered the temporary
assignment before temporary employees are assigned the temporary work. Regular employees who accept the temporary assignment will be paid the rate of the job they are performing. If the temporary assignment is for a minimum of 10 work days, the regular employee who is on layoff must accept the assignment or lose his seniority in accordance.
Note 2:	Temporary employees will be paid $12.00 per hour for all hours worked
regardless of the job they are performing.
Section 4,07	Creation Of New Job Classifications
If a new job classification is created, the Company will establish a rate for such classification and, if requested by the Union, shall after no more than 120 working days of job experience, negotiate with the Union for a permanent rate for such classification. Such negotiated rate will be retroactive to the date that the job was established. If the negotiation of such rate reaches an impasse, there shall be no arbitration of such wage rate and the parties shall continue to honor the provisions of Article XII - No Strikes Or Lockouts. In the event of such impasse, the rate negotiation will be deferred to the next regular negotiation of the collective Agreement, and the provision of retroactivity shall be as provided in this Section.
Section 4.08	Severance Procedure
In the event that a permanent reduction in force results in the reduction in the number of full-time employees, the Company and Union will meet to negotiate the severance payments for the affected employees.
ARTICLE V	HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 5.01	Intent And No Pyramiding
This Article is intended to set forth the normal hours of work and to provide a basis for computing overtime and premium pay, and shall not be construed as a guarantee or limitation on overtime hours or on hours of work per day or per week, nor shall anything in this Agreement be so construed as to permit the pyramiding or duplicating of overtime or premium payments. Hours for which overtime or premium payments are made
-7-
shall not be used to compute overtime or premium pay for any other hours. Whenever more than one premium could be applied to the same hours, only the larger will be paid. For purposes of this Section, shift differentials are not considered as premium payments.
Section 5.02	Workday And Workweek
The workday is a 24-hour period running from 6 AM one day to 6 AM the following day. The workweek begins at 6 AM Monday and ends at G AM the following Monday. The normal workweek contains 5 consecutive workdays scheduled Monday through Sunday. The workday and workweek may be different for some individuals, departments or shifts in the interest of efficient or less costly plant operations.
Note: Employees scheduled rest days will be consecutive; and, in the case of a 5-day work schedule, one of the rest days will include Saturday or Sunday.
Section 5.03	Starting Times. Shifts And Schedules
A - The Company may vary schedules, starting times and quitting times for different areas or operations of the plant or for individual employees. In general, when overtime is not required, employees may be scheduled, at the Company's option, on either an 8 1/2 hour shift including a 1/2 hour unpaid meal period, or on an 8-hour shift with a paid meal period on-the-run.
B - The Company may vary or change the number of hours scheduled, the number of shifts scheduled, the manpower requirements of the various shifts and the scheduling of workdays and hours for business reasons or efficient plant operations. This includes determination as to whether operations are scheduled in a continuous or noncontinuous manner. Any area of the plant or portion of the employees may be scheduled in more than one way.
C - Employees scheduled in operations with job classifications requiring 2 or more shifts may be required to rotate shifts. The Company, at its discretion, may from time to time change an individual employee's shift assignment within a given shift rotation. For example, in a 4-shift operation the Company may determine whether an individual employee is assigned to the A, B, C or D shift.
Section 5.04	Daily And Weekly Overtime Pay
All time worked by an employee over 8 straight time hours in any one day (on an 8-hour shift) or over 40 straight time hours in any one workweek will be paid for at the rate of 1 1/2 times.
Note: For purposes of satisfying the 40 straight time hour requirement, the following unworked hours shall count as straight time hours of work up to 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week for days the employee was either scheduled to work or was laid off: (1) a worked or unworked holiday for which the employee is paid, provided it falls on an employee’s scheduled straight time day of work, or (2) a paid absence resulting from either bereavement leave, jury duty or vacation time off, or (3) 8 hours per day for
-8-
Union members who miss work as a result of attending negotiations with the Company.
Section 5.05	Call-In Pay Premium
An employee who is called in for emergency or overtime work on his scheduled day off or called back after he has finished his shift and left the plant and premises, will be paid at the applicable hourly rate for such unscheduled hours worked or 4 hours pay at his straight time hourly rate, whichever is greater. An employee called back or called in to start in advance of his regular starting time and who continues to work on into his scheduled shift, shall not qualify for the 4-hour guarantee provided for in this Section.
Section 5.06	2nd Scheduled Day Off Premium
An employee shall be paid 2 times his regular rate of pay for work performed on his 2nd scheduled day off, provided he has actually worked 40 straight time hours in the workweek.
Note: The 2nd scheduled day off principle of double time pay shall apply to: (1) the 1st scheduled day off for those employees on a 6-day schedule, and (2) the 7th day of the workweek for those employees on a 7-day emergency schedule, and (3) the 7th day of the workweek for those employees scheduled less than 5 days.
Section 5.07	Distribution Of Overtime
Daily and weekly overtime will be filled by active, qualified employees who are either bid, assigned or temporarily transferred and working in the job where the overtime occurs. Such employees will be assigned to daily and weekly overtime on the basis of the man-on-the-job concept. If this applies to more than one man-on-the-job, then the man-on-the-job in the classification where the overtime occurs who has the most plant seniority will have first opportunity to work the overtime. The Company will attempt to equalize overtime assignments. If active employees in the job classification are not available, the Company may, subject to qualifications, then offer the overtime to the other regular department employees according to their plant seniority. If the overtime is still not filled, the Company may offer the overtime to (1) any qualified employee, then (2) anyone outside of the bargaining unit.
Note 1:	The term man-on-the-job means the employee who is actually performing a
specific job (within a job classification) on the off-going shift.
Note 2:	An employee whose job is in operation may not turn down overtime in his
own job in order to work overtime in another job.
Note 3:	If overtime (including call-ins) is mis-assigned, an employee so affected
shall have the opportunity to make up such missed overtime as soon as is practical within a 30 calendar day period at any time mutually agreeable between the Company and the employee.
-9-
Section 5.08
Job Coverage
A - In case an employee does not report for work, the employee waiting to be relieved will remain on the job and, if necessary, an attempt will be made to supply a replacement as soon as possible within 4 hours after the end of the shift With respect to relieving a group of employees in the same job classification, the principle followed is that the junior, available, qualified employee(s) must remain on the job until the crew is properly relieved.
B - Employees must stay until released when assigned to jobs which are necessary to complete from an emergency breakdown standpoint. Maintenance employees agree to accept emergency call-in or call-back work on a regular basis.
ARTICLE VI	SENIORITY AND FILLING VACANCIES
Section 6,01	Seniority
A - Seniority shall be considered as plant seniority and shall be defined as the duration of a regular employee's continuous service for the Company within the bargaining unit as described in Section 1.01 - Recognition, from his last hiring date. The seniority date of the employee will be determined according to Section 6.03 - Probationary Employees.
B - Seniority of employees hired at the same date will be determined by alphabetic order of family name at date of hire.
Section Note: An up-to-date seniority list will be posted every 3 months and a copy will be given to the Union.
Section 6,02	Consideration Of Qualifications
The application of the seniority provisions of this Agreement must be governed by considerations of whether the employee is qualified to perform the job required. If the employee is not so qualified, the applicable seniority provision will not apply.
Note: It is recognized that an employee who permanently bids or who is permanently transferred to a new or different job will have a fair trial/training period on such new job, as determined by management If during the trial period, the Company finds the employee incapable or the employee declares himself incapable, he will be placed in his previous job. It is understood that the employee who declares himself incapable during the trial period may not apply for another job posting for a 12 month period. The 12 month period will be from the date the posting comes down.
Section 6,03	Probationary Employees
All new employees will be hired as probationary employees for the first 120 calendar days of employment after which the employee shall be placed on the seniority
-10-
list dating back to his date of hire as a probationary employee. A probationary employee shall not have seniority rights and the discharge of such employee will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement.
Section 6.04	Fillino Permanent Vacancies
(Except Maintenance and Job Classifications in the Line of Progression)
When new jobs are created or the Company determines it necessary to fill a permanent vacancy, such job will be filled by plant seniority provided that, in the opinion of management, such employee is capable of learning and performing the job in a safe, efficient and productive manner.
Note 1:	If after posting in the plant, management determines that no suitable
employee is available in the bargaining unit, then employees may be hired from outside the bargaining unit.
Note 2:	An employee who returns from an absence of up to 60 days because of
vacation, leave of absence, funeral leave, jury duty, or occupational or nonoccupational illness or injury may make application retroactively for any permanent vacancies posted during his absence, provided that he does so within 2 working days following his return to work. The Company will attempt to contact an absent employee to determine if he/she wishes to bid on a permanent vacancy, and he/she must respond to such inquiry within 48 hours or forfeit his right to such bid.
Note 3:	For entry into Maintenance, see Section 6.05 - Filling Permanent
Vacancies (Maintenance).
Section 6.05	Filling Permanent Vacancies (Maintenance^
