8.07	TIME LIMITS

A grievance will automatically advance from Step No. 1 to Step No. 2 of the Grievance procedure if the Company fails to respond within the time limits specified, or as mutually extended as set out herein.
17
A grievance will be deemed to have been judged valid if the Company fails to respond in Step No. 2 within the time limits specified, or as mutually extended as set out herein.
8.08	GRIEVANCES DEFINED
Only differences concerning the interpretation or alleged violation of the Agreement are proper subjects for utilization of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
8.09	GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION BINDING
All decisions reached by mutual agreement under this grievance procedure shall be final and binding on the Company, the Union, and the employee.
ARTICLE 9 - ARBITRATION

18
When the Arbitrator deems it advisable to incur other expenses in connection with the grievance, the Arbitrator will obtain the consent of the parties before incurring such expenses.
Expenses which are incurred in connection with the services of the Arbitrator will be borne equally by both parties to this Agreement.
Witness fees and allowances shall be paid by the party calling such witnesses.
ARTICLE 10 - SENIORITY
10.01	SENIORITY DATE
After having served the probationary period, an employee will be given a seniority date coinciding with the most recent date such employee first commenced work with the Company under Article 10.03.
10.02	SENIORITY ZONE
(a)	Seniority shall be plant wide. An employee transferred to another department shall retain his original seniority date. Seniority lists will be revised after signing of this Agreement and every three (3) months thereafter. Copies of the lists will be posted on the corresponding departmental bulletin boards and copies will also be given to the Chairperson of the Grievance Committee. If an employee does not challenge his seniority as stated on the seniority list within ten (10) employee working days after the list is posted, then that statement shall be deemed correct. Protests with respect to alleged inaccuracies in the seniority lists shall be initiated at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
(b)	A plant-wide and a departmental seniority list shall be posted and a copy given to the Chairperson of the grievance Committee within five working days of each layoff and recall. Each laid off employee shall be shown as LO under status or RC if recalled to his job classification or if recalled from outside the plant.
10.03	PROBATION PERIOD
An employee will be deemed to be a probationary employee and he shall have no seniority rights until, he has acquired ninety (90) days of accumulated employment, within the preceding twelve (12) months, at which time he shall become entitled to Company seniority dating from his first most recent date of hire.
Any disciplinary action against a probationary employee including, without limitation, warnings,
19
suspensions, demotions and discharge, shall be deemed absolutely to be for just cause. The Company, in its absolute discretion may terminate the employment of any probationary employee at any time with or without notice or pay in lieu of notice. The probationary period may be extended by the duration of any leave of absence granted during that period and may be extended by mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union.
A new employee, during his probationary period but no later than upon completion of his probationary period, will be assigned by the Company to a job classification which has not been filled through the job posting procedure. The Company will inform the Local Chairperson of any such assignments, in writing, within five (5) working days.
10.04	LOSS OF SENIORITY
An employee shall lose all seniority when he:
(a)	voluntarily quits his employment with the Company or retires.
(b)	is discharged and is not reinstated through the grievance procedure or arbitration.
(c)	is off work for a continuous period of twenty-four (24) months or the length of the employee's seniority, whichever is shorter, except when a leave of absence has been granted.
(d)	fails to accept recall when given notice of recall, or fails to report to work within five (5) days of accepting recall, unless a reason acceptable to the Company (such as a 2 week notice to a current employer) is given and a leave of absence procedure invoked.
(e)	fails to return to work upon termination of authorized leave of absence, unless a reason acceptable to the Company is given.
(f)	accepts gainful employment while on leave of absence without first obtaining the consent of the Company in writing.
(g)	fails to notify the Company of his absence for a period of three (3) consecutive working days unless his reason for such lack of notification is beyond his control.
10.05	EMPLOYEE ADDRESS
It shall be the duty of each employee to notify the Company promptly of any change in address.
Notice required to be given by the company shall be deemed to be given if forwarded to the employee at the last address of which the Company had notice. The Local Chairperson will be notified when the
20
Company has failed to contact an employee for recall or other seniority related items.
10.06	SHORT LAYOFFS
Short layoffs may be invoked as the result of a breakdown of equipment, accident, or other events
outside the control of the Company.
Should a short layoff exceed more than twenty-four (24) hours, an employee affected by such a layoff
may exercise his seniority as set out in the following order.
(a)	By taking the layoff or by displacing the most junior employee within his departmental shift, provided he is capable of performing the required work efficiently, or,
(b)	If the employee is not able to exercise his seniority as stated above he shall;
(i)	Displace the most junior employee in another department on the same shift in a group level (4) job for which he has previously qualified, or a group level (3) job for which he has previously qualified, or a group level (2) job for which he has previously qualified, or;
(ii)	Displace the most junior employee in a group level I job, provided he is capable of performing the required work efficiently.
Once the layoff expires, the employee affected by the layoff must return to his prior job classification.
10.07	EXTENDED LAYOFFS AND BUMPING
(a)	The Company will give the Union one (1) week notice in writing of its intent to lay off if the layoff is to exceed five (5) consecutive working days. The Company will provide the initial employee being laid off the same one (1) week notice of the layoff in his classification. This does not apply to an employee who is subsequently laid off as a result of having been bumped by a more senior employee.
(b)	Foremost, those employees with seniority who remain must be capable of performing the required work efficiently.
(c)	Employees with seniority shall not be required to leave the plant through the layoff procedure while employees without seniority remain in the plant except where such employee holds a skilled trades job classification.
(d)	(i) When a layoff occurs, an employee shall exercise his bumping rights as he previously set
21
out. The employee shall have the right to choose the order he will bump into jobs which he previously qualified in through job postings, previous bumps, temporary transfers (umbrella jobs) and recalls. If an employee gains any job to which he is entitled to bump the employee has the right to rearrange his list, otherwise any new job will become the first possible bump.
(ii) If such employee, because of his seniority, cannot exercise his bumping rights as set out in (i) above, and where such employee is not the most junior employee in the plant, he shall bump the most junior employee working in a group level four (4) classification first. If there are no junior employees to be displaced in a group level four (4) job classification then the employee will bump the most junior employee in a group level three (3) classification. This bumping process will continue in sequential order until the employee has displaced a junior employee. An employee exercising this bumping right will not be permitted to select a bumping preference based on group level or job classification. The sequential bumping order will be strictly adhered to. An employee exercising this right must be able to show that he will be able to do the job within the qualifying time or be disqualified. An employee if he desires may voluntarily take the layoff by advising the Company in writing within one day of notice of layoff and will be placed on general recall status.
Qualifying for positions
To become qualified for a position an employee must satisfactorily complete the qualifying time as set out in job postings or a qualifying time mutually agreed between the Union and the Company. Should an employee be displaced from a job by reason of layoff, bumping or recall, before completion of the qualifying time, the employee will be considered qualified. An employee voluntarily posting off a job before completing the qualifying time will not be considered qualified.
(e)	The right to bump shall be confined to those employees who have completed their probationary period.
(f)	The onus is on an employee to be aware of his bumping rights and it is agreed that the Company will not be liable to an employee or his Union for an employee failing to exercise his proper bumping rights. However, when requested, the Company will assist an employee in determining his bumping right.
(g)	In the case of a reduction, an employee affected by a layoff may elect to take the layoff if he is in a skilled trades classification or in the case where an employee has a bona fide medical reason and is unable to perform work which is available and such reason is acceptable to the Company.
22
10.08	RECALL PROCEDURE
Recall from a layoff or displacement shall be based on the following:
(a)	For a group 5 or higher job, it is understood that, a vacancy shall be filled first by the most senior displaced or laid off employee who is qualified to do the job. Once the total of laid off positions have been recalled in a job classification, any further vacancies shall be posted.
(b)	For a group 4 or lower job, it is understood that, a vacancy shall be filled first by either the senior displaced employee from that job classification or the most senior employee on layoff from the plant, whoever is most senior. Once the total of laid off positions have been recalled in a job classification, any further vacancies shall be posted.
(c)	A Skilled Trades employee shall remain on layoff and will be recalled only to his skilled trades job classification when it becomes available or will be placed on general recall status if advised in writing at the time of lay off.
(d)	An employee exercising this right must be able to show that he will be able to do the job within the qualifying time or be disqualified.

13.07	OVERTIME AND RESCHEDULED SHIFTS
Overtime rate will not be paid for make-up or re-scheduling of shifts to suit the convenience of an employee or group of employees.
13.08	OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION
Overtime work in excess of the shift schedule in effect at any one time is intended to be on a voluntary basis provided adequate response is received. Overtime will be allocated on an equal opportunity basis and will be distributed as evenly as possible to those employees in the job classification for which overtime work is required, who are willing to work overtime, and who are qualified for the work required. Overtime will be offered to employees outside of the job classification within the department only after all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response within the job classification have been exhausted. After all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response from both inside and outside the department have been exhausted, the Company reserves the right to schedule the most junior qualified employee in the classification to do the overtime.
It is understood that the distribution of overtime does not assume that each employee sharing overtime will at any given time have received the same number of overtime credits, but merely expresses a fundamental practice to keep such overtime as nearly in balance from time to time as is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
When the Company deems it necessary to have work performed on overtime the following procedure will be used:
(a)	Overtime opportunities will be first offered to employees in the job classification who
normally perform the work, commencing with the employee who has on record the least amount of overtime credits. An employee shall be recorded on the overtime list within his job classification as having worked the overtime when he has worked the overtime; when he is absent from work on his shift when overtime would have been offered to him; when he has been offered voluntary overtime and declines; when he is absent and, as a result of his absence, overtime is required, except when he is on vacation including the weekend (or
34
designated weekend) continuous to the vacation, unless availability is made known beforehand; and when the Company is unable to contact the employee after reasonable attempts to do so.
(b)	After all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response by employees from within the job classification are exhausted, overtime opportunities will be offered to employees outside the job classification, within the department. Overtime worked by an employee outside his job classification shall be recorded with the overtime credits on the overtime list as having worked within his job classification. If such an employee declines an overtime opportunity outside his job classification, no overtime credits will be recorded.
(c)	If the balance of overtime hours among employees who normally share overtime work is not properly maintained because of an improper allocation and a grievance is filed, and as a result, an employee is found not to have had his fair share of overtime, the off-balance condition shall be identified and preference given to the aggrieved employee over the other employees involved as soon as is reasonably possible until a fair balance in the overtime distribution is re-established.
(d)	The Company agrees to post overtime lists showing overtime credits of employees. These lists will be revised each week and total credits shall be carried forward from week to week during the calendar year. Each department within the plant will be consistent in the manner for which overtime credits are recorded.
(e)	Overtime credits will be recorded on the overtime list as follows: For example, eight (8) hours worked at time and one half will be recorded as twelve (12) credits and eight (8) hours worked at double time will be recorded as sixteen (16) credits.
(f)	An employee who is transferred from one job classification to another job classification through a job posting, bumping or recall , will, upon transfer, be credited with the average of the overtime credits in the job classification within the departmental shift to which he is transferred, except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(g)	An employee who is absent from work for one week or more, except when he is on vacation, will upon return to work, be credited with the average of the overtime credits in the job classification within the departmental shift to which he returns except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(h)	An employee on temporary transfer under Article 10.16 (b) shall be considered in his regular job classification for the purpose of overtime distribution.
35
(I) When overtime credits are equal for all employees in a job classification the most senior employee will be asked first. This procedure will continue until all employees in the job classification have established overtime credits, at which time Article 13.07 (a) will prevail.
(j)	Probationary or Student employees will be asked for overtime only after all employees in the job classification with seniority have been asked.
(k)	The difference in overtime credits should not exceed forty (40) hours.
(l)	If an employee is asked to change shifts, he shall be paid overtime if not off work for 24 hours before reporting for work on his new shift. This is not in effect if caused by a layoff as stated in Article 10.07.
13.09	OVERTIME BREAKS
An employee who has worked an eight (8) hour shift and is required to work overtime shall be allowed a ten (10) minute break before the start of his overtime work. If he is scheduled to work two hours or more of overtime, he shall be allowed a twenty (20) minute break prior to beginning his overtime work.
Subsequent breaks will follow the pattern of the department in which he is working.
13.10	OVERTIME LUNCH ALLOWANCE
An employee who is required to work three and one half hours to eight hours of overtime as an extension of his shift will be paid a lunch allowance of six dollars ($6.00). If an employee is required to work a further three and one half hours, he will be entitled to an additional six dollars ($6.00) lunch allowance. The employee's foreman or another member of supervision will make arrangements for the payment to the employee.
13.11	CALL IN
(a)	If an emergency arises whereby an employee is recalled without prior notice to come to
work after his scheduled shift, he will be paid a minimum of four (4) hours pay at his regular rate or for the actual time worked prior to the commencement of his next shift, at the applicable overtime rate, whichever is greater. At the time the employee is called, he will be advised of the nature of the problem and/or the approximate amount of time he will be required to work. The employee will only be required to perform the work for which he was called except when it is apparent and he is so advised, before he leaves the plant, that additional emergency work is required.
36
(b)	An employee, while on emergency call-in, will receive a six dollar ($6.00) lunch allowance for each consecutive four (4) hours worked until the commencement of his next scheduled shift. An employee while on emergency call-in, who works less than four (4) hours however is required to work past one (1) hour immediately prior to the commencement of his next scheduled shift will receive a six dollar ($6.00) lunch allowance.
(c)	If an employee is called in after midnight, the call in pay will be six (6) hours pay at his regular rate or for the actual time worked prior to the commencement of his next shift, at the applicable overtime rate, whichever is greater.
13.12	REPORTING IN
Any employee who comes to work for which he was scheduled without having been advised in advance that his services were not required shall receive four (4) hours pay at his regular rate for his scheduled eight (8) hour shift or six (6) hours pay at his regular rate for his scheduled twelve (12) hour shift, whichever the case may be, provided he does any job available that the Company may request. This, however, does not apply in the case where lack of available work is due to causes beyond the control of the Company, as, for example, machinery breakdown, fire, flood, power failure or other like causes, or if the failure to receive notice was caused by the employee's absence on the previous day.

14.03	QUALIFYING FOR HOLIDAY PAY
In order to be entitled to payment for a plant holiday, an employee must have worked his scheduled full working day immediately preceding the holiday and his scheduled full working day immediately following the holiday unless a reason acceptable to the Company is given. The use of a sick day, as per Article 11.05, before or after a plant holiday is a reasonable excuse.
14.04	WORK ON A HOLIDAY
If an employee is required to work on one of the above-mentioned plant holidays, he shall receive payment at the rate of time and one-half his regular hourly rate for the hours actually worked by him in addition to receiving his holiday pay.

Once every employee has been given this opportunity the employees with more than two (2) weeks of vacation entitlement, by order of seniority, will be permitted to schedule the remaining weeks of vacation, with consideration to operational requirements.
An adjustment period, following the second Friday in April and lasting until the end of the month of April, will be used to resolve any conflicting vacation requests and to finalize the vacation schedule. Additional vacation requests will not be permitted during this adjustment period. Any requests after this adjustment period will be on a first come first serve basis with consideration to operational requirements.
A joint Company and Union committee will meet at least 30 days prior to the second Friday in April to review operational requirements as they relate to vacation scheduling and to discuss and make recommendations on any issue that may facilitate the vacation scheduling process.
For employees with a third, fourth or fifth week of vacation, these weeks may be taken at a time mutually satisfactory to the Company and the employee. Employees with a third, fourth and fifth week of vacation, may be permitted to take any portion of their third, fourth or fifth weeks in periods of not less than one half day durations provided the vacation time is at a time mutually satisfactory to the Company and the Employee.
If a plant shutdown is scheduled employees will take their vacation during the plant shutdown. A notice of such a shutdown will be posted before the second Friday in April. Exceptions will be made in the case of employees required for maintenance and those requested to work in other areas on a voluntary basis. In these cases, preference will be given to employees with the greatest seniority in scheduling vacations outside the shutdown period, provided the employee advised his intent at least one month before the requested vacation date.
15.05	VACATION/WORK OPTION
For employees having more than two weeks of vacation entitlement, the Company agrees to allow
40
employees to work a third, fourth and/or fifth week of vacation at their regular rates of pay, including overtime and premiums.
