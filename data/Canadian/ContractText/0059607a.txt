ARTICLE 13 SENIORITY
13.01	An employee will be considered probationary for the first ninety (90) working days during an eighteen (18) month period and will have no seniority rights during that period. Her employment may be terminated at any time during such probationary period at the discretion of Management and such termination shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure. After completion of probation, her seniority shall date back to date of hire upon completion of her probationary period.
Employees with the same date of hire will be placed first on the seniority list in the order of them achieving their 90 days. Employees reaching their 90 days with the same date of hire will then be placed in alphabetical order.
13.02	There shall be separate seniority lists for full-time and part-time employees.
A revised copy of the seniority lists shall be posted on the appropriate bulletin board and copies sent to the Union office in January and July of each year. The lists shall indicate part-time and full-time employees at the time of preparation in descending order of seniority. If the accuracy of the lists is not challenged within thirty (30) calendar days of posting, the lists shall be deemed to be correct.
13.03	Full-time seniority shall accumulate only while the employee holds a full-time posted position.
In the event that an employee transfers from the full-time to the part-time seniority list, without interruption as in Article 13.06, a record will be kept in her personnel file of her full-time seniority at the time of transfer. Should she subsequently return to a full-time position, she will be credited with the full-time seniority which was previously accumulated.
It is understoodthat full-time employees who elect part-timework as per Article 14.06 shall accumulate full-time seniority for a period up to their preexisting full-time seniority or twelve (12) months, whichever is less. Thereafter, part-time seniority is accumulated.
Part-time employees who are the successful candidates for a full-time temporary position will revert back to part-time status once the assignment is completed.
a
13.0<t	Part-time seniority shall accumulate only while the employee holds a part-time position.
In the event that an employee transfers from the part-time seniority list to the full-time seniority list, without interruption as in Article 13.06, a record will be kept in her personnel file of her part-time seniority at the time of transfer. Should she subsequently return to a part-time position, she will be credited with the part-time seniority which was previously accumulated.
13.05	An employee shall accumulate seniority under any of the following conditions:
a)	While she is at work for the Company, after she has completed her probationary period as set out in Section 13,01.
b)	During any period when she is prevented from performing her work for the Company by reason of illness or injury for period of time equal to her preexisting seniority to a maximum of twenty-four (24) months.
An employee's reinstatement after sick leave of three (3) days or more will be conditional on her supplying a certificate from a physician that she is fully recovered from the sickness which caused her absence. A certificate may also by required in cases of suspected abuse or when the Company feels food safety may be at risk.
c)	During any absence due to layoff or written leave of absence for a period of time equal to her preexisting seniority to a maximum of twelve (12) months.
13.06	Seniority and employment shall terminate when an employee:
a)	Voluntarily resigns;
b)	Is discharged and is not reinstated through the Grievance Procedure or Arbitration;
c)	Has been absent due to written leave of absence for a time longer than her preexisting seniority to a maximum of twelve (12) months.

d)	Fails to report for work within seven (7) calendar days after being notified by the Company, following a layoff, or fails to inform the Company within two (2) working days of recall that she will report for work;
e)	Fails to return to work promptly upon termination of an authorized leave of absence, or utilizes a leave of absence for purposes other than those for which the leave of absence was granted;
f)	Has been absent from work more than two (2) consecutive working days without notifying the Company (except for circumstances beyond the employee's control) and providing a reasonable explanation of her absence;
g)	In the case of a part-time employee, the employee misses, refuses or cannot be contacted to work a "scheduled" shift assignment without providing a reasonable explanation on three (3) occasions within a three (3) month period.
Where a part-time employee elects not to accept a special "call-in" shift assignment, this does not constitute a refusal
For the purpose of this 13,06 (g) a "scheduled" shift shall mean a shift which is scheduled the day before the employee is required to work.
13.07	An employee terminated according to Article 13.06 (c) because of illness or accident may make an application for re-employment. Provided she is able to resume her former job, the Company shall give her every consideration for re-employment and the parties shall discuss her seniority standing.
13.08	Where an employee has attained the age of sixty-five (65) years, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to lay her off, or to retire her, without regard to the seniority provisions of this Agreement. Each case will be dealt with on its own merits.
13.09	In the event that an employee covered by this Agreement should be promoted to a supervisory or confidential position beyond the scope of this Agreement, she shall retain the seniority previously acquired and shall have added thereto the seniority accumulated during the first year of service in such supervisory or confidential capacity.
Should the employee return to the bargaining unit within six (^months of her promotion she shall return to the position she previously held which would result in bumping of all positions involved. If at the Company's discretion the employee returns to the bargaining unit after an absence of longer than six (6) months she shall return to a full-time position provided that this does not result in the downgrading of any other full-time employees.

ARTICLE 14 LAYOFF AND RECALL
Further to Article 16.10, where an individual’s own job is not available for five (5) days or less, the Company will assign the individual other work if such work is available. Further in determining such assignments, it is the Company’s practice to attempt to assign the more senior employees the higher rated of the work which is available where this is practical. The application of the above practice is subject always to the following conditions:
i)	Employees must be fully qualified and capable of performing any work to which they are assigned.
ii)	Such reassignments must not result in the displacement of employees in posted jobs. For the purpose of this article, a Line Associate is not considered a posted job.
Layoffs which are anticipated to be six (6) or more working days shall be allowed to bump postedj obs based on the following factors:
i) full-time seniority in the case of a layoff involving full-time employees, or part-time seniority in the case of a lay-off involving part-time employees;
ii)	skill and ability required for the job.
It is understood that where the qualifications referred to in factor (ii) above are relatively equal, factor (I) will govern.
14.02	The foregoing layoff formula shall be applied by groups in the following sequences provided the remaining work force has the skill and ability required to perform the available work:
In the Case of Full-time Employees
i)	Probationary employees (new hire)
ii)	Seniority employees
In the Case of Part-time Employees
i)	Students
ii)	Probationary employees (new hire)
iii)	Seniority employees
14.03	When increasing the workforce after a layoff employees will be recalled in order of seniority provided that the resulting work force has the required skill and ability to perform the available work.
14.04	A full-time employee shall acquire the right to bump employees with less plant seniority from other jobs only when her regular job is permanently eliminated. In such event the bumping procedure shall be as follows:
i)	The Company will endeavor to place the employee in a position at a rate of pay equal to that of her previous position.
ii)	Where it proves impossible to find a replacement position in 14.04(i) the full-time employee shall be allowed to displace the most junior employee from any job in any classification which is at a level equal to or lower than that of the eliminated position provided that in the opinion of the Company she has the required skill and ability to do the job.
Displacement into a higher classification shall be allowed in accordance with the terms of this article but only in circumstances where senior employees would otherwise be laid off outside of seniority.
14.05	In the evaluation of skill and ability as referred to in Articles 14.01, 14.02, 14.03, 14.04, and 14.09, the Company shall be the judge, provided however, that if an employee believes that a proper consideration of her skill and ability (which shall include reliability, experience and where relevant, physical fitness) has not been given, she may file a grievance under the procedures of Article 10 claiming that the Company acted in an arbitrary, unfair or unfairly discriminatory manner.
In the event of a layoff affecting full-time employees, the employees so affected shall have the option of:
i)	accepting transfer to part-time status; or
ii)	being placed on layoff status
In either case, such employees will be subject to recall to full-time employment as per Article 14.03.
Employees who elect a transfer to part-time status as per Article 14.06 (a) (i) will be employed on a day to day basis prior to any remaining part-time employees to perform such scheduled or call-in work as arises prior to their recall to full-time work.
Such work will be allocated to these transferred employees on a rotational basis.
After one (1) year employees will revert back to part-time status and will lose their full-time recall rights.
14.07	The Company shall notify an employee of her recall to work by telephoning the last number on record with the Company. Where the Company is unable to contact the employee by telephone, recall notice will be sent by registered mail to the last address on record with the Company. The employee is solely responsible for their proper address and telephone number being on record with the
14.06	(a)
(b)
(c)
14.01 a)
b)
10
Company.
The notification shall state the job to which the employee is to be recalled and the date and time at which the employee shall report to work.
It is the sole responsibility of the employee to notify the Company of her intention to return to work within two (2) working days of receiving her notice of recall and return to work within seven (7) calendar days after receiving recall notice.
14.08	The Company will advise the Union as early as possible of any layoff which is expected to continue for more than five (5) working days.
14.09	For the purpose of layoff and recall of more than five (5) days, the Stewards and Chief Steward shall have preferential seniority provided they have skill and ability required to perform the available work.
14.10	The Company shall give notice of termination accordingto the EmploymentStandardsAct.
ARTICLE 15 SHIFT ASSIGNMENT
Full-time employees will be permitted to transfer to a preferred shift if entitled by seniority and provided the resulting work force has the skill and ability required to perform the work on each respective shift.
There shall be three (3) shift election opportunities each year. In advance of the specified election dates the Company will canvass full-time employees to determine if any wish to transfer from one shift to another.
A full-time employee who posts on to a new job may, once having passed the trial period, have at that time an opportunity to bump a more junior full-time employee in the same job on a preferred shift provided the resulting work force has the skill and ability required to perform the work on each respective shift. If this opportunity is not taken she must wait for the next shift election opportunity.
Where it becomes necessary to reschedule full-time employees working shifts the Company will attempt to meet its requirements by canvassing employees on a voluntary basis. Where this proves impossible the Company will reschedule employees in the reverse order of their seniority provided that the resulting work force has the skill and ability required to perform the work on each respective shift.
Where it has been necessary, under 15.01 (a) or 15,01 (b) to schedule a senior employee to a shift which is against her preference, that employee shall have the option of transferring to her preferred shift by replacing a morejunior employee when the junior employee has become fully qualified on the job.
The parties agree that clauses 15.01 (a) and 15.01 (b) shall not apply in the case of maintenance staff, quality control and sanitation personnel. It is further agreed that the Company will maintain its present practices with respect to shift assignment and reschedulingfor these employees.
15.02	Work will be allocated to the part-time work force on a full rotational basis. The order of employees on the scheduling rotation list, shall be the same as that on the part-time seniority list. Management reserves the right to use part-time employees out of seniority where they have the physical requirements necessary to perform the available work.
When increasing the part-time work force with new employees, in the interest of proper training Management reserves the right to place those employees on to the part-time rotation list out of seniority in a staggered manner for work scheduling only for a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days per employee.
It is further agreed that back up EPSU work will be assigned to part-time employees according to the parties' Letter of Understanding.
15.03	Part-time employees will be responsible for checking the posted work schedule for subsequent days prior to leaving the Plant after completion of their shift. Where such posted schedule(s) indicates that the employee is scheduled to work on a subsequent day (s) they will be deemed to have been notified of a regularshift assignment.
If a part time employee will not be working prior to her next shift assignment she will contact the factory office by 1:30 p,m. to determine if she is scheduled to work the subsequent day. If the factory office has not been contacted, the employee will be contacted at the last telephone numberwhich the employee has provided.

A new job or vacancy shall not be advertised outside the Company for the first two (2) days following its posting inside.
a)	All applications received will be considered within seven (7) days of the end of the posting procedure. The Company shall fill the posting only after considering the seniority, skill and ability of the applicants. Where the skill and ability of two (2) or more applicants are relatively equal, seniority shall govern. Skill and ability shall include reliability, experience and where relevant, physical fitness.
b) In considering applicants for a full-time job, preference shall go to full-time applicants first before part-time applicants are considered. All applicants will be considered for part-time positions.

Except as provided above employees will be paid the rate applicable to the work they perform.
Back-up positions exist to provide trained employees in case incumbents in key jobs are absent, and for temporary excess workloads. A back-up position is not a job posting. It is a temporary transfer as per Article 16.01 and 16.10 of the Collective Agreement. As such, by being given a back-up position an employee does not give up their regular posting. Employees designated to a back-up position have rights to weekend overtime after posted incumbents if the designated back-up employee worked the previous shift on the back-up job.
Management reserves the right to restrict an employee from being selected and trained to be a designated back-up. Such a right would be exercised when it is foreseen that the employee may not be available for the back-up assignment on a dependable basis. Management will consider the most qualified employee first when selecting from a volunteer list. However, where qualifications are relatively equal the most senior employee will be selected.

13
Management on an ongoing basis. In the course of her assignment as a Team Leader she may also be required to perform work regularly done by the employees she leads.
A Team Leader shall not assume any of the employee relations supervisory responsibilities that properly belong to forepersons or other management staff such as reprimanding or disciplining employees. This does not preclude a Team Leader from advising an employee that she is violating a work rule.

a)	Shift Scheduling for Stationary Engineers
This article is to vary certain terms of the current Collective Agreement between Nestle Canada Inc., Trenton Foodservice Plant, hereinafter called the “Company” and Service Employees Union, Local183, hereinaftercalled the “Union”. With the exception of specific variations set forth in this Article all other conditions and terms of the Collective Agreement shall remain in force and effect.
b)	Purpose
The purpose of this agreement is to enable the Company to operate the power and refrigeration plants on a twelve (12) hour shift schedule and to provide some assurance to crew members of their scheduled days off. This schedule may be discontinued in any area by the Company when: a) there are adverse effects on the service of the plants to the factory, b) inability to provide a workable staffing schedule, or c) where the Company wishes to do so for other reasons which are neither unreasonable or arbitrary.
15
Ic)	Schedule and Rotation
Such a schedule shall normally consist of six different positions, with each employee occupying one position for a period of four weeks. Four Operator positions will be scheduled as twelve (12) hour shifts and two Maintenance positions as eight (8) hour shifts. Each employee will rotate equally through all positions on the shift schedule.

A regular forty (40) hour work week will be paid at the applicable rate of pay for a fully completed week as per the schedule. Any scheduled hours missed which do not qualify for pay as per the Collective Agreement will be deducted from the forty hours each week.
All hours worked over twelve (12) on the Operator's twelve (12) hour shift will be compensated at time plus one half the regular hourly rate and paid each week.
All hours worked over eight (8) on the Maintenance eight (8) hour shift will be compensated at time plus one half and paid each week.

The Company reserves the right to alter an employee's normally scheduled assignment at any time to accommodate the relief of absent employees. The employee whose schedule is so altered will be paid according to the conditions laid out for the shift they have been transferred to.
At such times when such a shift transfer causes the employee to work less than the planned eighty (80) hours per two week schedule the employee shall be given the option to make up the difference in hours during the same two week schedule. Such time will be paid at straight time rate, and will be scheduled at mutual convenience of the employee and the supervisor.
f)	Scheduled Holidays
This agreement is not intended to provide any additional pay, or paid time away from work. Therefore, with reference to Article
19.02	(c) of the Collective Agreement holiday pay will be given to the two Operating Engineers at time plus one-half for actual hours worked plus either eight (8) hours holiday pay or one eight (8) hour day in lieu of holiday pay.

Both the applicable second shift premium and third shift premium ($.40/hr. and $.60/hr. respectively and subsequent increases as per Article 15.05) will be paid to the employee who works the midnight twelve hour shift. Whereas the Company would normally pay eight hours second shift premium to one employee and eight hours third shift premium to another, an equal amount of money will be paid to one employee.
For example:
8 hr. x$.40 = $3.20 8 hr. x$.60 = $4.80
$8.00 Paid to midnight 12 hr. shift employee per shift.
The Company reserves the right to alter this system without financial disadvantage to either party if it proves unmanageable.

RE: WORKFORCE COMPOSITION
The parties recognize that it is in their common interest to ensure that the Company is guaranteed the work force necessary to meet its operational requirements. It is further agreed that this is best achieved by maintaining the following practices:
1.	Protecting the employment security of full-time employees to the extent possible given demand for the Company's products; and
1
2.	Maintaining an adequate supplementary work force of part-time workers to meet fluctuating labor needs which vary daily according to the variety and output of product which is required.
In keeping with the above it is agreed that the provisions of the collective agreement which provide for the separate lay off of part-time and full-time employees are not intended to result in an increase of part-time employees at the expense of full-time positions.
Accordingly the Company will endeavor to maintain, to the extent possible and practical, the approximate current proportion of “production employees” which is made up of full-time employees versus part-time employees.
For the purpose of this letter “production employees” shall mean employees both full-time and part-time who are directly involved in manufacturing as opposed to service categories such as skilled maintenance, sanitation personnel, or truck drivers.
The parties agree that this letter will take effect on December 3rd, 1983 and that it will expire on October 31, 1998.

LETTER OF INTENT
RE: MAINTENANCE STANDBY
As agreed, the following practice will be maintained in the case of maintenance personnel when they are assigned weekend "standby" and scheduled overtime:
19.	On the sixth scheduled day of work, the employee will be paid the greater of six (6) times his regular straight time hourly rate or overtime at the applicable rate for the hours actually worked.
22
20.	On the seventh scheduled day of work, the employee will be paid the greater of eight (8) times his regular straight time hourly rate or overtime at the applicable rate for the hours actually worked.
For the purpose of clarity, I would emphasize that this arrangement recognizes the "standby" obligation of these personnel as well as their scheduled overtime duties. In view of this additional responsibility, Article 17.11 is not directly applicable. Should they be relieved of the standby obligation, then Article 17.12 would become applicable.

RE: BACK UP SANITATION - EPSU
Furtherto the parties Collective Agreement dated November"!, 1991 and revised November25, 1998, the parties recognize that it is necessary to have relief and supplementary EPSU workers available to meet changing operating requirements. It is further recognized that due to the specialized training required to do Sanitation work, it is safer and more effective to meet this need with a constant group of “Back up” EPSU workers.
Accordingly, it is agreed that the Company will, as the need arises, post “Back up Sanitation” jobs. These jobs will be open to full-time and part-time applicants.
In the event part-time employees are successful applicants to these jobs, it is understood that they will be assigned the work as it becomes available versus only being assigned work according to the standard part-time rotation.
In addition the experience that a part-timer gains as a result of such a “Back up Sanitation” posting shall be applied for selection purposes in Article 16.04.

RE: WORK BREAKS

As such, it is the Company's intent to attempt to schedule an employee's first break no sooner than two (2) hours after her start time and no later than four (4) hours after her start time. Furthermore, it is the Company's intent to attempt to schedule the second break in an equitable fashion after the first break, but no later than two (2) hours before the finish time.
The application of the above practice is during a normal shift and may be altered in the event of unforeseen circumstances.
