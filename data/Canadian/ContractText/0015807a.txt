To the Union,
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations,the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interestsand concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personalnature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices basedon their own uniquecircumslances,
3)	In the granting of compassionale and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, wi be considered.
In the granting of compassionale and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
II an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have inputto administerthe leave provisions,
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than fcr compassionale and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understoodlhat bankedovertime pay may be paid out in these instancesal the employee's request).
b)	Employeewould only be required lo take an unbooked "regular"vacation day after July 1st (vacationdays lakenin this regard would not be considered a split),
c)	Employeewould take a "special1 Vacation day at his request only (vacationdays taken in this regard would not be considereda split).
6)	In the determination of grantingof personal leave requests, individualcircumstances should be laken into account (e.g. commuting)and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
It was the general consensus of the group that addressedthis issue that personal leave requests need lo be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
