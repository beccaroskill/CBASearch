An employee from either Plant at the Smelter may similarly use a Plant Committeeman from the other Plant at the Smelter.
An employee from the Matte Processing Plant may similarly use a Plant Committeeman from the Copper Cliff Mill (including Sample House) and vice versa.

Attention: Mr. D.R. Campbell, President, Local 6500 Dear Sir:
We wish to confirm our discussions and understanding with respect to the existing trades classifications listed in Section 20.01 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The need for improved productivity and competitiveness has resulted in changes in operating requirements. The increased manpower flexibility that was required to meet this need is a continuing one and, as a result, it may be necessary to create new trades classifications.
Therefore, the parties agree to establish a special Trades Committee consisting of three (3) people appointed by the Com- . pany, two of whom will be the Assistant Vice-President of Administration and the Manager of Maintenance, and three (3) persons appointed by the Union. The committee will meet at least once every three (3) months, and at such other times as may be agreed upon, for the purpose of exchanging and discussing information pertaining to existing and new trades and considering specific problems relating to the trades.
The Company shall pay employee members of the Committee at their applicable hourly rate plus any applicable Cost
of Living Allowance for any time lost during their regular working hours while attending Committee meetings.
166
The parties agree that existing tradesmen who wish to remain in their present trade classifications may do so, and they will neither be required to take any additional training in connection with any new trade classification nor be required to work in any new trade classification, unless they so elect.
In cases where there is an increase in the job class of a trade classification because of a change in job content, existing tradesmen in that trade classification will not be demoted if they cannot successfully complete any additional required training.

12 quarterly adjustments, beginning by comparing the July 1988 CPI over the April 1988, using the CPI (1961= 100) index. 1t for each 0.35 point increase. Folded annually except for third year. COLA advance of 254 per hour, paid June 1 of second and third contract years, to be recovered by offsetting deductions from subsquent COLA calculations. (Previous formula similar except no advances and no scheduled fold-ins. Generated S 1.45 per hourfrom which U was diverted to the union education fund and 14 was diverted to the Steelworkers’ Humanity Fund.)
For any calendar quarter In which the company has net earnings and INCO‘s average realized price for nickel, is $2.25 (U.S.) a pound, each employee will receive a lump-sum payment equal to 10t per hour worked that quarter. \n additional 1 t per hour worked will be paid for each 1 4 that the Average Realized Price exceeds $2.25.
The formula will be applied retroactively to cover the last 4 quarters of the previous contract by paying the difference between the amount generated by the more modest formula of that agreement and the amount that would have been paid had the new formula been in place. The average worker will receive $2 080 • mostly derived from the differential for the last quarter of the previous agreement.
Unlike the previous formula, which had a cap of 354, the new formula has no set limits. In the current SS dollar price range for nickel, the payout is equivalent to $2.85 per hour worked.
