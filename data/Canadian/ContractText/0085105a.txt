Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee in the classifications of Stationary Engineer 2nd Class or 1st Class Tradesman who is demoted due to lack of work, will be given the option of being terminated by the Company due to lack of work.
(c)	The amount of an employee's severance pay, subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article, shall be:	^	$

For severance pay purposes a week's pay shall be equal to the employee's current straight time hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours, not to exceed forty (40), constituting his normal number of weekly hours of work at the said Site at any time of termination, and shall not include overtime or any other premium pay or allowance.
(d)	The Company may elect to pay severance pay in weekly installments or in a lump sum.
(e)	In the event that an individual receiving severance pay is re-employed by the Company, payments thereof shall cease with the payment for the period ending the day immediately preceding the date of his re-employment.
(f)	An individual who has received severance pay shall not be required to return any portion of such pay to the Company in the event he is reemployed.
