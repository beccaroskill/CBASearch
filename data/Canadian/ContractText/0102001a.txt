Usually, before starting extensive dental work, your dentist will tell you what he intends to do and the charge. If the cost of a course of treatment planned by the dentist for a covered family member is expected to exceed $200, the proposed course of treatment must be filed with, and approved by, the Insurance Company prior to the commencement of treatment. The necessary forms are available from your Employer. After reviewing the proposed course of treatment, the Insurance Company will notify both you and your dentist of the estimated payment under the Plan.
Because of the difficulty of determining the necessity for the types of services involved after treatment has been received, failure to file and obtain approval may result in benefits of a lesser amount than would otherwise have been payable.
Occasionally a patient may select a more expensive procedure rather than a suitable alternate procedure. In such cases, reimbursement will be based on the least expensive procedure which, as determined by the Insurance Company, will produce a professionally adequate result.
