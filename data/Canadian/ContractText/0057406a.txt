LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1 RE : SUBSTANCE ABUSE
The Company and the Union jointly recognize substance abuse to be a serious medical and social problem that can affect employees. It is in the best interest of the employee, the Union and the Company to encourage early treatment and to assist employees towards full rehabilitation.
The Company realizes the importance of a co-operative effort between its management and the Union in this regard. It is appropriate for the CAW and the Company to review and discuss such problems, with a view to providing assistance to addicted employees, consistent with their attitudes toward the problem.
Such assistance includes, but is not necessarily limited to, identification of the problem at the earliest stages, motivating the individual to obtain help, referral of the individual to appropriate treatment and rehabilitation facilities, and a continuing education of management and union representatives alike to recognize and deal constructively with such problems as they arise.
Any employee who undergoes a prescribed rehabilitative process will be entitled to Sickness and Accident benefits in accordance with the Sickness and Accident plan.
Substance Abuse Representative
The Company and the Union acknowledge the contribution that the local CAW
Substance Abuse Representative can make towards workplace education and substance abuse, counselling and referral in individual substance abuse cases.
To ensure that this level of contribution continues, it is agreed that the Substance Abuse Representative will be allowed reasonable time off at those times when an employee comes forth with a substance abuse problem to assist the employee with counselling, referrals and follow-up. The Substance Abuse Representative will not leave his duties without obtaining permission from his Team Leader. Such permission shall not be unreasonably denied.
44
In addition, it is recognized that the Substance Abuse Representative will be able to deal more effectively with matters related to substance abuse if they are provided with appropriate training. Therefore, the Company will allow reasonable time off to the Substance Abuse Representative to attend courses which form part of the Addiction Intervention Association’s Alcoholism and Drug Counsellor certification program, and will assume instructional fee costs and reasonable accommodation and meal costs associated with the taking of such courses.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #15
RE : BUSINESS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
The continued success of Nestle Canada depends upon our ability to improve and grow the business. The need to drive costs down in order to compete aggressively is in keeping with the investments that have recently been made. Full utilization of the Sterling Road factory can be achieved by adjusting existing work schedules and can generate additional employment. To achieve this growth, the Company and the Union understand that there is an urgent and immediate need to look at how the factory operates, specifically, the new opportunities for the business and increased jobs that a new work schedule could provide.
A joint Union/Management Committee with two members from the Union and two members from Management will be established to explore alternate shift schedules that will meet both the needs of the workers and the needs of the business. Consideration must be given to cost control and sufficient distribution of skilled and experienced workers on all shifts.
The Committee will endeavour to come to a mutual agreement on the new schedule before October 31,1996. Any implementation of an alternate shift will be by mutual agreement.
Director of Operations
