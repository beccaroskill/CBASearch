3.	The parties hereto agree that the grievances concerning production of Coke II and Mr. J. Walker shall be withdrawn. In addition, the Collective Agreement will be deemed to be amended to include the following provisions:
A. Subject to the availability of an approved bottle design/construction, the Company is planning to introduce a 500ml. plastic, non-refillable bottle for Coca-Cola Classic about June 1993.
The C.A.W. agrees that henceforth changes in distribution of overall production requirements among various Company-owned locations does not constitute "contracting out" under our Collective Agreement, and the Company commits that:
■ It will modify production facilities at Thomcliffe Plant as necessary to produce this package at such location and shall, in fact, produce this package there and continue to do so as long as this may be done in a manner consistent with attainment of its efficiency and cost objectives.
LOA-3-31-93
-4-
■ The Company and the Union recognize that introduction of the 500ml. package production at Thomcliffe and the resultant change of line configuration may result in the displacement of some 2L production to another location. However, it is fully expected that this realignment of production will result in a net increase in required hours of labour at Thomcliffe Plant.
B.(i) The Company will accept written applications from Inside Employees who wish to be considered for employment as a Delivery Salesman or a Delivery Salesman-In-Charge during the period from April 15th to September 15th and from November 23rd to December 23rd in a particular year. Such employees must possess the appropriate driving licence and successfully pass a physical assessment by a physician of their choice, paid for by the Company.
(ii)	If, during the period set out above, there is a vacancy in the subject Job Classifications which the Company expects to be available for a period of at least one week (Monday to Friday) and which it would otherwise fill with a Temporary Employee, then the Company will temporarily transfer, in seniority order, the most senior and available employee who has satisfied the requirements of (i) above,
LOA-3-31-93
-5-
4.	The parties agree that there shall be a special one-time reassignment of jobs on the basis of individual preference, by seniority order, in accordance with the detailed procedures established by the joint Company/Union committee assigned that responsibility. Such procedures are set out in Appendix A" hereto.
5.	The parties agree that the hours of work for the various shifts shall be adjusted to the following:
(a)	Night Shift Sundays & Holidays Balance of Week
(b)	Day Shift
(c)	Afternoon Shift
12.01 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. 10:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
6:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
3:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.
This rescheduling of shift hours by the Company does not diminish its existing contractual rights with respect to establishment of working hours or the work week.
6.	Clause 8.09(d) of the Collective Agreement will be deemed to be amended by changing "eighteen (18) months" to read "twenty-four (24) months".
