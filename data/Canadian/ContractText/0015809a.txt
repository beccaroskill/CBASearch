Article 7
SENIORITY
7.01 In all cases of upgrading, downgrading, increase or decrease in forces, the following factors shall be considered:
(a)	Length of continuous service.
(b)	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern. Length of continuous service will be based on Company service rather than department service.
16
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be employed as probationary employees for a period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). Probationary employees shall have recourse to the grievance procedure in all matters and during the probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed to be for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
7.03	Students hired temporarily for the period between semesters will continue to forego seniority rights if their period of employment should extend past the probationary four hundred and eighty (480) hours worked (including overtime hours worked). Students hired for the summer period (April 15 through September 15) will be terminated at the end of the summer period (September 15) and then considered eligible for rehire as a permanent employee. Students hired temporarily will be paid atjob class one (1). However, if a student works overtime, they will be paid time and one-half the normal rate for the job in question.
7.04	(a)	(i) Plant progression lists now in operation may
remain in operation, but shall be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any changes to progression lists will be made in consultation with the Union.
(ii)	When plant progression lists are not in effect, permanent occupational vacancies above the beginner level will be bulletined within the department or filled by a job request system. A
17
job request system may be put into a department if mutually agreed between the Union and Company. A departmentjob request system will require employees to outline in writing requests for job moves. Departments utilizing job request systems will fill vacancies by selecting from amongst those who have submitted written requests for the job in question from within the department. Within twenty-one (21)	calendar days of the
expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the appropriate local Union. With respect to vacancies so filled, the seniority date of the successful applicant shall be noted.
(iii)	However, nothing in this article shall be read or construed as preventing the Company from hiring skilled employees to fill such vacancies where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness. Before hiring an employee into a position above entry level in a department, discussions will take place with the Union President or his designate to review possible alternatives to hiring, such as training.
(iv)	For Mine Department operations, where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness
18
to fill a vacancy, the Company will not hire skilled employees to fill such vacancies with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience if there are current employees that have on file a written request for a job move to the Mine Department in question and who have been deemed acceptable for transfer to the Mine Department in question.
The foregoing shall not apply in circumstances where the Company is opening a new mine or is required to hire fifteen (15) or more Mine employees and the efficiency of operations would be impacted if the Company did not hire skilled employees with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience. The Company shall consult with the Union prior to hiring skilled employees with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience well in advance of hiring any such individuals.
(b)	Preference shall be given to an employee according to his seniority, subject to the requirements and efficiency of operations and the ability and skill of the employee to fill the normal requirements of the job.
(c)	Successful bidding on bulletins under this clause shall be limited to three (3) per calendar year.
19
(d)	In the event the Company is unable to place the successful applicant in a vacancy within twenty-one (21) calendar days of being awarded a bulletin, the employee will be paid the higher of the regular hourly rate of the bulletin job or the rate of the job he is performing until he is placed in the vacancy.
7.05	The Company shall maintain seniority lists for the department. A copy of such list shall be posted every three (3) months. Two (2) copies shall also be provided to the Union.
7.06	Where a Statute of Canada so provides, an employee shall maintain and accumulate seniority during service in the Armed Forces of Canada.
7.07	Before filling vacancies in a department or a plant with new employees, full consideration shall be given to any qualified employees who have requested a transfer to the department in which the vacancy exists.
An employee wishing such transfer shall file a written "Request for Transfer" application form with the Employment Office at Flin Flon or the General Office at Snow Lake. An employee's application shall lapse one (I) year after the date of filing but may be renewed from year to year at his request. However, in no event may an employee have more than three (3) such applications on file at any one time. The Company shall maintain a file of such "Request for Transfer" application forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, the Personnel Superintendent or designated representative shall meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
20
If there are no "Requests for Transfer" on file from employees deemed acceptable for transfer to the Flin Flon Mill, Warehouse, Surface and Transportation Department or the Flin Flon Mine Department, and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before filling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.
7.08	If an employee is transferred from one section to another within the same department there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former section and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job. Past practice with respect to moves within plant progression lists shall remain in effect.

Article 8
REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF FORCES
8.01	The Company and the Unions are committed to exhausting all reasonable efforts to retain senior personnel. Whenever a reduction of force or a reduction of hours is necessary, the Company shall give fourteen (14) calendar days' notice, or fourteen (14) days' pay in lieu of such notice, except in the case of temporary reductions due to breakdown, accident, or other emergencies making such notice impossible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will advise employees as soon as possible after a decision is made to reduce hours or manpower.
8.02	In all cases of curtailment of operations, layoff procedures shall be determined in consultation with the Union. In all cases of reduction in the plant forces (other than temporary layoff not to exceed two (2) weeks resulting from accident, breakdown or other emergency) the Company shall lay off the employees affected in the inverse order of their Company seniority ranking except in those cases where certain specialized skills and capabilities are required to fill the normal requirements of the job.
8.03	Employees laid off shall keep the Company advised of their address or forfeit their right to consideration when the working force is again restored. Notice of restoration shall be given to the employee not less than ten (10) days prior to his recall date by one of the following methods: (i) to the employee personally, or (ii) by leaving a message at the home of the employee, or (iii) by mailing it to him at his last known address by registered mail. The Secretary of the Union will be advised of the method used to try to contact the employee and whether or not the method was
22
successful. Employees who, because of their seniority have been identified for layoff but at the time of layoff are entitled to or are in receipt of Workers' Compensation benefits or sick benefits under the Sick Benefit Plan,' will be laid off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such employees will continue to receive life insurance benefits and Health Plan benefits as though they had not been laid off, but pension and vacation accrual will cease at time of layoff and all earned but unpaid vacation will be paid at that time. Life insurance and Health Plan benefits will cease at the time such employee recovers from disability or at such earlier date in accordance with the terms and policies of the Group Life Insurance Plan and the Health Plan. Ifsuch employee is in receipt of a recall notice but is unable to report for work because of a continuing disability, he shall begin accruing benefits as if he were recalled.
8.04	If any employee has followed the above procedure, he shall not lose his seniority status because of a layoff, but his continuous service record shall not be lengthened more than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days during such layoff.
8.05	An employee who has been recalled after being laid off for any reason outlined in this article and who has previously completed the probationary period outlined in Article 7.02 shall not be considered a probationary employee.
8.06	An employee who, for the convenience and benefit of the employee, is temporarily assigned or transferred to another department at his request instead of being laid off due to lack of work, breakdown of machinery, or other like cause, shall be paid while so employed as follows:
23
(a)	If the regular rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred or assigned is higher than the employee's regular pay, he shall receive such' higher rate provided he can perform the job to the standard normally required.
(b)	If the rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred is less than the employee's regular rate, he shall be paid a red circle rate.
8.07	An employee who has been temporarily assigned or transferred under Article 8.06 shall, if an additional employee is required in the department from which he was transferred, be given the opportunity to transfer back ahead of other employees who have not worked in that department. Should the employee refuse the opportunity to transfer back to his own section, he will no longer retain any right of preference in this matter. If an employee refuses the opportunity to retransfer the Company will advise the Union in writing that the employee has so declined with a copy to the employee.
8.08	(a) If an employee is temporarily assigned to a job by
the Company he shall receive the rate for the job or his regular straight time hourly rate, whichever is the greater. This rate also applies to General Holidays if the General Holiday falls within the period of that temporary assignment. Should such temporary assignment exceed thirty (30) calendar days' duration the employment card rate of the employee will be changed to the rate of the assigned job for the duration of the temporary assignment.
24
(b) Senior employees shall receive preference for temporary assignments, provided these employees are on the same shift and are capable of doing the work. In cases of temporary assignments extended beyond forty-two (42) calendar days in cases of vacation relief, or thirty (30) calendar days in all other cases, the preference will be given to the senior employee available regardless of the shift, provided this employee is capable of doing the work. This provision will not apply to any subsequent vacancies resulting from the above.
8.09	In t his article,
(j)	"Card rate" means the rate shown on the time
card for the job occupation into which an employee has been placed and as it appears on his time card.
(ii)	"Red circled" means a special wage rate.
If an employee as a result of technological change or organizational change is downgraded by the Company into a classification of work paying a lesser wage rate than the regular wage rate of his permanent job, the employee shall maintain the rate of the permanent job which shall be red circled. If such employee is subsequently placed into a card rate which equals or exceeds his red circled rate, he will be removed from the red circled rate and paid that card rate.
Red circle differentials established after January 1, 1995 shall be reduced by one (I) job class fifteen (15) months after they are established and
(a)
(b)
25
they shall be further reduced by one (I) job class every three (3) months thereafter until they are eliminated. Red circle differentials established prior to January 1, 1995 shall be reduced or eliminated by any increase resulting from an increase in the increment between job classes.
(d)	It is a condition of Article 8 that any employee affected by it be required to accept any training the Company offers him and that he accept any other higher card rate job offered to him by the Company through assignment or promotion, and that he be an applicant for any higher card rate job in his department that is posted.
(e)	The Company shall give one hundred twenty (120) calendar days' notice prior to introducing technological change as described in Article 8.09 (b).
In the event of a technological change, the Company will, as far in advance of the change as possible, consult with the affected Union(s) for the purpose of providing:
(i)	A detailed description of the nature of the proposed technological change;
(ii)	The names of the employees who will likely be affected by the proposed technological change;
(iii)	The rationale for the change and the impact it will have on the Company's efficiency and economy of operations, and
26
(iv)	The Company's plan to minimize the impact of the technological change on the employees affected.
As a result of discussions outlined above and where the scope of the technological change necessitates it, a committee will be established by the Union(s) and the Company and will be comprised of representativesfrom the Company and the affected Union(s).
The Company shall provide the members of the committee with materials pertaining to technological change which may be required to ensure that the fullest discussion on such matters as retraining, change of work methods, reorganization of work, change to the method of organization, etc. will take place in an effort to implement change with the least possible disruption and with the maximum possible benefits to the Company and employees. It is understood that if new skills are required, the Company shall make every reasonable effort to provide training for employees so that new skill requirements are met from within the existing work force.
(f)	The provisions of this article are intended to assist employees affected by any change described in Article 8.09 (b) to adjust to the effects of the change.
(g)	The provisions of the Canada Labour Code, Division IV, Sections 52, 54 and 55 do not apply during the term of this Agreement to the Company and the Union.
27
(h)	Ifan employee notifies the Company that he wishes his employment to be terminated rather than be downgraded as a result of technological change as now defined in the Canada Labour Code, or is required to transfer to another department in order to maintain his employment, and if such notification is given within fourteen (14) calendar days of that downgrading or transfer, the Company shall terminate his employment and pay him severance pay of one week's pay of forty (40) straight hours for each year of the employee's continued service, up to a maximum of ten (10) weeks.
(i)	An employee who
(i)	has at least one (I)year of continuous service with the Company, and
(ii)	is laid off after exhausting all "bumping rights" as per Article 8.02 and who is advised by the Company that he will be laid off for at least ninety (90) calendar days or who is in fact laid off for at least ninety (90) calendar days,
shall be entitled to payment of severance pay, as defined in this Article, as follows:
(a)	Subject to clause (c) below, an employee who is entitled to severance under 8.09 (i) (ii) may, at any point in time between the effective date of the layoff and a period that ends 56 weeks after the date of the commencement of the layoff, elect to relinquish all rights to recall and terminate his employment and, upon doing so,
28
shall be entitled to receive severance pay as defined herein.
(b)	For the purposes of this Article, the amount that shall be paid as severance pay shall be an amount equal to:
(j)	one (I) week's pay of forty (40) straight time hours for each year of the employee's continual service with the Company, minus
(ii) any amount paid to him under Article 8.09 (h).
This severance pay shall be considered to satisfy the minimum severance requirements that are set forth in the Canada Labour Code.
(c)	An employee who is on layoff for a period of twelve (12) months and who elects to receive severance in accordance with the minimum provisions of the Canada Labour Code shall be paid such severance at the end of the twelve (12) month layoff. Such employee will continue to retain any recall rights that he may have under the Collective Agreement, but will be disentitled from receiving any severance pay under the terms of this Collective Agreement.
This Article 8.09 (i) does not apply in the event of layoffs due to strikes, sit-downs, slow-downs or lockouts.
	29
8.10 (a)	There will be no direct layoff or displacement from the bargaining unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition.
(b)	A staff employee returning to the unit will return to an entry level position. If possible, this move will be to the department in which he most previously worked as an hourly employee. After thirty (30) days such employee may use his Company seniority to apply for bulletins, transfers or progression moves.
(c)	If a staff employee has never worked in the bargaining unit, he will only be able to enter the bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. That is, he will not be able to displace a bargaining unit employee or be placed in a vacancy if there is notice of impending layoff. Such employee will not be able to utilize his Company seniority for the purpose of answering bulletins, progression moves or transfers for three (3) months from date of placement.
(d)	All efforts will be made to return a staff employee to the hourly unit in which he most recently worked. Moves will be made in consultation with the affected Unions.
(e)	Staff employees returning to the unit will receive a red circle rate equal to the rate of the last position previously held in the unit.
(0	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an hourly employee is transferred to a staff position, there shall be a period of thirty (30) calendar days in
30
which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former job in the bargaining unit and the terms of Article 8.10 (a) and (e) will not apply.
8.11	(a)	When it is necessary within a department to remove
an employee covered by this Agreement from a bulletin job or progression for technological change as defined in the Canada Labour Code, he shall be assigned to the highest permanent occupation covered by this Agreement in which he has previously held the card rate or the next higher job in that progression if his seniority so dictates or, at the employee's option, to an entry level job or, at the employee's option, bump down in his present progression. All employees so affected shall be red circled. All moves will be done in consultation with the Union.
(b) In all other cases other than technological change an affected employee, to retain a position, must first bump within his progression. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump within his section. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, then the employee will bump to another section within his department. If unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump to a position outside his department in the section or progression in which he previously held the highest card rate. It is understood that an employee, in bumping, cannot bump into a job paying a higher card rate than the one he presently holds, nor can he bump into a job he has not previously held.
31
(c)	If an employee is unable to retain employment by the above method and he has the skill and ability to do a job at a higher rate, he will only then be allowed to bump up, if he so chooses.
8.12 An employee displaced from their job may elect "voluntary layoff instead of a job in another operating department or severance under Article 8.09 (h). It is understood between the parties that an employee electing "voluntary layoff' will do so under the following terms:
(a)	Seniority will cease accumulating after one hundred twenty (120) calendar days.
(b)	Entitlement to all benefits will cease at time of "voluntary layoff"
(c) It is understood an employee on "voluntary layoff" may at a later date elect to receive severance under Article 8.09 (h) and terminate his employment.
The foregoing will not apply to an employee who is removed from his job at his own request or as a result of his inability to perform the normal requirements of his job.

9.03
9.04

On continuous shift operations, each employee shall be allowed a reasonable lunch period, which period shall be considered as time worked.
(b)	Day workers will normally begin work at 8:00 a.m. Day workers will be given a lunch period of one-half (Vi) hour per day but such lunch period shall not be considered as time worked. It is recognized that in order to maintain efficient operations, certain day workers must begin work earlier or later than 8:00 a.m.
(a) Changes in Shift
An employee shall be given 24 hours' notice in the event of a change in his shift. Where 24 hours' notice is not given, employees shall be paid at the overtime rate for the first shift.
9.05
34
Ifan employee is assigned work part way through a shift that requires him to work on a different shift that day, the employee and his supervisor will consult to determine whether the employee should complete his regular shift or leave work early.
(b)	Notice Required on Change of Rest Days
In the event that an employee is assigned to a job which changes the employee's scheduled rest days from the job he presently occupies, overtime rates shall be paid for work performed on such rest days for the first week only of the work schedule of the new job, if sufficient notice is not given by instructing the employee to that effect (or by posting) prior to the scheduled rest days of the job he presently occupies. For the purpose of this article, sufficient notice shall mean the greater of two (2) calendar days or a number of days equal to the number of rest days of the work schedule for the job he presently occupies.
(c)	Pay for Work on Rest Days
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9.04 (b) overtime rates shall be paid to employees for work performed at the request of the Company on the first and subsequent restday(s) designated for the job which he presently occupies.

35
worked plus one (I) hour, except that he shall receive pay for a minimum of four (4) hours. However, this provision of "plus one hour" shall not apply in situations as described in Article 9.06.
(b)	(i) A steady day worker who is called out within
ten (IO) hours of his next regularly scheduled shift shall be paid for the call-out as per Article 9.05 (a). I n this situation he shall have the option of not reporting for any portion of the first four (4) hours of his next regularly scheduled shift, with no pay for the hours not so worked.

17.04	Subject to the terms of this Collective Agreement, apprentices removed from the apprenticeship program will be offered other employment.
17.05	No rules and regulations regarding apprenticeship training shall conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. Incase of conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

In addition, each such apprentice shall receive a bonus of $100.00. This bonus is offered solely as
67
an inducement to apprentices to fully and satisfactorily complete their contracts and it is understood that no part thereof shall be deemed earned until the contract has been fully and satisfactorily completed.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
18.01	When an employee is assigned to work on a construction project outside of his normal working area, Article 18.02 and 18.03 shall apply.
18.02	If in the opinion of the Company, it is necessary for an employee to reside in other than his normal place of residence, the Company will supply free board and room and free transportation from a Company designated place to and from the job. The employee will travel to and from the job on his own time, subject to Article 19.02, and work a full shift.
Subject to the provisions of Article 9.02, employees working under this Article 18.02 may work on the basis of a 48 hour week.

The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day that they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company management, it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare, Flin Flon to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Flin Flon for a temporary period.

Article 19
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
19.01	(i) The Company agrees that the Unions have an
understandable concern over "contracting out" by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the employees.
The Company will continue to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Unions agree that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1.	The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of operations and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
2.	The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the Presidents or their designate of the affected Unions prior to awarding a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside
71
Company property. The Company will also consult with the appropriate Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the affected Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively
72
and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
5.	It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, the Unions and Senior Management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
6.	The Company agrees that no employee shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
19.02	The Company will continue its present practice of supplying free transportation to and from a Company designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.09.
When an employee is required by the Company to travel in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way to or from a Company designated point and the outlying job site, outside the time of his regularly scheduled shift, a travelling allowance will be paid. Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the 30 minute portion will be paid.
73
Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
19.03	Without restricting Management Rights as set out in Article 3 of this Agreement, all working conditions now established by practice and negotiation and now in effect shall remain in force insofar as they are consistent with this Agreement.

Article 20
REPLACEMENT OF JOB TOOLS AND CLOTHING
20.01	Personal tools broken in service or lost in inaccessible places shall be replaced by tools of equal value by the Company, unless an investigation by the Company and the Union proves that the wear or breakage or loss was due to the employee's carelessness or neglect.
20.02	The Company will continue with its present practice of partial or full reimbursement for damage to clothing in circumstances where the damage arises while an employee of a service department is assigned to a Plant for temporary duty. Such amount shall be as determined and approved by the department superintendent.

Article 21
BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
21.01	A maximum bereavement leave of ten (IO) calendar days will be granted to an employee, commencing on the day of the death of his spouse, son or daughter, in order to attend the funeral.

21.02	A maximum bereavement leave of three (3) scheduled working days will be granted to an employee, upon the death of his mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, spouse's grandmother, spouse's grandfather, grandchild, and any relative permanently residing in the employee's household or with whom the employee resides, in order to attend the funeral. In this situation the bereavement leave will be extended by two (2) scheduled working days if the employee attends the funeral outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence the employee shall be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
21.03	In the event that an employee's bereavement leave overlaps or occurs during his vacation period his vacation time will be extended by the number of days that his bereavement leave encroaches on it.
21.04	To qualify for bereavement leave pursuantto 21.01, 21.02 or 21.03 the employee shall notify his immediate supervisor as soon as possible following the bereavement.
75
21.05	Notwithstanding the terms of 21.01 and 21.02, under the Canada Labour Code an employee is entitled to three (3) calendar days bereavement leave immediately following the death of the employee's spouse, son, daughter, mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law or father-in-law. There is no requirement under the Code to attend the funeral to be eligible for such leave.
Article 22
NO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT
22.01	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any of the members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in any labour organization or by reason of sex, race, national origin, colour, religion physical disability or sexual orientation.
Article 23
DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE
23.01	The following procedure shall govern in all cases of discipline:
(a)	The Company shall have the right to discipline any employee for sufficient and just cause.
(b)	Employees will be advised of any discipline as soon as possible following the incident giving rise to the discipline.
76
(c)	When an employee is formally disciplined while at work, a steward will attend. Every reasonable effort will be made to have the attending steward be from his own jurisdiction. An opportunity will be given to the steward to discuss the circumstances surrounding the discipline with the superintendent or his representative during the discipline procedure. The employee and his Union will be made aware of any information which is being considered for use in the discipline and informed of any information which is being placed in the employee file that could be used for discipline; and
(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, there will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts. It i s understood that any discipline stemming from the investigation will be solely determined by management. Every reasonable effort will be made to have this investigation completed within seven (7) calendar days. Suspensions will be administered at the end of an employee's shift whenever appropriate and possible, it being understood there are circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the workplace immediately following the incident. Except in those circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the property immediately, when a suspension is imposed the suspension will not be served, if the employee decides to file a grievance on the matter, until Step 2 of the grievance procedure has been completed.
77
(e)	The employee and the steward in attendance will receive a written copy of the suspension slip or discharge letter. Also, the appropriate Union shall be advised promptly in writing by the Company of the reason or reasons for such suspension or discharge.
23.02	There may be situations outside of the formal discipline procedures in which an employee may feel that he would be more comfortable with a Union Steward present when he is called into a meeting with management. Such request for a Union Steward will not be unreasonably denied. If either party feels the intent of this clause is not being followed, the parties will meet to resolve the matter.
23.03	Ifany employee feels that he has been unjustly disciplined, he shall have the right of appeal through the grievance procedure at Step 2. Such appeal must be filed in writing by the Union with the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of notification of discipline and, unless so filed, the right of appeal shall be lost.
23.04	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay period next preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
23.05	All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole
78
discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
23.06	Any employee with more than one (I)year's seniority may once annually request a formal evaluation from his supervisor. In addition, once yearly an employee may request to review his departmental employee file. The written evaluation will include items such as attendance, disciplinary action, promotability and attitude to work and safety.
An employee wishing to review his departmental employee file shall make such request to his department superintendent or designate. All of the material in the file will be reviewed with the employee. If the employee disagrees with the factual nature of any material in his file and the superintendent or designate is unwilling to remove the material from the file, such employee will be entitled to write a note to the file explaining his disagreement. Such note will become part of the file.
Article 24
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
24.01	Every effort will be made to resolve differences before grievances are filed. Failing that, the parties agree that grievances and grievance meetings should be treated as opportunities for mutual problem solving. Should any difference arise between the Company and any of the employees from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this
79
Agreement, an earnest effort will be made to settle such grievance without undue delay. All grievances, in order to settle them as quickly as possible, will have to be submitted to the Company representative within fourteen (14) calendar days of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the grievance and shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided. Every reasonable effort will be made to schedule Step 1 and 2 grievance meetings during the griever's working hours. Failing that, every reasonable effort will be made to hold the meeting immediately before or after the griever's working hours. Also, every effort will be made to include all involved parties (original steward, supervisors, etc.) in all steps of the grievance procedure.
24.02	Step 1 -- Any employee with a personal grievance must take the matter up with his front line supervisor accompanied by a Union steward of his choice from his own department.

24.04	Step 3 -- Failing satisfactory settlement within seven (7) calendar days after Step 2, the Grievance Committee shall present the matter to the appropriate manager or his designated representative within seven (7) calendar days thereafter. This designated representative is not to be the
80

24.06	Grievances other than a personal grievance that concern the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement may be initiated by the Union and shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this article beginning at Step 3.

the department superintendent in Step 2 in Article 24.03.

(c)	Grievances other than personal grievances shall be presented in writing by the Grievance Committee to the appropriate manager in Article 24.06.
81

clauses of this article, due to absence of a Company official from the vicinity, a substitute may be appointed by the Company with full power to effect settlement of grievances, or the step of grievance procedure in which said official is concerned may be eliminated from the procedure.

Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will negotiate a collective agreement having a three (3) year term.
Where two or more Unions that are bargaining at one bargaining table conclude a settlement, and the settlement is rejected by the membership of one or more of the Unions, then the Union(s) who were unsuccessful in having the settlement ratified by their membership shall be entitled to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
27.02	Upon receipt of written notice in accordance with Article 28.01, Duration of Agreement, the parties shall meet within fourteen (14) days to exchange collective bargaining proposals. Those proposals will serve to define
86
the issues that the parties will seek to address during collective bargaining.
27.03	The parties will bargain collectively in good faith and make every reasonable effort to enter into a new collective agreement through the normal collective bargaining process. The arbitration provisions set forth herein are intended to be a last resort and are not meant to be a substitute for the collective bargaining process.
27.04	The parties will, at the outset of collective bargaining meet to develop agreed time lines. The time lines shall provide that any arbitration hearing that is required shall be scheduled approximately thirty (30) days after the stated expiry date of the Collective Agreement.
27.05	I f it does not appear to either the affected Union(s) or the Company that a revised collective agreement will be concluded by the expiry date, then either may apply, pursuant to the relevant labour legislation, for the appointment of a Conciliation Officer to assist the parties in concluding a collective agreement. Meetings with the Conciliation Officer will begin no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the stated expiry date of the Collective Agreement, and will continue as necessary until the earlier of the conclusion of a new collective agreement, or the stated expiry date of this Agreement, whichever occurs first.
27.06	The parties agree that neither party will apply for the appointment of a Conciliation Commissioner or a Conciliation Board pursuant to any legislative provision that may be in effect.
87
27.07	Should the parties fail to conclude a revised collective agreement prior to the stated expiry date of this Agreement, and provided that notice to negotiate has been given pursuant to Article 28.01 of the Collective Agreement, then, for the sole purpose of governing the relationship between the parties, the terms of this Agreement shall continue in effect until a new collective agreement has been concluded, and the following shall apply:
(a)	The resolution of the provisions of this Agreement shall be immediately referred to arbitration, with the arbitration being scheduled, where possible, in accordance with the time lines referred to in clause .04;
(b)	All negotiation shall be suspended as at midnight of the stated expiry date of this Agreement, and the parties shall not be obligated to meet to negotiate beyond that date. This provision is intended to facilitate the conclusion of a jointly negotiated collective agreement prior to the expiry date, and the failure of either party to negotiate following the stated expiry date will not be taken to constitute a violation of any provision of the applicable labour legislation;
(c)	One arbitration board shall be appointed to hear all collective bargaining referrals that arise pursuant to any of the Collective Agreements that expire within twelve (12) months of each other. The arbitration board shall be established in the following manner:
(i) At any time after the commencement of negotiations, the Company or the Unions which
88
are party to a 2012 Amending Agreement shall name a single person who will act as their nominee to the arbitration board. The party receiving such notice shall likewise name its nominee within seven (7) days of receipt of notice of the appointment of the other party’s nominee.
(ii) The Chairperson of the arbitration board shall be chosen in rotation from the panel of individuals set forth below:
Hugh Jamieson Martin Freedman Martin Teplitsky
In the event that any of the aforenoted individuals become permanently incapacitated or otherwise unable to act, then the parties will meet to select a replacement for such individual.
Where the parties are unable to agree on such a replacement, then they may request that the arbitration board that has been convened pursuant to this Article name a replacement, and the arbitration board may do so notwithstandingthe provisions of paragraph 22 of this Article.
27.08	The Company and the aforenoted Unions shall each designate a contact person and those two individuals shall serve to facilitate the fixing of hearing dates and the resolution of all procedural matters relating to the arbitration hearing(s).
89
27.09	Unless the parties otherwise agree, the referral from each of the collective bargaining tables shall be treated as a separate referral. The parties may, however, either by agreement or direction of the arbitration board, stipulate that certain evidence (as for example, the Company's main economic submission) be heard only once and considered as though it had been heard in each of the collective bargaining table referrals that are being considered by the arbitration board. For the purpose of greater certainty, the term "collective bargaining table" shall be defined as those collective bargaining tables that are established pursuant to clause .01 of this Article.
27.10	The arbitration board shall convene a hearing (the "initial hearing"), either in person or by conference call, to determine the following:
(a)	the order in which the arbitrations will proceed;
(b)	the terms and conditions of the proposed Collective Agreements which are in dispute between the parties;
(c)	the date for submission of written briefs; and
(d)	the date(s) for the arbitration hearings.
In determining the order in which the hearings are to proceed, the arbitration board will have regard to factors such as the date on which negotiations commenced, the date on which an application for conciliation was made, the number of employees represented at each particular bargaining table, and any other relevant matters.
27.11
27.12
27.13
90
In preparation for the initial hearing, each party shall provide, in writing, to the other and to each member of the arbitration board, no less than three (3) working days prior to the initial hearing, a document setting forth the following :
(a)	the terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreements that have been agreed;
(b)	the terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreements that remain outstanding;
The Chairperson is to direct the nominee(s) at the initial hearing that, with the exception of other members of the arbitration board, they are to have no communication with anyone with regard to any aspect of the process or the hearing from that point onward until the arbitration board has issued all award(s) for any referral that has or may be made to the arbitration board with respect to Collective Agreements covering employees in the Flin Flon mineral area.
On the date fixed by the arbitration board at the initial hearing, each party shall submit to each member of the arbitration board, in writing a copy of:
(a)	its position on all terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreement which are in dispute between the parties;
(b)	its brief in support of its submission; and
(c)	a list of all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties as at that date.
91
27.14	The arbitration board shall on the date fixed by the arbitration board at the initial hearing, hold a hearing in order to provide each party or its representatives with the opportunity to submit evidence and arguments in support of their position.
The arbitration board may establish its own procedures for the conduct of the hearing, and may reschedule matters to dates other than those established at the initial hearing.
27.15	Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration board shall render its decision no later than fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the hearing.
The failure of the arbitration board to render its decision within the time specified under the previous paragraph does not affect the jurisdiction of the arbitration board to continue and complete the issuance of its award.
27.16	In arriving at its decision, the arbitration board may take into account:
(a)	the terms and conditions of the existing or any previous Collective Agreement between the parties;
(b)	wage settlements in general in the geographic area, in the industry and with the Company or a related company;
(c)	the economic circumstances of the Company;
(d)	changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index for the City of Winnipeg as published from time to time by Statistics Canada;
92
(e)	the desirability of maintaining comparable settlements between the Company and its various bargaining units;
(f)	such other matters as in the discretion of the arbitration board will assist it in arriving at a fair and reasonable decision.
Inarriving at its decision, the arbitration board shall have regard to all of the foregoing factors, giving due weight to those that it considers to be relevant for the resolution of the specific dispute. Except in cases of “survival”, where there is threat of closure of the operation or a significant portion of the operation, the total wage and benefit package as detailed in the Collective Bargaining Agreement(s) effective December31, 1999 shall not be reduced without the consent of the Union(s).
27.17	Neither party will rely on the funding status of the pension plan in opposition to or in support of any proposal for increased pension benefits. The foregoing sentence does not otherwise preclude or restrict the arbitrator from considering the Company‘s pension plan funding obligations in addressing the stipulated criteria.
27.18	Except where otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitration board shall impose a collective agreement that expires three (3) years after the stated expiry date set forth in the Collective Agreement that was being arbitrated. The newly imposed collective agreement is to be retroactive to the stated expiry date of the Collective Agreement that was being arbitrated except that the effective date of any particular change need not coincide
See Letter of Understanding #41 - Project 2012
Article 28
DURATION OF AGREEMENT
28.01 This Agreement- shall become effective as of January 1. 2009 and shall remain in effect until and including December 31. 2011 and shall be automatically renewed thereafter for successive periods of twelve (12) months unless either party requests the negotiation of a new agreement by giving written notice to the other party not less than thirty (30) calendar days and not more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to December 31, 2011 or not less than thirty (30) calendar days and not more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of any automatic renewal of this Agreement.
93
with the effective date of the imposed collective agreement.
27.19	The decision of the arbitration board is final and binding and the decision is not open to appeal or review in any court of law except on a question involving the jurisdiction of the arbitration board.
27.20	The parties shall bear the fees and expenses of their own nominee and shall equally bear the fees and expenses of the Chairperson.
27.21	A mutually agreed alternative process for dispute resolution may be substituted for the three-person panel process set out above. Possible alternatives include but are not restricted to mediation - arbitration, single person arbitration and final offer selection.
27.22	All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be interpreted as being subject to the provisions of this Article. This Article, the revised Article “No Strikes No Lockouts”, and any other provisions that the parties in a separate Letter of Understanding have identified as being non-arbitrable, shall remain unchanged for the duration of Project 2012 and the arbitration board shall not have any jurisdiction to amend or delete those provisions.
27.23	Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, this Article shall expire and be of no force and effect as of July 1, 2012. This Article shall also cease to be of any force and effect if Project2012 does not proceed or is cancelled as those terms are defined in the 2012 Amending Agreement that was executed between the Company and those Unions who are signatory to that Agreement.

RE: PARTNERING
The Company and the Unions are committed to a successful profitable operation founded on principles of respect and tolerance between the Unions and the Management of the Company.
Both the Company and the Unions share common objectives relating to achieving the ongoing viability of HBMS and in turn providing greater employment security and improved working life for employees.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #8 To the Union:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
Ifan employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
128
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee's request).
b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked "regular" vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
c)	Employee would take a "special" vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6)	In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
Itwas the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue
that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable
manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #18 To the Union:
RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the
140
additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company's Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate.
b)	Trades - I n order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
c)	Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBMS Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one (I) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (I) representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills required to
141
perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct
result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1, 1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid
off unless such layoffs are the result of the following:
a)	Layoffs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Layoffs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output
142
levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	Layoffs of any employee hired after the effective date of the collective agreement then in force.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	Layoffs due to closure, sale or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It i s understood that any layoff resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterized as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It i s further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

RE: 12-HOUR SHIFTS
The parties agree that no additional wage and benefit costs will be incurred with the adoption of a twelve (12) hour shift schedule and,
147
to this end, the following clauses in the Collective Bargaining Agreement have been revised. This summary is for information purposes only and does not prohibit the establishment of other provisions as may be deemed necessary by individual departments when implementing extended hours.
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be considered to have accumulated 1.5 straight time working shifts for any twelve (12) hour shifts worked for purposes of completing the normal probationary period of four hundred eighty (480) working hours (including overtime hours worked).
9.02	Standard rates of pay for hourly employees working extended hours shall be calculated on the basis of working 320 hours in an eight (8) week period (average forty (40) hours per week).
Standby allowance will be paid to hourly employees working extended hours if the department requires such an arrangement. The allowance payable will be one-half (1/2) hour's pay at straight time at the employee's applicable hourly rate.
For areas which work four on/four off with 12-hour shifts and do not use a swingman, the basis for their scheduled overtime pay will be as follows:
(j)	2.3 hours at 1/2 regular rate will be paid for each
48-hour working set of shifts which are worked as scheduled.
(ii)	Employees who miss a shift(s) due to sickness or AWOL during a 48-hour set of scheduled shifts will not receive the payment outlined in (i) for that 48-hour set.
148
(iii)	For the purpose of determining the payment in (i), shifts of paid leave such as vacation and bereavement leave will be considered as shifts worked.
(iv)	Payment under (i) will be prorated for shifts missed in the 48-hour set for shifts of unpaid leave (i.e. if there is one shift of unpaid leave in the 48-hour working set, the payment would be 36 -s- 48 x 2.3 hours x 1/2 regular rate).
9.04 For employees working 12-hour shifts, two (2) working days shall be considered as sufficient notice for change of rest days.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #25 To the Union:
RE: SPECIAL ALLOWANCE - JOB AMALGAMATION
During 1987 bargaining the Company and the Union agreed that a special allowance of one job class would be paid if, as a result of job amalgamation, the CWS evaluation of the amalgamated job does not result in a minimum one job class increase above the highest classified job being amalgamated and the following criteria are met:
(j) two or more job descriptions are combined into one or more job descriptions and one or more job descriptions are terminated, and
(ii)	the primary function(s) of the terminated job(s) become part of the primary function(s) of the remaining job(s), and
(iii)	as the result of the amalgamation less employees are required to do the work.
It i s understood that if technological change were to eliminate most of a job's duties and the remaining duties were added to another occupation, or a job were terminated and its duties spread amongst a large number of jobs or incumbents, the special allowance would not apply.
The special allowance will not form part of the CWS evaluation or classification but will remain a separate allowance.

To the Union:
RE: MINE DEPARTMENT TRAINING
Further to the 1993 negotiations, the following practices were
agreed to regarding Mine Department training:
1)	Vacancies for development miners and blasthole drillers will be bulletined within the department prior to hiring. If no qualified development miners or blasthole drillers apply, the Company will commit to training up to two (2) employees as development miners or blasthole drillers, at any one time, at each of the 777, Trout Lake and Snow Lake mines. Provided there are two (2) such trainees (two (2) development miners, two (2) blasthole drillers or one (1) of each) established at the mine with the vacancy (or vacancies), the Company may fill the vacancy (or vacancies) at that mine. In the event a situation arises which will cause the Company to increase its need for new development miners or blasthole drillers beyond the two (2) per mine outlined, the Union will be consulted as far in advance as possible to discuss alternatives to hiring. One potential alternative to hiring would be to recall qualified development miners or blasthole drillers from other departments or from the recall list out of seniority.
2) If t here is a requirement to bring additional employees into the mines to fill temporary vacancies created as a result of the training program, such employees will be required to return to their original department or return to layoff once the training has been completed.
155
3)	After completion of the training, if no permanent vacancy exists, the person trained will return to his former job.
4)	During the training period and until the person trained is placed in a permanent development miner or blasthole driller position (as applicable), he shall be paid at the rate of his former job.
5)	Anyone who receives training as a development miner or blasthole driller as outlined above will be unable to bulletin to any other position in the mine for a two (2) year period after completion of the training.
6)	After the signing of this agreement employees who enter into a development miner or blasthole driller training program will be required to fill vacancies for development miner or blasthole driller positions respectively, either temporary or permanent, regardless of whether such vacancies are at Trout Lake, 777 or Snow Lake.
7)	Employees who receive development miner training under this program must be prepared to qualify for all development miner jobs including drift mining and conventional raise mining.
8)	The Company shall establish selection criteria to assist with the selection process of development miners and blasthole driller trainees.

RE: STAFF TO HOURLY - MINE DEPARTMENT
The parties agree that staff employees returning to the bargaining unit in the Mine Department will return to an entry level position. Such employees will remain at entry level for at least thirty (30) days and be considered the junior employee for temporary assignmentwhile at entry level. The terms of Article 8.08 (b) would apply to such temporary assignment. The returning staff employee will remain at entry level until he is the successful applicant for a bulletin.
It is not the Company’s intent to show favouritism to a returning staff employee. That being the case, any disputes arising regarding job assignment or work location involving a returned staff employee will be considered a proper subject for the Grievance Procedure. The employee and his immediate supervisor are encouraged to settle any disputes prior to proceeding to Step I of the Grievance Procedure.

The letter will be passed out at the time of new employee documentation. It i s understood that the Union will provide the Company with a suitable quantity of letters for distribution.

Greetings:
As President of the United Steelworkers, Local Union 7106, Iwish to welcome you to Flin Flon.
The Steelworkers are involved in many and varied activities. Information can be obtained by visiting us at our office, 68 Church Street, Flin Flon.
158
Membership in our Union is voluntary and although you will be paying Union dues (under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement), you may become a member only upon signing an application for membership. Attached to this letter you will find an application form for membership. lu rge you to fill it out and return it to the Personnel office or bring it to the Steelworkers' office at the Labour Temple. The application forms can also be obtained at the office.
Iw ould like to extend a hearty welcome to you to visit us so that we can get to know each other.
Good luck in our community.
Please find below the United Steelworkers Anti-Harassment Policy.
UNITED STEELWORKERS ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Steelworker members are entitled to a harassment free environment at all union activities, events and meetings.
There are two principles fundamental to the labour movement: human rights and solidarity. Harassment strikes at the heart of both.
Steelworkers will not tolerate nor condone behaviour that is likely to undermine the dignity or self-esteem of an individual, or which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. As Steelworkers we must speak out against harassment and stand together to protect human rights.
Harassment is not a joke. It i s an expression of perceived power by the harasser over another person, usually for reasons over which the victim has little or no control. Prohibited grounds under Human Rights Codes across Canada can include sex, race, age, marital
159
status, sexual orientation, disability, political or religious beliefs, and place of national origin.
Harassment can be defined as any action (verbal, psychological or physical) on a single or repeated basis which humiliates, insults or degrades and is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the victim of the harassment.
Harassment can include but is not limited to: unwanted comments, slurs, racist or sexist jokes, pictures or posters, bullying or intimidation, graffiti, physical contact of any kind, remarks about a person’s appearance or personal life, unwelcome sexual advances or demands, suggestive looks or gestures.
Steelworkers take harassment complaints seriously. Complaints of harassment at Steelworkers activities will be investigated by one of our anti-harassment complaints counsellors and reported to the Canadian National Director for any necessary follow-up. A substantial complaint will result in action by the Union, which could include the removal of the harasser from the event. A letter outlining the reasons for the removal will be sent to the local union.
“We can’t make people like each other. But we can, through concrete action, promote tolerance and mutual respect in our Union."

Tom Davie President January 1, 2009

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #32 To the Union:
RE: MODIFIED WORK
The Company and the Unions have agreed to establish a Modified Work Program which is designed to help employees return to meaningful work with minimal risk to their rehabilitation. To this end, the parties agree to the following:
162
1.	A committee of seven (7) representatives to oversee the
program will be formed consisting of:	three (3) from the
Company, one (I)from the Trades Association, one (I)from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one (I)from the United Steelworkers, Local 7106 and one (I)from the United Steelworkers, Local 9338.
2.	The committee will operate by consensus.
3.	The committee will use a medical professional for consultation purposes as required.
4.	The employee must qualify for Sick Benefit or Workers' Compensation before being eligible for the formal Modified Work Program. However, employees who fall outside the formal Modified Work Program may make arrangements with department supervision for modified work.
5.	The employee will be involved in placement decisions. All reasonable efforts will be made to meet the employee's needs both medically and personally. Any disputes will be dealt with by the Joint Committee. Every effort will be made to place the employee on modified work in his original department and classification.
6.	Wage structure:
a) Workers' Compensation
The employee will receive the rate of pay for the modified work performed until a decision on make-up of wages is made by WCB. If there is no make-up of wages, then the Company will retroactively pay the red circled rate of the employee's former job.
163
b) Sick Benefit
The employee will receive a red circled rate for 520 hours of modified work for each unrelated occurrence of modified work. If a dispute arises over whether an occurrence is a reoccurrence, it will be referred to the Committee. Anything in excess of 520 hours will be paid at the rate of the modified work performed.
7.	The employee's originating department will assume the costs for the first 520 hours if the employee is assigned to another department.
8.	The Modified Work Program will be co-ordinated by the Superintendent of Loss Control who will also serve as the Company representative on the committee.
9.	Union jurisdiction:
Ifan employee is assigned to a job outside of his current Union jurisdiction, he will continue to pay dues to his Union for a one (I) year period. At that time it will be reviewed by the committee and the affected Unions.
10.	Transfers:
An employee on temporary modified work can only apply for job bulletins in his original department.
11.	A meeting will take place between the department, the co-ordinator, the employee and his Union steward to outline the restrictions and responsibilities of all involved in the modified work assignment.

That is, after three (3) years of service, employees who are laid off or who retire will be afforded one-third (1/3) of the three (3) week special vacation allotment for each full year of employment.
By way of example, special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis shall mean an employee who has been on the payroll for five (5) years and three (3) months at time of layoff will be entitled to two weeks' special vacation pay in addition to that earned but not taken on obtaining three (3) years of service.

RE: COMMITMENT TO COST AND MANPOWER REDUCTIONS
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties at
1996	bargaining and their commitments with regard to cost and manpower reductions. The parties recognize the need for cost and manpower reductions in 1997 and beyond to enhance our chances of survival.
It is understood that there is a need to reduce operating costs in
1997	by $30 million and, as part of this effort, the Company has decided that the hourly Steelworker and Trades Association memberships will be reduced by 48. These reductions will be measured against the January 1,1997 budgeted manpower number of 982 which does not include hourly employees who may need to be laid off in 1997 as a result of the Westarm Mine closure (37 employees as of February 7, 1997).
It is understood that 48 Steelworker and Trades Association positions will be reduced by voluntary means. To this end, incentive programs have been put in place. It i s understood that it may have the effect of reducing the Steelworker and Trades Association memberships by more than the target of 48.
In association with the Company's commitment to reduce manpower by 48 by voluntary means in 1997, the Unions underscore their commitment to the terms of Letter #18 by the following:
1.	Each Union President will communicate in writing to their members the need and their support for the flexible use of employees' skills.
169
2.	The parties will work together to educate the employees of the necessity for flexibility to reduce costs and improve productivity while adhering to safe working practices and standards.
3.	To not allow their demonstrated commitment to waiver in the face of disputes over other issues.

4.	Unless the parties otherwise agree, the following provisions of the Collective Agreement (except as otherwise noted) will remain unchanged for the duration of Project 2012, and the arbitration board shall not have any jurisdiction to amend or delete those provisions:
