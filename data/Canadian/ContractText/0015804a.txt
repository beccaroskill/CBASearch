RE SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting shortterm personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subjecttothe requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
(a) Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee’s request).
105
-2-
(b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked "regular* vacation day after July 1 st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
(c)	Employee would take a "special" vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6) In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (eg commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit
It was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

RE: SNOW LAKE TRAVEL
Further to negotiations with the Bargaining Committee, 1987, towards concluding a Collective Bargaining Agreement effective October 1,1987, the Company has agreed to resubmit Letters of Agreement regarding past practise of providing transportationto Snow Lake. It is, therefore, the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
Flin Flon employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2 5s) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (2\) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools from Snow Lake when they return from the completion of a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the soie opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to providethe equivalent of return bus fare, Flin Ron to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Flin Ron for a temporary period.

To the Union:
RE: LONGTERM ABSENTEEISM
This will confirm the agreement reached at 1993 bargaining with regard to employees who have been off work twelve (12) months or more.
Effective the date of signing of the Collective Agreement, an employee who has been off work for more than twelve (12) months on Sick Benefit will not accrue vacation pay. Accrual of vacation pay will restartafter the employee has been back at work on a full time basis for a minimum of three (3) months (accrual from the date of return).
Effective the date of signing of the Collective Agreement, an employee who is off work on Workers’ Compensation will stop accruing regular vacation. When such employee returns to work and remains at work for a minimum three (3) month period, he shall be deemed for the purpose of regular vacation to have been at work for the full calendar year prior to his return to work.
For example, an employee goes off work on WCB July 1996 and returns to work April 2000 (seniority entitles him to 25 regular vacation days/year).
-	January 1997 employee would be paid lump sum for any regular vacation earned in 1995, but not taken prior to July 1996 when he went off work on WCB.
-	January 1998 employee would be paid lump sum for any regular vacation earned from January 1996 till July 1996.
-	When employee returns to work in April 2000, he will be entitled to 25 regular vacation days with pay to be taken during the calendar year 2000. (Would be entitled to the 25 days during 2000 regardless of when he returned to work during 2000.)
Effective the date of signing of the Collective Agreement, employees off work on Workers’ Compensation or Sick Benefit will cease accruing special vacation on being off work for twelve (12) months. Accrual of special vacation will restart once
127
2
an employee has returned to work for three (3) months (accrual from date of return to work).
Using the same circumstances in the example outlined above, if the employee’s next set of specials are due August 1998, then:
-	His specials would continue to accrue until July 1997.
-	As of August 1998 he would have accrued 23/38 x 15 a 10 working days of specials to be taken no later than August 2001.
-	When he returns to work April 2000, he would have the 10 days referred to above (to take by August 2001) and he would begin accruing specials again.
-	At his next entitlement date (August 2001) he would have accrued 16/36 x 15 = 7 working days of specials to be taken no later than August 2004.
Effective the date of signing cf the Collective Agreement, an employee who has been off work for twelve (12) months or more win be required to retire provided he qualifies for an unreduced pension unless his personal physician, in consultation with a Company designated physician, determines that the employee should be able to return to work within a twelve (12) month period.

T radespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
132
(c; Operators • In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph (a) above.

b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fosteringand promotingthe principlesof employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace mattersinvolvingcontinuingimprovementsin productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It is agreed that during the term of this Agreement, no employees on the payroll as at October 25,1993 other than those on the layoff list as of that date will be laid off unless such lay-offs are the result of the following:
a)	Temporary lay-offs because of temporary shutdown, including but not limited to vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Lay-offs resultingfrom decreased manning levels required becauseof the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof not including work reorganization or process modifications with the exception of the Noranda Reactor Project.

RE: SPECIAL ALLOWANCE - JOB AMALGAMATION
During 1987 bargaining the Company and the Union agreed that a special allowance of one job class would be paid if, as a result of job amalgamation, the CWS evaluation of the amalgamated job does not result in a minimum one job class increase above the highest classified job being amalgamated and the following criteria are met:

(jj) the primary function(s) of the terminated job(s) become part of the primary function(s) of the remaining job(s), and
(jjj) as the result of the amalgamation less employees are required to do the work.
It is understood that if technological change were to eliminate most of a job's duties and the remaining duties were added to another occupation, or a job were terminated and its duties spread amongst a large number of jobs or incumbents, the special allowance would not apply. '
The special allowance will not form part of the CWS evaluation or classification but w3l remain a separate allowance.

RE: MINE DEPARTMENTTRAINING
Further to the 1993 negotiations, the following practices were agreed to regarding
Mine Departmenttraining:
1)	Vacancies for development miners will be bulletined within the department prior to hiring. If no qualified development miners apply, the Company will commit to training up to four (4) development miners at any one time (two (2) for Callinan and two (2) for Trout Lake). In the event a situation arises which will cause the Company to increase its need for new development miners beyond the four (4) outlined, the Union will be consulted as far in advance as possible to discuss alternatives to hiring. One potential alternative to hiring would be to recall qualified development miners from other departments or from the recall list out of seniority.
2)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there are no vacancies for development miners by June 1,1994, two (2) trainee development miner positions will be bulletined in the Mine Department as of that date.
3)	If there is a requirementto bring additional employees into the mines to fill temporary vacancies created as a result of the training program, such employees will be required to return to their original department or return to lay-off once the training has been completed.
4)	After completion of the training, if no permanent vacancy exists, the person trained will return to his former job.
5)	During the training period and until the person trained is placed in a permanent development miner position, he shall be paid at the rate of his former job.
6)	Anyone who receives training as a development miner as outlined above will be unable to bulletin to any other position in the mine for a two (2) year period after completion of the training.
144
2
7)	Mine Department employees who have completed development miner training will be required to fill future vacancies for development miner positions, either temporary or permanent, regardless of whether such vacancies are at Trout or Callinan.
8)	Employees who receive training under this program and qualify as a development miner will not displace existing development miners who are junior to them in seniority except as outlined in 11) below.
9)	Employees vtfio receive training under this program must be prepared to qualify for all development miner jobs including drift mining and conventional raise mining.
10)	The parties agree to develop selection criteria for development miner trainees to assist the selection process.
11)	The parties agree that as of April 8,1994, the following development miners can be characterized as being retained in the mine out of seniority:
JENNINGS, Frederick J.	Development Miner	83/08/29
STEEVES, Troy A.	Development Miner	84/08/21
TRUDEAU, J.M. Claude	Miner (Certified)	86/05/06

ROBERTS, Jack W.	Miner (Certified)	87/11 /02
KNUTSON, David R,	Development Miner	88/05/04
The foregoing will continue to be characterized as being retained out of seniority so long as there are no employees in the Mine Department in a classification other than development miner who have less seniority.
The Company agrees that the number of employees in the foregoing group will reduce by two (2) within twelve (12) months, four (4) within twenty-four (24) months, six (6) within thirty-six (36) months, etc.

If either party feels that the intent of this letter is not being followed, ttepartles will meet to resolve the matter.

2.	The committee will operate by consensus.
3.	The committee will use a medical professional for consultation purposes as required.
4.	The employee must qualify for Sick Benefit or Workers’ Compensation before being eligible for the formai Modified Work Program. However, employees who fall outside the formal Modified Work Program may make arrangements with department supervision for modified work.
5.	The employee will be involved in placement decisions. All reasonable efforts will be made to meet the employee’s needs both medically and personally. Any disputes will be dealt with by the Joint Committee. Every effort will be made to place the employee on modified work in his original department and classification.
6.	Wage structure:
a) Workers’ Compensation
The employee will receive the rate of pay for the modified work performed until a decision on make-up of wages is made by WCB. If there is no make-up of wages, then the Company will retroactively pay the red circled rate of the employee’s former job.

7.	The employee’s originating department will assume the costs for the first 520 hours if the employee is assigned to another department.
8.	The Modified Work Program will be co-ordinated by the Superintendent of Loss Control who will also serve as the Company representative on the committee.
9.	Union jurisdiction:
If an employee is assigned to a job outside of his current union jurisdiction, he will continue to pay dues to his union for a one (1) year period. At that time it will be reviewed by the committee and the affected unions.

Electronic monitoring equipment is not intended for invading the privacy of employees or to administer undue disciplinary action; however, employees should be aware that performance could be monitored as a by-product of electronic monitoring.
It is agreed that in the event of a criminal investigation (i.e. RCMP), employees may not be notified of the installation of electronic monitoring equipment.

RE: STAFF TO HOURLY -1993/94 REDUCTIONS NO LAY-OFF OR DISPLACEMENT
There will be no direct lay-off or displacement from the bargaining unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition. That being the case, for each staff employee returning to the bargaining unit, one hourly employee will be removed from the lay-off list.
It is understood between the parties that this approach may, for a time, cause the Company to carry employees beyond those required and that this excess will only be eliminated or reduced by attrition (quits, retirements, terminations, etc.) or the requirement/oradditional manpower (e.g. Westarm).
The accounting for this attrition will begin for Trades and Steel on the date a staff employee’s return to the individual bargaining unit would have resulted in the layoff of an hourly employee.

To the Union:
RE: HBM&S AS SECOND PAYER FOR DRUGS
It is agreed between the parties that the Company will become the second payer for drugs as outlined in Article 13.04. That is, the Company, effective January 1, 1994, will be responsible for payingfor only the non-recoverable portion of eligible drug costs for regularpartlcipating status membersand special participating group members.
It is understood between the parties that the Company will, retroactive to April 1, 1994, provide members with a vision care benefitso long as the cost of that benefit to the Company is offset by an equal amount of savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments. The vision care benefit shall be for the cost of prescription lenses, frames and contact lenses to a maximum of $100 every twenty-four (24) months for eligible members.
It is further understood that the Company will provide a pension window affording employees who have attained 55 years of age and 30 years of service to retire without penalty during the calendar years 1994, 1995 and 1996. The pension window provided for the calendar years 1995 and 1996 will be provided only if the savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments exceeds the combined cost of the vision care benefit and the yearly cost of the pension window.
For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the expression "savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments" shall be defined to mean the reduced Company costs that can be established as being solely attributableto the Company being the secondary rather than the primary payer for drugs covered under Article 13.04 (c) of the CollectiveAgreement(hereinafterreferredto as'savings"). Savings shall include savings related to all bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired), and the cost of the vision care benefits shall be based on the cost required to extend the benefit to all such bargaining and non-bargaining
163
2
unit personnel (both active and retired). The cost of the pension window shall be determined on the basis of the cost of extending the pension window only to personnel employed in the bargaining units covered by the terms of this Letter of Understanding.
The Company will review the savings that are available following each calendar quarter during the years of 1994,1995 and 1996 to determine if there are sufficient savings available to provide the vision care benefit and the pension windows. Savings may be carried forward from quarter to quarter within a calendar year, but shall not be carried forward from one calendar year to the next.
The cost of the pension window will be amortized over a 15-year period starting with the calendar year in which each electing employee retires. If there are insufficient savings available to fund the pension window for all employees who elect to retire in either 1995 or 1996, then the pension window will be offered to employees in the order in which they have filed their written request to retire in accordance with the terms of the pension window.
The cost of the pension window will be as determined from time to time by the actuary appointed by the Company under the terms of the Revised Retirement Pension Plan for Employees of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited and Its Designated Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies. The actuary’s decision shall be final, provided that it is made in good faith and in accordance with the principles and assumptions utilized to value the pension plan as a whole.
In light of the costs that the Company will incur in funding the pension window during the 15-year period over which the additional costs are amortized, there will be no obligation on the Company to purchase any additional benefits or to make any concessions related to any subsequent savings other than those set forth herein.
