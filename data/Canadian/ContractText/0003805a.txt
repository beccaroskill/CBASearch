Dear Wilt:
It is apparent from your comments over the last several months that the job security of your members is <£ paramount importance to you. We, too, are concerned about the livelihood of our employees.
There ate, of course, many factors which affectjobs. The seasonal nature of forest products operations, technological change, the needs of our mill operations, and the cost effectiveness (competitiveness) in harvesting and transporting wood from our limit are all factors we must consider.
It is this last factor which we collectively have influence over. What we require to help secure our future is cost competitive wood ifrom our limit for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 (term of this contract) and beyond.
Against this backdrop, I do not foresee a need nor do I intend to employ a third-party contractor on our wood limit to supply the Terrace Bay mill.
I trust that these comments will provide you with the assurance you sought.

APPENDIX A

Mr, Wilfred McIntyre Local 2693 • IWA Canada Lakehead Labour Centre P.O. Box 2384 Thunder Bay, Ontario P7B SE9
Dear Wilf:
It is apparent from your comments over the last several months that the job security of your members Is of paramount importance to you. V\fe, too, are concerned about the livelihood of our employees.
There are, of course, many factors which affect jobs. The seasonal nature of forest products operations, technological change, the needs of our mill operations, and the cost effectiveness (competitiveness) in harvesting and transporting wood from our limit are all factors we must consider.
It is this last factor which we collectively have influence over. What we require to help secure our future is cost competitive wood from our limitfor the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 (term of this contract) and beyond.
Against this backdrop, I do not foresee a need nor do I intend to employ a third-party contractor on our wood limit to supply the Terrace Bay mill.
I trust that these comments will provide you with the assurance you sought.
Yours Truly,
R.C, Taylor
President & General Manager RCT:cb
