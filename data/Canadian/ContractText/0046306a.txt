TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
Employee Health & Welfare Insurance Benefits
This letter sets forth the basis on which the Company agrees, during the term of our current Collective Agreement, to pay the cost of employee health and welfare insurance benefits,
The Company will pay the premium cost of the accident and sickness plan underwritten by the Prudential Insurance Company of America for employees who have completed their probationary period and otherwise have fulfilled the eligibility requirements of the underwriter. Effective March 1, 1991, benefits will be sixty six and two-thirds percent of the employee’s earnings which are insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act. An insured employee will be eligible for benefits from the first day of absence, due to a nonoccupational accident and from the fourth day (first day if hospitalized during the waiting period) where the absence is due to a bona fide sickness. The benefit will be payable for a maximum period of twenty-six weeks.
Effective July 1,1997, the Company will pay the premium cost of $24,000 of group life insurance underwritten with the same amount for accidental death and dismemberment for employees who have completed their probationary period and otherwise fulfilled the eligibility requirements of the underwriter. Effective November I J997, the life insurance coverage will increase to $26,000.
The Company agrees to pay the premium cost of the present major medical plan (excluding drugs) $25/50 deductible and a prescription drug plan with a deductible of $10 for the insured employee and $10 for his dependents.
The Company will pay the premium cost of a dental insurance plan for employees who have completed their probationary period and otherwise qualify and for their eligible dependents. Such dental plan will provide benefits equivalent to the basic blue cross plan #7. Effective July 1,1997, benefits will be paid on the basis of the 1995 Ontario Dental Association schedule. Effective November 1,1997, the 1996 O.D.A. Schedule will apply.
18
The Company will pay the premium cost of a long term disability insurance plan for eligible employees who have completed the probationary period. The disability benefit under the plan shall be 55% of basic earnings, excluding overtime or other premium to a maximum of $1,400 per month effective November 1,1991 increased to $1,500 effective November 1, 1995. No benefits are payable for the first twenty-six weeks of disability or the period of time during which disability benefits are payable under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Canada Pension Plan and other legislated benefits shall be integrated with the long term disability benefit.
It is understood that payment of these insurance premiums by the Company is in lieu of any employee entitlement to future premium reduction under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
The Company will pay the premium for the semi-private hospital plan for eligible employees and their eligible dependents. The maximum daily benefit of this plan effective July 1,1997 is $110.00.
It is understood that payment by the Company of Group Life, hospital, medical-surgical, major medical, drug, dental and weekly benefits insurance premiums, as described, is conditional upon the employee performing work for the Company during the month in which the premiums fall due. It is understood that in cases of bona-fide sickness or accident, premiums will be paid for three months beyond the month in which the employee last worked, except where the law requires otherwise (i.e. Workers’ Compensation).
The Company may elect, at some future date, to transfer the underwriting and/or administration of one or more of these benefit plans to another insurance carrier with the understanding that in this event, the benefits that will be provided by the new carrier will be similar or substantially similar to those in effect at this date.
Would you please indicate the Union’s concurrence with this understanding by countersigning the duplicate copy of this letter and return it to the Company.
Yours very truly, MASTERFEEDS, A DIVISION
