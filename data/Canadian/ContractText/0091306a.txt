AGREEMENT
BETWEEN:
WESTERN GLOVE WORKS LTD.,
hereinafter referred to as the “Company”,
AND
UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 832,
chartered by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, hereinafter referred to as the “Union”.
WHEREAS: THE COMPANY AND THE UNION DESIRE TO COOPERATE IN ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING CONDITIONS WHICH WILL PROMOTE THE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE OPERATION OF THE COMPANY, IMPROVE QUALITY, ELIMINATE WASTE AND UNNECESSARY EXPENSE AND AVOIDABLE DELAYS IN PRODUCTION, MAINTAIN HARMONIOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND FACILITATE THE AMICABLE SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES;
NOW, THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND THE UNION MUTUALLY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
11
ARTICLE 1 NATURE OF THE BARGAINING UNIT
1.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the bargaining unit defined in Certificate No. MLB-313 dated July 4, 1951 which is recognized as including all employees of the Company employed at 555 Logan Avenue and 300 Princess Street, in the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, and excluding mechanics, maintenance personnel, quality control personnel, laundry technical personnel, fabric personnel, product development personnel, office staff, office clerical staff, plant clerical staff, sales staff, retail staff, supervisors, those above the rank of supervisor and those excluded by The Labour Relations Act (Manitoba). If the Company moves from 555 Logan Avenue and/or 300 Princess Street to another location in Manitoba, this Agreement will apply mutatis mutandis to the employees at that new location except where the employees at that new location are covered by another Manitoba Labour Board certificate or another collective bargaining agreement.
1.02	The Union and the employees recognize and agree that in order to provide maximum opportunities for continued employment and in order to continue to provide good wages and working conditions, the Company must always be in a strong competitive market position. This means that the Company must always provide the highest quality
12
products and services at the lowest possible cost. Therefore, the Union and the employees also acknowledge that at all times, subject to the express terms of this Agreement, the Company must be able to improve the quality of workmanship, products and services, eliminate waste of materials, supplies and time, conserve and protect materials, supplies, equipment and facilities and do such other things as may be reasonably required to promote efficient and productive operations.
1.03	Once every three (3) calendar months the Company will provide the Union with a list containing the current names, addresses, telephone numbers and rates of pay of all employees. The onus is on each employee to keep the Company advised of his current address and telephone number.
ARTICLE 2 DEFINITIONS
2.01 The word “employee” or “employees” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean those employees of the Company for whom the Union is the bargaining agent as set forth in Article 1.01 and who are covered by the terms of this Agreement.
(a)	The words “temporary employees” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean an employee who is hired to meet seasonal or
------------------- 13 ---------------------
peak period demand or as a replacement for a regular employee who is on vacation, on Workers Compensation or on an approved leave of absence and whose service will be of a limited duration and in any event of not more than three (3) consecutive months. A temporary employee shall have no rights under the seniority provisions of this Agreement. However, if a temporary employee remains in the Company’s employ beyond three (3) consecutive months, or if he is offered permanent full-time employment prior to that date, he shall thereupon cease to be a temporary employee and shall be then regarded as a regular employee. In such a case, service as a temporary employee shall be credited to his most recent date of hire.
No employee will work less than his full week’s work because of temporary employees performing his normal work and no temporary employee will be hired while there are regular employees on layoff who are immediately available to perform the work and who have the qualifications and skill to perform the work in an efficient manner.
(b)	The employment of an employee hired as a temporary employee shall automatically terminate at the expiry of the available work for which the employee was hired, the stipulated term or upon return of the
-------------------- 14 ------------------------
absent permanent employee whichever is the lesser. An employee hired as a temporary employee shall be advised at the time of his hiring of his temporary status and the estimated duration of his employment and the Union shall be informed in writing of same.
(c)	Temporary employees shall not have access to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 10 or to the arbitration provisions set forth in Article 11 in the event of discharge or layoff.
2.03	Whenever the singular or masculine terms are used in this Agreement, they shall also mean the plural or feminine terms where the context so requires.
2.04	The words “probationary employees” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean those employees referred to in Article 6.
2.05	The words “piece work average rate of pay” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean the average hourly rate of pay earned by an employee working piece work during the most recent three (3) calendar month period as set forth below preceding the date of application of the piece work average rate of pay under this Agreement during which the employee worked a minimum of two hundred and forty (240) hours on piece work. If an employee has not worked a minimum of two hundred and forty (240) hours on piece work in each of the two (2)
15
immediately preceding three (3) calendar month periods, then that employee will be paid the guarantee rate of pay, unless he has not worked the minimum two hundred and forty (240) hours on piece work in each of the two (2) immediately preceding three (3) calendar month periods because he has been absent due to an authorized leave of absence or because he has been transferred by the Company in circumstances where his rate of pay has been maintained pursuant to Article 8.01, in which event the Company and the Union will agree on a piece work average rate of pay for that employee for the current three (3) calendar month period and failing agreement, a grievance may be filed in accordance with Article 10 with respect to the rate. The piece work average rate of pay is calculated based on the number of hours actually worked by an employee on piece work in the three (3) calendar month period divided into the total piece work earnings, exclusive of any and all overtime pay, supplementary pay or premium pay of any kind, of that employee for those hours during that three (3) calendar month period.
The three (3) calendar month periods shall be from the beginning of the pay period beginning closest to the fifteenth (15th) day of December to the end of the pay period ending closest to the fourteenth (14th) day of March, from the beginning of the pay period beginning closest to the fifteenth (15th) day of March to the end of the pay period ending closest to the fourteenth (14th) day of June, from the beginning of the pay period beginning
16
closest to the fifteenth (15th) day of June to the end of the pay period ending closest to the fourteenth (14th) day of September and from the beginning of the pay period beginning closest to the fifteenth (15th) day of September to the end of the pay period ending closest to the fourteenth (14th) day of December.
2.06	The words “guarantee rate of pay” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean the greater
Of:
(a)	the applicable statutory minimum wage rates in effect from time to time in Manitoba plus fifteen (150) cents; and
(b)	five dollars and sixty ($5.60) cents,
minus the supplementary pay referred to in Article
20.07	for employees working piece work who have not completed six (6) months of continuous service with the Company since their most recent date of hire.
2.07	The words “regular hourly rate of pay” and “piece work average rate of pay” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean at any time with respect to any employee that straight time rate of pay per hour or piece work average rate of pay per hour as the case may be, exclusive of any and all overtime pay, supplementary pay or premium pay of any kind, to which such employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement in respect of the work which he is performing at such time.
17
2.08	The word “department” whenever used in this Agreement shall mean one of the following:
1.	Product Development
2.	Cutting
3.	Sewing Preparation
4.	Sewing Assembly
5.	Sew Finishing
6.	Wet Processing
(includes Laundry and Sandblast)
7.	Finishing
8.	Distribution
9.	Trim
together with such other additional departments as the Company may from time to time establish.

3.02	Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Union acknowledges that the Company has the sole and exclusive right to operate and manage its business, affairs and facilities; to con-
18
trol and direct the working forces and to select, hire, promote, demote, transfer, assign, classify, lay off and recall employees; to maintain order, discipline and efficiency and to discipline and discharge employees for just cause; to establish, alter and enforce from time to time reasonable rules, regulations, policies and practices to be observed by employees; to establish new jobs and to alter, consolidate or abolish existing jobs; to determine the number and type of employees needed at any time, the hours and shifts to be worked, the duties to be performed, overtime requirements, job content, quality and quantity standards of performance and the qualifications of employees to perform any particular job; to subcontract work; and to determine the hours and schedules of operation, operating techniques, methods, procedures and processes and means of performing work, the facilities and services to be provided, the materials, supplies, tools, machinery, equipment and facilities to be used, the nature and kind of business conducted, the number, location and types of operations and the extension, limitation, curtailment or cessation of operations or any part thereof.
3.03	The Company agrees that it will not exercise its functions in a manner inconsistent with the express terms of this Agreement and in that regard, in administering this Agreement, the Company shall act reasonably, fairly, in good faith and in a manner consistent with the Agreement as a whole.
19

The Company will keep the Union informed of the name of the Director of Operations or his/her designate if the Director of Operations is unavailable.
4.02	Whenever possible, meetings between an employee and a Union Representative shall take place on the rest period or meal period of the employee or immediately prior to or immediately following the scheduled work period of the employee.

4.03	Discussions between the Union Representative and the employee shall be held in private so as to not distract other employees. The Company will designate the location of any meeting between an employee and a Union Representative. In no event
20
shall the admission of the Union Representatives or their meetings with employees interfere with or disrupt operations.
4.04	The Union shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the names of the three (3) Union Representatives and any changes thereto. The Company will not recognize an individual as a Union Representative until it has received such notification from the Union.
ARTICLE 5
UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DEDUCTION OF UNION DUES
5.01	All employees hired or rehired on or after the date of ratification of this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, apply for membership in the Union within ten (10) calendar days from the date of hire or rehire and once membership is granted by the Union, such employees shall continue to be members of the Union for the duration of this Agreement.
5.02	The Company agrees to forward Exhibit One, as attached to this Agreement, duly completed, to the Union within ten (10) calendar days from the date of hire or rehire of an employee. The Union shall bear the expense of printing and mailing Exhibit One.
21
5.03	Once each calendar month the Company will provide the Union with a list containing the names and social insurance numbers of all employees who have terminated their employment during the previous calendar month.
5.04	The Company will deduct from the wages of each employee such Union dues, initiation fees and assessments as are authorized by regular and proper vote of the membership of the Union.
The Company agrees to deduct Union dues and/or initiation fees and/or assessments from the first paycheque of any new employee provided the employee has worked, or received pay, for more than forty (40) hours during the first pay period. If a new employee has worked less than forty (40) hours during the first pay period, the Company shall deduct only the initiation fee with respect to that employee. Thereafter, the amount of Union dues set by the Union from time to time shall be deducted from each subsequent paycheque of employees regardless of the amount of hours worked during any pay period subsequent to the first pay period, as long as the employee remains a member of the bargaining unit.
5.05	The Company will remit monthly the total sum of the amount so deducted to the Union on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the calendar month following the month in which the deductions were made, together with a list of the names and social insurance numbers of the employees from
22
whose wages the deductions have been made and the amounts so deducted from each employee’s wages.
5.06	The Union shall advise the Company in writing of the amount of Union dues, initiation fees and assessments to be deducted from the wages of employees and shall notify the Company in writing of any change in such amounts to be deducted at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the end of the pay period in which the deductions are to be made.
5.07	Each year the Company shall calculate the amount of Union dues deducted from each employee’s pay and shall indicate same on the T-4 slip of each employee by no later than February 28.
5.08	The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the Company from any and all claims, demands, actions, proceedings and any other form of liability or expense arising out of or in respect of deductions made by the Company from the wages of any employee pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5, except where the Company has failed to make deductions in accordance with the foregoing.
23
ARTICLE 6
PROBATIONARY PERIOD
6.01	A newly hired employee shall be on probation for thirty (30) days of actual work with the Company since his most recent date of hire. The Company may discipline or discharge an employee at any time during his probationary period and neither the employee nor the Union on his behalf shall have any recourse to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 10 or to the arbitration provisions set forth in Article 11. The discipline or discharge of a probationary employee shall be deemed to have been for just cause. After completion of the probationary period, seniority shall be established and shall be effective from the most recent date of hire.
7.01	The Union and the employees agree that during the term of this Agreement they will not cause, condone or engage in any strike, sympathy strike, slowdown, sitdown, stoppage, picketing or interruptions of any kind which would in any way restrict, disrupt, limit or otherwise interfere with the quality or quantity of work or production.

ARTICLE 8
TRANSFER FROM ONE OPERATION TO ANOTHER
8.01	When the Company requires an employee working on piece work to transfer from his normal operation to another operation, the employee’s piece work average rate of pay will be maintained during the transfer for a maximum of four (4) calendar weeks providing that:
(a)	at the time of the transfer the employee had sufficient work at his normal operation:
(b)	the transfer is not of a seasonal type which is normal to the operation of the Company;
(c)	the transfer is not made as a result of change-overs in types of garments being made by the Company; and
(d)	the transfer is not to one of the employee’s other established operations.
8.02	When there is no work available at his normal operation, an employee working piece work may, at the time of transfer, reject a transfer to another operation where he would not be paid his piece work average rate of pay and thereby elect to go home, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 8.
8.03	In case of dissatisfaction with the work assigned or the transfer made, employees must continue to do such work as is assigned or to which
25
they have been transferred, but may grieve in the manner set forth in Article 10 and the procedure therein provided for shall then be followed so that the grievance may be heard and adjudicated upon through the procedure provided in Article 11.
8.04	Whenever there is a breach of any of the provisions of this Article 8 by an employee, no negotiations shall take place and no complaints shall be heard or adjudicated upon until all employees who have committed such breach are back to work in the usual manner, unless the employee and his immediate supervisor otherwise agree.
8.05	Wages earned on piece work shall not be used to cover work performed on time work and vice versa. An employee must immediately clock out whenever there is a change in the method by which he is paid and he must have that clock out immediately verified by his immediate supervisor. Employees who have an operation which normally provides less than the normal hours of work each day will be granted a second available operation whenever reasonably possible in an attempt to provide the normal hours of work each day. Operational Seniority shall prevail with respect to the assignment of a second available operation provided the senior employee possesses the qualifications and skill to perform the available operation in an efficient manner and to the satisfaction of the Company.
8.06	When an employee is transferred from one (1) operation/ classification/ department to another, s/he shall retain his/her Operational Seniority/
------------------------- 26 ---------------------------
Departmental Seniority in the operations/classifica-tion/department from which s/he was transferred for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days. Following one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days, if the transfer remains in effect, the employee’s full Operational Seniority/ Departmental Seniority will be transferred to the new operation/ classification/ department and s/he shall cease to have any Operational/Departmental Seniority in the operation/classification/department from which s/he was transferred.
Note: Article 8.06 will be applied by the Company to current employees as of the date of ratification of this Agreement, will be applied to both employees working piece work and hourly paid employees and will be applied retroactively to December 15, 1994 for all current employees who have been transferred since December 15, 1994, from one operation to another and who, in accordance with the current Article 8.06 did not have their seniority transferred.
8.07	Hourly paid employees assigned by the Company to a higher paying classification for more than one (1) work day will receive the higher hourly rate of pay for all time worked in the higher paying classification. Hourly paid employees assigned by the Company to a lower paying classification for less than four (4) calendar weeks will not have their hourly rate of pay reduced for all such time worked.
8.08	Any employee who relieves a person outside the bargaining unit for more than one (1) work
27
day will receive, in addition to his/her regular hourly rate of pay/piece work average rate of pay an additional fifty (5O0) cents per hour for all such relief time worked outside the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE 9
SHOP STEWARDS AND UNION ACTIVITIES
9.01	The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint not more than seventeen (17) employees as Shop Stewards. The Union shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the names of the Shop Stewards and any changes thereto. The Company will not recognize an employee as a Shop Steward until it has received such notification from the Union.
9.02	There shall be no Union activity of any kind on Company time or property unless such activity is specifically permitted by this Agreement. No meetings of the Union or its members shall be held on Company property at any time without the prior written approval of the Director of Operations or his designate except as specifically provided for in this Agreement. Shop Stewards shall perform their regular work assignments and shall engage in no Union related activity whatsoever during working hours except as specifically provided for in Article 9.03.
28
9.03	To ensure operations are not interfered with or disrupted, the parties agree that whenever possible the Shop Stewards shall conduct their activities outside regular working hours. In a grievance situation which requires a Shop Steward’s attention during working hours, he shall not leave his regular duties without first obtaining permission to do so from his immediate supervisor. It is understood that the taking of such time away from regular duties shall be kept to a minimum and that permission will not, therefore, be unreasonably withheld. Shop Stewards shall report to the supervisor of the area visited before contacting any employee in that area and shall return to their regular duties as expeditiously as possible. The Company reserves the right to limit such time if the time requested is unreasonable. Abuse of leave or excessive use of time spent adjusting grievances shall not be permitted and in no event shall the adjustment of grievances interfere with or disrupt operations. Subject to the foregoing, a Shop Steward shall be paid at his regular hourly rate of pay/his piece work average rate of pay for the time spent investigating or presenting a grievance during his regular working hours.
9.04	Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees that no employee shall be discriminated against for exercising his rights under the terms of this Agreement.
9.05	Shop Stewards shall be allowed to wear their Shop Steward’s badge while on duty.
29
ARTICLE 10 ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
10
10.01	The Company and the Union agree that grievances shall be adjusted as quickly as possible in the manner set out herein and without suspension, interruption or disruption of the normal operations of the Company.
10.02	A “grievance” shall mean a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company, the Union or an employee may present a grievance.
10.03	All employees have the right to express to management any complaint they may have concerning any matter related to their work or general welfare.
10.04	No employee shall have a grievance until he, or a Shop Steward or a Union Representative on his behalf, has first given his immediate supervisor the opportunity to settle the complaint.
10.05	If such informal discussion does not result in a satisfactory adjustment of the employee’s complaint, an earnest effort shall be made to settle the grievance in the following manner:
STEP 1 The grievance shall be submitted in writing to the Director of Operations or his designate within fourteen (14) calendar
30
days immediately following the event or circumstance giving rise to the grievance. Any grievance which is not presented within fourteen (14) calendar days shall be forfeited and waived by the aggrieved party. The Director of Operations or his designate shall reply to the grievance in writing within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance. If a satisfactory settlement has not been reached, or if the Director of Operations or his designate has failed to reply in writing within the five (5) calendar days, then the employee, the Shop Steward or the Union Representative may proceed to Step 2.
The nature of the grievance, the article or articles of this Agreement alleged to have been violated and the remedy sought shall all be clearly set out in the grievance.
STEP 2 Failing satisfactory settlement at Step 1, the employee shall meet with the Director of Operations or his/her designate, together with a Shop Steward and/or Union Representative, to discuss the grievance within the next fourteen (14) calendar days. The Director of Operations or his/her designate shall render his/her decision in writing within seven (7) calendar days after the meet-

11.04	The arbitrator shall receive and consider such material evidence and contentions as the parties may offer and shall make such independent
33

34
the Province of Manitoba Conciliation Services. In the event the costs of the mediator are not borne by the Province of Manitoba, the expenses and fees of the mediator shall be borne equally by the parties to the arbitration proceedings.
ARTICLE 12 HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
12.01	The provisions of this Article 12 are intended to define the normal hours of work for the purpose of calculating payment for authorized overtime and nothing in this Article or this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of or a limitation upon the hours of work per day or per week or of days of work per week, nor as a guarantee of work schedules.
12.02	The normal work week shall consist of forty, (40) hours to be worked in five (5) consecutive days, eight (8) hours each day, during the period Monday to Friday inclusive (currently Monday to Sunday inclusive for those employees working in the laundry). Hours paid for a holiday as referred to in Article 18 on which an employee does not work shall be considered as hours worked when calculating weekly overtime.
The Company will give to each affected employee and to the Union as much advance notice as is practicable in the circumstances before imple-
35
menting shift schedules in excess of eight (8) hours in one (1) day. The requirements and efficiency of operations must necessitate the implementation of such schedules and such schedules must not be implemented in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner. The Company will consult with the Union before implementing such schedules and will give careful consideration to any recommendations which the Union may have with respect to the implementation of such schedules provided, however, that if the Union does not agree with the implementation of such schedules, a grievance may be filed in accordance with Article 10 and failing settlement, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 11.
12.03	Overtime is recognized as being voluntary but if there are insufficient qualified volunteers immediately available to do the required work, then the Company will require employees to work the overtime which will be assigned to employees immediately available who have the qualifications and skill to perform the work in an efficient manner.

Whenever the Company requires overtime work to be performed, the Union and the employees must cooperate fully whenever possible.

12.06	All hours worked by an hourly paid employee on a Saturday which is her/her regularly scheduled day of rest shall be considered overtime and the employee shall be paid one and one-half (1 l/2) times his/her regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked by him/her on the Saturday unless the employee is absent without valid reason during any part of his/her regularly scheduled work week, in which event s/he shall only be paid overtime for those hours worked by him/her in excess of his/her normal hours of work in any one (1) week. All hours worked by an employee working piece work
37
on a Saturday which is his/her regularly scheduled day of rest shall be considered overtime and the employee shall be paid his/her piece work earnings plus one-half (l/2) of his/her piece work average rate of pay and one-half (l/2) of the supplementary pay referred to in Article 20.07 for all hours worked by him/her on the Saturday unless the employee is absent without valid reason during any part of his/her regularly scheduled work week, in which event s/he shall only be paid overtime for those hours worked by him/her in excess of his/her normal hours of work in any one (1) week. For the purposes of this Article 12.06, “valid reason” shall be absence for a compelling and satisfactory reason or any authorized leave of absence under this Agreement. If the reason for the absence is illness or injury, the employee must, if requested to do so by the Company, provide to the Company satisfactory medical evidence that s/he was unable to work due to illness or injury in order to have a valid reason for the absence.
12.07	All hours worked by an hourly paid employee on a day observed as a holiday in accordance with Article 18 shall be considered overtime and paid for at two (2) times the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay.

38
he would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Article 18 had he not worked on the holiday.
12.08	In the event an hourly paid employee works seven (7) consecutive days, he shall be paid two (2) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked by him on the seventh (7 th) day.

(7 th) day.

12.11	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, should the majority of affected employees voting on the issue and the Company desire to have hours banked in order to have up to four (4) additional days (or such other number of days as may be mutually agreeable) off between December 24 and January 2, inclusive, the Company will advise the Union by September 30 as to which Saturdays will be worked by which
39
employees at regular hourly rates of pay/piece work average rates of pay, according to (i), (ii) or (iii) below:
(i)	the first four (4) Saturdays following

13.01	When an employee is required to report for work and does report for work, he shall be guaranteed a minimum of four (4) consecutive hours of work or four (4) hours of pay at his regular hourly rate of pay/piece work average rate of pay unless he
40

This Article 13.01 shall not apply when work is not available due to an act of God, power shortage, lack of material, machinery or equipment breakdown or other reasons beyond the reasonable control of the Company. To qualify for payment under this provision, employees must have their current telephone number on tile with the Company.
13.02	An employee must immediately clock out and report to his immediate supervisor when the machine he is using is not in suitable working order or has broken down, in which case the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay/piece work average rate of pay shall be paid for the loss of time after the first fifteen (15) minutes waiting time and until such time as alternate work, if any, is assigned to him or he is sent home, except that there shall be no fifteen (15) minute waiting time when the employee immediately begins working on another machine. When the machine is repaired or the employee is assigned alternate work, he must immediately clock in and have his immediate supervisor verify both the time he clocked out and the time he clocked in.
13.03	When an employee is required to move to another machine of the same type on a temporary basis while the machine he normally works with is being repaired, the temporary machine shall be serviced (thread, etc.) to enable the employee to continue to earn his regular hourly rate of pay/piece work average rate of pay.

(a)	Operational Seniority in this Agreement is defined as applying within a single operation (e.g., J-stitching, side seaming, bar tacking, bar tack loops, etc.) for an employee working piece work and within a single classification for an hourly paid employee;
(b)	Departmental Seniority in this Agreement is defined as applying to all employees working in one (1) of the departments referred to in Article 2.08.

43
Agreement since his/her most recent date of hire, as well as showing each employee’s Operational Seniority and Departmental Seniority. An up-to-date seniority list will be posted by the Company once every three (3) calendar months and a copy of the posted list will be mailed by the Company to the Union. An employee will be permitted a period of ten (10) working days following the posting of any seniority list to protest in writing to the Company any alleged omission or incorrect listing, but such protest shall be confined to errors or changes occurring subsequent to the posting of the immediately preceding seniority list. Where an employee is absent due to holiday, illness or approved leave, the ten (10) working day time limit for that employee shall run from the date of his/her return to work. In the event an employee does not file a protest within the time limits stipulated, then the seniority list shall be considered as correct, accepted and final as regards the employee. Any timely protest filed by an employee which is not settled can be taken up as a grievance under Article 10 of this Agreement.

(f)	he retires; or
(g)	he takes employment elsewhere while on an authorized leave of absence; or
(h)	he fails to report for work at the expiration of an approved leave of absence, a vacation or a suspension, unless he provides a compelling and satisfactory reason.

are immediately available to perform the work and who have the qualifications and skill to perform the work in an efficient manner.
(b) Notice of recall to an employee who has been laid off shall be made by registered mail to his last known address, the onus being on the employee to keep the Company advised of his current address.
(c)	Union Stewards shall be the last employees laid off in each department and the first employees recalled in each department provided they have the qualifications and skill
