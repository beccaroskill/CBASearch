5
complaint arising out of the interpretation, application or alleged violation of this agreement shall be dealt with in the following manner.
Step
The employee shall take the grievance up with his Department Shop Steward who, with or without the aggrieved employee, shall discuss the grievance with the Foreman concerned. The Chief Steward may accompany the Department Steward in this step. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached within twenty-four (24) hours, the matter shall be progressed to Step 2.
Step
The Grievance Committee shall take the matter up, in writing, with the Production Manager, and if following this stage, the grievance is not settled to the satisfaction of the employee(s) concerned within twenty-four (24) hours, or within any longer period of time which may be mutually agreed to between the two parties, the grievance shalt be progressed to Step 3.
Step
a.	The grievance shall then be taken up at a meeting of the Grievance Committee, the General Manager, or in his absence his designate, at which meeting a Representative or his nominee of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union may be present if his presence is requested by either the Company or the Union.

c.	If, at Step 3, a settlement to the satisfaction of both parties is not achieved, then either party may, within a further twenty-five (25) working days, request that the grievance be referred to a Board of Arbitration referred to in Article 10.
4.	General
a.	A grievance to be accepted must be initiated by or on behalf of an aggrieved employee in respect to a specific action of which there is a complaint within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of the action. A grievance submitted by the Grievance Committee shall be processed commencing at Step 2 of the procedure.

6
from among its regular staff, a reasonable number of stewards to assist employees in presenting their grievances to the representative of the Company. The Union will supply the Company with a list of Steward.

A claim by an employee that he has been unjustly discharged from his employment shall be treated as a grievance if a written statement of such grievance is lodged with the Company office within three (3) working days after the employee ceases to work for the Company. All preliminary steps of the grievance procedure prior to Step 2 will be omitted in such cases. Such special grievance
7
may be settled by confirming the Management’s action in dismissing the employee, or by reinstating the employee with full compensation for time lost, or by any other arrangement which is just and equitable in the opinion of the conferring parties.

ARTICLE 11 - SENIORITY
1.	a. Until an employee has completed sixty (60) days of actual work with the Company,
accumulated over a continuous period of six (6) months, he shall be considered a probationary employee. Commencing with the forty-first (41) day or employment, (i.e. the day after he has completed 40 days of actual work in the Company’s employ) an employee shall be granted seniority retroactive to the initial date of hiring and his name shall be entered on the seniority list as a regular employee. If there is doubt about an employee being able to qualify during the probationary period, his probationary period may be extended by an additional twenty (20) days of actual work by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union Negotiating Committee. Any further extension of the Probation Period of up to a maximum of twenty (20) working days may be mutually agreed upon between the Company and the Union Negotiating Committee.
b.	Seniority shall be divided into two categories, i.e.
(i)	Plant seniority: which shall be an employee’s accumulated over-all service in the Company’s employ. The Company and the Union agree that the principle of Plant Seniority shall apply in situations where seniority is a consideration unless specifically stated otherwise.
(ii)	Departmental seniority: which shall be the accumulated seniority of an employee in a department. Department seniority shall prevail in the jobs listed in Clause 5(c). After ninety (90) days the Departmental Seniority begins in the department where the employee is working retroactive to the date the employee began working in that department.
Temporary transfers of less than ninety (90) days shall not break the continuity of the seniority of an employee in the department to which he returns.
2.	With the exception of the jobs listed in Article 11, Clause 5.C., in the event of any reduction in the working force or lay off, probationary employees shall be laid off before any employees with seniority are laid off. No employees shall be on lay off status while a junior employee is employed, subject to the senior employee having the immediate
9
qualifications and being capable of satisfactorily performing the work available. If there is any disagreement between the Company and the Union regarding an employee’s qualifications or capabilities, the matter shall be discussed an if there is still a reasonable doubt, a trial period of up to thirty (30) days of actual work shall then be permitted.
3.	Subject to all other conditions of this seniority article of the agreement, when reducing or increasing staff, the Company and the Union agree that the principle of plant seniority shall govern. The last laid off shall be the first rehired and the first rehired shall be the last laid off. In cases of recall from layoff, the Company shall have met its obligations under this article if it has attempted to reach the employee by phone as per the telephone numbers posted on the Seniority List, or given to the Company in confidence. It will be the employee’s responsibility to advise the Company if they are available at some different telephone numbers. The Company agrees that in the event of a temporary lay off, reasonable notice will be given to the employee whenever possible. The tentative production schedule for the following week will be posted on Thursday, p.m. Employees for periods of less than forty-five (45) days temporarily laid off or transferred from their position shall retain their rate of pay and shall revert back to their former position once such position becomes available.
4.	The Company shall maintain and post every three (3) months, a Plant seniority list, and in addition, a Departmental seniority list for each of the following departments: Flour Mill, Bakery, Packing Room, Warehouse, Maintenance and Elevator.
5.	All vacancies shall be posted for a period of forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturdays Sundays, and Statutory Holidays, so that employees desiring the vacant job may apply. The Union shall be informed within ten (10) working days, after close of applications, who the successful applicant is.
Filling of vacancies shall be based on qualifications, ability and seniority. Vacancies will be filled in the following manner:
a.	The regular position department employees with Plant Seniority in the department in which the vacancies occur, and who apply on the posting, will be awarded the job.
b.	Should there be no applicants from within the department in which a vacancy occurs then the job will be awarded to the senior applicant applying on the posting.
If there is any disagreement between the Company and the Union regarding a senior applicant’s qualifications or ability the same trial procedure shall be followed as is outlined in Clause 2, above.
If at the end of thirty (30) actual working days, an employee is not satisfied with his new job, he shall be returned to his former position, or if at the end of thirty
10
(30) actual working days the employee doesn’t prove satisfactory he will be returned to his former position.
c.	Vacancies in the position of millwrights, millwright trainee, and all lead hands, shall be filled on a departmental seniority basis.
6.	When it is necessary to move employees from one classification to another for a period of one week [five (5) working days] or less, the Supervisor in charge may make appointments in a manner most convenient to Plant efficiency and minimum disruption to the work schedules in effect at that time. Every consideration will be given to Plant seniority, but it will not necessarily follow that Plant seniority will be the governing factor.
7.	The seniority of an employee shall be considered broken and all seniority rights forfeited (including the Company’s obligation to rehire) for any of the following reasons:
a.	If the employee voluntarily quits.
b.	If the employee is discharged and is not reinstated pursuant to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
c.	If the employee is laid off and fails to report for work within Seven (7) calendar days of being requested to do so without furnishing a reasonable excuse for such failure to report or without securing leave-of-absence.
Leave of absence for reasonable cause, granted by the Company, shall not break the continuity of an employee’s seniority rights and an employee granted leave of absence shall return to the position held prior to the absence or to one of equal rating providing he is capable after a fair trial of handling the job.
Employees absent from work because of sickness or accident shall be obliged whenever it is reasonably possible to notify the Company their approximate length of absence.
8.	The Company will not be obliged to retain seniority records for employees who have been laid off for periods exceeding those listed below?
a.	Employees with two years or more service - two (2) years.
b.	Employees with less than two (2) years service - length of seniority, with a minimum of six (6) months.
Recognizing that the Company has no obligation to call in employees whose seniority records have been discontinued by reason of their lay off exceeding the above limits, it is nevertheless mutually agreed that, when hiring, consideration will be given to those employees who have previous experience and who make application for work; always
11
provided that ell employees with seniority are first rehired. ARTICLE 12 - LEAVE OF ABSENCE
1.	The Company may grant leave-of-absence, without pay, to any employee for legitimate personal reasons and any person who is absent with such written permission shall not be considered to be laid off, and his seniority shall continue to accumulate during his absence.
Union business will be considered a good cause for leave of absence and such leave of absence shall be granted by the Company, and seniority shall accumulate during such leave of absence. It is agreed that not more than one employee from any one department or a maximum of three employees from the Plant will be granted such leave of absence at any one time.
The Company agrees to notify the Secretary of the Union when extended leave of absence is granted to an employee. This does not apply when leave of absence is granted for anything up to a forty-eight (48) hour period.
2.	The maximum period for which leave of absence without pay may be granted shall be three (3) months except when the leave of absence is for the purpose of handling the affairs of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
3.	Should an employee fail to return to work at the expiry of his leave of absence or alternately fail to seek renewal of his leave of absence, he shall be considered to have terminated his employment with the Company.
