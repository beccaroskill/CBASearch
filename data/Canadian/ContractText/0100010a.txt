(a)	The Review Committee will be responsible for seeing that all requests for evaluation or re-evaluation of jobs are adequately and accurately documented before being passed to the Plywood Evaluation Committee for further action. The documents required will include a “Request for Job Evaluation” form submitted either by an individual employee or by local management, and a fully completed job description which provides sufficient information for the subsequent work of the Plywood Evaluation Committee. The form of the documents, the procedures for submitting and handling them, and the time limits for completion may be amended as required by the Plywood Evaluation Committee under the authority given them by Article 3 of this Supplement.
(b)	Decisions of the Review Committee respecting the appropriateness of a request for evaluation or re-evaluation, or respecting the adequacy and accuracy of documents, shall be by unanimous agreement. Failing such agreement within the established time limit, the Review Committee shall, at the request of any one of its members, immediately forward the Request for Job Evaluation, together with any other documents on which there is unanimous agreement, to the Plywood Evaluation Committee and shall then have no further responsibility for documenting that request.
96
(c)	When the Plywood Evaluation Committee has made a decision respecting the evaluation of a job, it shall communicate that decision to the appropriate Review Committee. The Review Committee will be responsible for informing management and the employees concerned, giving reasons for the outcome where these are available. A decision of the Review Committee that an Application for Job Evaluation should not be forwarded to the Plywood Evaluation Committee will, similarly, be communicated with reasons to those concerned.
(d)	Nothing in this Article limits the right of the Plywood Evaluation Committee to determine the facts about any job by direct observation or otherwise, or to amend any job description or specification submitted to them in support of a Request for Job Evaluation form.
6.	APPLICATION OF PROGRAM
The Job Evaluation Program shall apply to all employees in the Plywood Industry except Journeyman Tradesmen, Improvers, Helpers, Powerhouse and Boom Crews and Filer-Grindermen.
7.	DIRECTION OF WORK
Job evaluation descriptions are written with the intent to set forth the general duties and requirements of the job and shall not be construed as imposing any restriction on the right of the Company to assign duties to employees other than those specifically mentioned in job descriptions, provided always that if the assignment of such duties changes the job content sufficiently to justify a review of the evaluation the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall make such a review in accordance with the procedure set out herein.
97
8.
RE-EVALUATION
(a)	When a job has moved to another grade as a result of re-evaluation, the wage rate for the new grade shall be effective on the date that management or the employee has applied to the Review Committee for re-evaluation.
(b)	When a job is moved to a lower grade as a result of re-evaluation, the incumbent shall maintain his job rate as a red circle rate subject to the provisions of Paragraph 10 herein.
9.	NEW JOBS CREATED
Where the Company has exercised its right to create a new job, a temporary rate shall be set by management. The permanent rate for the said job as determined by the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall be effective as of the date the job was installed. If the evaluated rate for a new job is lower than the temporary rate, the incumbent(s) shall be allowed to continue at the temporary rate.
10.	RED CIRCLE JOBS
(a)	The Company shall supply the Union with a list of employees holding red circle jobs, the said list to include the name of the employee, name of job category filled, the evaluated rate for the job and the actual rate paid.
(b)	Employees on red circle rates who are promoted to a higher grade shall regain the red circle rate if subsequently found incompetent to continue in the higher grade.
98
(c)	Employees holding red circle jobs who are demoted during a reduction of forces, shall be paid only the evaluated rate for the job to which they are assigned. If at a later date an employee is reassigned to his former job he shall regain his red circle rate.
(d)	When the Company terminates a job, or a job is not occupied during a period of one (1) year, a record as to the cancellation of the applicable job description and classification shall be established.
(e)	If an employee is temporarily transferred at the request of the Company he shall retain his existing rate or receive the rate for the new job, whichever is higher. On return to his regular job the said employee shall regain his red circle rate.
11.	SENIORITY
(a)	Subject to the provisions herein set out, Article VIII (Seniority) shall continue to apply.
(b)	Promotions shall be made only where a vacancy exists.
12.	REFERRAL PROCEDURE
(a)	When the Plywood Evaluation Committee has decided the outcome of a Request for Job Evaluation, it shall transmit its decision to the appropriate Plant Job Review Committee.
99
(b)	An evaluation done by the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall be final and binding on the Parties but, at any time after five (5) years since the last evaluation or re-evaluation of a job, management or an individual employee may submit a request for re-evaluation of that job and no other reason than the elapsed time shall be necessary.
(c)	If the Plywood Evaluation Committee is unable to reach agreement regarding the disposition of a Request for Job Evaluation or any other matter regarding the job evaluation program which falls within their jurisdiction, the matter shall be referred to CONIFER and to United Steelworkers for settlement.
(d)	All communication between any Plant Review Committee and the Plywood Evaluation Committee referred to above shall be effected by sending one (1) copy to the Union representative or representatives on the Committee and one (1) copy to the employer representative or representatives. In the case of communications to a Plant Review Committee, the Union representatives will be addressed care of the office of the appropriate Union Local and the employer representative care of the Company’s offices at the plant.

PRINCE GEORGE, B.C.
Dear Sirs:
We wish to confirm our Agreement originally drawn up March 25th,
1955 for the duration of our present Agreement in regard to logging
contractors employed by the Company in the Quesnel area.
1.	We shall hold our uncertified logging contractors responsible to abide by the relevant provisions of the present Agreement, in particular as it regards wage scale, holiday pay and seniority clauses. Dues for all employees and a list of employees for whom dues are submitted must be submitted to the Local Union once a month, without application for Union membership.
2.	The seniority provisions are interpreted as follows:
a)	Men working for any contractors gather seniority on that operation only.
b)	If another contractor or ourselves takes over all or part of one operation, men whose jobs essentially continue under the new setup will retain their jobs and go on the new contractor’s seniority list as per the date they were hired by the previous contractor.
c)	If, due to layoff or reorganization of a show or for any other reason, a man’s job “disappears”, he has no claim to be transferred to any other logging show, the plywood mill or sawmill.
3.	The Company will encourage logging contractors to make reasonable arrangements to help compensate for travelling were no camp is provided.
123
USW LOCAL 1-424, Prince George July 1,1991 Page 2
4.	New wage categories paid or negotiated by our contractors (i.e. categories other than or higher than set out in our Agreement) bind us (or future contractors) only if they have been approved by an Officer of West Fraser Mills.
5.	The Company agreed to notify the USW as regards the commencement date of new logging shows.
Yours truly,

Attention: Gordon Gray
Dear Sir:
Re: Agreement on New and Evolving Work
This letter is intended to clarify the United Steelworker’s intent with regard to the terms and conditions of the Letter of Understanding in 1994 negotiations on New and Evolving Work.
During discussions on this, the Industry raised concerns that we answer as follows:
1.	It is not the intention of United Steelworkers to use this agreement to replace existing logging contractors with USW members or crews.
2.	It is United Steelworker’s desire to have opportunities to discuss with employers the possibility of either using USW company crews, or USW contractors, to perform work under Forest Renewal, but it is not our intent to cause companies to purchase equipment without having the costs of such equipment considered as part of the efficiency and cost effectiveness that the USW agrees to address under the New and Evolving Work agreement.
3.	It is United Steelworker’s intention that discussions concerning new operations under the agreement may lead to voluntary recognition and certification - it is not our intention to achieve certification first and enter into discussion later unless certification occurs as a direct result of an USW organizing drive.
142
As stated earlier, this letter is to clarify our intentions concerning our agreement. It is not intended to form part of the agreement, as is not arbitral by either party.
Sincerely,
Harvey Arcand 4th Vice President United Steelworkers

Dear Roland:
Re:	Alternate Shift Scheduling
Over the years, Locals 1-424 and 1-425 have worked cooperatively with West Fraser Mills Limited to implement alternative shift schedule. These shifts have, in the past, provided greater opportunities for our members and helped companies achieve better results from their northern operations and greater job security for our membership in both union locals.
Based on discussions and commitments made at the bargaining table, both local unions commit that they will continue to work cooperatively with companies to implement alternate shifts in order to continue to maintain productivity and job security for operations represented by West Fraser and our membership.
Yours truly,
Frank Everitt, President Wade Fisher, President
