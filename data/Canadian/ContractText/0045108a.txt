Section 9:01
Vacations
Vacation Entitlement
The Company will grant annual vacations with pay on the following basis to those employees who qualify for
same under all of the provisions of this article.
A.	Two (2) weeks vacation with pay after one (1) year of continuous service.
B.	Three (3) weeks vacation with pay after five (5) years of continuous service.
C.	Four (4) weeks vacation with pay after eleven (1 1) years of continuous service.
D.	Five (5) weeks vacation with pay after nineteen (19) years of continuous service.
E. Six (6)weeks vacation with pay after twenty-five (25) years of continuous service.
Section 9:02
Vacation Scheduling Procedure
A.	1. Vacations will be granted at such tunes through the calendar year as is found most suitable, considering
both the wishes of the employees and the Company.
2. However, they will be scheduled in such a manner as to provide for even distribution of the number of people who are absent due to vacation. Vacation weeks will begin on Sunday, however, the Company may permit a change, if practical, for individual employees. Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their department scheduler.
B.	1. Vacation lists will be posted prior to October 1st for the first tune frame, and prior to April 1st for the
second time frame.
2.	Preference will be indicated in advance, in writing, on the Vacation Request Fonn, and separated into two tune frames of January 1st to the 2nd Sunday in June, and the 2nd Sunday in June to December 31st. The deadline is September 30* 4:00 p.m. for the first tune frame and March 1st 4:00 p.m, for the second time frame.
3.	Protest of assignment of vacation dates must be made within two weeks following the posting of the lists. Otherwise, allotted dates will be assumed as correct.
C.	The following procedure will be utilized:
1.	The minimum allotment allowed will be 15% for vacation. The allotment will be applied on a departmental basis so that the total number of employees absent from the department on vacation at any given time will equal the total allotment and will not be less than two (2) employees per week.
2.	When the departmental allotment is allocated, it will be applied so that there are an equal number of employees who may be off on vacation on each shift, by seniority. The vacation openings that are left to be filled, will be filled by the senior employee(s) who has/have requested the opening from another shift in the department, except as outlined in 7. b) i) & ii) below.
3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this process is not filled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this tune, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
71
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.
It is understood that there will be no artificial creation of overtime due to the process of shift balancing under item 3 above.
In the event that there is a vacation opening that becomes available after the vacation scheduling process is complete because of the cancellation of scheduled vacation, the senior employee(s) on the shift involved who are on the vacation waiting list will be offered such openings first, then to the other employee(s) by seniority on the waiting list in the department.
6.	As operational needs permit additional openings, the senior employee(s) on the waiting list will be offered such openings, within the department.
7.	a) Vacation scheduling for Weekend Workers will be as per Section 6:12. b) Guidelines for Scheduling
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)
i)	Maintenance by seniority, by shift, within each primary and secondary trade. Those trade employee(s) who did not get at least one week between July and August will be afforded one-week vacation on their day shift in July or August.
For the period of the 3rd Monday in June until the 2nd Friday in September trades in rotating shift positions may be assigned in reverse seniority rotation, to cover vacations for the off shifts Monday to Friday. No maintenance employees will be assigned to the off shifts for two consecutive weeks other than to cover their regular scheduled shift.
ii)	Stores Keepers by seniority within their classification.
iii)	Packing by seniority within their classifications and shifts.
iv)	All other departments by seniority and shifts.
Employees who are not eligible for three (3) or more weeks vacation will be given preference in selecting their vacations as against the second portion of the vacation of those entitled to three (3) weeks vacation who wish to split such vacation period.
Senior employees who split their vacation but take one portion outside the holiday season (2nd Sunday in June to the year end) will still have preference over junior employees in obtaining one vacation period between the above dates.
Vacation cancellation will only be accepted by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday the week before. Unscheduled vacation requests will only be accepted by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday the week before. In the event that additional people can be permitted on vacation at any period upon short notice, first consideration will be given to those who did not have sufficient seniority to get a scheduled vacation in either July or August.
Vacation will be completed each calendar year with the exception as outlined in 9:03.
Employees with more than three (3) weeks vacation must take that excess vacation outside of the prime period (2nd Sunday in June to September 1st), unless there are additional openings after all other employees have scheduled their vacation.
Section 9:03
Vacation Pay in Lieu of Time Off
A. In the event an employee has been absent from work during the current calendar year for a full calendar week because of layoff, an excused absence, approved leave of absence or illness, but not because of a disciplinary suspension or dispute between the Company or Union, he/she may have the option of electing to receive vacation pay in lieu of being required to take vacation time off, to the extent such periods of absence are within the amount of vacation time off for which the employee is eligible.
72
B.	Employees would not be allowed to work their vacation if regular employees are on layoff.
C.	A minimum of two (2) weeks vacation will be completed each calendar year. Employees entitled to more than two (2) weeks vacation may carry-over up to two (2) weeks vacation to be taken the following year.
D.	Vacation carry over may be taken as long as it does not interfere with vacation scheduling procedures for the current scheduling period as outlined in 9:02.
Section 9:04

Out-of-Province/Out-of-Canada Claims
1.	The Travel Assistance service arranges for the payment of eligible emergency medical expenses in excess of $200, If you do not contact the Travel Assistance before the medical expenses are incurred, or as soon as you are medically fit to contact Travel Assistance, you may be responsible for paying the entire expense and submitting the claim for reimbursement to the Group Benefits carrier which will then coordinate payment with the provincial government health insurance plan (if applicable).
2.	If medical expenses are $200 or less, you are responsible for paying the expense and submitting the claim for reimbursement to the Group Benefits carrier which will then coordinate payment with the provincial government health insurance plan (if applicable).

93
payments made on your behalf are subsequently determined to be for ineligible services or amounts, the Group Benefits carrier reserves the right to recover the overpayment from you.
Co-ordination of Medical and Dental Care Benefits
If you or your eligible dependents are covered for similar benefits under another Plan, the Benefits Group carrier will take this into account when determining the amount of expenses payable under this program. This process is known as Coordination of Benefits. It allows for reimbursement of covered medical and dental expenses from all Plans, up to a total of 100% of the actual expense incurred.
Order of Benefit Payment:
A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the "Primary Payer" (i.e. responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the "Secondary Payer" (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).
1.	Ifthe other Plan does not provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, it will be considered as the Primary Payer, and will be responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense.
2.	Ifthe other Plan does provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, the following rules are applied to determine which Plan is the Primary Payer.
a)	For Claims incurred by you or your Dependent Spouse, the Plan covering you or your Dependent Spouse as an employee/member pays benefits before the Plan covering you or your Spouse as a dependent.
b)	In situations where you or your Spouse have coverage as an employee/member under more than on Plan, the order of benefit payment will be determined as follows:
i)	The Plan where the person is	covered	as	an active full-time employee, then
jj)	The Plan where the person is	covered	as	an active part-time employee, then
iii)	The Plan where the person is	covered	as	a retiree.
3.	For Claims incurred by your Dependent Child, the Plan	covering the parent whose birthday (month/day) is earlier in the
calendar year pays benefits first. If both parents have the same birth date, the Plan covering the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet pays first.
4.	However, if you and your Spouse are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
a)	The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
b) The Plan ofthe spouse ofthe parent with custody of the child (i.e. ifthe parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child), then
c)	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
d)	The Plan ofthe spouse ofthe parent not having custody ofthe child (i.e. ifthe parent without custody ofthe child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child).
5.	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Plans.
6. If the order of benefit payment cannot be determined from the above, the benefits payable under each Plan will be in proportion to the amount that would have been payable if Co-ordination of Benefits did not exist.
Submitting a Claim for Co-ordination of Benefits
To submit a claim when Co-ordination of Benefits applies, refer to the following guidelines:
1.	As per the Order of Benefit Payments section, determine which Plan is the Primary Payer and which is the Secondary Payer.
2.	Submit all necessary claim forms and original receipts to the Primary Payer.
3.	Keep a photocopy of each receipt prior to submitting your claim to the Primary Payer.
4.
Once your claim has been settled by the Primary Payer, you will receive a statement outlining how your claim has been handled. Submit the statement along with all necessary claim forms to the Secondary Payer for further

4.	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62). There are no adjustments to the calculation after age sixty-two (62).
G.	Pension Payment Options

c)
If you have a spouse but wish to select a fonn other than the Joint and 60% Survivor fonn then you and your spouse must sign a Spousal Waiver fonn.
96
2.	Life Only
If you do not have a spouse when you retire, the normal form of pension is "Life Only" which means that payments stop when you die.

Section 15:14
Stock Purchase Pian
A. Features of the Plan
1.	Kellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder of Kellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 U.S, per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars, which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan. Shares will be purchased by Wells Fargo for employees on the open market. Dividends are reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
2,	Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for:
a)	Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.)
b)	However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and payment to the Wells Fargo will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Wells Fargo a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
c)	Wells Fargo will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the Plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Wells Fargo protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
B. How the Plan Works
1. You may sign up to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the Payroll Deduction Form (see your Human Resources office). The following guidelines apply:
a)
b)
<0
d)
e) 0
Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this Stock Purchase Plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes significantly in foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this minimum amount may have to be changed.
Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S. (in total) per year.
A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Wells Fargo will be refunded to you.
2.	Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at die time of each dividend payment. Since dividends are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three (3) decimal places.
3.	Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by
102
investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
4.	At year-end, Wells Fargo will provide you with information on the payment of brokerage charges and bank service charges. Payment of these charges on your behalf must be reported as income for tax purposes.
C.	Purchase of Shares through Cash Payment
1.	Cash payments of $25 U.S, (minimum) to $25,000 U S. (in total) during any calendar year for purchase of shares can be made by sending cheques directly to Wells Fargo at any tune. Kellogg Company or Kellogg Canada Inc. will not handle voluntary cash purchases.
2.	Wells Fargo will purchase shares on or about the 15th of each month. Cheques received on or after the purchase date will be held until the next month.
3.	If shares are not purchased by the 15th of the month preceding a dividend payment, no dividend will be paid on the newly purchased shares until the next quarter.
D.	Safekeeping of Shares
1,	For your convenience, Wells Fargo will hold the shares it has purchased for you. Whole and fractional shares will be held in a dividend reinvestment account. You may also deliver for safekeeping any Kellogg Company stock you already hold. Upon written request, Wells Fargo will issue you certificates for any or all of the full shares credited to your account, and you may continue to reinvest dividends on those shares.
2.	Any employee who withdraws his or her shares from the custody of Wells Fargo may subsequently sell these shares only through a broker registered under the Securities Act of the province in which he or she resides. The employee is responsible for the brokerage fees.
E.	Communications
Contact your Human Resources office if you have questions regarding your payroll deduction or general operation of the program. If you have specific questions regarding your account, contact Wells Fargo:
