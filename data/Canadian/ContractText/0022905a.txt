10.01 The Company shall determine the number of employees in each job classification and if a vacancy in a job classification is to be filled or to be left vacant. 10.02(a) When the services of individuals with special abilities or training are required and are not available within the Bargaining Unit, the Company may transfer or employ such individuals from outside the Bargaining Unit.
(b) The Company will inform the Union of any vacant First Line Foreman positions that are to be filled in order that employees may make application for such positions. The extent of the Company’s obligation in this regard will be to inform any unsuccessful employee applicant of the reasons why he was not awarded the position. Under no circumstances will a grievance be accepted under the provisions of this clause.
10.03 Vacancies defined: A temporary vacancy is one which lasts thirty days or less or is one created by employees on vacation. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. A permanent vacancy is one which lasts more than thirty days.
TRAINING
10.04 To the extent consistent with efficient operations, a senior lower-bracket employee will be given the opportunity to train for the higher-bracket job next available to him in his Line of Progression, provided however that in determining the qualifications of successful bidders, as provided in this Article, such training will not be given preference in determining qualifications.
10.05(a) If the senior employee in a job classification or assignment refuses to avail himself of training opportunities or refuses a promotion, the Company may assign a less senior employee in that job classification or assignment to another shift or assignment consistent with his Departmental Seniority and qualifications if required to allow for promotional opportunities for other employees. “Promotional opportunities” as used above also refers to the additional skill assignments in the Mill Department.
(b) Where certain operating job classifications require training and qualifications on more than one unit of equipment or area, employees within the classification will be required to rotate assignments on a seniority basis in order to provide training opportunity for other employees in the same classification.
FILLING TEMPORARY VACANCIES
10.06	A temporary vacancy may be filled by an employee who is regularly classified in the job classification in which the vacancy exists or by the temporary advancement of an employee on the same shift based on Departmental Seniority and qualifications. It is understood that temporary vacancies which occur during the course of a shift may not always be filled by the senior qualified employee.
39
10.07	When filling temporary vacancies, the Company will determine in a fair and equitable manner the qualifications of an employee to fill the particular vacancy which exists.
FILLING PERMANENT VACANCIES
10.08	A permanent vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the Lines of Progression as contained in the Exhibits of this Agreement on the basis of Departmental Seniority, subject to the job bidding provisions of the Agreement where applicable. If qualified employees are not available within the department, the permanent vacancy may be filled from outside the department or if not available within the Bargaining Unit, from outside the Bargaining Unit.
10.09	An employee awarded a permanent vacancy as per Article 10.08 shall be entitled to a reasonable training period up to 240 regularly scheduled working hours. During the training period the employee shall train at his prior job rate or at the new job rate whichever is less. The employee will receive the new job rate prior to the completion of the 240 hours worked if he assumes the job duties without training assistance. (The training period and rate will be modified as indicated in the various Exhibits.)
REFUSAL OF PROMOTION
10.10	If an employee refuses to accept a promotion, he will remain eligible for consideration for a future vacancy in the classification or assignment if he indicates in writing to his Department Head that he wishes to be considered.
DAY ASSIGNMENT
10.11	An employee who is on a rotating shift assignment other than for his training for maintenance progression, may file a written application for consideration
40
for a straight day assignment within his department. A vacancy in such day assignment will be filled by the senior qualified applicant but the filling of the day vacancy may be temporarily delayed until a qualified replacement is available for the successful applicant.
JOB POSTING
10.12	A permanent job vacancy will be posted for plant-wide bidding for:
a)	New job assignments not specified in the Agreement,
b)	Job assignments above bid level jobs which the Company has been unable to fill in a Line of Progression,
c)	Bid level job assignments as designated in Exhibits 2 through 7 of the Agreement,
d)	Permanent day shift maintenance job assignments,
e)	An apprenticeship job vacancy,
f)	All job postings below Journeyman and above bid level, in a Maintenance Department shall be posted in consultation with the Union,
g)	All permanent day shift vacancies that cannot be filled from the Line of Progression, including those below bid level, will be posted (also see Footnotes Exhibit 2, Mine Operating Department).
10.13	Notice of the vacancies as defined in 10.12 shall be posted for six days and shall show job classification, job assignment, rate of pay, department, shift work or day work, and the crew where the initial vacancy exists.
10.14	An employee who desires to be considered for the posted vacancy shall submit a written bid on a bid-form supplied by the Company within the posting period which closes at the end of the day shift on the sixth
41
day of posting. A Shop Steward may file a bid on behalf of an absent employee.
10.15	Job bids submitted within the six day posting period shall be considered in filling the vacancy. The vacancy shall be awarded to the qualified applicant on the basis of General Seniority. The name of the successful bidder will be posted within five days following the end of the bidding period.
10.16	The Company will transfer the successful bidder within thirty days following the posting of the successful bidder’s name if a qualified employee is available to fill the vacancy of the successful bidder. In the event two or more successful bidders to the same job posting cannot be transferred simultaneously, the employee with the most General Seniority will begin accumulating Departmental Seniority in the new department when any successful bidder on that job is transferred. If the Company is unable to make such transfer within thirty calendar days after posting the name of the successful bidder, then such bidder will receive the rate for the new job starting on the thirty-first day, provided the new rate of pay is higher than the bidder’s present rate and the bidder will begin accumulating the new Departmental Seniority on the thirty-first day.
10.17	An employee who bid and was awarded the job may not bid on another vacancy within six months of the posting of his name as a successful bidder unless the new vacancy posted is for an apprenticeship or maintenance progression vacancy and his prior successful bid was a non-apprenticeship or a non-maintenance progression vacancy. This disqualification does not apply to an employee who has been displaced from his job assignment due to a layoff or a reduction of the workforce or has been awarded a posted job which lasts less than six months.
42
10.18	The permanent vacancy notices as provided for above will be posted on a bulletin board provided for that purpose in the change room. Bids on these permanent vacancies shall be deposited in the bid-box located in the change room.
10.19	Vacancies in job classifications that require job posting, will be posted prior to the hiring of personnel from outside the Bargaining Unit.
10.20	Any vacancies in job classifications that require job postings, that are posted, but not filled by bids or outside hiring within three months, will be reposted if the Company still wishes to fill that vacancy.
10.21	A successful bidder on a job in another department who voluntarily disqualifies himself or is disquali-tied by the Company, as permitted in Articles 10.23 and 10.24, will revive his former Department Seniority and will be permitted to bid on any job vacancies within his department but will not be permitted to bid on any job vacancies other than maintenance progression or apprenticeship vacancies outside his department for a period of six months following his return to his department.
10.22	An employee who occupies a permanent day shift vacancy who subsequently loses the job due to a reassignment to shift work will be returned to the day shift job when it next becomes vacant on the basis of General Seniority. The Company will not be required to post such vacancies until all eligible employees have been returned, bypassed the opportunity or have been successful bidders on another job.
QUALIFYING ON THE JOB
10.23	If within 240 regularly scheduled working hours an employee in a new job classification or assignment voluntarily disqualifies himself he shall return to his last classification and assignment if the job assignment still exists.
43
10.24(a) If an employee fails to satisfactorily perform the duties in a job classification or assignment, he shall be returned to his last classification and assignment if the job assignment still exists, and he will not be considered for the job assignment he was disqualified from for a period of up to six months.
(b) For the purposes of Article 10.23 and 10.24 if the employee is unable to return to his last classification and assignment because it no longer exists, then the affected employee will be reclassified in accordance with the provisions outlined in Article 11.04.
10.25	In the Maintenance Departments, any employee entering the Maintenance Line of Progression after July 1, 1979, who does not progress in the progression after two attempts at any level up to the Journeyman level, may be disqualified. Such employee may be returned to his status before entering the maintenance progression system following consultation with the Union.
TRANSFERS OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT
10.26	The Company may with the written consent of the employee temporarily transfer an employee possessing special abilities to another department for a period not to exceed six months. Such employee shall retain his Departmental Seniority in his regular department.
TRANSFERS OUT OF THE BARGAINING UNIT
10.27	Employees transferred from hourly-rated jobs to temporary jobs outside the Bargaining Unit shall continue to accumulate seniority.
10.28	An employee transferred from an hourly-rated job to a permanent job outside the Bargaining Unit shall retain all seniority held at the time of the transfer and will reactivate such seniority if he returns to the Bargaining Unit within a six month period following such transfer. In the event the transfer is for more than six months, the employee shall lose all retained seniority.
44
ARTICLE 11 - LAYOFF AND REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF THE WORKFORCE
NOTICE OF LAYOFF
11.01	Subject to the Labour Standards Act, in any reduction of the workforce for a period in excess of six consecutive days, the Company will give employees so affected at least seven days’ notice prior to their layoff. In lieu of the notice, the Company may elect to pay equivalent wages exclusive of overtime to the employee laid off.
11.02	In any reduction of work forces expected to last for a period not longer than seven days, the Company will attempt to give employees thus affected twenty-four hours notice.
REDUCTION OF WORKFORCE
11.03	Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen days will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than: - one week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is less than three years; - three weeks’ notice if the employee’s period of employment is three years or more but less than five years; - five weeks’ notice if the employee’s period of employment is five or more years.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six days or less, or if an employee is recalled for a specified, limited period of work.
The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
11.04	When the Company deems it necessary to reduce the working force for a layoff expected to last in excess of six days, the following procedure shall be followed:
45
a)	Employees who have not yet established General Seniority shall first be laid off, then employees with the least General Seniority shall be laid off until the necessary reduction is effected.
b)	The Company will not be required to retain an employee because of his General Seniority unless such an employee possesses the necessary qualifications to perform and is willing to perform the work of the employee who would otherwise be laid off in accordance with this provision.
c)	Within each department affected by the reduction, employees in the job classifications abolished or reduced shall be reclassified within the department on the basis of qualifications and General Seniority.
d)	When there are vacancies existing in departments due to layoff of employees by General Seniority, employees who have been unable to remain in their respective departments shall be assigned to fill the existing vacancies on the basis of qualifications and General Seniority.
e)	Any employee who accepts layoff in lieu of a transfer to another department or is laid off on the basis of General Seniority shall continue to accumulate General Seniority and shall be eligible for recall to work for a period not exceeding twelve months after which the layoff shall be deemed to be permanent and his employment terminated as of the date of the layoff except if during the twelfth month following such layoff the laid off employee notifies the Company by letter with return address attached that he desires to be restored to employment he shall continue to accumulate General Seniority and shall be eligible for recall to work for a total period of twenty-four months from the date of such layoff.
f)	The laid off employee shall leave his address
46
with the Company and shall notify the Company of any change of address.
g)	The reasonable trial or training period as referred to in Article 9.02, does not apply in the case of layoff and recall and restoration of the workforce. However, a senior employee will be entitled to a 3-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. It is understood the Company may refuse to grant the 3-day familiarization period if it can demonstrate that the employee could not meet the requirements of the job even if a 3-day familiarization period were granted. An employee who fails to meet the requirements of the job during the 3-day familiarization period in a job at bid level or above will be eligible to displace a junior employee in a position below bid level who filled the vacancy as per 11.03(d) on the basis of General Seniority. The 3-day familiarization period will be 3 normal work days for the individual based on the weekly work schedule in effect for the classification in which the period of familiarization is being offered whether it be on the 8,10 or 12 hour schedules.
RECALL OF THE WORKFORCE
11.05	A laid off employee who fails to report for work to the Company’s office within ten days after receiving notification of recall by registered mail or telegram unless he requests and receives an additional ten days extension during the ten days shall forfeit his seniority and right to recall. This period will be extended if disability prevents immediate return if the employee notifies the Company of the personal disability within the ten day period.
11.06	If at the time of the layoff the Company gives an employee a definite date upon which he is to return to work, notification will not be necessary and failure to return upon the designated date shall constitute a voluntary termination of employment as of the date of layoff.
47
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
11.07	When an employee is laid off the Company
may require that he be examined by the Company physician to determine his physical condition and upon recall shall be re-examined by the physician. If the layoff has continued for thirty days or more or if he has been involved in an accident during the layoff, he shall be eligible to return to work if he is physically capable of performing the work for which he is recalled. The physician’s fee will be paid by the Company.
11.08	A copy of the physician’s report of each examination shall be furnished to the Company, the Union and the employee involved.
LAYOFF DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
11.09	An employee with five or more years of General Seniority who is laid off as a result of technological change, as defined by the Trade Union Act, 1972, or permanent property closure, shall receive a severance payment of one week’s pay (40 hours) at the employee’s base wage at the time of layoff, for each complete year of accumulated service prior to this layoff, up to a maximum of thirteen weeks’ pay. In the event an employee who received a severance payment as provided above, is recalled within the period covered by the payment (maximum of thirteen weeks), he shall repay a prorata amount of the severance payment based upon the date of recall.

11.12	Whenever possible the Union will be advised in advance of the shutdown.
BASIS OF RECALL
11.13(a) Employees will be recalled from layoff on the basis of their General Seniority and ability to perform the work for which they are being recalled.
(b)	An employee who lost his job assignment due to a reduction of the workforce or layoff will be required to return to that job assignment when it next becomes vacant on the basis of General Seniority, unless he has since been awarded a posted job, or has been displaced for more than 24 months; however, when a vacancy occurs in a Department, preference to fill the vacancy will be given to a qualified employee with more General Seniority who was displaced from his job for 24 months or less due to a layoff or reduction of the workforce, until there is a vacancy in his former job assignment.
(c)	The Company will not be required to post such vacancies until all eligible employees have been returned to their former job assignments.
MAINTENANCE OF RATE

The Company pays the entire premiums for 30 days from the date the leave commenced, and the employee pays the entire premiums for the duration of his leave (maximum of 1 I months). By mutual agreement, between the Company and the employee, benefits (excluding pension) may be extended beyond one year.
-	sick days are “frozen” as of the date the leave commences, and the entitlement for the year will be prorated based on months of actual service during such year.
-	Pensionable service is accumulated (up to a one year maximum) while on Union Office Leave of Absence.
-	receiving Long Term Disability benefits: The Long Term and Group Life premiums are waived and the coverage will remain at the level which was in effect on the date the employee last worked. The employee may pay the cost of premiums for all other benefits.
-	on Maternity Leave: the employee may pay the cost of all benefit premiums.
3)	All benefits cease at the end of the month in which the employee’s employment with the Company terminates (voluntary termination or discharge).
4)	In the case of layoff, the benefits continue for 3 full months following the month in which the employee was laid off.
5)	An employee who is leaving the Company’s employ may convert his/her Group Life and/or Long Term Disability Insurance to his/her personal policy by directly contacting a representative or the insurance company
88
within 3 1 days of his/her termination.
Optional Insurance:
Employees may apply for either the optional group term life insurance and/or the voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance which is currently available. The effective date of such coverage will be as per the conditions specified in each of the plans. Premiums are paid by the employee through payroll deduction. In case of layoff or other absence without pay premiums must be prepaid to maintain coverage.
MISCELLANEOUS
1)	For Leaves of Absence requested under Article 5.04 the Company agrees to pay the employee his base wages for the scheduled work time missed and bill the Union for that amount plus 10%. This is conditional upon having received a written request for the leave from the Union, which also states the Company is authorized to bill the Union.
2)	Subject to Article 6.10, for Christmas, Boxing and New Year’s Day, the Company will poll the employees involved to determine the numbers that are willing to work. Where practical, other employees will be utilized and crews reduced in order to accommodate those who do not wish to work on those days.
3)	Recognizing that absentee problems could cause cancellation of the 10 hour or 12 hour compressed work week schedules, the Union and employees agree to establish a voluntary call-board system for replacing absent employees should the situation warrant such action. Employees will indicate whether they are available to be on call during their days off by listing their names and phone numbers on the call-board. An employee who indicates that he is available for call-outs and who fails to report for such call-out work will be considered to be on
89
an unexcused absence. It is also agreed that should the call- board system prove to be unsuccessful in that no
employees are available for call outs the affected compressed work week schedule will be cancelled given seven days notice from the Company.
4)	As far as is reasonably practicable, employees scheduled on the 10 hour and 12 hour work schedules will schedule medical, dental and business appointments to coincide with their regular days off. This will also apply to medicals required by the Company.
5)	is also agreed and understood that excessive overtime costs incurred by the Company will be just cause for cancellation of the compressed work week schedules.
6)	It is further agreed that the 10 hour and 12 hour day compressed work week schedules should provide benefits for the Company and the employees. At the same time it also recognized that the Ten Hour Day or Twelve Hour Day should not increase costs or be used by employees to gain financially.
7)	It is also agreed that the various modifications to relevant articles within this collective agreement for the purpose of accommodating the 10 hour or 12 hour day compressed work week schedules are subject to modification or amendment should the parties recognize that some of the changes are not desirable and should be modified or dropped and that other clauses may require modification.
8)	The Company, Employees and the Union agree to cooperate fully in the successful implementation and operation of the compressed work week schedules. However, the parties also agree that either the Company or the Union may terminate the compressed work week schedules within seven days notice if it is believed to be unsatisfactory to either party.
90
9)	The parties further understand that the Company reserves the right to schedule all of its employees on an eight hour day schedule whenever it is deemed that an emergency exists.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN

UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, C.L.C., LOCAL 7458
This letter of intent is designed for the purpose of rc-affirming the basic principles of the Cooperative Wage Study Program (referred to as C.W.S.). This re-affirmation is necessary because of recent trends within the workforce that employees feel that C.W.S. is to be used as a detailed job description, used to determine one’s day-to-day job duties.
The following principles are statements cited from the Job Description and Classification Manual published in August 1971 by the United Steelworkers of America - AFL - CIO CLC:
A.	Significant details concerning the function and requirements of each job shall be set forth in a job description which shall:
Provide a means of identifying the job under consideration, the processes, equipment and products with which it is concerned, and shall serve only as a basis from which to classify the job.
Reflect the general details considered necessary to describe the principal functions of the job identified and shall not be construed as a detailed description of all the work requirements that may be inherent in the job.
Provide, together with the reasons for the classification, the basis from which to judge changes in the job content which may result from new or changed conditions when such are established from time to time.
B.	The job classification of a job shall serve only to assign the job into a proper job class for application of the standard hourly wage scale.
In summary, these principles outlined are designed solely for the purposes of determining wage rates and not to provide any basis for determining the day-to-day job activities of any individual employee. Referring to the term “inherent” as outlined
95
on the bottom of each job description, this term ins defined as: Job duties that have been common to a particular job prior to the implementation of C.W.S., whether they were specifically addressed in the Job description or not, shall continue to be part of that particular job.
This Agreement will expire April 30, 1997 or until a new Agreement is signed.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN

UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA,
C.L.C., LOCAL 7458
The parties agree the provisions of this Memorandum of Agreement, when applied, supersede Article 8.14(a), 8.22(b). or any other provisions, which may be deemed to be in conflict.
It is agreed, for the life of the new Collective Agreement the following provisions will apply:
When a public holiday falls on an employee’s scheduled day off, the Company may schedule another day off without pay during the pay period in which the public holiday falls. In such an event, shortened work week overtime will not be paid regardless of which week in the pay period the other day off is scheduled.
However, when the Company chooses to schedule another day off as above, it shall be consecutive with the employee’s other scheduled days off in the pay period, and unless the holiday falls during an operating cycle the day off will be scheduled to tie in with the holiday weekend.
Notwithstanding Article 6.09, if another day off is scheduled the pay for the public holiday, as above, will be the greater of base rate times 8 hours or times the hours which would have been scheduled on the other day off.
The Company will post a weekly work schedule on the Monday prior to the start of the work week, and such will indicate the scheduling of another day off, if any.
This Agreement will expire April 30, 1997 or until a new Agreement is signed.
Signed this 24th day of March, 1995.
