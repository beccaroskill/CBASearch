Within five (5) days of the appointment of the impartial Chairman, the Board of Arbitration shall sit to consider the matter in dispute and shall render a decision within fourteen (14) days after its first session.

No person shall serve on the Board of Arbitration who is involved or directly interested in the
57
controversy under consideration. Grievances submitted to an Arbitration Board shall be in writing and shall clearly specify the nature of the issue. In reaching its decision the Board of Arbitration shall not be vested with the power to change, modify or alter this Agreement in any of its parts, but may, however, interpret its provisions. The expense of the impartial Chairman shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union, unless otherwise provided by law. The findings and the decisions of the Board of Arbitration shall be binding and enforceable on all parties. A decision of the majority of the Board of Arbitration shall be deemed to be a decision of the Board.

The grievance may be referred to a single arbitrator by notice in writing to the other party within thirty (30) calendar days of the decision in the second step of the grievance procedure.
The party requesting arbitration shall notify the other party by specifying a list of three (3) names it is willing to accept as a single Arbitrator.
The party receiving the notice shall either accept one (1) of the persons suggested to act as the Arbitrator, or if it does not accept any of the persons, notify the other party accordingly and send a list of three (3) names it is willing to accept as a single Arbitrator.
If the parties are unable to agree within twenty (20) working days after the request for arbitration on a
58
person to act as a single Arbitrator, either party may request in writing that the Director of Mediation Services of the Province of Alberta appoint a single Arbitrator.

refuses to perform the work assigned to them, the Company shall be absolved from any guarantee in respect of the work performed during that week.
(c)	The guarantee shall be the same for weeks in which one (1) of the eleven (11) Statutory Holidays occur as in other weeks, the pay received for said Statutory Holiday shall be regarded as part of the guarantee.
(d)	Any employee who is absent from work after having started to work on a week which would entitle them to receive the guaranteed work week, shall have their guarantee reduced by the time so lost.
(e)	Any employee who is laid off in excess of one (1) month is not eligible for the guaranteed work week provision in the week of recall.
(f)	Where overtime or other premium paid hours are worked they shall be computed as, one (1) hour worked is one (1) hour of the guarantee only.
