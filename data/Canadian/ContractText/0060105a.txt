The following outlines the Company’s present policy on the use of outside contractors in the Vancouver refinery.
The Company’s main concern has been to tty to ensure that no permanent employee would be displaced by any work contracted out. In general, then, the Company has used outside contractors, for example:
1.	where work involved is new construction.
2.	where the work involved some new equipment installation or for warranty work following an installation.
3.	where the work involves only a temporary surge in work volume. The Company hopes and expects to be able to continue its past
and present policy on this issue, barring any unforeseen developments. There is no past instance of any employee being displaced by the use of outside contractors in the Vancouver refinery.
