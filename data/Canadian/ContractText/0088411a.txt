10
ARTICLE 6 - REPRESENTATION
6.01	Bargaining Committee
The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise select from the Union membership in the Company's Port Hope, Ontario plant, a Bargaining Committee comprised of not more than four (4) seniority employees in good standing of the Company. The Local Union President shall be Chairman thereof. The Company will recognize the Bargaining Committee for the purpose of handling any grievance or discussing a matter properly arising during the continuance of this Agreement. Wherever in this Agreement the term "committee” is used, it shall be deemed to mean "Bargaining Committee."
The Company agrees to recognize eight (8) stewards, who shall be seniority employees.
When there are fifty (50) or more employees on the night shift, the Union shall be entitled to an additional steward on that shift.
When there are more than five hundred (500) employees in the Bargaining Unit, the Union shall be entitled to two (2) additional stewards and when there are more than seven hundred and fifty (750) employees in the Bargaining Unit, the Union shall be entitled to one (1) additional steward.
The Company agrees to recognize one (1) additional steward as a Chief Steward.
The bargaining committee shall have the option of being placed on day shift throughout the life of the agreement providing:
a)	There is productive work to be done within their qualifications and ability.
b)	Such option is exercised within two weeks of ratification or a new bargaining committee member taking office.
c)	That a bargaining committee member returns to their home shift upon leaving office.
6.02	Not more than two (2) International Representatives of the Union may be present and participate in any meeting of the Bargaining Committee and the Company. The Company will not be required to meet a total of more than four (4) Union representatives at any time in addition to an International Representative of the Union. An additional union representative may be present by mutual agreement.
11
6.03	One (1) member of the Bargaining Committee will be permitted to leave his work and unit when notified by his supervisor that he has been summoned for the purpose of handling grievances. A member of the Bargaining Committee will be permitted to leave his work and unit when notified by his supervisor that there will be a meeting with representatives of the Company. A Shift Steward will be permitted to leave his work when he has been notified by his supervisor for the purpose of handling a grievance at the first or second step of the grievance procedure. Such employee shall report to his supervisor upon his return to work. Time away from work for the purpose herein specified shall not on the aggregate exceed three (3) hours per week for any one individual.
6.04	A Committeeman or Shift Steward required under the grievance procedure to enter another unit must inform the supervisor of that unit which he enters of the reason for his presence. Committeemen or Shift Stewards, as the case may be, shall expeditiously attend to the grievance so that no unnecessary loss of time or interference with production will result therefrom.
6.05	The Union recognizes and agrees that members of the Bargaining Committee and Shift Stewards have their regular duties to perform in connection with their employment. The Company will compensate such Committeemen and Shift Stewards for time spent at the plant during their regular working hours in handling grievances of employees pursuant to the grievance procedure at their regular straight time base hourly rate of pay, provided this privilege is not abused by the Committeemen or Shift Stewards. Committeemen or Shift Stewards will not be compensated for time spent prior to or beyond their regular working hours on Union business unless at the request of the Company.
b) The Company and the Union agree that from time to time, meetings between the parties, for reasons of resolution of a grievance, may extend beyond the normal working hours of the persons involved. The Company will, in attempting to schedule such meetings, endeavour to hold them at times most convenient to the employees involved and to minimize the amount of time spent outside of regular working hours. However, in cases where a meeting extends beyond the normal working hours of the participants or is held at a time other than one which falls within the employees' regular shift, no compensation will be made to the employee for such time.
6.06	Notwithstanding anything otherwise contained in this Agreement, the Company may delay or defer permission to a Steward, Committeeman, or other Union official who wishes to leave his work pursuant to the provisions hereof, if such leaving would interfere with the efficient operation of the Plant. Such permission will not be unreasonably withheld.
6.07	The Union agrees to supply the Company with the names of Committeemen and Shift Stewards and to keep such list up to date at all times and the Company shall not be obliged to recognize such personnel until it has been so informed.
12
6.08	The employees shall be represented by stewards upon their shift as set out in Article
6.01	hereof, not more than two (2) of whom shall be from any single department with fewer than thirty (30) employees per shift.
Consistent with article 6.01, the Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise elect Union Stewards for the purpose of representing employees in the handling of complaints and grievances.
6.09	For the purpose of this Agreement, the Bargaining Committee and the stewards, together with the officers of the Local Union, shall be deemed to be officials of the Union. The parties hereto agree that the Union officials occupy positions of leadership and responsibility to see that this Agreement is faithfully carried out.
6.10	The Company will recognize a bargaining unit employee, who has received training in time study methods, as an observer in cases where a work standard becomes the subject of a grievance. The observer shall have the right to be present during a review of work method, time study and calculations necessary to check the general standard.
6.11	The Company will continue to pay the Union Officers who are away on Union business, and will invoice the Union on a monthly basis for all lost time.
6.12	A member of the Bargaining Committee who is temporarily assigned by the Company to another operation because of his frequent absence in connection with Bargaining Committee activities will not undergo a reduction in his hourly rate because of such assignment. When his frequent absence is no longer required, he will be reinstated to his regular job.
13
ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.01	The grievance procedures provided for are among the most important matters in the successful administration of this Agreement. The Company and the Union therefore agree that the designated grievance procedure as set forth in this procedure shall serve as and constitute the sole and exclusive means to be utilized by the grievor for the prompt disposition, decision and final settlement of a grievance arising in respect of the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement. This specifically designated grievance procedure shall be strictly followed. Wherever the term "grievance procedure" is used in this Agreement it shall be considered as including the arbitration procedure.
7.02	"Grievance" shall mean a complaint or claim concerning improper discipline or discharge, or a dispute with reference to the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement.
7.03	The Company shall be under no obligation to consider or process any grievance unless such grievance has been presented to the Company in writing at Step 1 of the grievance procedure within five (5) working days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known by the grievor.
7.04	All time limits referred to in the grievance procedure herein contained shall be deemed to mean "working days", i.e., exclusive of Saturday, Sunday or the holidays set out in Article 12 hereof. These time limits can be extended by mutual agreement.
7.05	No employee or group of employees shall have a grievance until they have discussed their complaint with their immediate supervisor. If the employee wishes, he/they may be accompanied by their steward. If the immediate supervisor does not promptly settle the matter to the employees’ satisfaction an employees’ proper grievance shall be processed as follows:
STEP No. 1
If an(y) employee(s) have a grievance the grievance shall, within the five (5) working days referred to in Article 7.03, be reduced to writing and presented to the Shift Superintendent/Coordinator. The steward will present the written grievance to his Shift Superintendent/Coordinator. The Shift Superintendent/Coordinator shall give the grievor(s) a written reply as soon as possible but not later than three (3) days after such discussion. If the Shift Superintendent/Coordinator's reply is not satisfactory to the grievor(s), the next step must be taken within five (5) days of the Shift Superintendent/ Coordinator's answer, but not thereafter.
The written grievance referred to above shall identify: the facts giving rise to the grievance; the section or sections of the Agreement claimed to be violated; the relief requested; and shall be signed by the employee(s) and countersigned by their steward or union representative on the employee’s behalf.
14
STEP No. 2
At this step the written grievance shall be presented to the Human Resources Manager within five (5) days of receipt of the Shift Superintendent/ Coordinator's written reply, but not thereafter.
A meeting will be held within five (5) days between a Member of the Bargaining Committee together with the steward involved, the Grievor, and the Shift Superintendent/Coordinator together with Human Resources. This meeting will be held at a mutually agreeable time and location.
If the Company’s reply is not satisfactory to the member of the bargaining committee the next step shall be taken within five (5) days after the delivery of such reply to the member of the bargaining committee, but not thereafter.
STEP No. 3
At this step, the Union shall, within five (5) days, notify the Human Resources Manager in writing of its desire to appeal the decision given at Step No. 2. Within seven (7) days, a meeting will take place between the Bargaining Committee (which may be accompanied by the International Representative of the Union and Steward) and the Plant Manager and any other representatives of management. The grievor shall be required to be present at the request of either party. The Company shall deliver its decision in writing to the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee within seven (7) working days of such meeting.
STEP No. 4
In the event the grievance is not settled at Step No. 3, the party having carriage of the grievance may request mediation, by mutual agreement of the parties, or arbitration of the grievance by giving notice in writing to the other party within thirty-five (35) days from delivery of the decision at Step No. 3 to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, but not thereafter.
If a request for arbitration is not so given within such thirty-five (35) day period, the decision at Step 3 shall be final and binding upon both parties to this Agreement, and upon any employee involved. The notice to arbitrate shall contain the name of three (3) arbitrators. The party receiving the notice may select an arbitrator from the list or propose to the other party a list of three (3) arbitrators for the other party to select an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, then either party can request the Minister of Labour to appoint an arbitrator.
7.06	In the case where a grievance is taken to arbitration, the Arbitrator shall hear and determine the matter and shall issue a decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee affected by it.
7.07	The Arbitrator shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify or amend any part of this Agreement, nor to adjudicate
15
any matter not specifically assigned to it by the notice to arbitrate in Step. No. 4 of Article 7.05 hereof.
7.08	Each party shall bear its own costs of and incidental to any such arbitration proceedings. The fees and charges of the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the two parties.
7.09	The time limits and other procedural requirements set out in this Article 7 are mandatory and not merely directory, and no matter may be submitted to arbitration which has not properly been carried through all specified previous steps of the grievance procedure within the times specified. The parties recognize that in some departments and on some shifts "immediate supervisor" and "Shift Coordinator" shall be the same person, and the grievance shall be filed with such person after being discussed with him as a complaint, pursuant to the provisions hereof. In the event that the Company exceeds the time limits set out in the grievance procedure, the grievance will be considered to have been carried through the applicable step of the procedure and will be advanced to the next step. The provisions of this clause shall not be considered to have been waived by the parties or either of them unless they expressly provide a waiver thereof in writing, signed by both parties.
7.10	A decision or settlement reached at any stage of the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto, including the complaining employee, and shall not be subject to reopening by any party except by agreement in writing. If the grievance is settled at any step of the grievance procedure, both the Company management and the Union representatives who pass on the same as provided herein shall sign the settlement as endorsed upon the written grievance, so that no question or argument may arise as to what the settlement was. Either party shall have the right to require the attendance of the grievor at any meeting held pursuant to Steps 1, 2, or 3 of the grievance procedure.
When an employee's grievance is settled by the parties or determined by the Arbitrator on the basis that the employee is entitled to be reimbursed for wages lost as a result of action on the part of the Company in violation of this Agreement, such reimbursement shall be retroactive to the date of the presentation of the grievance to the Company in writing. Such reimbursement shall be at the employee's regular straight time earnings for such hours as the employee would have worked for the Company if the violation had not occurred.
7.11	Union Policy Grievance or Company Grievance
A Union policy grievance or a Company grievance may be submitted to the Company or the Union, as the case may be, in writing, within seven (7) days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known or should have been known by the grievor. A meeting between the Company and the Union shall be held within five (5) days of the presentation of the written grievance and shall take place within the framework of Step No. 3 of Article 7.05. The Company or the Union, as the case may be, shall give its written decision within three (3) days of such meeting.
If the decision is unsatisfactory to the grieving party, the grievance may be submitted to mediation or arbitration within thirty-five (35) days of the delivery of such written decision and in the case of arbitration the arbitration sections of this Agreement shall be followed.
16
It is expressly understood that the provisions of this paragraph 7.11 may not be used by the Union to institute a grievance directly affecting an employee or employees which such employee or employees could themselves institute, and the provisions of Article 7.05 hereof shall not thereby be bypassed.
7.12	DISCIPLINARY ACTION
(a)	DISCHARGE CASES
A claim by a seniority employee that he has been discharged without just cause shall be treated as a grievance and shall commence at Step No. 3 of Article 7.05 provided a written grievance signed by the employee and his Department Steward or Bargaining Committee is presented to the Human Resources Manager within five (5) days after the discharge. The International Representative of the Union will be permitted to attend the meeting held pursuant thereto, with the Human Resources Manager. The Union will not question the discharge of any probationary employee nor shall such discharge be the subject of a grievance unless such discharge was for unjust cause.
A seniority employee who is discharged while on the Company premises shall have the right to confer with his steward for up to thirty (30) minutes, in a place designated by the Company, before leaving the Plant.
(b)	DISCIPLINE
The Company agrees that when occasion arises to issue a disciplinary letter of notation to an employee, the following will apply:
1.	When an employee has completed the probationary period, is suspended or discharged or disciplined, the Company shall arrange for a Steward or Negotiating Committee member present at the time of suspension or discharge is to be issued.
2.	If a seniority employee is called to a meeting where discipline is being contemplated, the Company shall arrange for a Steward or a negotiating committee member to be present.
3.	The notation will be issued not more than five (5) working days following the infraction to which it refers. If a union official is not available the issuance of discipline will be delayed to the earliest possible time that they are available.
4.	The notation will be issued to the employee(s) concerned with copies to the Union Steward for the appropriate area and to the employee's personnel file.
5.	Should a period of twelve (12) months lapse between the issuance of a notation and the issuance of any subsequent related notation, the original notation will not be used in a disciplinary manner against the employee and will be removed from the employee’s file.
6.	The Company and Union may extend the time limits to issue discipline by mutual agreement.
17
7.
Letters of discussion are non disciplinary and will not form part of the employees record or considered when assessing an employee for bid jobs.
(c)	Should the parties agree or should the grievor satisfy the Arbitrator that an employee has been discharged without just cause, such employee shall be reinstated as an employee without loss of seniority and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7.10 hereof.
18
ARTICLE 8 - SENIORITY, LAYOFF, TRANSFERS, JOB POSTINGS
8.01	Employees will be considered probationary until they have been employed by the Company for ninety (90) calendar days within a twelve (12) consecutive month period. During the probationary period such employees will have no seniority rights. Upon successfully completing the probationary period, the employee will have a seniority date consistent with their date of hire. Layoffs or absences of five (5) consecutive days or more will extend the probationary period by the equivalent number of days. Layoffs or absences of less than five (5) consecutive days will not extend the probationary period. If two or more employees are hired on the same day they shall be placed on the seniority list in order of their clock numbers when their ninety (90) days are achieved. The employee shall carry such seniority in his unit.
An employee shall hold seniority in only one (1) unit at any one time.
8.02	The Company will post seniority lists once every six (6) months and such list shall show the employee's seniority and unit in which the employee holds such seniority. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, seniority shall be by unit and plant-wide. The Company shall furnish the Union with a copy of the seniority list.
8.03	For the purpose of applying the seniority provisions of this Agreement, the present units are as follows:
Unit No. 1
Unit No. 2 Unit No. 3
Unit No. 4
Production operations including Labour Grade 99s, Compounders, Shell/Foam/Injection Technicians, Paint Technicians and Mould Cleaner, WCM Associate, Facilities Project Set-Up Warehouse Drivers
Maintenance Mechanic/Millwright, Maintenance Fabricator, Industrial Instrument Electrician, Refrigeration/Air Conditioning Mechanic, Tooling Mechanics, Modular Tooling Specialists, Mould Repair, Mould Maker, Apprentices
Colour, Analytical/Chemical, Development, Foam/Shell, Auditors, Process Verifier, QC Inspector, Automation Technician
New product lines or changes in existing product lines may require additions to or changes in the foregoing unit structure. The Company will notify the Union of any such additions or changes. Should the Union, after being so notified, wish to discuss any such additions or changes, the Company will meet with the Union and explain or otherwise discuss the additions or changes.
Any new classifications will be placed in the seniority unit that is most consistent with the existing unit structure.
1.	The Company will provide the Union with copies of all hourly job descriptions.
2.	The Company will notify the Union President or designate of any changes to any job classifications or job descriptions in writing prior to implementation.
19
8.04	A seniority employee who is transferred to another unit by seniority on an indefinite layoff (i.e. lay-off other than layoff due to Work Shortage as defined in 8.06, or on recall from indefinite layoff), shall lose seniority in his former unit in which he held unit seniority after ninety (90) days and attain seniority in the new unit, after ninety (90) days in the new unit.

A work day shall consist of the twenty-four (24) hours from midnight to midnight.
The provisions of this Article 10 are for the purpose of computing overtime and shall not be construed as a guarantee or limitation of hours of work per day or per week nor as a guarantee of working schedules.
In determining the hours worked by the employee for the purpose of entitlement to overtime pay, hours not worked because of a paid holiday, bereavement leave, jury duty, layoff, leave of absence necessitated by an unavoidable problem provided written leave is requested and secured not later than the day prior to the date of the leave, shall be counted as if worked. When the Company requires that additional work be performed per day or per week, such additional work shall be compensated for at the rates set forth below:
a)	Time and one-half (1 1/2) will be paid for all time worked in excess of eight (8) straight time hours in any one (1) day, provided, however, that this rule will not apply when an employee is required to work more than eight (8) hours in the day or forty (40) hours in the week because of:
i)	a transfer resulting from the lay-off and recall procedure or permanent
transfer procedure;
ii)	a change in shift or exchange of shifts requested by the employee and
consented to by the supervisor;
iii)	the granting of a request for transfer.

Where an employee reports for work on his regular shift and is sent home with instructions to report on a later shift, he shall be paid for two (2) hours subject to the same exceptions and conditions as set forth in this section. An employee, other than an employee who reports for work on his regular shift and is sent home with instructions to report on a later shift, who does not accept available work when offered shall not be entitled to payment for reporting.
10.08	STAND-BY-PAY
An employee who is required by the Company to hold himself ready and available to be called in to perform work on a Saturday, Sunday or designated holiday will be paid four (4) hours' pay at his straight time rate of pay exclusive of premiums for each twenty-four (24) hour period he is required to stand-by subject to the following:

Maintenance Policy
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
During the 1998 negotiations, the parties discussed how Maintenance Mechanic/Millwrights transfer within the classification to the various jobs that may from time to time exist.
To clarify the intention of the parties, it is agreed that when a vacancy arises within the aforementioned classification, existing Maintenance Mechanic/Millwrights will have the opportunity to move into the vacancy on the basis of seniority, providing they are able to satisfactorily perform the work that is to be done. Employees’ attendance and performance records will be taken into account in this selection.
The resulting opening created from the process described above will be bid in accordance with Article 8.10 (a).
Yours very truly,
CPK INTERIOR PRODUCTS

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2
United Steelworkers AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 889 Attention: Bargaining Committee
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Absentee Pool Employees
The Company may utilize an Absentee Pool of temporary part-time personnel in the Labour Grade 99 classification. With the exception of the initial training/orientation period, Absentee Pool employees will be used to cover for the absences of full-time employees only.
However, the Company may utilize Absentee Pool Employees for 40 hours in a workweek for the purpose of replacing employees on an approved vacation consistent with Article 11.05 or for the replacement of an employee on an approved 40 hour vacation consistent with Article 10.03 - Vacation Lieu Time.
The pool will have a maximum number of participants equal to 10 percent of the full-time workforce. Participants will consist of:
1.	Regular full-time employees on indefinite lay-off who elect to participate in the absentee pool;
2.	Part-time employees as defined in Article 1.01.
3.	Such employees shall be paid at a rate of $14.50 per hour.
In the event of a temporary layoff, full-time employees will be canvassed as to their availability for temporary work. Full-time employees who place their names on the temporary work list will be called in, as needed, on their requested shift providing they are qualified to perform the work available. Such employees are expected to be available for call-in during the following times: 1st shift (6-8:00 am); 2nd shift (2-4:00 pm); 3rd shift (10:00 pm - 12:00 am) and report to work promptly when called. An employee’s name will be removed from the temporary work list if he/she is unavailable for work on two occasions during the duration of the layoff. No Absentee Pool employees will be utilized when permanent employees, who are
57
on the temporary work list, are available, willing, and qualified to do the work.
For absentee coverage required on weekends, the Company will make a reasonable effort to contact full-time employees who are qualified to perform the work available. If this effort is not successful, absentee pool employees may be utilized.
On a weekly basis, the Union will receive an accurate list of Absentee Pool employees as well as records of hours worked each week.
Yours very truly,
CPK INTERIOR PRODUCTS

United Steelworkers AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 889 Attention: Bargaining Committee Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Workplace Closure Agreement
The parties wish to set out the terms and conditions relating to a potential plant closure of the
Port Hope Facility and termination of employees.
The parties agree that any obligation will come into effect upon the announcement of the
Plant Closure.
The parties agree that for the purposes of this Agreement, the term “plant closure” shall be
defined as the cessation in whole or in part (which constitutes a reduction of more than 50%
of staff) of manufacturing or production at the Port Hope facility.
Therefore the parties agree as follows:
1.	It is agreed that it is in the best of interests of both parties that the historic cooperation between management and employees continues as long as the Port Hope Facility remains open. The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all its employees at its Port Hope Facility as outlined in the Collective Agreement.
2.	The Company will pay to each employee a lump sum severance payment upon layoff in accordance with the Employment Standards Act, 2000 upon each individual’s layoff provided such individual has waived recall rights.
3.	The calculation of severance pay will be pro-rated as outlined in the Employment Standards Act, 2000 and such payment will be subject to all applicable deductions.
4.	Employees will have the option of transferring the severance payment to which they are entitled or part thereof, to their personal RRSP consistent with legal requirements.
5.	The Company agrees that wherever possible, it will provide the Union and the employees with six months notice of the Plant Closure unless the customer fails to provide the Company with such notification.
59
6.	During the closure process employees will be laid off in accordance with the Collective Agreement.
7.	If it is necessary to eliminate jobs during the statutory notice period, the Company will make payment for the remaining time of the notice period in lieu of notice.
8.	Employees who provide one week’s written notice of resignation during their notice period, will be entitled to receive their severance pay in accordance with the Employment Standards Act, 2000. These employees will not be eligible for any other benefits as contained in this Agreement or otherwise.
9.	The Company will maintain the current group insurance benefits of each employee for a period of 90 days following their layoff.
10.	Employees have the option of converting life insurance within thirty-one (31) days of the exhaustion of the Company covered benefits subject to the conditions of the benefit plan.
11.	Employees currently receiving benefits under WSIB or STD will continue to receive such benefits as long as they remain eligible; however, all STD payments and coverage shall cease 90 days from the date of the Plant Closure. Eligibility will continue to be governed by the applicable governmental agency or the insurer in the same manner as it has been determined in the past. These Employees will be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with this agreement.
12.	The Company agrees to cooperate with WSIB and the Union to ensure that employees who are accommodated as a result of a workplace injury, accident or disease are provided with the benefit of WSIB which may include Labour Market Re-entry Program provided that the individual employee is eligible.
13.	The Company agrees to pay out any vacation accrued but unused as of the announcement of the Plant Closure.
14.	Employees who require time off to attend a job interview will be granted a reasonable period of time on an unpaid basis to attend such interview.
15.	The Company shall provide such assistance (by way of in kind donations) as it is able to with respect to the Job Action Centre.
16.	The parties agree that this Agreement is enforceable through the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the Collective Agreement.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #4
December 4th, 2009
United Steelworkers AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 889 Attention: Bargaining Committee
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE: WORLD CLASS MANUFACTURING
The Parties recognize the significant need for and the opportunity associated with the implementation of a world-class business model, especially as it relates to Port Hope’s manufacturing activities.
Pending approval of the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) Association in Turin, Italy, and the acquisition of the Port Hope facility of CpK Interior Products by Chrysler Group LLC, WCM will be implemented at the Port Hope facility.
The objective of WCM is to improve the performance of the Corporate Operating System to a level of excellence able to achieve World Class competitiveness. This objective can only be achieved through wide-scale people development and an organization able to:
•	attack all types of waste and loss
•	involve all those who operate at all levels of the organization
•	apply methods and tools rigorously
•	deploy and standardize the results achieved.
Achievement of this objective will require full implementation and immediate commitment to be fully operational as required by Chrysler or the WCM Association.
61
In addition, WCM is based on important, challenging principles:
•	it is introduced and deployed top down with the constant commitment of the management
•	it is based on the constant, widespread contribution of all those who work at the company (and not consultancy driven)
•	it is a way of working (and not a project)
•	it is reinforced and developed with the involvement of all concerned
•	it requires methods, tools, standards and rigorous application of these
•	it results in the setting up of a visible, transparent system
•	it is effective as it aims to ‘keep it simple’
Pending the approval of Fiat and Chrysler, the Parties agree to fully implement the principles
of World Class Manufacturing, including, but not limited to
•	Team based structure - 2 non-skilled labour classifications (Team Member and Team Leader). All job postings and overtime equalization will be Team based.
•	Team member rotation - Team Members rotate on a regular and recurring basis.
•	Autonomous activities - Performed by Team Members including cleaning, lubrication, inspection and re-tightening as required, both inside and outside the work cells.
The Parties agree that these key principals will be implemented notwithstanding any
conflicting elements of the collective agreement.
