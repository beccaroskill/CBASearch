A cooperative and consistent program that uses modified work, rehabilitation, job placement, and follow-up to ensure that ill, injured and disabled employees can remain at work or quickly return to productive and meaningful work. The Modified/ Transitional Work Program will confirm this commitment.
OBJECTIVES
-	to minimize the disabling effects of injury and illness
-	to assist in the early rehabilitation of disabled employees and thereby allow a return to their regular jobs, to a comparable job or to suitable work.

breakdowns are determined by Maintenance Shift Supervisors.
iii)	All trade employees on afternoon and night shifts will prepare daily a log-of work performed for review by the trade supervisor.
iv)	If operations require reassignment of Millwrights or Packaging Maintenance Millwrights in excess of one month, the requirements will be posted as temporary positions. The selected employee(s) will be added to extra shift list(s) and given the same charges as the next senior employee, and added to the call-in list(s).
If insufficient employee(s) apply, the junior qualified employee(s) will be assigned to fill the vacancies, and added to the extra shift and call-in lists.
For requirements of one week or less, junior Millwrights or junior Packaging Maintenance Millwrights will be assigned; however, this will not change their status in respect to overtime lists.
v)	No employee will be allowed to work more than sixteen accumulative hours in a twenty-four hour period. The twenty-four hour period will commence at the start of their regular scheduled shift, or at the start of an overtime opportunity, after the employee has had eight (8) hours unbroken time off

4.	EXTRA SHIFTS
Definition - an “extra shift” is any shift or split shift scheduled for a department on a Saturday, Sunday, or Holiday.
A “split shift” is normally for a minimum of four (4) hours at the start or prior to the end of the shift unless it is a startup shift which is of a shorter period depending on the job and department.
A) Book On
a)	Employees are required to book on their assigned shifts only -“Shifts” and “Core”.
b)	Employees will be considered as volunteers for other shifts, or core assignments if they indicate their availability.
c)	Employees who wish to work an extra shift assignment must “book on” the extra shift availability list by 10:00 a. m. Wednesday of each week.
Extra shift schedules will be posted on the bulletin boards by 2:00 p.m. Thursday or each week for Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, except for Good Friday at which time it will be posted Wednesday 2:00 p.m.
“Book on’s” may be retracted by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday of each week without penalty. The request must be in person to the Department Secretary or, if the secretary is unavailable, your immediate supervisor, with a maintenance steward present. The request to retract must be initialled on the book on sheet by the department secretary or initialled by your immediate supervisor and maintenance steward.
Note: If a holiday falls on Friday, the “book on” form must be completed by 10:00 a. m. Tuesday of that week.
d)	Maintenance Department Extra Shift Scheduling
Employees would be considered unavailable for extra shifts unless they explicitly Book On for extra shifts.
Employees must sign their names and initial appropriate spaces on the Book On lists.
Employees would be able to Book On for their normal bid shift, as well as specify any additional shifts they would be interested in working should they be excess to their normal bid shift in their department.
In order to book on for shifts other than your normal bid shift you must Book On for your normal bid shift first.
46
Out of department book ons will be utilized after all available openings have been filled by department employees who have booked on (Section 6:04).
B)	Scheduling Process:
The scheduling of employees to meet production shift needs and core needs would be done in the following manner:
1.	Weekend workers will fill their normal shift positions first.
2.	Assign by senior employee lowest in hours, employees normally scheduled to the Shift or Core and Booked on by Wednesday 10:00 a.m.
Note: If a holiday falls on Friday, the “book on” form must be completed by 10:00 a. m. Tuesday of that week.
3.	Assign by Seniority rotation, Core and Shift, to employees excess to their normal shift and booked on.
Assignment would be based on their indicated shift on the Book On form and by seniority rotation to Days, Afternoons and Nights in that order.
The only exception would be where the extra shift would conflict with their normal weekday shift (e.g.: could not be scheduled onto days Saturday if they are scheduled Friday night shift or scheduled nights on extra shifts when the employee is scheduled to work days the following day).
4.	To fill available openings in the schedule by utilizing a twelve (12) hour shift, assignment would be made by seniority rotation.
The twelve (12) hour volunteers would be shown as available for the twelve (12) hours, and would only be utilized after all eight (8) hour extra shift opportunity, (Core, Days, Afternoon or Nights, on Saturday, Sunday and paid Holidays) have been scheduled.
When a Book On for twelve (12) hour extra shift opportunity is used, it is understood that the twelve (12) hours will be continuous extra shift hours. Not broken into an eight (8) hour opportunity, then return for a four (4) hour opportunity at a later time.
The four (4) hour attached opportunity must be part of an extra shift.
Extra shift hours are from Saturday 8:00 a.m. to Monday 8:00 a.m. except when paid Holidays are in effect, then it will extend to accommodate the paid Holidays.
5.	Available openings for non-skilled trade job functions not filled within department will be filled by utilizing out-of-department book ons if available (e.g.: Wall washing and Maintenance helper).
47
6.	Book ons submitted after the closing date would be utilized prior to securing employees readily available that did not previously book on but may be available.
7.	Openings on Schedule
After the schedule is posted and “shift openings” are shown, these openings are available to shift employees within their own classification only until 8:00 a.m. Friday. (Eight (8) or Four (4) Hour)
After the schedule is posted and “Core openings” are shown, these openings are available to Core Employees within their own classification only until 8:00 a.m. Friday. (Eight (8) or Four (4) Hour)
These openings are for an eight (8) hour opportunity; or a four (4) hour opportunity attached to a scheduled eight (8) hour shift (before or after the shift).
After the above time frames and openings still exist, any appropriate trade person(s) willing to come in and fill the open spot(s) will do so on a first come first serve basis.
Split shifts of a four (4) hour opportunity do not have to be at the start or prior to the end of a shift, but may be part of a Day, Afternoon, or Night shift, (e.g.: the front half of a shift, 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., 12:00 midnight to 4:00 a.m., or the back half of a shift, 12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.).
8.	When no employees are available and openings still exist, these postings will be shown on the posted schedule, thus indicating that a Call-in may be used to fill the opening should production warrant it.
Openings would only be shown and scheduled to the maximum of a normal full shift complement of employees.
If a Call-in is utilized to fill the opening within one (1) hour of the beginning of the shift for shift support, the rate of pay would be the same as replacing for absenteeism.
Call-ins for shift support after the start of the shift will not be considered as absenteeism and will be paid at double the rate.
9.	Employees will not be able to voluntarily trade extra shift assignments unless the trade is for a complete week (seven (7) days, Sunday through to Saturday).
10.	To accommodate the situations where Junior Non-Rotating
employees are scheduled the next week on shift due to vacation, training or known illness, the following will apply:
48
a)	A notice will be posted, each Monday, outlining known shift coverage needs for Junior Non-Rotating for the upcoming weekend. This will provide information showing how many employees will be off shift and allow time so that the Junior Non-Rotating employees can book on to the appropriate shifts.
b)	Should any unforeseen issues arise prior to Friday 4:00 p.m. that may require additional Junior Non-Rotating employees to go to shift, those employees affected would be asked if they wish to be scheduled for the Sunday extra shifts. If they agree, they would be scheduled in as if they had booked on by Wednesday.
Any changes that may be required after Friday 4:00 p.m. that require Junior Non-Rotating employees go to shift, would be filled without opportunity for them to become available, except if openings are shown and not yet filled by the first come first serve basis.
After Friday 4:00 p.m. Junior Non-Rotating employees will not be obligated to accept the afternoon or night shift if the employee is scheduled on core Sunday.
Note: This process will advance one day on a holiday Friday.
c)	Junior Non-Rotating employee(s) who are required to be on shift, will be considered as shift personnel for Sunday extra shifts. Once the employee is asked or notified, before the schedule is posted, that he/she is being placed on shift the next week, this becomes his normal shift. This means the employee will not be entitled to a core shift unless all the criteria to go off shift is met.
Note: Weekend workers who have booked on are scheduled first on paid Holidays before utilizing out-of-department employees.
C)	Staffing of Extra Shifts
a)	“Shift” and “Core” - “Shift” employees and “Core” employees are considered as separate groups in administering extra shift overtime. The extra shift list will group employees assigned as “shift” - by each shift and “core”.
i)	“Shift” employees have first opportunity for extra shifts
for their given shifts of the week only. (Note: “Shift” employees who do not work their shifts as scheduled -time of day - for at least three (3) weekdays are considered as “Core”).
ii)	“Shift” employees surplus from their given shifts are
generally not eligible for extra shifts of other production
49
support shifts, and are only considered for “Core” extra shifts after all “Core” employees have had an opportunity, and if they indicate their availability.
iii)	Core employees scheduled for extra shifts “on core” have all rights and responsibilities to an extended or additional assignment that may develop.
iv)	Shift employees scheduled for extra shifts “on shift”, have all rights and responsibilities to an extended or additional shift that may develop.
b)	i) Any employee who trades during the week, Monday through
Friday, will maintain all rights and responsibilities for their normal extra shifts during that week.
ii) Employees who have switched shifts for the week assume the rights, responsibilities, extra shift hours, location on lists, and extra shift rights of the person they have switched with. They, in essence, own the shift they work for the week. As such, when they Book On for extra shifts, they MUST sign for those extra shifts that align with the weekday shifts they actually work during the week, as per section 4.B)9.
c)	In cases of temporary replacements for shift vacancies, the employee normally assigned retains the rights and responsibilities for extra shifts, if available, and if not absent for all regular shifts. Junior non-rotating temporary replacements will be considered as core employees, when relieved of temporary shift assignments.
d)	Employees scheduled for extra shifts may decline a portion of the shift, without charge, if they worked a “stay-over” or “call-in” during the six hours preceding the scheduled extra shift.
Employees declining a portion of an extra shift are required to leave notice of their intentions for supervisors, and must report to work not later than 8 hours out of the plant, provided this allows them to report not later than the mid-point of the extra shift. Hours worked of the extra shift will be hours charged.
e)	For any schedule change for extra shifts, identified forty (40) hours or more in advance of the start of the extra shift, the book on list would be used first in attempting to secure replacements.
For any schedule change for extra shifts, identified less then forty (40) hours in advance of the start of the extra shift, the call in list would be used first in attempting to secure replacements.
D)	Extra Shift Daily Opportunity Stay-over
When employees are unable to complete their planned work assignment within the scheduled extra shifts, or should completion of additional unplanned work assignments be required and extended beyond the
50
scheduled extra shifts employees presently on the shifts may volunteer to complete the work assignments.
Should only one employee of the original crew be required, selection will be based on senior employee lowest in hours.
E)Charged Hours and Overtime Policy
a)	The extra shift list will be divided to indicate “shift” employees by shift, and “core” employees. Employees will be charged either as “shift” or “core” employees - not both - based on their assignments.
Surplus shift employees who volunteer to work core assignments will not be charged; and surplus core employees who volunteer to work shift assignments will not be charged.
Extra shift hours would not be charged for employees who were scheduled on a shift other than their normal bid shift.
As assignments change, employees names will be moved on the list, and accumulated hours will be based on those of the next senior employee to him/her on that “shift” or in the “core”.
A voluntary trade for an individual’s personal reasons is not considered as a change in assignment; hence, names will not be moved on the list, and accumulated hours will not change. Individuals will be charged as if no trade had taken place. Hence, any employee receiving the opportunity will only be charged for any opportunity traded away, and not the opportunity received.
b)	Extra shifts on Saturday will be scheduled for a specific length of time.
The Company will guarantee hours of work at least as scheduled. Should an employee request to go home early after having completed his/her assignment(s), he/she will be charged based on scheduled hours. Charged hours will be 1/4 times hours scheduled, or H/2 hours worked (to a maximum charge of 12 hours) if hours worked exceed hours scheduled.
Hours worked beyond the scheduled extra shift hours will be considered daily opportunity stay over and will be paid at double time.
c)	Extra shifts on Sundays and Holidays will be scheduled for length of time as required to complete the assignment. Charged hours will be at double time based on hours worked to a maximum charge of 16 hours per day.
d)	Any employee absent for any reason from the first extra shift which results in his/her missing subsequent extra shifts involving job continuation will be charged for all extra shifts missed.
51
e)	When the lowest employee(s) extra shift hours reach one thousand (1000), then one thousand (1000) hours will be deducted from everyone on the list.

VACATION SCHEDULING PROCEDURE SECTION 9:02
(a)	Vacations will be granted at such times through the calendar year as is found most suitable, considering both the wishes of the employees and the Company.
However, they will be scheduled in such a manner as to provide for even distribution of the number of people who are absent due to vacation. Vacation weeks will begin on Sunday, however, the Company may permit a change, if practical, for individual employees. Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their department scheduler.
Preference will be indicated in advance, in writing, and separated into two time frames of January 1st to the 2nd Sunday in June, and the 2nd Sunday in June to December 31st,
The following procedure will be utilized:
1,	The minimum allotment allowed will be 15% for vacation. The allotment will be applied on a departmental basis so that the total number of employees absent from the department on vacation at any given time will equal the total allotment and will not be less than 2 employees per week.
84
2.	When the departmental allotment is allocated, it will be applied so that there are an equal number of employees who may be off on vacation on each shift, by seniority. The vacation openings that are left to be filled, will be filled by the senior employee(s) who has/have requested the opening from another shift in the department, except as outlined in (c) i) and ii) below.
3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this
process is not tilled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this time, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.
4.	It is understood that there will be no artificial creation of
overtime due to the process of shift balancing under item 3 above.
5.	In the event that there is a vacation opening that becomes
available after the vacation scheduling process is complete because of the cancellation of scheduled vacation, the senior employee(s) on the shift involved who are on the vacation waiting list will be offered such openings first, then to the other employee(s) by seniority on the waiting list in the department.
6.	As operational needs permit additional openings, the senior
employee(s) on the waiting list will be offered such openings, within the department.
7.	Vacation scheduling for Weekend Workers will be as per
Section 6: 12.
(b)	Vacation lists will be posted prior to October 1st for the first time frame, and prior to April 1st for the second time frame.
Protest of assignment of vacation dates must be made within two weeks following the posting of the lists. Otherwise, allotted dates will be assumed as correct.
(c)	Guidelines for Scheduling
i)	Maintenance by seniority within each Primary and Secondary Trade.
ii)	Storeskeepers by seniority within their classification.
iii)	Packing by seniority within their classifications and shifts.
85
iv)	All other departments by seniority and shifts.
(d)	Employees who are not eligible for three or more weeks vacation will be given preference in selecting their vacations as against the second portion of the vacation of those entitled to three weeks vacation who wish to split such vacation period.
Senior employees who split their vacation but take one portion outside the holiday season (2nd Sunday in June to the year end) will still have preference over junior employees in obtaining one vacation period between the above dates.
(e)	In the event that additional people can be permitted on vacation at any period upon short notice, first consideration will be given to those who did not have sufficient seniority to get a scheduled vacation in either July or August.
(f)	Vacation will be completed each calendar year with the exception as outlined in 9:03.
g) Employees with more than three weeks vacation must take that excess vacation outside of the prime period (2nd Sunday in June to September 1st), unless there are additional openings after all other employees have scheduled their vacation.
VACATION PAY In LIEU OF TIME OFF SECTION 9:03	<£?
In the event an employee has been absent from work during the current calendar year for a full calendar week because of layoff, an excused absence, approved leave of absence or illness, but not because of a disciplinary suspension or dispute between the Company or Union, he/ she may have the option of electing to receive vacation pay in lieu of being required to take vacation time off, to the extent such periods of absence are within the amount of vacation time off for which the employee is eligible.
Employees would not be allowed to work their vacation if regular employees are on layoff.
A minimum of two (2) weeks vacation will be completed each calendar year. Employees entitled to more than two weeks vacation may carryover up to two (2) weeks vacation to be taken the following year.
Employees who carry over vacation must take it between the first full week in January up to the week before March break or in the month of November.
HOLIDAY Within VACATION PERIOD SECTION 9:04
Sundays occurring during vacation period shall count as part of such
86
vacations. If an employee is eligible for a holiday with pay which falls during a regular scheduled vacation week, the Company may grant that holiday off with pay on the last day preceding or the first day following the vacation, but if not convenient to operating schedules, he/she will receive a days pay in lieu of the day off.
VACATION BENEFICIARY

employee shall receive as vacation pay an amount equivalent to 2% of total earnings paid to him/her by the Company during the preceding calendar year.

minimum of twenty-six (26) weeks in a calendar year (one or more days of work to constitute a week) and is off at any point in time during the calendar year on Workers’ Compensation, Weekly Indemnity, Laid Off, or on approved Leave of Absence his/her vacation pay for the following year would be based on forty (40) hours at his/her previous year end rate per week of entitlement, or 2% of his/her previous calendar year’s earnings per week of entitlement, whichever is greater.
To qualify for this, an employee must be off a minimum of two (2) calendar weeks on Workers’ Compensation, Weekly Indemnity, or layoff.
(c)	If an employee qualifies in (b) above and is off work on Workers’ Compensation, those payments would be included in the 2% of previous calendar years earnings calculation.
(d) If an employee does not work a minimum of twenty-six (26) weeks in a calendar year, or works twenty-six (26) weeks but has less than five (5) years service, his/her vacation pay for the following calendar year would be 2% per week of entitlement of his/her previous calendar years earnings.
TERMINATION VACATION PAY
SECTION 9:07
(a) Employees who have ceased to be employed by the Company will
87
receive a cash payment, in lieu of any vacation which they would otherwise have been entitled to take as time off, as at the date of termination, and which they had not already received during the calendar year in which termination occurs. Settlement will be computed for each week not already received, on the basis provided under Section 9:06 above.

If an employee did not wish to actually take time off, but wished to draw money from their banked hours accumulation, they would fill out a form requesting a specific number of hours, indicating clearly on the request, that only draw from
88
the banked funds by specifying the number of hours and cannot go below zero, i.e.: there are no overdraft privileges.

3.	Since the computer payroll system is not able to separate hours worked by date, the Company will process the overtime
89
hours on the employee’s behalf, such that the Labour Distribution and Costing Systems reflect the actual hours worked. Once overtime hours (other than those worked on the standard weekend worker Saturday and Sunday shifts) have been accumulated, the employee is responsible for depositing the equivalent dollar value for the hours banked in his/her banked overtime account.

UNION ACTIVITY
SECTION 13;05
Union activity is not permitted on Company property, or time, except as may be agreed upon by Company and Union.
(a)	Union Representation
The Company agrees that the Chief Steward will be privileged to visit any part of the plant in order to investigate a specific grievance which has not been settled within the department in accordance with the regular grievance procedure, and must attempt to contact the Supervisor of the department which he/she wishes to visit. Stewards or other Union Representatives and Officers shall avoid neglecting their regular jobs during work hours or interfering with the work of others. In the event that it is necessary to investigate a matter immediately, such a Representative shall be excused from his/her job for a short period by contacting his/her supervisor and arrangements will be made to have his/her job taken care of. With respect to this latter point, it is understood that in many situations, a job can be taken care of by fellow crew members without the necessity for a specific replacement, where on other occasions, a specific replacement may be necessary. The Union pledges that their Representatives will not abuse the arrangement. This does not represent a new plan, but is purely an explanation of a past practice which is to be continued.
(b)Chief Steward & President
The Company and the Union agree to allow the President and the Chief Steward to have the option of working day shift during the incumbents’ term of office.
It is agreed these positions are not an addition to the crew and may result in the displacement of a junior employee. This letter does not connote a change in the method of conducting Union business. Members of the Union Committee or Stewards shall not leave their work stations without authorization from their supervisors. It is understood that either party may terminate the above portion (refers to (b) portion) should it become unsatisfactory.
Assignments of extra shifts to the Chief Steward and the President will be on day shift only, according to the following guidelines:
1.	His/her hours will be recorded on one list for Saturdays and Sundays/Holidays and also according to the shift (A, B, or
C)	on which the assignment extra shift happens to fall.
2.	For extra shift assignments (A, B, or C shifts) the Chief Steward and/or the President of the Union will take the hours
97
of the next senior employee plus applicable charged hours (if any) from the previous week to determine as to whether they are to be scheduled.
(c)	In cases where the Employee Relations Department requests the
attendance of the Chief Steward and it is necessary to call this person into work, the Company will pay the hours involved. The decision of payment will be the exclusive right of the Company.
(d)	If an employee on weekend work accepts an Executive Board position or an employee already holding an Executive Board office successfully bids a weekend worker position his/her weekend worker job would be posted as a temporary bid and held until he/ she no longer holds an Executive Board office.
ABSENCE FOR UNION BUSINESS
Elected Officers of the Union who may be called upon to transact business for the Union which requires their absence from duty with the Company shall, upon application and six (6) hours notice to the proper representative of the Company, be allowed to absent themselves sufficient time to transact such business. The Company will likewise cooperate, if requested three (3) days in advance, by excusing up to (3) employees who may be selected by theUnion, to serve as delegates at a conference or convention for the Union, providing satisfactory arrangements can be made for their replacement.
Any regular employee who may be elected to a political office or appointed to the Canadian Labour Congress and/or provincial body or an office in the International Union which will require the employee to be absent from work with the Company for an extended period of time shall be granted a leave of absence without pay to serve in such office. At the expiration of such term of office, employee shall be reinstated to former classification including all seniority rights. It is understood that in case of the return of such an employee, other employees will consent to such demotions as are necessary to make room for said employee.
The Company will agree to include the Union Executives hours in the calculation of regular hours worked for the purpose of overtime limitations.

HEALTH CARE PROGRAM
I	Ontario HEALTH & HOSPITAL INSURANCE
A wide scope of benefits for medical and hospital services are provided for you and your eligible dependents. Coverage is automatic in Ontario where health insurance is funded by employers through payroll taxes.
All information outlined is subject to the current provisions of the Ontario Health Insurance Act and is subject to any changes in its provisions.
Doctor's Services
The plan provides coverage for the services of doctors in the home, the doctor’s office or a hospital. Ontario has its own government health plan which pays most basic medical, surgical and hospital expenses for you and your eligible dependents.
Hospital Services
The following services are usually provided in an approved public hospital:
■	standard ward accommodation
■	necessary nursing care
■	prescribed drugs and surgical supplies.
Your local Ontario health insurance office provides a booklet that describes the benefits more fully. It also lists eligible dependents and explains procedures for making claims. Check the blue pages of your telephone book for the closest office.
Emergency Out-Of-Province Coverage
OHIP provides coverage both outside Ontario and Canada. The Travel Plan pays most additional costs not covered by OHIP. You usually have to pay for the services first and then present a paid, itemized bill to OHIP for reimbursement. Details of out-of-province coverage are also in the Ontario health insurance booklet.

HOW TO SUBMIT A CLAIM
All claim forms, available from your Plan Administrator, must be correctly completed, dated and signed. Remember, always provide your Group Policy Number and your Certificate number (found on your Group Benefit Card) to avoid any unnecessary delays in the processing of your claim.
119
Your Plan Administrator can assist you in properly completing the forms, and answer any questions you may have about the claims process and your Group Benefit Program.
After completing the appropriate form, you can mail your Extended Health Care and Dental claims directly to the carrier.
Payment of Extended Health Care and Dental Claims
Once the claim has been processed, the carrier will send you a Claim
Statement.
The top portion of this form outlines the claim or claims made, the amount subtracted to satisfy deductibles, and the benefit percentage used to determine the final payment to be made to you. If you have any questions on the amount, your Plan Administrator will help explain.
The bottom portion of this form is your claims payment, if applicable Simply tear along the perforated line, endorse the back of the cheque and you can cash it at any chartered bank or trust company.
You should receive settlement of your claim within three weeks from the date of submission to the carrier. If you have not received payment, please contact your Plan Administrator.
CO-ORDINATION OF EXTENDED HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL CARE BENEFITS
If you or your dependents are insured for similar benefits under another Plan (e.g. Group Life and Health Program, or other arrangements covering individuals in a group), the carrier will take this into account when determining the amount of expenses payable under this program.
This process is known as Co-ordination of Benefits. It allows for reimbursement of insured medical and dental expenses from all Plans, up to a total of 100% of the actual expense incurred.
Order of Benefit Payment
A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the “Primary Carrier” (i.e. responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the “Secondary Carrier” (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).
■	If the other Plan does not provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, it will be considered as the Primary Carrier, and will be responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense.
■	If the other Plan does provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, the following rules are applied to determine which Plan is the Primary Carrier.
■ For Claims incurred by you or your Dependent Spouse:
120
The Plan insuring you or your Dependent Spouse as an employee / member pays benefits before the Plan insuring you or your Spouse as a dependent.
In situations where you or your Spouse have coverage as an employee / member under more than one Plan, the order of benefit payment will be determined as follows:
■	The Plan where the person is covered as an active fulltime employee, then
■	The Plan where the person is covered as an active parttime employee, then
■	The Plan where the person is covered as a retiree.
■ For Claims incurred by your Dependent Child:
The Plan covering the parent whose birthday (month/day) is earlier in the calendar year pays benefits first. If both parents have the same birthdate, the Plan covering the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet pays first.
However, if you and your Spouse are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
■	The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
■	The Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child (i.e. if the parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse’s Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child), then
■	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
■	The Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child (i.e. if the parent without custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse’s Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child).
■	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Plans.
■	If the order of benefit payment cannot be determined from the above, the benefits payable under each Plan will be in proportion to the amount that would have been payable if Coordination of Benefits did not exist.
121
Submitting a Claim for Co-ordination of Benefits
To submit a claim when Co-ordination of Benefits applies, refer to the following guidelines:
■	As per the Order of Benefit Payment section, determine which Plan is the Primary Carrier and which is the Secondary Carrier.
■	Submit all necessary claim forms and original receipts to the Primary Carrier.
■	Keep a photocopy of each receipt or ask the Primary Carrier to return the original receipts to you once your claim has been settled.
■	Once your claim has been settled by the Primary Carrier, you will receive a statement outlining how your claim has been handled. Submit this statement along with all necessary claim forms to the Secondary Carrier for further consideration or payment, if applicable.
III	TRAVEL PLAN OUT-OF-PROVINCE/OUT-OF-CANADA
The following benefits provide emergency medical protection when travelling (for other than health reasons) or vacationing outside your province of residence for up to 183 days..
REIMBURSEMENT
No deductible, 100% reimbursement of eligible charges.
Note:	None of these benefits will be paid for any condition resulting
from a mental disorder; or to patients in chronic care hospitals, chronic units of general hospitals, or nursing homes.
DESCRIPTION OF BENEFITS
(a)	Payment for the cost of hospital accommodation which is in excess of the amount paid by OHIP or any other Plan.
(b)	Payment for charges made by physicians when such charges are
over and above the allowance made by OHIP.
(c)	When illness or injury is such that you must fly home and the physician or commercial airline stipulates in writing that you must be accompanied by a qualified medical attendant, the insurance carrier pays the costs incurred for one round trip economy fare for the medical attendant (not a relative), and extra costs for the number of economy seats required to return the covered person, by most direct route, to the air terminal nearest the departure point in Canada.
(d)	Subject to payment by OHIP charges made by chiropractors,
chiropodists and podiatrists to a maximum of $10.00 Canadian per treatment date.
122
HOW TO CLAIM BENEFITS
When eligible expenses are incurred outside your province of residence, request detailed receipts (in duplicate if possible). Send one set of receipts to OHIP for their consideration and payment. When they have replied, send original proof of their payment together with receipts and a completed claim form to your insurance carrier for payment of remaining eligible benefits. Payment will be made in Canadian currency, based on the rate of exchange in effect at the conclusion of the service rendered as determined by any Canadian Chartered Bank. Please note that claims in foreign languages require an accompanying translation.
IV	SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL HOSPITAL BENEFIT
If you, or a covered dependent, are confined in a licensed hospital within Canada, you will be eligible for accommodation up to the level of a semi-private room plus the daily co-insurance charge (if applicable). If confined in a private room, payment will be based on the hospital’s charge for semi-private room and board. You should pay for the private room charges and then make a separate claim to the insurance carrier for the private room differential.
Charges must be reasonable and customary in the area where hospitalization occurs.
SUBMITTING A CLAIM
To submit an Extended Health Benefit claim, you must complete an Extended Health Care Claim Form which is available from Employee Relations.
Once you have completed the form, attach all applicable receipts and mail it directly to the insurance carrier.
All claims must be submitted within 12 months after the date the expense was incurred. However, upon termination of your insurance, all claims must be submitted no later than 90 days from the termination date.
CO-ORDINATION OF BENEFITS (See page 119)
EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE
Your coverage, as well as your dependents’, is automatically effective on the first day of the month following successful completion of the probationary period of at least three days per week for 10 consecutive weeks of full-time employment.
If you are initially insured for single coverage and later acquire a dependent, your dependent will be enrolled in the plan. You must advise your Employee Relations Department as soon as possible of your change in status.
123
If one of your dependents is hospitalized (other than new-born infant) on the date coverage would normally become effective, coverage will commence on the day following discharge from the hospital. Once you are insured for dependent coverage, additional dependents will be insured from the date eligible regardless of hospital confinement.
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
Insurance for you and your dependents will end when you leave the company. Any expenses incurred before that date will be covered in the normal way.
V	DENTAL CARE
The Dental Plan is provided to encourage regular preventative care by paying up to 100% of the cost of routine dental treatment according to the negotiated Provincial Schedule of Fees approved by the Company. The plan also pays up to 80% of the cost of major restorative and 50% of the cost of orthodontic services for your dependent children.
EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE
Your coverage, as well as your dependents’, is effective on the first day of the month following completion of the probationary period of at least three days per week for 10 consecutive weeks of full-time employment.
If you are initially insured for single coverage, and later acquire a dependent, your dependent will be enrolled in the plan. You should advise your Employee Relations Department as soon as possible of your change in status.
MAXIMUM BENEFIT
The maximum amount payable per individual for routine Treatment and Major Restorative combined is $2,000 per calendar year. The maximum for Orthodontic Services is $2,000 for a lifetime.
ELIGIBLE EXPENSES
Eligible Expenses are those which are recommended as necessary by a physician or dentist that are not in excess of the fee specified in the applicable Dental Association Fee Schedule.
There are several dental procedures which are covered by OHIP up to certain maximums. If the dentist or dental surgeon chooses to charge more than that payable by OHIP, legislation in Ontario does not permit the excess charges to be eligible under this plan.
Situations may arise where alternate methods of treatment may be available. It is solely for you and your dentist to decide which method will be employed. As the basis for determining its liability, the insurance company reserves the right to reimburse charges based on the least
124
expensive method of treatment that would provide a professionally adequate result.

TERMINATION OF INSURANCE
Insurance for you and your dependents will cease on the earliest of the following events:
1,	Termination of your employment.
2,	If you should die. However, depending on your years of service, dependent coverage may be continued.
3,	Termination of Policy.
4,	On the date you reach age 65.
5,	Upon early retirement, unless service requirements (see quick reference charts) for continuation of coverage to age 65 are met.
TREATMENT PLAN
In order for you and your dentist to learn in advance what cost sharing there may be, it is recommended that a Treatment Plan be tiled whenever the total cost of the proposed dental work is expected to exceed $300.00.
This Treatment Plan identifies coverage and limitations for specific services and clarifies insurance percentages, specific limits and Dental Fee Guide allowance before dental treatment commences. The Treatment Plan is not intended to limit you in your choice of dentist, to tell you or your dentist what treatment should be performed, or to tell the dentist what fee to charge, nor to guarantee reimbursement after coverage ceases.
A Treatment Plan is a plan of dental treatment (including X-rays if required) showing the patient’s dental needs, a written description of the proposed treatment necessary in the professional judgment of the dentist, and the cost of the proposed treatment. It should be forwarded to your Employee Relations Department for validation.
EXPENSES NOT COVERED
No payment will be made for:
1.	Self-inflicted injuries or illness while sane or insane.
2.	Any injury or illness for which the insured person is entitled to indemnity or compensation under any workers’ compensation act.
3.	Charges levied by a physician or dentist for time spent travelling, broken appointments, transportation costs, room rental charges or for advice given by telephone or other means of telecommunication.
4.	Cosmetic surgery or treatment unless such surgery or treatment is for accidental injuries and commenced within 90 days of an accident.
5.	Injury resulting directly or indirectly from insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country or participation in a riot.
6.	Services, treatments or supplies payable by, or insurable only by, a government plan.
7.	Examinations required for the use of a third party.
130
8.	Dental treatment received from a dental or medical department maintained by an employer, an association, or a labour union.
9.	The replacement of an existing appliance which has been lost, islaid or stolen.
10.	Services and supplies rendered for full mouth re-construction, for
a vertical dimension correction, or for a correction of Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction.

INCOME PROTECTION PROGRAM I WEEKLY INCOME (SHORT TERM DISABILITY)
Weekly Indemnity benefits provide a portion of your salary during the first 52 weeks of recognized absence from work. If you are still totally
131
disabled after 52 weeks, the Total Disability benefit will pay monthly installations of your life insurance. Under certain circumstances, you may be eligible to receive disability income payments from the Canada/ Quebec Pension Plan, Workers’ Compensation or Unemployment Insurance Commission.
The Company pays the full cost of the Weekly Indemnity and Total Disability Benefits.
*******
The Company’s Short Term Disability Program (Weekly Indemnity) is registered with the Unemployment Insurance Commission. Consequently, the Company receives a preferential rate when computing its unemployment insurance liability. The resultant savings to the Company has been used to upgrade your benefits plans.
This plan provides a portion of your income when non-occupational illness or injury prevents you from working.
ELIGIBILITY
All full-time employees who are actively at work are eligible for coverage. Coverage becomes effective on the first day of the month following completion of the probationary period.
THE BENEFIT Benefit Amount
Your Weekly Income Benefit Amount is determined as follows:
■ Your Card Rate times forty (40) times Sixty-Six (66) Percent.
Qualifying Period - Benefits are paid from the 1 st scheduled working day of disability due to accidental bodily injury, provided you have had qualified medical attention or from the 3rd scheduled working day of disability due to sickness. Payment of benefits is conditional upon your being under the care of a qualified physician. If you have not consulted a qualified physician by the day you would ordinarily receive benefits due to sickness or accident, benefits will not begin until the first day of medical attention. Payment will be made at the end of each week for which satisfactory proof of disability has been received, for a period not exceeding 52 weeks for any one period of disability. If you are confined to hospital prior to the date benefits would normally commence, benefits will be paid from the first day of hospitalisation, provided you are a registered bed patient who has been formally admitted and assigned to a bed in a hospital on a physician’s order. However, if an employee is not confined to a hopital, but had surgery done on an out- patient basis, benefits will be paid from the first day.
The weekly indemnity benefits will be reduced by the following income: a) Income replacement indemnity payable under any government plan
132
or automobile insurance which has been approved as an acceptable limitation by Unemployment Insurance legislation
b)	Disability benefits payable under the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (including benefits for dependents but excluding benefits payable directly to dependents)
c)	Earnings or payments from any employer
The benefit shall not be reduced by subsequent cost of living increases in income for any other source.
RECURRENT DISABILITY
If you are totally disabled on the date the insurance terminates, you will be eligible to receive benefits, provided the disability continued uninterrupted, but not beyond the earliest of:
a)	the date total disability ceases
b)	after 52 weeks have elapsed
EXCEPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
No payment will be made for claims resulting from:
■	A disability due to any cause at any time when you are on pregnancy leave of absence in accordance with the pregnancy leave provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Commission.
If you become disabled prior to such leave of absence, you are eligible for benefits, however, once such disability extends into the leave of absence, benefits are suspended for the duration of the pregnancy leave.
If you are unable, because of disability, to return to work as scheduled after a pregnancy leave of absence, you are eligible for commencement or continuation of benefit payments on your intended date of return. This is regardless of whether disability arose prior to or during the leave of absence.
■	A disability for which you are not under the continuing care of a qualified physician.
■	Intentional self-inflicted injuries or illness while sane or insane.
■	Any disability for which you are entitled to indemnity or compensation under any Workers’ Compensation Act.
■	Bodily injury resulting directly or indirectly from insurrection, war, or participation in a riot.

1)	The date of your total disability ends;
2)	If you fail to submit to a medical examination requested by the insurance company;
3)	The date your insurance would normally cease if you were not disabled;
4)	When you reach age 65;
5)	If the insurance company’s request for proof of continuing total disability are not answered after 2 months.

RETIREMENT INCOME AND SAVINGS PROGRAM
I RETIREMENT INCOME PLANS
The Company retirement plan is based on your service after January 1, 1980. You will also receive any pension benefits you may have earned under the former pension plans such as the Profit Sharing.
The Company pays the full cost of the Kellogg Retirement Income Plan. ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP
Regular full-time employees are automatically included in the retirement plan after completing on:: year of continuous service.
NORMAL RETIREMENT PENSION

This plan provides a pension income at age 65, based on your credited, or length of service in any year as follows:
Hours Worked	Credited Service
0 - 349 350 - 749 750 - 1,124 1,125 - 1,499 1,500 or more
0	year % year Zi year % year

Monthly Defined Benefit
Pension	April 18	April 17	April 15

This plan covers only your service with the Company from January l*1, 1980. Any pension benefits you may have earned from former plans are in addition to the pension from this Retirement Income Plan.
ANNUAL BENEFITS STATEMENT
Your annual benefits statement shows your pension earned to date and estimates your pension for future service based on your current earnings
139
and the current levels of the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan and Old Age Security. These levels may change each year and your estimated total pension will change accordingly. The nearer you get to age 65, the more accurate the total estimated pension on your benefits statement will be.
EARLY RETIREMENT
You may retire and receive a pension any time after reaching age 55. Certain subsidies may apply according to your years of service and your age.
■	If age 55 or over and age plus years of service total 85 or more, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension with no reduction.
Furthermore you receive a Bridge Benefit of $12 a month for each year of service to a maximum of $360 a month. This Bridge Benefit is paid until age 65 at which time the government pensions begin.
■	With 20 years of service, but age plus years of service are less than 85, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced. The reduction is 2% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age 62, down to age 60 and then 4% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age 60.
■	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age 62. There are no adjustments to the calculation after age 62.
PENSION PAYMENT OPTIONS
SPOUSAL
If you have a spouse when you retire, the Pension Benefits Act states that your pension must be paid on a joint and survivor basis with at least 60% of the pension payable to you continuing to your spouse after your death, should your spouse survive you.
If you have a spouse but wish to select a form other than the Joint and 60% Survivor form then you and your spouse must sign a Spousal Waiver form.
LIFE ONLY
If you do not have a spouse when you retire, the normal form of pension is “Life Only” which means that payments stop when you die.
LIFE - GUARANTEED 5, 10 OR 15 YEARS
Under each of these options, the pension is payable for as long as you live. If you should die before the guaranteed period ends, pension
140
payments are continued to your beneficiary for the balance of the guaranteed period.
TERMINATION BENEFITS
If you leave the Company after completing 3 or more years of service you will be entitled to a deferred pension payable at age 65.
You may elect to transfer the commuted present value of the earned pension to a “locked-in” vehicle. Locked-in pension amounts must be used to purchase a life annuity at retirement unless paid as a death benefit prior to retirement.
You will be 100% vested for all earned benefits in this Plan as well as any benefits you may have earned from former plans, after 3 years of service for full-time employees.
You earn one year of service for each year you have worked 1500 hours in a calendar year.
BENEFITS ON DEATH
If you have less than 2 years of participation in the plan, there is no death benefit. If you should die after completing 2 or more years of participation in the Plan, your beneficiary or estate will receive the value of your pension accrued at date of death.
SPECIAL DISABILITY PROVISION
If you become disabled, you may be entitled to receive a disability retirement benefit provided you have at least 10 years of continuous service. This will be based on your accrued pension at the time you become disabled. The Plan will pay a monthly pension as though you had retired at the time you become disabled.
IF YOU DIE BEFORE RETIREMENT
If you have less than 2 years of participation in the plan, there is no death benefit. If you should die after completing 2 or more years of participation in the Plan your beneficiary or estate will receive the value of your pension accrued at date of death.
In addition, any death benefits from previous plans would be payable. IF YOU DIE DURING RETIREMENT
If you elected at the time of retirement to provide a continuing payment to your spouse or beneficiary in the event of your death and the conditions of that payment are still applicable, payment will be made to them as you directed. If you retired prior to age 65 and were receiving a bridge benefit at the time of your death this payment would not continue to your spouse or beneficiary.
141
OTHER BENEFITS AT RETIREMENT
SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL AND EXTEND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS
Your coverage is continued under these health insurance plans at normal retirement.

V	STOCK PURCHASE PLAN FEATURES OF THE PLAN
Kellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder of Kellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 U.S. per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan. Shares will be purchased by Harris Bank for employees on
146
the open market Dividends are reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for: Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.) However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and payment to the Harris Bank will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Harris Bank a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
Harris Bank will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Harris Bank protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
HOW THE PLAN WORKS
You may sign up to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the payroll deduction form (see your Employee Relations office). The following guidelines apply:
■	Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this stock purchase plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes significantly in foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this minimum amount may have to be changed.
■	Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S. (in total) per year.
■	A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
■	The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
■	Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
■	You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Harris Bank will be refunded to you.
Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at the time of each dividend payment. Since dividends
147
are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three decimal places.
Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
At year-end, Harris Bank will provide you with information on the payment of brokerage charges and bank service charges. Payment of these charges on your behalf must be reported as income for tax purposes.
PURCHASE OF SHARES THROUGH CASH PAYMENT
■	Cash payments of $25 U.S. (minimum) to $25,000 U.S. (in total) during any calendar year for purchase of shares can be made by sending cheques directly to Harris Bank at any time. Kellogg Company or Kellogg Canada Inc. will not handle voluntary cash purchases.
■	Harris Bank will purchase shares on or about the 15th of each month. Cheques received on or after the purchase date will be held until the next month.
■	If shares are not purchased by the 15th of the month preceding a dividend payment, no dividend will be paid on the newly purchased shares until the next quarter.
SAFEKEEPING OF SHARES
■	For your convenience, Harris Bank will hold the shares it has purchased for you. Whole and fractional shares will be held in a dividend reinvestment account. You may also deliver for safekeeping any Kellogg Company stock you already hold. Upon written request, Harris Bank will issue you certificates for any or all of the full shares credited to your account, and you may continue to reinvest dividends on those shares.
■	Any employee who withdraws his or her shares from the custody of Harris Bank may subsequently sell these shares only through a broker registered under the securities act of the province in which he or she resides. The employee is responsible for the brokerage fees.
