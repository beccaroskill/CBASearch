BANKING OF OVERTIME
It is understood and agreed that an employee may at his discretion apply all or a portion of his overtime hours towards an equivalent amount of hours of time off using the appropriate overtime rate. For example, an employee who works one hour of double time his regular rate shall be reimbursed in one of the following ways:
1)	Paid at two (2) times his regular wage rate, or;
2)	Upon Supervisor approval and provided the time off does not impact upon the operation or cause any additional costs, the employee would be granted two (2) hours time off at his regular wage rate.
The following controls will apply to the banking of overtime:
a)	The maximum number of hours that may be banked in a calendar year by any employee shall be 80 hours at any one time. Once an employee has drawn on the bank either by taking these hours as time off or cashed out, an employee will be allowed to replenish the bank to the maximum cap of eighty (80) hours. The maximum number of hours that an employee may take as time off will be limited to eighty hours (80) per year.
b)	The intent of this plan is that employees take significant blocks of time off at any one time, i.e. one (1) week. Time off for periods as short as one (1) day will be granted on occasions where reasonable notice is given and shift change premium is not required for the man's replacement and subject to point (2) above.
c)	Banked time is accumulated over a calendar year. Employees are not required to take their banked time off during the calendar year in which it was accumulated but must use their entitlement by March 31st of the following year. To qualify for using this entitlement in the period
78
December 1 to March 31, the employee must have previously scheduled his vacation entitlements. Banked time off not taken by the March 31st deadline will be paid at the rate it was banked. Banked time off may be taken between September 1st and April 30th. Time off will be arranged by requests to the immediate Supervisor, and such requests shall be accommodated where time off does not interfere with the operation of the plant and subject to point (2) above. Following the finalization of the vacation schedule on March 31 of each year, requests for remaining vacation and banked time off will be considered and approved on a first come first served basis. The scheduling process of vacations prior to March 31 shall take preference over the scheduling process of banked overtime in the event of any conflict. Requests for banked time will be approved only after the banked time has been accumulated and will be confirmed the week before by Friday 10:00 am.
d)	Maintenance department employees may not take their accumulated time off during the annual overhaul periods, but their requests for time off outside September 1st to April 30th will be granted where possible.
e)	Employees may, at their discretion, request payment in cash for overtime hours banked. All such requests must be made in writing and signed by the employee making the request. Overtime monies will be included in the employee's regular direct deposit pay following the request provided a minimum of one (1) week's notice is received prior to issuing direct deposit.

Sick Credit Top-up Bank
The following will outline how this bank will operate.
Regular status employees will on an annual basis bank all unused sick day credits in the sick credit top-up bank. These employees may use this bank to provide for top-up pay to bring the employee's weekly rate up to regular full pay while the employee is on W.I., W.C.B., or L.T.D. The employee is not allowed to use this bank to earn more than his regular hourly rate while on any of the programs mentioned above (for example, the employee's daily rate shall not exceed 8 hours multiplied by his regular hourly rate).
Credits that go into the bank will be valued at the employee's hourly rate as of December 31 of the year the credits are from (for example, if the employee has 8 hours of credit to go into the bank and his hourly rate is $22.10, the value that goes into the bank is $176.80). This calculation will be done in January of each year.
