(17.7)	Job Elimination/Combination Bumping Procedures
The Company will notify the Association of any job eliminations or job combinations and give in writing details of such changes at least twenty (20) working clays in advance.
Job Elimination:
A job elimination occurs in the following circumstances:
. the job is permanently transferred to a different shift
• the work required to be performed is discontinued
. when a job combination occurs between two (2) or more shifts the work transferred from the originating shift on which the work was performed will be deemed to be a job elimination on that shift and handled accordingly.
Note:	A job is not eliminated by reason of the start time
changing within the same shift.
The individual directly affected must secure job ownership by either applying for job vacancies (Articles 18.2/18.3 -Process/Plant-Wide Posting) or by bumping to junior seniority positions within the Process.
The only purpose of the bumping procedure is for job ownership. If bumping applies it will be after the 20 days notice.
Job Combination Procedure:
A job combination occurs when:
1.	Two (2) or more jobs on the same shift are combined and in such case the employee(s) with the least seniority will be bumped;
2.	When a job is changed such that some of the work is allocated to other shift(s), the work remaining on the shift will be treated as a job combination on that shift. The work transferred to another shift(s) is considered a job elimination on the
originating shift. In such cases there are no bumping rights across shift(s) for the displaced employee(s) on the originating shift(s).
The bumped employee(s) will proceed through the bumping
procedure under job elimination.
Bumping Procedure:
1 An employee whose job was eliminated/combined must fill any vacancy on their shift, by seniority and ability, that becomes available under the process job posting procedures. If the job vacancy is on a different shift the employee may elect one of the following options:
a)	If the number of employee job eliminalion/combinations on a shift is greater than the number of vacancies available, and if the most junior employee(s) jobs are not affected, the senior displaced employee has the option of filling a vacancy or bumping the junior employee.
b)	The employee may displace the most junior employee in their process on their shift. If they are unable to perform the job of the most junior employee, they may displace the second least senior employee on their shift and so on until they reach a job they can perform consistent with their seniority rights. Note: When an employee displaces a junior employee under this Article 17.7 they shall acquire job ownership of that job. If there is no vacancy in the process and there are farmed-in employees in the process, the employee whose job was eliminated/combined, may choose to bump a farmed-in employee rather than bump the junior employee.
c)	The employee may choose to transfer to a vacant job in the plant according to the Collective Agreement.
2. Once all job vacancies are filled, any additional displaced employees must bump a junior employee in their process to obtain job ownership. The junior employee bumped off their
shift will have the option of bumping the most junior employee in the process on any remaining shifts. If they are unable to perform the job of the junior employee they are entitled to bump, they can move up the seniority list as described in 1 i3
3.	The junior employee bumped out of their process must apply for all job postings (Article 18.2 and 18.3) or they will be placed in any job vacancy in the plant. If there is no vacancy, the employee will have the choice of replacing any temporary work assignment in the plant or displacing the most junior employee in the plant providing they have fifteen (15) months or more seniority. If they are unable to perform the most junior job, the employee will move up the seniority list as described in 1B.
4.	When a number of employees are displaced due to job elimination, the corresponding number of least senior jobs in the process and/or plant, whichever is applicable, will be identified and the most senior of the displaced employees can choose the job they want. In the event that two or more of the same job classification are identified within this group of least senior jobs, the junior employee in the job classification will be first to be displaced. This process will continue in order of seniority until all employees are assigned job ownership. If one of the displaced employees is unable to perform the job to which their seniority entitles them, they may move up the seniority list until they reach a job they can perform consistent with their seniority rights.
5.	If the employee is unable to bump in accordance with the above steps they will be laid off.
6.	When one or more jobs are eliminated or combined, the affected employee(s) within the process will have recall rights if the job is reinstated by 50% of its original form. Employees with less than fifteen (15) months seniority have twelve (12) months recall rights and employees with more than fifteen (15) months seniority have twenty-four (24) months recall rights.
Al
7.	An employee displaced from their process will have recall rights only to their process if additional full-time staff is required, subject to the above time limits, prior to applying Article 18.3. The Director of Meat Manufacturing will determine if full-time staff is required following discussion with the S.E.A. President or a delegate.
8.	Employees who voluntarily transfer under Article 18.2 from the job to which they were assigned or bumped into as a result of their job elimination/combination, will retain recall rights as specified in this section. Employees who voluntarily transfer to another process under Article 18.3 from the job to which they are assigned or bumped into as a result of their own job elimination/combination, will lose their recall rights.
9.	Employees who do not have fifteen (15) months or more seniority can exercise their seniority rights in accordance with steps 1,2 and 3.
Note:	The Company and the Association President and/or
delegate plus the process steward will mutually determine if any employee is able to perform any job to which their seniority entitles them. Any disagreements regarding an employee's ability to perform a job may be entered as a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
Note:	An employee who has availed themself of the transfer
option contained in Article 17.7 will be eligible by seniority to secure job ownership of any new job created in the process where their job elimination occurred, prior to the affected date of elimination.
Rates Of Pay:
An employee will have their rate of pay adjusted at the beginning of the first pay period following six (6) months from the date of their job elimination/combination. Employees who have not acquired job ownership during this time will be paid the rate of the job they are performing.
Job Transfers:
A job transfer will occur when the relocation of duties, product, equipment or such, results in additional jobs in
the receiving process.
1.	When a job is transferred to another process or operation, the employee who has job ownership has the option of moving with the job.
If the employee elects not to follow the job, the following will apply.
2.	A. The job being transferred will be offered in order of
seniority to the employees in the process it is leaving.
B.	If no employee volunteers to move with the job to the process, the job will be posted in accordance with the job posting procedure.
C.	The employee who had job ownership and who elected not to move with the job, will exercise their seniority rights and follow the bumping procedure as described in Article 17.7.

The shift covered will be whatever shift becomes vacant due to the layoff, resignation, or transfer.
-	Employee on day shift are expected to cover for vacations, sickness and time off due to accidents for those on 3-11 and 11-7 shifts. This will be covered on a voluntary basis. If there are no volunteers and the absence is for one week or less, the junior employee on day shift will be transferred to the required shift. If the absence is for more than one week and there are no volunteers, the shift will be covered on a rotating bases, one week at a time by reverse seniority.

- Continuous Improvement Program
Mr. Charles l.osier President
Schneider Employees Association 321 Courtland Avenue E.
Kitchener, Ontario N2G 3X8
Dear Mr. Losier
RE: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
I want to confirm the commitment I gave to you relative to the continuous improvement program underway in the organization. Specifically, I stated that full-time employees who have a job elimination/combination which is identified through a V.A.M. project, will be utilized until a permanent opening occurs to which they can obtain job ownership via Article 17.7. Permanent job vacancies will occur as a result of retirements, resignations, discharge, death, etc., and when such vacancies occur employees must apply or will be assigned job ownership according the Collective Agreement.
The Company will notify the Association of job elimination/ combinations resulting from a V.A.M. project, together with job openings that occur, to ensure that displaced full-time employees are permanently reassigned.
As much as possible, employees will be assigned to their same shift provided this can be done consistent with the Collective Agreement.
Also the Company agrees there will be no Self Directed Work Team during this Agreement.
