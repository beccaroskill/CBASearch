LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Reference:	Foremen and Leadhands
October 26,1990
The parties recognize that a Lead Hand is essentially a working foreman. They also recognize that the restrictions on foreman working have caused a number of grievances and operating difficulties that the parties wish to avoid.
Therefore, it is agreed that:
° the "foreman” classification will no longer be used and all references to foremen will be deleted from the collective agreement;
the following named employees who currently hold the classification of foreman will become leadhands in their respective departments and work in accordance with Article 26.04
*	Boris Baran
*	Chris Vanderkamp
the named individuals will continue to earn their current wage rates until such time as the wage rates for lead hands exceed the current foreman’s rate (i.e. they will have their current wage rate "red circled”) and under no circumstances will these individuals earn less than their current rate as a
45
result of the elimination of the foreman classification;
0 the designation of these individuals as lead hands rather than foreman will not be used to reduce the number of employees in these departments; and
° other than the named individuals, all other lead hands will be appointed in accordance with Article 26.04.
While it is not the Company’s intention to reduce the number of positions in these departments now or in the future as a result of the elimination of the foreman classification, the parties recognize that any special benefits or guarantees that apply to the three named individuals to compensate them for this change shall not continue for any other individuals after these individuals terminate employment or cease to hold their current positions.
****************************************************************************************************
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Reference:	Article 6.03 (b) Contracting Out
December 22,1989
It is agreed between the parties that for the purposes of Article 6.03 (b) the definition of “work” means the regular and normal maintenance function and any construction work that in the past has been performed by the Tradesmen and which is work normally done by the Tradesmen which in all the circumstances would be reasonable for the Tradesmen with seniority to perform.
It is further agreed that this is the interpretation of Article 6.03 (b) for the purpose of the “work” defined above; there shall be deemed to be added to the sixth (6th) line of the Article, after the word “lay-off, the phrase “who would normally perform the work...” This interpretation shall not change the language of Article 6.03 (b). It is for the purposes of interpretation only.
****************************************************************************************************
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Reference: Article 10.02	August 16, 1993
The parties agree to delete Article 10.02 - Regular Employee List - from the collective agreement and re-number the remaining clauses of the article appropriately as the Regular Employee List no longer exists.
However, the following named employees, who held "regular employee” status prior to February 28,1975, shall retain all of the rights to which they were entitled under Article 10.02 - Regular Employees List. This means that, for as long as they remain Sun-Rype employees, they will have the equivalent of DE status, whether they continue to hold a DE position or not.

Employees covered by this letter of understanding are:
Gordon Hamm Jerome Veller Rodney Rath Armand Vermette Umber-toCagnoni Richard Hawley George Hermanson

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Reference:	Article 20 - Hours of Work	August 16, 1993
The Company and the Union recognize that the Company will have to implement alternative shift schedules that incorporate Saturday and/or Sunday work in order to remain competitive and attract new business to the company’s operations in the future. Further, the parties recognize that many of the details of such schedules are not known at this time and must be defined at the time new business is attracted which requires the implementation of such schedules.
Therefore the parties agree that, as the need arises in the future, such alternative schedules will be developed and implemented in accordance with the following.
1.	A joint union/management committee will be established to investigate and report on all matters relating to the implementation of non-standard work schedules, The committee will be comprised of three (3) representatives of the Company and three (3) of the Union and will present its findings and recommendations to the Vice President, Production and the Chief Shop Steward or the Business Agent as soon as possible.
If the parties are in agreement regarding the recommendations of the committee, a Letter of Understanding will be prepared and signed to govern the implementation of alternative work week schedules. If agreement cannot be reached regarding the method of implementation of new schedules by the union/management committee, the parties agree to submit those implementation issues that remain in dispute between the parties to a grievance panel or arbitrator for resolution.
2.	Any work week schedule that involves Saturday and/or Sunday work will attract a premium of 10% of the employee’s base wage rate for all hours worked on Saturday and/or Sunday.
3.	Prior to implementation of any alternative work week schedules, the Company will meet with the employees in the affected departments and explain the issues and its ideas on such schedules to them.
4.	In determining schedules for non-standard work weeks seniority will be a
47
governing factor. This will not preclude the implementation of rotational shift schedules,
5.	Employees working on alternative shift schedules will not receive additional wages, benefits or other entitlements other than those specified in 2 above or as specifically agreed by the parties.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Reference: Technological/Organizational Change and Contracting out of Work
The Company and the Union agree that the intent of introducing new language to deal with change under Article 25.00 during 1996 negotiations is to neither strengthen nor weaken either the Company’s or the Union’s current rights with respect to the contracting out of bargaining unit work.
Article 25.00 will not be used to justify the contracting out of bargaining unit work. Should contracting out be considered necessary in the future, it shall be done in accordance with Article 6.03.
