ARTICLE 1 - PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this agreement to maintain and promote harmonious relations between the Company and the Association and the employees who are represented by the Association and to provide the negotiated terms and conditions of employment of such employees. Both parties agree that their mutual interest lies in friendly co-operation to promote the mutual interest and welfare of both the Company and such employees.
ARTICLE 2 - RECOGNITION
(2.1)	Bargaining Agent
The Company recognizes the Association, which is certified by the Labour Relations Board of Ontario, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees at Kitchener, save and except supervisors, persons above the rank of supervisor, Office Staff, and Sales Staff.
Where the term Association is used, it shall mean the Executive Officer of the Association.
(2.2)	Transfer of Operations
The Company agrees that if the existing operations covered by this agreement or part of it are moved or transferred to another facility operated by Maple Leaf Consumer Foods, a division of Maple Leaf Foods Inc., outside the bargaining unit, affected full time employees shall have the first opportunity to transfer without loss of seniority and service, subject to the provisions of any collective agreement in place at such facility.
ARTICLE 3 - ASSOCIATION SECURITY
(3.1)	Membership
All employees covered by this agreement shall be required on or before the first work day of actual employment, to become members of the Association and sign a dues deduction authorization form. On the first day of employment a new employee will be introduced to his/her Association steward by the process supervisor. Efforts will be made by the Supervisor to introduce the Safety Rep and where this not possible, provide contact information.
New Employees will be introduced to an Officer of the Association or a designate for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the general conditions and responsibilities with respect to the Collective Agreement and to the Association. This will take place at the end of the Company’s orientation meetings.
(3.2)	Part-Time Employees
2
Part-time employees may be used to supplement existing staff requirements, for volume fluctuations, for absenteeism and for other business opportunities, where it is not practical to employ full-time employees. Part-time employees may be used up to twenty-four hours per week except in cases of emergency or as otherwise agreed with the Association Executive.
Part-time employees will not be employed for the purpose of reducing overtime unless that part-time work is required on a regular basis (regular meaning at least twice per month). Part-time employees will be the first to be laid off provided there are qualified full-time employees who can perform the work. Where the work performed by part time employees within a Process can be satisfactorily combined to permit the employment of a full time employee, this will be done provided the employee has the ability to satisfactorily perform the work.
Part-time employees will be eligible to receive overtime at the rate of time and one-half for any hours worked in excess of their regular daily schedule provided their regular daily schedule is a minimum of eight (8) hours duration. Part-time employees may be offered overtime on a first or second additional shift etc. provided all full time employees in the process have been given the opportunity to work.
Part-time employees will be hired into a job and be allowed to apply for part-time vacancies of a higher job rate within their Process and the successful applicant will be the senior applicant who is capable of performing the job as determined by the Company.
Part-Time employees will be allowed to apply for part-time vacancies on a different shift within their process, limited to one move every twelve (12) months, and the successful applicant will be the senior applicant who is capable of performing the job as determined by the Company.
Part-time employees who are at work may be reassigned to other work as required in accordance with article 17 of the Collective Agreement except they may not be reassigned to perform work that is scheduled to be done on overtime.
Where overtime is required on a regular basis (twice a month or more) the Company may utilize a part-time shift.
Full-time employees may be assigned to a regular shift supplemented by part-time employees in accordance with the Collective Agreement.
The Company may use full-time employees on overtime together with part-time employees if required to fill in for absent employees or on a temporary basis (temporary meaning 4 weeks) or during the job posting procedure or for the purpose of training part-time employees (the parties will agree to the duration of such training).

employees that must be reduced will be identified and these employees will be laid off.
FIFTH:	The staffing work team will assign the displaced employees who have the
seniority to be at work, but not on their job, to the Processes where vacancies exist as a result of laying-off the junior employees or where additional need for staff has been identified, on the following basis: skills, ability, knowledge, medical restrictions and staffing information forms.
SIXTH:	Operations management will reassign employees to jobs they are
qualified to perform in order to create vacancies the farmed-in employees will be able to perform. This may involve proceeding up the seniority list to identify the junior qualified employees for temporary reassignment to different processes in order to place affected employees in temporary positions they can perform.
25
Notes:
1.	Where it is determined by the Company that an employee requires training the Company will designate which employee will provide the necessary training. Upon completion of the training the excess employee(s) will be laid off and will not be entitled to the weekly guarantee for the week if they are eligible and apply for E.I.C.

(17.6)	Job Elimination/Combination Bumping Procedures
The Company will notify the Association of any job eliminations or job combinations and give in writing details of such changes at least twenty (20) working days in advance.
Job Elimination:
A job elimination occurs in the following circumstances:
•	the job is permanently transferred to a different shift
•	the work required to be performed is discontinued
•	when a job combination occurs between two (2) or more shifts the work transferred from the originating shift on which the work was performed will be deemed to be a job elimination on that shift and handled accordingly.
Note: A job is not eliminated by reason of the start time changing within the same shift.
The individual directly affected must secure job ownership by either applying for job vacancies (Articles 18.2/18.3 - Process/Plant-Wide Posting) or by bumping to junior seniority positions within the Process.
The only purpose of the bumping procedure is for job ownership. If bumping applies it will be after the 20 days notice.
Job Combination Procedure:
A job combination occurs when:
1.	Two (2) or more jobs on the same shift are combined and in such case the employee(s) with the least seniority will be bumped;
2.	When a job is changed such that some ofthe work is allocated to other shift(s), the work remaining on the shift will be treated as a job combination on that shift. The work transferred to another shift(s) is considered a job elimination on the originating shift. In such cases there are no bumping rights across shift(s) for the displaced employee(s) on the originating shift(s).
The bumped employee(s) will proceed through the bumping procedure under job elimination.
Bumping Procedure:
27
1.	An employee whose job was eliminated/combined must fill any vacancy on their shift, by seniority and ability, that becomes available under the process job posting procedures. If the job vacancy is on a different shift the employee may elect one of the following options:
a)	If the number of employee job elimination/combinations on a shift is greater than the number of vacancies available, and if the most junior employee(s) jobs are not affected, the senior displaced employee has the option of filling a vacancy or bumping the junior employee.
b)	The employee may displace the most junior employee in their process on their shift. If they are unable to perform the job of the most junior employee, they may displace the second least senior employee on their shift and so on until they reach a job they can perform consistent with their seniority rights.
Note: When an employee displaces a junior employee under this Article 17.6 they shall acquire job ownership of that job. If there is no vacancy in the process and there are farmed-in employees in the process, the employee whose job was eliminated/combined, may choose to bump a farmed-in employee rather than bump the junior employee.
c)	The employee may choose to transfer to a vacant job in the plant according to the Collective Agreement.
2.	Once all job vacancies are filled, any additional displaced employees must bump a junior employee in their process to obtain job ownership.
The junior employee bumped off their shift will have the option of bumping the most junior employee in the process on any remaining shifts. If they are unable to perform the job of the junior employee they are entitled to bump, they can move up the seniority list as described in 1b.
3.	The junior employee bumped out of their process must apply for all job postings (Article 18.2 and 18.3) or they will be placed in any job vacancy in the plant. If there is no vacancy, the employee will have the choice of replacing any temporary work assignment in the plant or displacing the most junior employee in the plant providing they have fifteen (15) months or more seniority. If they are unable to perform the most junior job, the employee will move up the seniority list as described in 1b.
4.	When a number of employees are displaced due to job elimination, the corresponding number of least senior jobs in the process and/or plant, whichever is applicable, will be identified and the most senior of the displaced employees can choose the job they want. In the event that two or more of the same job classification are identified within this group of least senior jobs, the junior employee in the job classification will be first to be displaced. This process will continue in order of seniority until all employees are assigned job ownership. If one of the displaced employees is unable to perform the job to which their seniority entitles them, they may move up the seniority list until they reach a job they can perform consistent with their seniority rights.
28
5.	If the employee is unable to bump in accordance with the above steps they will be laid off.
6.	When one or more jobs are eliminated or combined, the affected employee(s) within the process will have recall rights if the job is reinstated by 50% of its original form. Employees with less than fifteen (15) months seniority have twelve (12) months recall rights and employees with more than fifteen (15) months seniority have twenty-four (24) months recall rights.
7.	An employee displaced from their process will have recall rights only to their process if additional full-time staff is required, subject to the above time limits, prior to applying Article 18.3. The Plant Manager will determine if full-time staff is required following discussion with the Association President or a delegate.
8.	Employees who voluntarily transfer under Article 18.2 from the job to which they were assigned or bumped into as a result of their job elimination/combination, will retain recall rights as specified in this section. Employees who voluntarily transfer to another process under Article 18.3 from the job to which they are assigned or bumped into as a result of their own job elimination/combination, will lose their recall rights.
9.	Employees who do not have fifteen (15) months or more seniority can exercise their seniority rights in accordance with steps 1, 2 and 3.
Note: The Company and the Association President and/or delegate plus the process steward will mutually determine if any employee is able to perform any job to which their seniority entitles them. Any disagreements regarding an employee's ability to perform a job may be entered as a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
Note: An employee who has availed themself of the transfer option contained in Article 17.6 will be eligible by seniority to secure job ownership of any new job created in the process where their job elimination occurred, prior to the affected date of elimination.
Rates of Pay:
An employee will have their rate of pay adjusted at the beginning of the first pay period following six (6) months from the date of their job elimination/combination. Employees who have not acquired job ownership during this time will be paid the rate of the job they are performing.
Job Transfers:
A job transfer will occur when the relocation of duties, product, equipment or such, results in additional jobs in the receiving process.
1. When a job is transferred to another process or operation, the employee who has job ownership has the option of moving with the job.
29
If the employee elects not to follow the job, the following will apply.
2. a. The job being transferred will be offered in order of seniority to the employees in the process it is leaving.
b.	If no employee volunteers to move with the job to the process, the job will be posted in accordance with the job posting procedure.
c.	The employee who had job ownership and who elected not to move with the job, will exercise their seniority rights and follow the bumping procedure as described in Article 17.6.
This Article is subject to review and revision every six (6) months as agreed to by the parties.
ARTICLE 18 - PROGRESSION
(18.1)	Job Progression
The Company agrees to recognize the principle of seniority in job progression in a fair and equitable manner having regard not only to the length of service, but as well to the knowledge, training, skill, efficiency and physical fitness of the employee or employees concerned to do the work assigned.
Job progression means moving to a higher rated job category or a job on a different shift, as per LOA #9, within the Process.
(18.2a) Process Job Vacancies
When a permanent job vacancy occurs within a process, the vacancy will be posted on the process notice board for two days. Interested employees in the process will make application to the supervisor. Employees from the process who have no job ownership will have their names automatically added to the job posting and must accept the job when it arrives at their name, if capable of performing it. Employees who are away on vacation will have their name automatically added to all process job postings.
The senior employee with job ownership listed on the posting who is capable of performing the duties of the job, as determined by the Company, will be awarded the position with no job trial if the position is accepted. Exceptions to awarding the position on the basis of seniority occur where specialized external qualifications are required such as journeyperson's license, truck drivers license or other positions requiring an external license or certificate or for the apprenticeship program. Where there is a new job, or where the job vacancy is on a different shift, or in a different area of the process the Company will provide up to one-half hour to review the job and all pertinent information that is available at the time of posting such as the job description, physical demands analysis, standard operating procedures etc.
If the Company cannot find a suitable employee within the process then the vacancy will be advertised on a plant wide basis, according to the provisions of Article 18.3-Plant Wide Postings.
30
An employee who is no longer able to satisfactorily perform the duties of their job due to non-medical reasons as agreed between the parties, will forfeit job ownership and will be permanently reassigned by management in accordance with the procedure described herein.
When an employee from another process accepts a job vacancy and the result of that transfer will cause the staffing level to be in excess of the process requirements, the employee(s) without job ownership will become plant floaters but will retain process ownership.
The Company will consider each application in a manner consistent with the principles listed in Article 18.1. An employee is limited to one job posting other than job progression within 6 months.
All employees absent from work for any reason other than vacation must immediately render their decision when contacted by phone. The Company will make two phone calls to the employee. If there is no contact, such matters will be recorded and the employee will be bypassed. An absent employee will be considered for a job vacancy if he can return to the job within a four week period. The intent of this clause is not to allow an employee to temporarily interrupt a scheduled leave or illness/injury for the purpose of acquiring job ownership.
When an applicant has accepted, the change will be made effective the first shift of the following work week.
If the job vacancy is on the day shift, a plant wide posting will occur before awarding such job to a probationary employee.
Progression will not be considered until the applicant has attained job ownership under Article 18.2.
Process postings can occur to replace employees who are retiring at a future identified date. In such cases management may post the vacancy one week prior to the employee actually leaving except for job postings requiring more than one week training, in which case management will post the job sufficiently in advance to provide proper training. This also applies to employees who utilize their vacation entitlement to leave in advance of their actual retirement date.
(18.2b) Process Job Vacancies-Probationary Employees
1.	(a) Probationary employees who are capable of performing the duties of the available job may, through job progression, which is defined as the availability of a higher rated job category or a job on a different shift, apply for permanent job vacancies within their Process subject to the other provisions of Article 18.2.
(b) If the job vacancy is on the day shift, a plant wide posting will occur before awarding such job to a probationary employee.

31
3.	Probationary employees without job ownership must accept the job if the company so requires in accordance with Article 18.2.
4.	Plant-wide Postings: Probationary employees are subject to the requirement in Article 18.3 to have completed a minimum of one year service before being eligible to apply for a plant wide posting and therefore may not apply.
(18.3)	Plant-Wide Postings
Vacancies received in the Human Resources department after the process posting procedure is complete, as per Article 18.2, will be posted on a plant wide basis for a period of five working days. Applications for a plant wide posting will be made in the Human Resources department and it is the sole responsibility of each employee to have their name listed on any plant wide posting for which they are interested. Prior to taking vacation, employees must notify Human Resources if they are interested in having their name added to plant wide postings.
The senior employee on the list for the posting who is capable of performing the duties of the job, as determined by the Company, will be awarded the position with no job trial if the position is accepted. Exceptions to awarding the position on the basis of seniority occur at the Company’s discretion where specialized external qualifications are required such as journeyman's license, truck drivers license or other positions requiring an external license or certificate or for the apprenticeship program.
The Company will provide up to one half hour to review the job and all pertinent information that is available at the time of posting. Such information will include a job description, physical demands analysis, standard operating procedures, etc. Employees who have no job ownership will have their names automatically added to plant wide postings and must accept the position if their name is reached on the list provided, they are capable of performing the job as determined by the Company and the Association
An employee who has completed a minimum of one year of service (exceptions to the one year restriction may apply at the discretion of the Company) and wishes to transfer to another process may apply by signing the form in the Human Resources department for a plant wide posting.
The Company will consider each application in a manner consistent with the principles list in Article 18.1.
When an applicant is accepted, the change will be made on the first shift of the following work week provided the remaining employees can satisfactorily perform the required work.
Employees, who make such an application for plant wide posting and as a result are transferred, may not apply for a further plant wide posting until two years have elapsed.
Should transferred employees be paid a rate lower than the rate of the job to which they are transferred under this Article, the rate will be increased to the rate of the new job in accordance with Article 9.4.
32
An absent employee will be considered for a plant-wide posting if they can return to the job within a four (4) week period. The intent of this clause is not to allow an employee to temporarily interrupt a scheduled leave or illness/injury for the purpose of acquiring job ownership. All employees absent from work for any reason must immediately render their decision when contacted by phone. The Company will make two phone calls to the employee. If there is no contact, such matters will be recorded and the employee will be bypassed.

Letter of Agreement #15 - Job Ownership
Where the collective agreement refers to ‘jobs’ or ‘job ownership’ the language will only refer to a job title within a rate category within a process. Outside of this letter, nothing in the collective agreement will be interpreted to provide an employee with the right to perform the same work duties, on the same line, or in the same physical location on a regular basis.
Appendix ‘X' will list all of the job titles within a rate category. Effective the date of ratification, all future job postings will be posted as job titles and rate categories within a process for these job classifications. Employees who currently have ‘job ownership’ will retain their rights to their job ownership, until they leave that job, until the job is eliminated, or until June 1,2012.
Employees who have a job title will be assigned to a position on a weekly basis. Management will consider reasonable requests for weekly assignments within a job title based on seniority, skill and ability.
When the Company determines there is a requirement to increase the number of positions in a category a job posting with the following information will occur; job title, rate of pay, shift start and end times, and process.

Letter of Agreement #17 - Association Executive Officers Temporary Job Posting

Letter of Agreement #18 - Medical Certificates and Notes
In this matter, the issue is that of supervisors with reasonable grounds, requesting Doctor's notes of employees who have called in sick to substantiate their casual absence for illness.
If the Company directs an employee to provide medical information from a doctor, the cost of the note will be paid for by the Company upon presentation of a paid receipt. The Doctor's note must state the employee was disabled and incapable of working during the period of absence and signed by the doctor.
Employees are free to submit medical information on their own, not requested by the supervisor, to substantiate their casual absence from work for medical reason, however this will not be paid for by the Company.
Doctor's notes are to be submitted to the Health Centre Nurse who will notify the appropriate supervisor of the expected return and any work restrictions that may apply.
