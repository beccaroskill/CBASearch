Looking back...Looking forward
Looking back, the prior three years represented unparalleled success for us in the automotive industry. Our success came in many forms - new and exciting products, sales records, quality milestones, new product and vehicle launches, ISO certification and Manufacturing Quality Assurance System (MQAS) compliance at our plants, and being a part of one of the largest industrial mergers in the world. There were many challenges which we worked together to overcome and the fruits of our success are now shared by all in this agreement.
As we go forward, we see that the challenges we faced in the past are still there. Competition is ever increasing and the customer is ever more demanding. Our relentless challenge to improve our quality and control our cost is still with us. Our challenge to help our community and those less fortunate than those of us employed in the auto industry is still urgent. The challenge to be ever vigilant to ensure the health and safety of all employees while we continue to deliver the right products to market will never cease. We are still challenged to become a more diverse workforce as we continue to accept our differences.
One constant, however, which must never change, is our realization that the way to overcome these challenges is to continue to work together as we have done in the past. The past shows us the recipe for success. The challenges are still there -our continued success is up to us. We know what it takes to get the job done because we have done it before. Together into the future we can continue to work to support the common interests of DaimlerChrysler Canada and the C.A.W. - secure, well paying jobs based upon delighted customers and inspired people.

Brothers and Sisters:
Every set of negotiations has its share of historic significance and this one was no exception. The CAW entered these negotiations with a very ambitious bargaining aqenda based on the unprecedented growth and success of DaimlerChrysler and our Union’s relentless desire and commitment to make progress for our members. Through the collective bargaining process we were successful in negotiating a collective agreement that included economic improvements to wages, benefits, and paid time off. Most importantly, we bargained a pension agreement for both past and future retirees that is considered amongst the best in the industrial world. This pension agreement improves on past ones and recognizes the incredible contribution made by our senior members not just to the Company but to our Union over a great many years. These negotiated initiatives in combination of one another along with the significant investment bargained in each of our workplaces are designed to enhance the job security of our membership. They also offer hope and opportunities for those in our community who seek to work in a unionized environment that bargains decent wages, benefits, and working conditions for those who we are privileged to represent.
While we can take pride in these victories, we cannot forget that our continued success at the bargaining table rests in our ability to work with DaimierChrysler to satisfy the customer who buys and drives the products built by our membership.
On behalf of the Master Bargaining Committee. I would like to conclude my brief statement by dedicating this collective agreement to our retirees who have built into our Union a culture that allows us to be ambitious in our pursuit of obtaining social and economic justice for our members that when successful, also strengthens our communities where we live and raise our families.
Special recognition goes out to our National Staff representatives, Sam Gindin and Ron Pellerin who participated in their last set of negotiations as they have decided to retire. Their contribution to our success was enormous and deeply appreciated.

. Tell the alleged harasser(s) to stop;
(8)

•	Immediately report the harassment to the employee's Union Representative and/or Supervisor, or if this is not appropriate, to the local Equity Representative, Personnel Manager, or designate of the Vice President - Human Resources.
(E)	The Investigation
In minor cases, the Union may try to resolve, a harassment complaint informally without a full investigation when so requested by the complainant. However, the following procedure will apply to all complaints requiring investigation:
The person receiving the complaint will advise the local Personnel Manager, or such higher authority as may be appropriate, who will arrange an interview with the complainant as soon as possible. This interview and the subsequent investigation will be carried out jointly by the Union and the Company. The investigation team, if possible, will be comprised of at least one woman, whenever the complaint is sexual in nature.
The investigation will include interviews of the complainant, the alleged harasser(s) and any witnesses. The Chairperson of the employee being interviewed will be present with Union members during the interview. Interview timing and location will recognize the need to maintain confidentiality.
The investigation team will inform the complainant promptly as to the results of the investigation and the appropriate actions that have been or will be taken. The
(9)
RECOGNITION
complainant will also be encouraged to report any further incidents.
The identity of the complainant, the alleged harasser(s), and the nature of the complaint will be kept confidential and only other persons with a need to know will be informed.

If it is determined that the complaint has no validity, and was, in fact, lodged with malicious intent, the initiator of the complaint may be subject to action under the misconduct rules outlined in the Safety and Conduct Guide.
(G)	Right to Refuse
A bargaining unit employee alleging harassment in the workplace is encouraged to use the above procedure to resolve a complaint. However, it is agreed, in principle, that in serious cases or when the safety of an employee is being threatened, it may be necessary for that employee to leave the job.

However, if the complaint cannot be satisfactorily resolved locally or is of an extremely serious nature, then other steps may be required including the intervention of the National Union and/or DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. Staff.
This policy and procedure in no way precludes the complainant's right to seek action under the Ontario Human Rights Code. However, both the Union and DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. urge employees to use the internal mechanisms as outlined above before seeking alternative recourse.
(I)	The Union shall hold harmless DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. against any liability which may arise by reason of the implementation of a mutually acceptable resolution of a complaint.

Letter (2.15) Over-time Entitlement
. Union Representatives
During the course of negotiations the Corporation raised the issue of undue representation costs during periods of overtime work. Both parties agreed the matter required attention.
The parties therefore agreed as referenced below that notwithstanding the applicable provisions of the Production
(52)
REPRESENTATION
and Maintenance Agreement as well as the Special Provisions thereunder:
(a)	Union representatives would not be entitled to work during overtime or holiday periods when only one of the representatives respective constituents are working.
(b)	Union representatives from one shift would not be entitled to work overtime on another shift during the regular hours of scheduled production when the representatives respective constituents are working.
These arrangements were reached in recognition of the principles expressed in the Purpose and Intent of the Production and Maintenance Agreement.
Letter (2.16) Overtime/Temporary Layoff Work
Opportunities (Benefit, Health and Safety, and Substance Abuse Representatives)
During negotiations the Union expressed concerns regarding the limited work opportunities that are made available to the Benefit Representatives, Health and Safety Representatives, and Substance Abuse Representatives during overtime and periods of temporary layoff.
The Company indicated that it was mindful of circumstances which could result in work opportunities for such Representatives even though sufficient numbers of employees were not at work to qualify such Representatives in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Agreement. For example, it would be appropriate for the Health and Safety Representative to be offered the opportunity to be at work during the plant rearrangements involving new equipment installations. Similarly, it would be appropriate for the Benefits Representative to be at work during the periods of temporary layoffs or indefinite layoffs involving a significant number of employees to permit him/her to work with plant administrators to ensure the expeditious processing of benefit-related matters, and similarly, it would be appropriate for the Employee Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative to be at work
(53)
REPRESENTATION
to attend to employee assistance and substance abuse problems.
In response the Company has agreed that where the overtime is required to meet the responsibilities and duties of the full time Benefits Representative, full time Substance Abuse Representative, or full time Health & Safety Representative such Representatives may be retained at work provided they have the prior approval of the Personnel Manager.
Where the respective Representative believes that there is no reasonable justification for the Personnel Manager withholding prior approval, the matter may be referred to Staff Labour Relations and the CAW National Office.
Letter (2,17) Payment of Union Representatives During Local Negotiations
During the course of current negotiations, the Corporation and the Union had discussions concerning the payment of Union Representatives during Local Negotiations.
This letter is intended to clarify the understandings agreed to during the course of negotiations, pertaining to the payment of such Representatives during such negotiations.
The parties agreed that the following principles would be applicable to the payment of Union Representatives only during the negotiations of the Local Negotiations and would not be used as grounds or basis for claiming that such principles should be extended to other negotiations.
(a)	Plant Chairpersons of the Plant Shop Committees would be paid for time spent during Local Negotiations meetings and time spent in Union caucus relevant to such negotiations.
In the event such time would involve overtime hours, and the Plant Shop Chairperson would otherwise be entitled to overtime if said Plant Chairperson had been in
(54)
REPRESENTATION
the plant, the Corporation agrees to pay overtime up to this entitlement as long as the Plant Chairperson continued in such meetings or caucus.
In the event overtime became available in the plant and the Plant Chairperson was not involved in such meetings and caucus, the Plant Chairperson would be paid for such overtime only for time spent in the plant to the extent of this overtime entitlement.
The Skilled Trades Chairperson would be treated the same as a Plant Chairperson.
(b)	The Corporation agreed that alternate Representatives would be recognized only to the extent that additional cost relative to the representation in a given jurisdiction was not incurred. For purposes of example, the Plant Shop Chairperson's alternate and the Committeeperson's alternate would be allowed to function whereas the alternate steward would not be recognized.
(c)	The Corporation agreed that Union Representatives on the Local Negotiation Bargaining Committee would not be required to punch their time cards in their respective plants.
The Corporation further agreed that suitable arrangements would be made to administer the recording of hours and payment for such Representatives during the course of Local Negotiations.
(d)	The Union agreed that the continuation of such arrangements was contingent upon the mutual satisfaction of the parties and that upon notice to the Union that such procedure had been abused, the Corporation could dissociate itself from such arrangements.

(59)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(3.3)	Membership off the Appeal Board
(a)	The Appeal Board shall consist of one but not more than two Labour Relations executives of the Corporation and one but not more than two official representatives of the National Union, and an Impartial Chairperson. The Union and Corporation representatives of the Appeal Board shall attempt to settle all grievances properly referred to the Board.
(b)	In the event that they are unable to settle the matter, it shall be determined by decision of the Impartial Chairperson and not by majority vote of the Board. The Impartial Chairperson shall have the right, however, to participate in all discussions and meetings of the Appeal Board and shall also have the duty of assisting the parties in resolving particular questions.
(c)	The impartial Chairperson shall have only the functions set forth herein and shall serve for one year from date of appointment provided said Impartial Chairperson continues to be acceptable to both the Union and the Corporation. The fees and approved expenses of the Impartial Chairperson will be paid one-half by the Corporation and one-half by the Union.
(3.4)	Authority of Appeal Board
The power and authority of the Appeal Board shall be limited to:
(a)	matters involving the correctness of the classification of employees, provided that the absence of a classification from the list of classifications authorized for use at a particular plant by the Corporation shall not preclude the application of that classification at that plant, provided the requested classification is an established hourly classification under this Agreement and provided further the application of the requested classification is proper, based upon the work performed; and
(b)	applying and interpreting the provisions of the Agreement including written memorandum and letters of
(60)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
understanding between the Corporation and the National Union that relate to and supplement the terms of this Agreement except as may otherwise appear in said Agreements.
(c)	in proper cases, modifying penalties assessed by the Management in disciplinary discharges and layoffs.
(d)	grievances submitted charging a violation of the Corporation’s express commitments set forth in Section
(1.15)	of the Agreement or Section (17.16) (a), Section
(17.17)	or Section (17.19) of the Skilled Trades Section. The Appeal Board may not determine that any Plant Management decision regarding the letting of a contract for maintenance or construction work or for the in-plant fabrication of tools, dies, jigs, and fixtures or any Plant Management decision to buy tools, dies, or models rather than make them violated the express provisions of Section
(1.15)	of the Agreement or Section (17.16) (a), Section
(17.17)	or Section (17.19) of the Skilled Trades Section, unless:
(1) the Appeal Board finds that the decision complained of has resulted, or will result, directly in the layoff of journeymen/women or temporary employees in the affected classifications at the plant on layoff, and (2) unless the Appeal Board finds that, in making the disputed decision to contract out the work involved or to buy rather than make, Plant Management did not exercise proper judgment on the basis of the information available at the time the decision was made based on all the considerations set forth in Section (17.18) of the Skilled Trades Section and those set forth in Section (1.15), Section (17.16) (a), Section (17.17) and Section (17.19), referred to above as the case may be. If on the basis of the evidence presented the Appeal Board finds that the management decision complained of did not violate the provisions of said Section (1.15), Section (17.16) (a), Section (17.17) or Section (17.19), such determination shall resolve the grievance. If, however, the Appeal Board
(61)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
finds that the Management decision violated any such provision, the Appeal Board shall have authority to issue an award in which the sole remedy shall be limited to providing relief to journeymen/women and temporary employees in the affected skilled trades classifications at the affected plant who either were laid off directly as a result of the Management decision complained of or who were on layoff from the affected skilled trades classifications at the affected plant when Management made the decision complained of.
The Appeal Board shall not have authority to add to or subtract from or to modify any of the terms of the Agreement or to establish or change any wage or rate of pay.
Any case appealed to the Appeal Board on which it has no power to rule shall be referred back to the parties without decision.
(3.5)	Time of Appeals
(a)	Hereafter, a grievance not appealed from an answer at one step of the grievance procedure to the next step of the grievance procedure, shall be considered settled on the basis of the last answer and not subject to further review but shall not prejudice the position of either party with respect to a grievance involving the same issue at another plant. Time limits for appeal shall be as follows:
1.	Appeal from an answer given in either Step 1 or 2 of the grievance procedure must be made within five (5) working days after such answer;
2.	Appeal from an answer given in Step 3 of the grievance procedure must be made within fifteen (15) working days after such an answer;
3.	Appeal to the Appeal Board must be made within forty-five (45) clays from date of appeal to Step 4.
(b)	A grievance may be withdrawn without prejudice, and, if so withdrawn, all financial liabilities shall be
(62)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
cancelled. If the grievance is reinstated, the financial liability shall date only from the date of reinstatement. If the grievance is not reinstated within three months from the date of withdrawal, the grievance shall not be reinstated. Where one or more grievances involve a similar issue, those grievances may be withdrawn without prejudice pending the disposition of the appeal of a representative case. In such event the withdrawal without prejudice will not affect financial liability.
(3.6)	Time Limit on Claims
(a)	No claims, including claims for back wages, by an employee covered by this Agreement, or by the Union, against the Corporation shall be valid for a period prior to the date the grievance was first filed in writing unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee, or for the Union as the case may be, to know that the employee, or the Union, had grounds for such a claim prior to that date, in which case the claim shall be limited retroactively to a period of thirty (30) days prior to the date the claim was first filed in writing.
(b)	Deductions from an employee’s wages to recover overpayments made in error will not be made unless the employee is notified in writing prior to the end of the month following the month in which the payment in question was made to the employee. The notice will specify the amount of the overpayment, and deductions to recover such overpayment shall not commence until the pay period following the pay period in which the notice of overpayment was given to the employee.
Letter (3.7) Time Limit on Claims - Waived
In the past there have been limited situations in which the Corporation and the National Union have mutually agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
(3.6)	, Time Limit on Claims, equity and fairness dictated that the time limits be waived regarding (a) claims by an
(63)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
employee or by the Union, including claims for back wages, and (b) deductions from an employee’s wages to recover overpayments.
This letter will confirm that in such instances of mutual agreement between the Staff Labour Relations Department and the National Union, the limitations set forth in Section
(3.6)	may continue to be waived in order to provide equitable and fair resolution of such matters.
(3.8)	Payment of Back Pay Claims
If the Corporation fails to give an employee work to which the employee's seniority entitles the employee, and a written notice of the employee’s claim is filed within ten (10) working clays of the time the Corporation first failed to give the employee such work, the Corporation will reimburse the employee for the earnings lost through failure to give the employee such work.
(3.9)	Computation of Back Wages
No claim for back wages shall exceed the amount of wages the employee would otherwise have earned at the employee’s regular rate less:
(a)	any unemployment, compensation or supplemental unemployment benefit the employee may have received, in which case the Corporation will pay to the appropriate federal agency the amount of the unemployment compensation the employee received in order to restore the employee's entitlements for unemployment compensation benefits, provided the employee authorizes such payment if authorization is required; also, the employee's entitlement for supplemental unemployment benefit will be restored in accordance with the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan; and
(b)	compensation for personal services that the employee was not receiving when the employee last worked for the Corporation. However, wages for total hours worked each week in other employment in excess of the
(64)
GRIEVANCE- PROCEDURE
total number of hours the employee would have worked for the Corporation during each corresponding week of the period covered by the claim, shall not be deducted.
The Appeal Board shall have authority in its discretion to deduct such further amount as it may deem fair.
(3.10)	Retroactive Adjustments
No decision of an Appeal Board or of the Management in one case shall create a basis for retroactive adjustment in any other case.
(3.11)	Withdrawal of Cases
After a case on which an Appeal Board is empowered to rule hereunder has been referred to the Appeal Board, the case may not be withdrawn by either party except by mutual consent.
(3.12)	Finality of Decisions
There shall be no appeal from any Appeal Board's decision. Each such decision shall be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved, and the Corporation. The Union will discourage any attempt of its members, and will not encourage or cooperate with any of its members in any appeal to any Court or Labour Board from a decision of an Appeal Board.
(3.13)	Appeal for interpretation
Any issue involving the interpretation and/or the application of any term of this Agreement may be initiated by either party directly with the other party. Upon failure of the parties to agree with respect to the correct interpretation or application of the Agreement to the issue, it may then be appealed directly to the Appeal Board as provided in Section (3.2) Step 4.
(65)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(3.14)	Law Suits
Any grievance that either (a) is not processed or (b) is disposed of in accordance with this Grievance Procedure shall be considered settled, and such settlement shall be final and binding upon the Corporation, the employee or employees involved, the Union and its members.
Except with respect to the right to present an individual grievance as expressly set forth in Section (3.2) Step 2 (a), the Union shall, in the redress of alleged violations by the Corporation of this Agreement or any local or other agreement supplementary hereto, be the exclusive representative of employees or groups of employees covered by this Agreement, and only the Union shall have the right to assert and press against the Corporation in any judicial or adjudicatory proceeding any claim or action asserting a violation of the Agreement.
No employee or former employee shall have any right of action under this Agreement on the basis of or by reason of any claim that the Union or any Union officer or representative has acted or failed to act relative to presentation, prosecution or settlement of any grievance or other matter as to which the Union or any Union representative has authority or discretion to act or not to act under the terms of this Agreement.
(3.15)	Maintenance of Discipline
It is agreed that the maintenance of discipline for just cause is essential to the satisfactory operation of the plant.
(3.16)	Notice of Suspension, Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge
The plant management agrees promptly upon the suspension, disciplinary layoff or discharge of an employee including a probationary employee to notify in writing the employee and the Steward or	Plant Shop
Committeeperson in the district of the suspension, disciplinary layoff or discharge, and the reason therefor.
(66)
GRIEVANCEPROCEDURE
Such notice will be provided at a reasonable time where practicable prior to the end of the shift and will advise the employee that the employee has the right to request union representation.
If such an employee is absent from the plant at the time the action is taken, or where it was not practicable to provide written notice prior to leaving the plant, management will send to the employee's last known address notice of suspension, disciplinary layoff or discharge and notice that the employee has the right to request representation.
(3.17)	Union Representation
The employee may ask to discuss the suspension, disciplinary layoff or discharge with either the Steward or Plant Shop Committeeperson for the district. The management will designate an office where the employee may do so before the employee is required to leave the plant. Upon request, the employee's Supervisor or other designated representative of management will discuss the suspension, disciplinary layoff or discharge with the employee and the Steward or the Plant Shop Committeeperson. In proper cases, exceptions shall be made.
(3.18)	Appeal of Discharge
Should a discharged employee or the Union representative and the Plant Shop Committee consider the discharge to be improper, a complaint shall be presented in writing through the Shop Committee to the designated Labour Relations Representative within forty-eight (48) hours of the discharge. The Management of the plant will review the discharge and give its answer within seventy two (72) hours after receiving the complaint. The Management of each plant is authorized to settle such matters. If the decision is not satisfactory to the Union, the matter shall be referred to Step 3 of the grievance
(67)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
procedure within five (5) working days after the Management gives its answer to the Union.
(3.19) Use of Past Record
In imposing any discipline on a current charge, Management will not take into account any prior infractions which occurred more than one (1) year previously nor impose discipline on an employee for falsification of the employee's employment application after a period of one (1) year from the employee’s date of hire.
Letter (3.20) Grievance Procedure - Flow Chat-t
Both parties to the Production and Maintenance Agreement signed today acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt and fair resolution of employee grievances. The parties also acknowledge the importance of the requirements set forth in Sections (3.16) Notice of Suspension, Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge and (3.17) Union Representation. The attached flow chart illustrates the proper sequence of procedural steps to be used in processing employee grievances.
The Corporation assures the Union that it is interested in seeing that all grievances receive prompt and objective consideration on their merits. The Union assures the Corporation that it will make a sincere and determined effort to keep the procedure free of unmeritorious grievances.
Also, during our recent contract negotiations the Corporation pointed out that Special Conferences, as provided for in Section (2.7)(b), are in some instances being used to circumvent the Grievance Procedure. Such action hinders the expeditious handling of grievances. The parties agree Section (2.7)(b) was not intended to provide the means for circumvention and abuse of the Grievance Procedure and will put forth their best efforts to eliminate any such abuse.
(68)
■GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
To further assist in expediting the handling of a grievance, it is understood if a grievance has not been resolved in Step 2 or Step 3 of the grievance procedure within forty-five (45) days after its appeal from the previous Step, unless held over by mutual agreement between the parties for further discussion, the representative of Management at that Step may answer the grievance in writing without a meeting.
The parties also discussed problems created as a result of the submission of written grievances containing insufficient information. It is agreed that each grievance submitted in writing shall set forth in reasonable detail the date and nature of the grievance, identity of the employee or employees involved by name, seniority date, classification or location, insofar as diligent effort will allow, and the provisions of the applicable agreement, if any, that the Union claims the Corporation has violated. Management's answers will set forth facts taken into account in answering the grievance.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Production & Maintenance
(70)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Letter (3.21) Reinstated Grievances
During negotiations of the Production and Maintenance Agreement, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the National Union (CAW-Canada), by either its (i) Executive Board, (ii) Public Review Board or (iii) Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the National Union may inform the Senior Manager Staff Labour Relations in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either (i) are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or (ii) that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Corporation in the grievance procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, provincial, or municipal agency.
(71)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Impartial Chairperson of the Appeal Board or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the aforementioned Agreement except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any Appeal Board decisions or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter agreement and the Corporation's obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
Letter (3.22) Grievance Disciplinary Action
In response to your demand made during the current negotiations, we have agreed that during discussions as early as Step 2 of the grievance procedure of grievances over discipline, discharge and other terminations from employment, each party will present a statement of position reciting facts then known on which it relies, and a copy of a document or statement on which the party relies to support its position.
In the case of a document covering, or statement by, an employee who is not the grievant, the party relying on it may excise, block out, or otherwise remove, information on it that is not relevant or that would disclose the identity of the person who made the statement or concerning whom the document refers.
In cases where a prior disciplinary record is involved, the Corporation may present a written summary of the grievant's disciplinary record.
(72)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
The statement of position and other statements and documents that a party has provided the other shall become part of the grievance file and may be referred to in subsequent steps of the grievance procedure, including the Appeal Board.
The failure or refusal of the Union to present a full oral explanation of its position shall relieve the Corporation from presenting any statement or document on which it relies. The failure or refusal of a party to make available to the other a copy of a document or statement which it has in its possession and on which the party relies shall preclude the party from using it before the Appeal Board.
The Corporation expressed its concern that its providing to Local Union representatives involved in processing grievances copies of employee statements and corporate documents relating to employees may lead to abuses unless the statements and documents (i) are used solely in connection with the proper processing of a grievance, (ii) are otherwise kept confidential, and (iii) are not in any way used by any member of the bargaining unit to attempt to harass or intimidate an employee giving a statement or providing a document. The Union assured the Corporation that it will instruct its Local and National Representatives of these restrictions on the use of such material and the need to maintain confidentiality. The Union further represents that if a copy of a statement or document provided it in accordance with this Letter Agreement is used by its representatives or those under their control for any purpose other than the proper processing of a grievance or is publicized outside of the grievance procedure, the Corporation would be relieved of any obligation under this Letter Agreement at the plant where the abuse occurred.
Letter (3.23) Application off Section (3.16)
This is to confirm our understanding concerning the application of Section (3.16) Notice of Suspension,
GRIEVANCE .PROCEDURE
Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge of the Production and Maintenance Agreement as it relates to employees who are terminated for inability to perform assigned work.
When an employee, including a probationary employee, is terminated for inability to perform assigned work, plant management will provide written notice pursuant to Section (3.16).
Letter (3.24) Discipline On Standards
In Appeal Board Case No. 1664 the Impartial Chairman said that “the mere presence of proof of failure to meet a rate of production requires the Chairman to approve the propriety of discipline unless, by some means other than a showing of non-compliance with Sections (46)-(48) (now Section (4.1) it is established that the fault did not lie with the employee.” Nevertheless, the undersigned agree that the provisions of Section (44) (c) of the National Production and Maintenance Agreement dated November 2, 1961, give the Appeal Board power and authority to determine the propriety of the penalty imposed by management in disciplinary discharges and layoffs for violation of Letter (4.2), Work Standards, of said Agreement, and that the mere presence of proof of an employee's failure to meet a disputed work standard does not require the Appeal Board or the Chairman to approve the propriety of the discipline assessed to an employee.
The disposition of any such case shall be on the merits but shall not involve the propriety of any disputed work standard or work load assignment performed by the grievant or grievants.
In any such determination, the Appeal Board will take into consideration any relevant facts occurring prior and subsequent to the time the penalty in question was imposed.
This letter shall not be construed to limit or otherwise impair any right Section (1.2) reserves to the Corporation,
(74)
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
including the right to establish and maintain work standards or rates of production and to discipline employees. (c99)
(75)
WORK STANDARDS
WORK STANDARDS
(4.1) Work Standards
(a)	Establishing Work Standards
1.	When the Corporation establishes work standards, by whatever method it may select, it shall do so on the basis of fairness and equity in that such standards shall be based on the reasonable working capacities of normal experienced employees working at a normal pace to produce quality work in the manner that the Company prescribes.
2.	When a work standard is established and is not disputed, or is disputed and settled, such standard shall remain unchanged and not subject to dispute unless and until the operation is changed as a result of change in method, layout, tools, equipment, materials or product design. When a change is made in a work standard for any of the above reasons, only the elements of the operations that are affected by such change will be adjusted.
The Corporation agrees it is desirable to establish work standards on a new operation as early as is feasible. Where a standard is not established, the Steward, upon request, will be given management's reasons for not establishing the standard.
When a standard is not established, an employee, who is following the prescribed method and using the tools provided in the proper manner and performing at a normal pace, will not be disciplined for failure to obtain an expected amount of production.
When imposing discipline for failure to follow a prescribed method or for failure to use the tools provided in a proper manner, an employee will be informed in writing in what respect the employee failed to follow the method or use the tools. Upon request, the Steward will also be given the reason.
(76)
WORK STANDARDS
3.	When a work study is to be made for the purpose of establishing a standard, advance notice will be given to any normal experienced employee to be studied and to the employee's Steward. When a work standard is established, notice will be given to the employee and to said Steward advising them of the established work standard. When a study is made for purposes other than establishing a standard, the purpose of the study will be made known to a Union representative.
4.	Circumstances affecting the time of performance of a particular job that were not taken into account in establishing a work standard are known as non-standard conditions. When such non-standard conditions exist and are brought to the attention of management, the employee concerned shall be advised of the rate of production at which said employee will be required to perform the job under such non-standard conditions.
(b)	Relief Time and Other Allowances
1.	All employees on a regular eight-hour shift shall have a relief period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate twelve (12) minutes before lunch and twelve (12) minutes after lunch. Such relief periods represent five percent of the shift time or three (3) minutes per hour. The amount of such relief time shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular eight-hour shift. This shall not be deemed to affect the environmental relief allowance now included in the work standard of certain operations nor the allowance applicable to certain other operations as expressly set forth in letters from the Corporation to the Union.
Such relief time, except in emergencies, shall not be provided during the first hour of the shift or the first hour after the lunch period, or during such other periods, not exceeding in the aggregate two (2) hours per shift, as may be mutually satisfactory in the local plants.
(77)
WORK N D A R D S
2.	When a time study is made, the employee's performance will be rated as to normal at the time such study is made. In addition to the regular relief allowance, allowances will be made for such elements as standard tool changes, material handling, and fatigue where these are a factor.
(c)	Special Provisions Regarding Breakdowns, Ratio of Body Types, and Controlling Operations.
1.	An employee will not be required to make up a loss in production on the employee's operation solely as a result of machine or equipment breakdown or shortage of stock or other conditions if the condition is beyond the employee’s control, but the employee may be directed while the condition exists, to perform other work or, if the condition exists during a period when the employee may be required to do so, to take regular relief time.
2.	Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the expected normal ratio of body types, optional equipment or other product types. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled ratio of body types including optional equipment or other product types on conveyor lines and more or less work is required because of the change in mix, compensating adjustments in work assignment, manpower, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. Arrangements will be made locally to establish procedures which will provide advance knowledge of mix changes that require compensating adjustments so that such adjustments will be made in a timely manner. On conveyor line operations, management will designate specific off-line operations from which employees will be made available to compensate for such mix changes when one of the compensating adjustments selected is an increase in employees, The compensating adjustments will be made known to the affected employee in the employee's ordinary work area in
(78)
WORK STANDARDS
time to accommodate the mix change. Upon request, Management will advise the Union of the arrangements made. If the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee does not equal the available time of the employee's work station, additional elements of work may be assigned to the employee. not to exceed the available time of the employee's work station. If work assignments on such lines are changed, the Supervisor will advise the employee what elements have been added to or removed from the operation.
3.	On some press, machine or conveyor lines the operations are limited by the controlling operation on the line with the result that on such lines either the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee is less than the employee’s available time or the rate of production required of an employee is less than standard. In such circumstances the employee will be advised of the standard and available time for the operation whether or not the employee is required to produce to the standard. When the work standard on the controlling operation is adjusted, the other operations that were so limited will be adjusted accordingly within their standards.
(d)	Dispute Procedure
1. If an employee or group of employees believes that any paragraph or paragraphs of this Work Standards Section has been violated, and the employee (or they) is aggrieved as the result thereof, the employee, or a designated member of the group, may take the matter up with the Supervisor, or ask the Supervisor to send for their Steward. On request the Supervisor will obtain for the Steward in writing an elemental breakdown of the operation in question. Such elemental breakdown shall consist of all the elements of the operation in the order of their performance with the time for each element and the total time for the operation as these appear on the study or supporting data. On conveyor assembly lines each
work: standards
elemental breakdown will reflect the scheduled rate of production and available time, either by the hour or the day as requested.
The best efforts of the employee, the Supervisor concerned and the Steward shall be directed toward settling the matter. Among other things, it shall be determined that the employee's work method, the job layout, the tools and equipment are those on which the standard is based. Machine cycle times, feeds and speeds, stock locations and line speed are among other items that should be checked to determine that these are as contemplated in the standard.
When an Elemental Breakdown has been requested, employees on the disputed operation, if a work standard has not been established, will not be disciplined in connection with the dispute until the Union has been furnished the Elemental Breakdown. Once a standard has been established and the Union has been furnished the Elemental Breakdown, employees may be disciplined for failure to obtain the standard notwithstanding the fact the standard may be in dispute.
By receiving the elemental breakdown and other information regarding an operation, the Union will not thereby waive its right later to dispute the time values of the elements of the operation.
2. (i) If after the above procedure is followed the matter is not resolved, a written grievance may be filed with the Supervisor, signed by the aggrieved employee or aggrieved employees. The Supervisor shall reply to the grievance within Iwo (2) regular working days. If the grievance is not disposed of, it may within two (2) regular working days of the Supervisor's reply be appealed by the Chairperson of the Plant Shop Committee to the next step by giving written notice to the Labour Relations Department.
(ii) Following receipt of the Supervisor's reply and prior to the special meeting held pursuant to
(80)
WORK STANDARDS
Paragraph 3 below, the Local Union Time Study Person will be permitted to make a study of the job in dispute. This study shall not be deemed to be in substitution for the National Union Industrial Engineer giving technical assistance as provided in Paragraph 3 below.
(iii) The Local Union Time Study Person shall be an employee having seniority in a plant of the Corporation, who is trained and qualified by the National Union as a Time Study Person. The Union may designate in writing to the Corporation from among seniority employees at work in the plant a permanent alternate Local Union Time Study Person who is trained and qualified by the Union as a Time Study Person to function when the Local Union Time Study Person is to be away from the plant for at least a full shift and plant management receives advance notification of such absence.
The Time Study Person, during regular working hours of the Time Study Person, may perform the' duties as herein set forth subject to the provisions of Section (2.3) (b), (c), (d) and (e) and notwithstanding seniority status, shall in the event of a layoff be retained at work as long as there is a job scheduled in the plant in which the Time Study Person is employed which the Time Study Person is able to do and shall be recalled to work after a layoff as soon as there is a job in either the Windsor Assembly Plant, the Pillette Road Truck Assembly Plant or the Bramalea Assembly Plant, the Time Study Person is able to do.
3.	Within five (5) regular working days of the receipt of the appeal to the Labour Relations Department, the grievance will be considered at a special step of the grievance procedure by three representatives of the Union, including the Steward, Plant Shop Committeeperson and Chairperson of the Plant Shop Committee and three representatives of management, at least one of whom shall be a member of higher supervision.
(81)
WORK. N D A R D S
After the written grievance has been answered by the Supervisor, all of the data supporting the standard shall be made available to the appropriate Plant Shop Committeeperson or to the National Union’s Industrial Engineer upon request, without undue delay.
If the Chairperson of the Plant Shop Committee so requests, the Corporation will make a new study of the operation promptly by the time study method, using a normal experienced operator on the job. 'The time limits for the meeting in this step of the procedure shall be extended by the time required to make the study and the study shall be made available to the participants in this step of the procedure. Also, should the National Union through the Labour Relations Department request an Industrial Engineer from the Corporation and an Industrial Engineer from the National Union to give their technical assistance in resolving the grievance the time limits for the holding of this meeting shall be extended by the time required. In this event, the Industrial Engineers shall give their prompt attention to the matter. In the presence of a Local Union representative or representatives they will compare and exchange their studies and computations without undue delay to determine the areas of difference, if any, in order to expedite resolving the grievance. The National Union and the Labour Relations Department will arrange for the participation of the Union's Industrial Engineer.
The requirements of this procedure for the making available of elemental breakdowns, back-up data, for the taking of a new time study by the Corporation at the request of the Chairperson of the Plant Shop Committee, and for the participation of the Union's Industrial Engineer shall apply only to grievances alleging that the aggrieved employee cannot perform the work required in the time allowed because the standard was not established in conformity with Section (4.1) (a) (1) hereof.
4.	Within two (2) regular working days of the special step meeting, higher supervision will give a written answer.
(82)
WORK STANDARDS
If the grievance is not settled at this step, it may within five (5) regular working days from the date of the written answer be referred to the Work Standards Arbitrator. The Work Standards Arbilrator shall consider the grievance and render a decision within two (2) weeks of receipt of such referral.
The Work Standards Arbitrator shall be selected either by mutual agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, by the Minister of Labour for Ontario. Payment of the Work Standards Arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be shared equally by the parties.
5.	In considering a grievance so referred the Work Standards Arbitrator shall have authority only to rule on whether any paragraph or paragraphs to this section have been violated, including Paragraph (a) 1, and on the correctness of any and all facts that are in dispute in the grievance. However, the Work Standards Arbitrator shall not have authority to alter or establish a standard on any operation. The ruling of the Work Standards Arbitrator shall be binding on both parties.
6.	The Union and the Corporation shall stipulate in advance of the hearing which matters are in dispute and the Work Standards Arbitrator shall make a determination only with respect to those matters. The parties shall make available to the Work Standards Arbitrator at the hearing any data pertinent to the operation which the Work Standards Arbitrator may request, or which the parties may desire to present.
7.	The Work Standards Arbitrator shall observe the performance of the operation in dispute and when requested by either party the Work Standards Arbitrator shall make a time study of the operation, using a normal experienced operator on the job. If the parties cannot agree on the normal experienced operator to be studied, the Work Standards Arbitrator shall make the selection.
WORK STANDARDS
8.	In submitting a ruling, the Work Standards Arbitrator shall also submit to both parties copies of all the facts of the study and computations thereto.
9.	If pursuant to the above the Work Standards Arbitrator rules that Paragraph (a) 1, has been violated, the Corporation will be obligated to establish a new standard within two (2) regular working days following receipt of such ruling.
10.	If the Union considers the new standard unsatisfactory, it may file a grievance concerning the standard and such grievance will be reviewed by the parties within two (2) regular working days. If the grievance is not resolved at this meeting, the Corporation will give its written reply to the grievance within two (2) regular working days thereafter.
Within two (2) regular working days after receipt of the written answer, the Union may appeal the grievance to the Work Standards Arbitrator and in such event the Work Standards Arbitrator will hold a hearing within one (1) week and review the action taken by the Corporation. The Work Standards Arbitrator will not take an additional time study but shall determine within three (3) regular working days after the hearing whether the new standard is also in violation of Paragraph (a) 1.
1 1. The Arbitration procedure outlined herein shall be subject to the laws of the Province of Ontario and any regulations or decisions thereunder having the force of law. (c99)
Letter (4.2) Work Standards - Disputes
During negotiations, extensive discussions took place between the parties regarding the requirements to establish fair and equitable workloads and a process to expeditiously resolve job disputes in an orderly manner. Fundamental to the effectiveness of this process is a commitment to open communication and a process of finding satisfactory solutions.
(84)
WORK, STANDARDS}
The par-ties agree that the following elements are key to an effective work allocation process:
1.	Advance discussions concerning planned efficiency initiatives and new model changes.
2.	A well defined process to address operation or employee issues as they arise.
3.	Effective utilization of all resources including, but not limited to, engineering, health and safety, ergonomics and maintenance to resolve issues on disputed operations.
4.	Involvement of the time study representative and company counterpart to address work allocation and job standard issues.
5.	Exchange of information, including but not limited to, available time study data to facilitate the resolution of work allocation issues.
6.	Two (2) weeks prior to the conclusion of the work allocation period, company and union representatives will meet to review the status of the work allocation changes and plans to finalize these actions. This review will encompass the identification of remaining efficiency targets, work elements to be allocated, and plans for assigning these elements.
7.	An understanding that in the event allocation changes are required outside of the work allocation period as provided in the collective agreement, these changes will be implemented following advance notification and, where reasonably possible, stable work loads will be maintained.
Further, the parties discussed the procedures used at the assembly plants to resolve disputed work allocations consistent with Section (4.1 )(d) of the collective agreement.
It was agreed that the following elements are key to an effective process to resolve disputed work allocations:
1.	Identification of the -reason(s) for the disputed work allocation.
2.	Utilization of all resources to address issues including, but not limited to, tooling, engineering or design
(85)
WORK STANDARDS
specifications, health and safety, ergonomics, methods, layout, sequence, and process.
3.	If the dispute remains, involvement of the time study representative and company counterpart to review available time study data and address issues including, but not limited to, non-standard conditions, model mix and option content impact and overcycles as required. The parties shall verify available time study data on the operator experiencing difficulty. At this stage and if necessary, a time study would be conducted for the purpose of resolving the above issues.
4.	Fteview of any remaining issue(s) will be undertaken by the time study representative and a senior member of management.
5.	If the dispute remains, a grievance may be filed in accordance with the provision of Section (4.1)(d) 2 of the collective agreement.
6.	A meeting will be convened as required, consistent with Section (4.1)(d) 3 of the collective agreement.
7.	In the event the matter is not resolved, the Plant Chairperson and the Human Resources Manager may arrange a meeting with the appropriate local personnel including the special committeeperson to resolve the matter.
8.	Should an issue still remain, the CAW National President’s office and DaimlerChrysler Canada Labour Relations Staff may each appoint an external subject matter expert to review the disputed work allocation. Their recommendation for resolution will be provided to the plant chairperson and the plant manager within two weeks. If the recommendation is not mutually agreed upon, or the recommendation is not acceptable to either party, the grievance will be expedited to arbitration consistent with the provisions of the collective agreement.
The intent of this process is to provide for the timely and orderly resolution of job disputes.
(86)
WORK5TANDARDS
It is recognized that modifications to this process may be required consistent with current local practices as agreed to by the parties.
If at any time either party believes that the spirit and the intent of this letter are not being followed, a meeting will be convened between representatives of the CAW National President’s office and DaimlerChrysler Canada Labour Relations Staff. (n99)
Letter (4.3) Work Allocation - Assembly Operations
During negotiations, the parties discussed the subject of work allocations in the Windsor Assembly, Pillette Road Truck Assembly and Bramalea Assembly Plants.
The Company emphasized the numerous factors that influence its ability to make unchangeable work allocations early in the model run in its vehicle assembly plants, among which include the overmanning that sometimes occurs early in the model, in connection with launching and the normal difficulties associated with the production of new models, the engineering changes which occur throughout the model run, the frequent variations in body mix and option scheduling rates, the continual changes in processing and tooling, and the persistent efforts which the Company makes to achieve a satisfactory level of manpower efficiency and workload balance.
The Company also appreciates the interest which employees in vehicle assembly plants have in securing a reasonably certain level of work assignment at some point in time in the model run. EJearing this in mind, the factors noted above are particularly critical in assembly plants in the model years in which there is a new or major change to the car or truck lines, and somewhat less critical where the vehicle lines receive minor changes. In either case, these changes are not unimportant.
In addition, the Company expressed its objective to be fully competitive in the industry and marketplace, and its coinciding inclination to approach this matter cautiously.
(87)
WORK STANDARDS
As such, the Company assured, in negotiations, that beginning 10 working days, after the first new model vehicle reaches the end of the Final Assembly line, and by the end of 100 calendar days following thereafter, exclusive of the plant vacation shutdown period, suitable employee work allocations will have been made and will remain unchanged for the balance of that year's model run, excepting if a change in work allocation is occasioned by changes in line speed, schedule mix, option installation rates, tooling, processing, engineering or design specifications, methods or layouts. This arrangement applies only in those circumstances where minor changes are made to the respective models at either the Windsor Assembly, or the Pillette Road Truck Assembly or Bramalea Assembly Plants. Where major changes are contemplated in any one or all of its models at these assembly plants, extensions to the 100 calendar day time period will be necessary to accomplish its work allocation objectives, at which time the matter will be explained to the respective in-plant CAW Committee. Implementation of this arrangement at the Bramalea Assembly Plant will be effective with 1996 model year production and apply to direct labour operations only.
This arrangement does not constitute any kind of acknowledgement that the workload or work allocation as of the time it becomes unchanged wilj represent a full workload, nor does it include any assurance or implication that the work allocation in the succeeding model year will remain unchanged regardless of the degree of vehicle change. (n93, c96)
Letter (4.4) Mix and Overcycle Condition
During negotiations, the parties discussed the impact of mix and overcycle conditions on work allocations. The union expressed concerns related to overcycles and recovery time. The company recognizes the importance of ensuring an employee’s ability to perform his/her operation
WORK STANDARDS
in a safe manner resulting in a quality product. The parties acknowledged that efforts to minimize the frequency and impact of overcycles has been effective. It was agreed that floor supervision will use available data and advanced planning to respond to adverse mix conditions. In addition, each facility will locally establish a containment plan to immediately address any mix concerns or overcycle conditions and this plan will be communicated to affected employees. (n99)
Letter (4.5) Methodology
During negotiations, the parties discussed alternative methodologies that may be utilized to resolve disputes relating to elemental time allocations when establishing a product standard. While it was acknowledged that M.O.S.T. at Bramalea and a stop watch in Windsor are the time measurement systems utilized by the company to establish production standards, local practitioners may use the stop watch, M.O.S.T. or other methodologies to resolve disputes regarding elemental time allocations.

(5.3) Loss of Seniority
(a) An employee shall lose seniority for the following reasons only:
1.	The employee quits.
2.	The employee is discharged and the discharge is not reversed through the grievance procedure.
3.	If the employee is absent for five (5) regular working days (scheduled Saturdays included) without advising the Corporation's Employment Department giving satisfactory reasons.
4.	If the employee fails to return to work within five (5) regular working days (scheduled Saturdays included) after notification to do so to the employee's address on record with the Corporation unless the employee furnishes satisfactory reasons for such failure.
5.	If the employee is not called upon to perform work for the Corporation for a period of sixty (60) consecutive months or for a period equal to the employee’s seniority at the date when the employee last performed work for the Corporation, whichever shall be the greater.
6.	If the employee receives a permanent total disability benefit under a group life insurance policy held by the Corporation. If such employee recovers and either (a) the employee's permanent total disability benefit is discontinued or (b) the employee’s permanent total disability benefit has been fully paid, the employee’s seniority, including that which the employee otherwise would have acquired during the period of said disability, shall be restored. Provided, however, if the period of the employee's disability was for a period longer than the seniority the employee had on the date the employee was approved for a permanent total disability benefit the employee shall upon the restoration of seniority as provided above be given seniority equal to the amount of the seniority the employee had on the date such permanent total disability benefit was approved. However, as to an employee who received such benefit prior to the

date of this Agreement, the employee's seniority will continue to accumulate and, should the employee recover, the employee's total accumulated seniority will be credited.
7.	The employee retires or receives a pension under the Pension Plan of this Agreement. If the employee receives a pension for permanent total disability and recovers and the pension is discontinued, the employee's seniority including that which the employee otherwise would have acquired during the period of disability, shall be restored, provided, however, if the period of the employee's disability retirement was for a period longer than the seniority the employee had on the date said pension for permanent total disability began, the employee shall, upon the discontinuance of permanent total disability pension, be given seniority equal to the amount of seniority the employee had on the date such pension began.
8.	The employee accepts a Separation Payment under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan incorporated in this Agreement in which event the employee's seniority shall be broken at any and all plants and locations of the Corporation as of the date the employee's application for the Separation Payment was received by the Corporation.
(b) In the event an employee loses seniority under Section (5.3) as a result of imprisonment for up to one (1) year in connection with an offence arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, or for imprisonment up to 18 months in connection with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, the employee's incarceration shall be considered a proper exception under the provisions governing loss of seniority and the employee's seniority shall be reinstated.

When exceptions this Section involving an employee the Corporation and the Union to be =t problem, the parlies may further agree that such employee may not be displaced under the Layoff and Recall paragraphs of the applicable Plant Special Provisions or under Paragraph 6.2 of the Special Provisions Pertaining to Windsor Area Plants, nor may such employee exercise any job opportunity claim to any other job unless mutually agreed by the Corporation and the Union. However, if in the event of a layoff the seniority of the employee placed under this Section does not entitle the employee to remain at work, the employee shall be laid off accordingly and the employee shall be called back according to seniority provided the employee has the ability to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(5.5) Reinstatement After Disability
(a) When an employee's absence from work is due solely to disability resulting from sickness or injury and due proof of the disability is given to the plant the employee will be returned to work in accordance with seniority and these rules as nearly as may be as if the employee had not suffered disability, provided the employee passes the required medical examination. If the disposition made as the result of any such medical examination is not satisfactory, the employee may ask to discuss the matter at the plant with the Steward or Committeeperson, and Management will so arrange it. If a grievance on the matter is submitted, it may be referred to Step 3 of the grievance procedure. The Local Union may then take the grievance up with the Plant Manager, or the designated representative. In proper cases, the parties may select an independent physician to resolve the conflicting medical findings of the employee's personal physician and the plant

The selection of an independent physician by the Plant Management and the Local Union will be made within seven (7) working days from the date the matter was referred to the Plant Manager or the Plant Manager's designated representative. Costs will be paid by the Plant. If the report of the independent physician places work restrictions or limitations on the employee equal to or greater than those previously placed on the employee by the plant physician, there shall be no retroactive pay. If the report or decision, places work restrictions or limitations on the employee which are less than those previously placed on the employee by the plant physician, retroactive pay, if any, shall be limited to the period beginning two (2) weeks prior to the day of the final examination by the independent physician and shall be calculated as provided in Section (3.9).
The decision of the independent physician shall be final and binding on the Corporation, the employee involved and the Union.
(b) If an employee claims to be unable to perform the duties of the available work to which he/she would be entitled by seniority and Management disputes such claim, the issue shall be submitted to an independent physician, provided consultation between the employee's personal physician and the plant physician or physicians acting for the Corporation does not resolve the conflicting medical findings. The independent physician shall be selected by the Local Union and the Plant Management within seven (7) working days from the date the dispute arose. The employee shall submit to a physical examination by the independent physician who shall submit a written report of medical findings and conclusions. Costs of such examination shall be paid by the Plant. The decision of the independent physician shall be final and binding on the Corporation, the employee involved and the Union.

Provisions pertaining to shift preference shall be negotiated locally in the plants. Any such agreements must have sufficient flexibility to give full protection to efficiency of operations at all limes.
Letter (5.7) Student Hires - Seniority
The Corporation agrees that student hires will not be required to serve a double probationary period provided the permanent employment follows the period of student employment without interruption. Accumulation of seniority will be as provided under the Section dealing with being placed on the seniority lists after ninety (90) calendar days intermittent employment within any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. (c96)
Letter (5.8) Hiring Practice
In hiring new production and maintenance employees it will be our practice to give serious consideration to the employment applications of qualified persons who have lost their seniority by reason of layoffs at plants of the Corporation.
Letter (5.9) Preferential Hires
During the recently concluded negotiations, the Union expressed great concern regarding seniority employees who are indefinitely laid off as a result of a permanent discontinuance of operations or other reduction in force without reasonable likelihood of recall.
The Corporation stated it shared the Union's concern and advised the Union that during the term of the Agreement such employees may apply for preferential hiring opportunities at other Company plants covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement during the term of the new agreement.
Seniority employees who wish to apply shall file application for placement within six (6) months of layoff at
(96)
SENIORITY
their local Employment Office. Exceptions will be reviewed by the Senior Manager Labour Relations and Safety upon request of the National Union.
Such employees shall be given preference for placement in seniority order, available work permitting, or if none is available, the opportunity to displace probationary employees on jobs for which they are qualified in other plants covered by the P&M Agreement.
Any employee hired pursuant to this provision shall enter the new plant with date of entry seniority and shall not while so employed be subject to recall to the plant from which said employee was laid off. When permanently laid off from such new plant the employee shall elect to (a) retain seniority in the new plant, or (b) return to the former plant with full accumulated seniority, in which case the employees seniority at all other plants shall terminate. Any employee who upon layoff fails or refuses to make the election set forth above shall be deemed to have elected to retain seniority in the plant from which the employee was last laid off.
An employee accepting work under the provisions of this letter shall retain' rights accrued for purposes of holiday pay, payment in lieu of vacation, pensions, insurance, and the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
It is understood that the separation of an employee from the new plant for a reason other than ability to perform the assigned work shall result in the termination of the employee's seniority at all plants.
Employees who refuse an initial offer to work pursuant to these preferential placement arrangements shall be ineligible for further coverage under these provisions except for a onetime opportunity to reapply within thirty (30) days following a six-month period after the offer.
The preferential hiring arrangements covered by this letter contain potentially complex administrative implications and there may be times the Corporation may not be able to fully conform with these provisions.

Accordingly, the Corporation shall not be liable for any back pay on any claims arising from the administration of this letter.
Letter (5.10) Preferential Hires - Plant Closure
During the negotiations, in conjunction with discussions regarding the Job and Income Security Program, the parties discussed the application of the preferential placement guidelines contained in Letter (5.9).
The parties agree that in circumstances involving a plant closure exceptions will be made to the arrangements specified in the Preferential Hires Letter (5.9) such that employees who transfer to another location will receive an adjusted seniority date at the new location which will be the date that notice of closure was given to the Union. Employees would be canvassed for Preferential Hire considerations and offered the opportunity to exercise hiring rights at any plant covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement. As job opportunities occur at a receiving plant, employees will be contacted in seniority order and offered employment. Employment offers may be made prior to the actual plant closing. If an employee declines the employment opportunity, such employee shall be removed from the list for that plant after which the employee shall become eligible for normal preferential hire rights as specified in the Preferential Hires Letter. Such employees, when transferred to an opening at the new location, may displace employees hired at that location after the date the notice of closure was provided to the Union.
Letter (5.11) Rights Under Job & Income Protection During the recently concluded negotiations the Union expressed concern regarding seniority employees who are laid off as a result of an action described in Letter (17.11) -Restructuring - Job and Income Protection who secure employment through the Preferential Hire opportunities at

SENIORITY
another corporate facility and within five years of the original layoff date are again indefinitely laid off without expectation of recall.
The Corporation agrees that under these circumstances the employee will be given the option to remain on layoff from the last facility where they were employed or to exercise their rights under Letter (17.1 I), Job and income Protection available to them at the time of the original layoff.
Letter (5.13) Correctional Services -
Temporary Absence Program In the course of current negotiations the Corporation and the Union had discussions concerning the loss of seniority by employees who had been approved by the Ministry of Correctional Services for release from jail under a Temporary Absence Work Release permit.
This letter is intended to clarify the understanding, agreed to during the course of negotiations, pertaining to such employees.
The Corporation agrees that in the situation in which the Ministry is prepared to release an employee from jail to attend work, the Corporation will not decline to participate in such a Temporary Absence Program provided the employee’s seniority would not otherwise be lost.
(5.14) Statement Of Policy No. 1
Able To Satisfactorily Perform The purpose of this phrase is tied in with seniority to assure the Corporation of a satisfactory performance just as seniority is designed to give an employee an equitable degree of security. The Corporation does feel that a reasonable application of this phrase throughout the Collective Bargaining Agreement would involve careful consideration of the following basic principles:
(a)	The complexity and nature of the job.
(99)
SENIORITY
(b)	The experience of the employee on the type of work involved.
(c)	The amount of instruction and/or break-in required.
(d)	The length of time that the employee would be working at the job involved.
In applying these principles generally, this would mean that the shorter the period of time an employee would be assigned to a particular job (e.g., overtime, short-term layoff) the less time the Corporation could be expected to spend on instruction or break-in even to the extent that present ability could be a requirement. Likewise, the longer period of time (in indefinite layoff or job opportunity situations) the longer time the Corporation could be expected to spend, up to reasonable limits, on instruction and/or break-in. Members of supervision in making such decisions should give thorough consideration to the ability of the employees.
It would mean that as jobs increase in complexity, etc., the greater the experience on the type of work involved would be required in order to be able to satisfactorily perform.
In its application, particularly in indefinite layoff and job opportunity situations, it would be advantageous to the employee and the Corporation and it would help to eliminate problems if employees would place on record with the Corporation by supplemental application for employment, qualifications which they did not make known at the time of hire or which they have since acquired so that the Corporation would be in at least as good a position to qualify applicants in these situations as it is in assessing the qualification of new hires.

Letter (8.13) Pay Practices
In the negotiations of the Production and Maintenance Agreement between DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. and the CAW dated today certain interpretations were developed. The Corporation's interpretation of the applicable sections of the Agreement will be as follows:
1.	Saturday work. Section (8.4) provides:
“Time and one-half will be paid as follows, except as provided in Section (8.6):
"(b) For time worked on Saturday, except when a shift starts on Friday and continues into Saturday; provided that hours in excess of eight (8) per day or forty (40) per week on such shift will be paid at time and one-half.”
In interpreting Section (8.4) (b), it is understood that employees who work a shift on Saturday or Friday into Saturday that normally would be their sixth day worked but have not yet worked five (5) straight time shifts in the workweek due to an absence during the workweek will receive time and one-half for the hours worked on Saturday. This interpretation is intended to cover the third shift Sunday Night Start employee who works a sixth scheduled shift, and the first or second shift employee in the situation covered by Appeal Board Case No. 3855.
2.	Saturday following a holiday. Except as specified in Paragraph 1 above, employees whose shift begins on Friday and who work into a Saturday do not receive time and one-half for work on Saturday. A holiday falling during a workweek has no effect on the payment of premium for Saturday work.
(HI)
WORKING HOURS
3.	Work into a new workweek. The workweek is defined in Section (8.11).
“The regularly scheduled workweek starts at 12:01 a.m., Monday, and ends 168 hours thereafter, except those employees on third shift operations starting Sunday night in which case their regularly scheduled workweek starts with the beginning of their shift Sunday night and ends 168 hours thereafter.” It is understood that this includes those employees on seven-day operations.
Accordingly, (i) a third shift employee who begins a shift on Sunday and works into Monday will receive double time for hours worked on Sunday and straight time for the hours worked on Monday; (ii) a second shift employee who works a shift that starts Sunday and continues into Monday will be paid double time for hours worked on Sunday and time and one-half for hours worked on Monday, provided such hours on Monday are in excess of 40 straight-time hours worked during the week in which the Sunday falls. If such hours on Monday are not in excess of 40, such hours will be paid at straight time until the employee accumulates 40 straight-time hours, and then hours in excess of 40 will be paid at time and one-half. If Monday is a holiday, such hours will be paid at double time.
The above paragraph does not apply to employees on seven-day operations.
The chart attached to this letter illustrates the interpretations set forth above.
4.	Seven-Day Operations. Section (8.6) of the Agreement now provides:
“Employees working on what are normally classified as seven-day operations will not be paid overtime or premium pay in accordance with Sections (8.4) and (8.5) above, but will be paid as follows:
“(a) Time and one-half for hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any continuous twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the starting time of the employee’s shift or in excess of forty (40) hours per week.
(112)
WORKING HOURS
"(b) Time and one-half for time worked on the sixth (6th) day of the employee’s scheduled workweek.
"(c) Double time for time worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive scheduled day whether or not the seven consecutive scheduled days fall in the same workweek.
"(d) For the purposes of Subsections (b) and (c), a holiday specified in Section (12.1) for which an employee receives holiday pay or on which the employee performs work will be considered as a day worked. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (8.8), a holiday counted in determining an employee’s eligibility for payment pursuant to Subsection (b) may also be counted in determining the same employee’s eligibility for payment pursuant to Subsection (c).
"(e) Double time and one-half for time worked on any of the days on which any of the designated full holidays is observed unless the holiday falls on one of the employee's regularly scheduled days off in which event the employee, in addition to holiday pay under Section (12.12), will be paid double time for time worked.
“(I) Time and one-quarter for time worked on a Sunday that is not compensable at a higher overtime rate under any other provision of this Agreement."
An employee who performs maintenance duties in the powerhouse and who is normally scheduled to work Monday through Friday, and an employee, who is assigned to attend or maintain an auxiliary equipment installation that operates in conjunction with five-day operations, shall not be deemed to be working on an operation covered by Section (8.6).
5.	The provisions of Sections (8.4) and (8.5) shall not preclude mutually satisfactory local arrangements to the effect that when an employee is transferred to a different shift as the result of a reduction in the working force the employee’s previous twenty-four (24) hour period shall terminate for purposes of computing overtime, and the shift to which the employee is transferred shall be regarded as
(113)
WORKING HOURS
the beginning of a new twenty-four (24) hour period. This provision shall not require a change in any existing local arrangement on this matter.
6.	Section (8.2), Shift Premium and Hours, provides:
“(a) Employees regularly employed on the second or third shift shall receive in addition to their regular pay for the pay period five (5) per cent and ten (10) per cent, respectively, additional compensation.
"(b) The first shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 4:00 a.mi. but before 1 1:00 a.m. The second shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 11:00 a.m. but before 7:00 p.m. The third shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 7:00 p.m. but before 4:00 a.m.”
Hourly employees who are scheduled to work and work a shift other than their regularly scheduled shift, will receive the premium provided in Section (8.2).
For example, an employee is normally scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On Friday the employee is scheduled to work and works a shift from 3:30 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. The employee will receive second shift premium for those hours on Friday.
First shift employees who are scheduled to work and who do work additional hours in advance of their regular shift starting time will receive the shift premium applicable to their advanced starting time for all hours worked on such shift.
For example, a first shift employee is normally scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On Friday the employee is scheduled to work and works a shift from 3:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The employee will receive third shift premium for those hours on Friday.
7.	These interpretations shall be effective with the effective date of the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today and shall apply during the term of said Agreement.

Letter (8.14) Paid Lunch
This will confirm our understanding that in applying Section (8.9) (b) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement, the Corporation intends to do the following:
When production employees are assigned full time on a regular basis to all three shifts in a production department and the number of production employees on the least populated shift exceeds 50% of the number of employees on the most populated shift in that production department, all the production employees in that department shall be scheduled to work 7 3/4 hours on each shift and shall have a lunch period of one-quarter hour and shall receive eight (8) hours pay.
It is understood that this arrangement does not apply to repair departments in assembly plants or employees in nonproductive or indirect labour departments such as inspection, material, maintenance, janitors, etc., except for those employees assigned exclusively on a full-time and regular basis to the production department working 7 3/4 hours, in which case the non-productive or indirect employees will also be scheduled to work 7 3/4 hours and a one-quarter hour lunch period.
This application is not intended to interfere with any local agreement in effect or to limit management's right to apply the provision of Section (8.9) (a) under any ci rcumstances.
If it is necessary to deviate from this application at any plant, the local union will be advised of 'the reasons and should any disputes arise as to the application of this Agreement and cannot be resolved at the local level, it will be immediately referred to the National Union and DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. for resolution.

Letter (8.15) 3rd Shift Operations Sunday Night Start During negotiations leading to the new collective bargaining agreement signed today, the parties discussed the feasibility of converting all third shift operations to a Sunday night start.
The parties recognize that in certain plants it is essential that third shift operations continue to start the work week on Monday night due to operating requirements.
Under certain conditions which are acceptable to both the Local Union and the Management of a particular plant, arrangements may be made whereby third shift operations which start on Monday night may, by mutual agreement, be changed to start on Sunday night subject to the approval of the National Union and the Staff Labour Relations Department of the Corporation.
Letter (8.16) Starting Times in Plants
In the negotiations leading to the current collective bargaining agreement, the Union acknowledged that business considerations in the Corporation Plants often require a change of shift starting times.
It is the policy of the Corporation to advise the Union of the need to change shift starting times prior to implementing such change as well as to advise the Union of the reasons for such change.
Letter (8.17) Shift Schedule
The Corporation reserves the right to change the current shift schedules where circumstances so warrant. Such changes will be discussed with the Union prior to implementation.

Letter (8.18) Employment Standards Act
During the current negotiations the Union expressed concern about the possibility of future legislative changes negatively impacting existing employment standards as set forth in the Employment Standards Act (Ontario) June 5, 1995. During the negotiation process the parties acknowledged their reliance on this legislation as forming a basis for past practices in respect of employment standards not otherwise specifically covered by the collective agreement. As an outgrowth of these discussions, the parties came to the following agreement.
A. The rights, benefits, terms or conditions of employment as set out as employment standards in the Employment Standards Act, and Regulations made thereunder, as they existed on June 5, 1995, as the same relates to the Union, the Corporation and/or its employees, shall be minimum requirements incorporated within this collective agreement; however, where this collective agreement provides higher remuneration in money or a greater right, benefit, term or condition of employment in favour of an employee(s) with respect to a particular standard, this collective agreement shall prevail.
A violation of the rights, benefits, terms or conditions of employment as set out as employment standards in the Employment Standards Act and Regulations made thereunder, as they existed on June, 5,1995, as the same relates to the Union, the Corporation and/or its employees, may be subject to the grievance procedure of this collective agreement or may be prosecuted and enforced through the procedural mechanisms offered by the Employment Standards Act and Regulations thereunder, as they exist from time to time, but not both.
13. During negotiations, the union expressed the concern that the provincial Government has and would amend the Employment Standards Act and or Regulations
WORKING R S
in a manner adverse to the interests of the Union and DaimlerChrysler bargaining unit employees. It was agreed that the parties shall meet within thirty (30) days after the introduction of a Bill amending the ESA to the legislature to discuss the proposed Bill. The parties agree that the Union and/or DaimlerChrysler bargaining unit employees shall not be disadvantaged in any way by any amendments to the ESA or regulations thereunder made by the provincial Government. It is agreed that for example, if any part of the collective agreement or past practice of the parties provides a greater right, benefit, term or condition of employment than the amendment to a particular employment standard (such as an amendment to the 8 + 48 hours of work rule), then the collective agreement or past practices shall prevail and apply.

Distribution and Recording of Overtime
Memorandum of Understanding between DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Corporation”) and the National Union, CAW, and its Local Unions No. 444 and 1090 (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
In view of the desire of the parties to establish a procedure for the distribution and recording of overtime applicable to existing conditions, it is agreed that the following procedure be established.
This procedure in no way takes the place of, or takes away from, Paragraph 8.1 Special Provisions Pertaining to Windsor Area Plants or Paragraph 8.1 Special Provisions Pertaining to Ajax Trim Plant in the case of other than skilled trades. It establishes the mechanics only for the

Because of the limited number of departments presently operating on more than one shift, and owing to the present absence of groups, and in view of the desire of the parties to establish a procedure for the distribution and recording of overtime applicable to existing conditions, it is agreed that for the time being the following procedure will not contain any reference to group or shift. However, it is further agreed that when, in the opinion of the Corporation, the situation warrants reference in the procedure to group and/or shift such reference shall be read into the procedure as if set out in full therein consistent with Paragraphs 8.1 or 8.1 in the above Special Provisions.
Definition
1.	For the purposes of distributing and recording overtime work: “Overtime” shall mean time worked over eight (8) hours within any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, Monday through Friday; time worked on Saturdays, Sundays and paid holidays excepting that, where overtime pay is paid for time worked within a regular eight (8) hour day such time shall not be considered overtime for the purposes of this Memorandum.
Notice
2.	The Union recognizes that the Corporation’s operations do not generally permit twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of overtime to be given. The Corporation will, however, endeavour to give to the employees affected such notice of overtime work whenever it can be reasonably done.

Where such notice cannot be reasonably given in .advance the Supervisor will provide
(120)
MORHINO R S
this information to the Steward as soon as it can reasonably be clone thereafter.

3.	(a) Overtime will be evenly distributed when reasonably possible among the employees in the same department.
(b)	The Supervisor after thoroughly considering the employees’ ability shall offer the work to the employees having the least amount of recorded overtime hours in the department provided such employees are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(c)	In choosing from among the employees of a department having an equal amount of recorded overtime then those with the greatest seniority able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done shall be given the overtime.
Skilled Trades
(d)	Overtime will be evenly distributed when reasonably possible among the employees in the same classification in the department. In the event an employee voluntarily misses a turn at such overtime, the employee shall be considered as having worked that turn insofar as distribution is concerned.

(c)	In the event the Corporation in its endeavours is unsuccessful in giving notice, the employee shall not be charged in the record. Such attempt by the Corporation shall fulfill its obligation towards the employee insofar as this turn at overtime is concerned.
Entering a Department
(d)	An employee other than skilled trades on returning to work after an absence of thirty (30) days or more for any reason except vacation shall [except as hereinafter provided in Subsection (g)] have recorded against the employee’s name in the overtime records the number of hours which is equal to the greater of (i) the average number of overtime hours of the department or (ii) the number of hours charged against the employee immediately prior to the commencement of the absence.

The average number of overtime hours is to be computed weekly. The overtime hours of Union Representatives will not be used or recorded in computing the average over-time hours for any department. When an employee ceases to be a Union Representative said
(123)
WORKING U R S
employee shall assume the average number of overtime hours of the employee's department and participate in overtime distribution in the regular manner.
(e)	A skilled trades employee on returning to work after an absence of thirty (30) days or more for any reason except vacation shall [except as hereinafter provided in Subsection (g)] have recorded against the skilled trades employee’s name in the overtime records the number of hours which is equal to the greater of (i) the average number of overtime hours of the classification or (ii) the number of hours charged against the skilled trades employee’s name immediately prior to the commencement of the absence.

When an employee ceases to be a Union Representative said employee shall assume the average number of overtime hours of the employee's classification and participate in overtime distribution in the regular manner.
Employees Offered Overtime
(f)	Any employee offered overtime in any department shall have such overtime charged to the employee's record.

same number of recorded overtime hours that said employee had at the time the layoff commenced.
Model Change
(h)	In the case of other than skilled trades only the overtime records will be suspended for each department as each department completes its work on the old model. From this point up until the point the Corporation converts the recall for the new model from a departmental basis to a plant-wide seniority basis, interim overtime records will be instituted and overtime will be distributed according to the same general principles as are outlined in this Memorandum. With the conversion to plant-wide seniority, the interim records shall cease and the suspended overtime records will be revived and shall form the basis for future distribution of overtime in the department.

for each of the three months that form the basis for an adjustment, and the average of those three months, rounded to the nearest 0.1 index point using the Engineering Method of Rounding described in Section
(9.2)	, subsection (k). This letter will be prepared and sent to the.Union after publication of the appropriate Consumer Price Indexes for the third month used for each adjustment period in accordance with Section (9.2), subsection (b) of the agreement.
If the Union claims that the Corporation's calculations in any particular instance were not made in accordance with the terms of Section (9.2), it may refer the matter to the Appeal Board.
(k)	The Engineering Method of Rounding shall apply to the determination of the three-month average of this Consumer Price Index:

(ii)	- if the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits, not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits 130.557 becomes 130.6.
(iii)	- if the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zero, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500 becomes 130.6. (c96, c99)

A pay shortage of 7.9 hours which occurs solely because an employee failed to ring will be included in this procedure. Separate pay rates for skilled and non-skilled employees will be used in determining the adjustment. In the case of those paid Thursday afternoon, the adjustment payment will be made available on Friday. (c96)

WAGES
Letter (9.8) Accumulation of Time
— Higher Clai.sifications
The Corporation's practices on accumulating time on higher classifications are as follows:
(a)	It is recognized that under certain circumstances it is necessary for employees to be regularly assigned to do work that falls within two or more hourly classifications with different rates of pay. The employee so assigned will be classified on the higher classification provided the employee spends 50% or more of the employee’s time on the work of the higher classification. In such cases no reduction in rate will be made for the time worked on the lower classification.
(b)	An employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification for one or more hours of a shift shall be paid at the rate of the higher classification for all hours worked on that shift. The Corporation has instructed its supervisors to maintain accurate records of time accumulated on higher classifications, and to process for payment any accumulation of such time on a pay period basis. Whenever requested to do so by an employee and, in any event, before submitting the request for payment of accumulated time, the Supervisor will show to the employee the copy of the Hourly Rate Adjustment Notice retained by the Supervisor and permit the employee to copy any information from it.
An employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification for less than one hour on a shift shall receive the rate of the lower classification for all hours worked on that shift.
(c)	A seniority employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification who receives the rate of a higher classification shall be paid the full base rate of the higher classification.
(136)
WAGES
(d)	This letter regarding accumulation of time will not be applicable to local plant agreements regarding division of overtime covering classifications paying different rates, or to the assignment of Union representatives where such assignment is made for representation.
Letter (9.9) Reclassification
Where an employee has held a particular hourly classification and rate while performing the same job for a period of one (1) or more years, and Management determines that the classification is improper for the job in question, Management may reclassify the job to the appropriate hourly classification, but the employee's rate of pay while assigned or reassigned to that job will not be changed. The proper classification and rate of pay shall apply to any future employee on the job so reclassified. This shall not preclude the Union from protesting the propriety of such reclassifications through the grievance procedure.
Letter (9.10) Wage Progression/COLA Fold-In
For the purposes of administering the new hire provisions of the new Collective Agreement, it was agreed that employees hired prior to the effective date of the new Agreement who are governed by the provisions of Section (9.6) shall have the calculation of their base rate determined on the basis of 85% or 92.5%, as the case may be, of the maximum base rate under the current Agreement, except that the cost-of-living allowance fold-in effective the beginning of the pay period commencing on or after the receipt of notice of ratification will not be subject to the reduction to 85% or 92.5%, as the case may be, but shall be transferred to base rate without reduction.

BENEFITS
Letter (10.5) Alcoholism and Drug Abuse
During negotiations the parties reaffirmed their continuing conviction that it is important to provide assistance to employees afflicted with alcohol and drug dependence and to find ways to motivate them to recognize their problem and seek treatment where appropriate. Accordingly, the parties have expressed their mutual wish to continue their progress toward the common goal of achieving an effective alcohol and drug abuse program at DairnlerChrysier-CAW locations.
While the current DaimlerChrysler-CAW program has continued to develop and mature, it has become apparent that the most successful local programs are those that have enjoyed the full support of the respective plant managements and Local Unions. That support has led to different approaches to similar problems at the various locations. Difficulties of implementation that exist at one location may not exist at others. Solutions, in part at least, therefore, have to be tailor-made for the location. For example, the proximity or availability of approved treatment facilities, the suitability of places utilized for employee contact, and the prior existence of a union or government-sponsored program are all factors bearing on the success of an alcohol and drug abuse program at the local level.
The foregoing leads us to conclude that our joint endeavor should be to continue to assist local programs in developing methods that will more effectively encourage afflicted employees to seek assistance under the program and that will convince them of the privacy and confidentiality of such assistance. To this end, the National Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Committee, pursuant to the principles and guidelines previously established, will (i) analyze those causes that inhibit and those that foster employee utilization of the program at each location, (ii) establish procedures for the confidential maintenance at each location of records of employees using the program, and (iii) communicate to all locations, when appropriate,
BENEFITS
those techniques that have proved successful at one or more locations, (iv) co-ordinate and oversee a pilot training program for certification of the Employee Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative and develop an evaluation procedure to measure improved performance as a result of the training, {v) recommend and co-ordinate an in-plant awareness campaign on substance abuse information handouts, posters, etc., and (vi) initiate a four (4) hour drug/alcohol awareness training for union representatives and supervisors conducted by the inplant Employee Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative.
Representation on the National Committee. shall be two (2) Management and two (2) Union members and shall meet twice each year. The National Committee will also continue to periodically review local programs to assist local management and local shop committees concerned with alcohol and drug abuse problems who believe they are experiencing difficulty in attaining program effectiveness.
Our experience under this program thus far shows that an effective company-wide program requires the full cooperation of management and Union alike. The joint efforts necessary to provide assistance to afflicted employees may, however, be complicated by many factors such as multi-shift operations, plant location and population, inplant facility available for employee contact, plant layout, and the need for privacy. We mutually endorse reasonable and practical resolution to these problems where they exist.
Finally, the success that already has been achieved under the program indicates the commitment that both DaimlerChrysler and the CAW have toward helping employees with problems of alcohol and drug dependence. We will continue to monitor and assist with local program activities to assure the continued success and improvement of this DaimlerChrysler-CAW program.
BENEFITS
Letter (10.6) Child Care

Re: Employees permanently laid off as a result of plant closing:
During these negotiations the parties discussed the job counselling and job placement assistance needs of employees permanently laid off as a result of a Plant Closing.

Such surviving spouses who choose to receive benefits under the Insurance Program will become eligible again to receive the pension benefit following the exhaustion of eligibility for insurance benefits.
Letter (10.15) Pension Benefit Reduction
The parties agree that if any employee’s total pension benefit is reduced because of the application of Section 3 of Article IV (“Maximum allowable lifetime pension for employees retiring after December 31,1991") or of Section 5 of Article VII (“Maximum allowable temporary pension for employees retiring after December 31, 1991"), or of Section 6 of Article VII (“Maximum allowable total benefits for employees retiring after December 31, 1991”), then the Corporation agrees to pay to such employee an equivalent pension from general revenues so long as the commuted value of that pension exceeds 2% of the YMPE at the time of retirement.

It was agreed that effective with the first pay period ending in January 1991, and continuing through the term of this Agreement, the Corporation will cease sharing the premium reduction with employees in the form of a cash rebate and will instead apply the employee's share of the Employment Insurance premium reduction to improvements in current benefits or to provide new benefits.

Letter (10.22) SCF Exclusion for AWS Operations
During the course of current negotiations, the parties discussed the exclusion of overtime penalties for a plant that implements an AWS schedule. Consequently, it was agreed that a formula be developed to determine the overtime penalty that will be excluded, as follows:
On the first day of the month following the commencement of an Alternate Work Schedule (AWS) the Special Contingency Fund (SCF) accrual will be adjusted based on the following steps:

Step 2: A monthly average excess hours will be determined for the affected plant.
Step 3: For each full month of AWS operation, a plant specific excess hour amount will be calculated. Step 4: For months; in which the excess hours calculated in Step 3 exceeds the average penalty calculated in Step 2, the P&M SCF accrual will be reduced by the difference between the amount calculated in Steps 2 and 3 multiplied by the current SCF penalty.

Letter (13.5) Administrative Procedures of the SPA Program
The parties have met and agreed to the following interpretations:
(a)	The Company and the Union are mindful of and do not desire to impact the efficiency of the operations which must be protected at all times. Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h) of Section
(13.4), in the event that there are significant employee transfers into or out of a department which because of the scheduled SPA time would adversely impact the operations, the Personnel Manager and the Shop Chairperson will modify the designated weeks off in order to protect skill levels and quality.
(b)	Any discipline assessed which would be scheduled during the SPA weeks shall not otherwise disqualify the employee for payment of the day in which the discipline was scheduled. As an example, if an employee was assessed a three (3) day disciplinary layoff, scheduled to be on Friday, Monday and Tuesday . . . and Monday and Tuesday were days the employee was designated off as
(177)
VACATION, SPA and PAA
SPA week, the discipline would reflect a three (3) day disciplinary layoff, however the employee would receive SPA payments for those two (2) days.
(c)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of Section (13.4), the Company and Union agree that should at any time the Company demonstrate a significant increase in the number of employees on WSIB and/or S&A status during their SPA weeks the parties will endeavor to determine the underlying causes for such increase.
If the underlying causes have not been identified and corrective action has not been taken prior to the commencement of the next SPA scheduling period the Company reserves the right to disqualify from SPA entitlement employees in receipt of WSIB or S&A during their SPA week. (c96)
Letter (13.6) Vacation and PAA
— Encouragement to Take Time Off During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the Payment in Lieu of Vacation and Paid Absence Allowance Plan and its purpose of providing employees with paid time away from work during the course of the year. '
While the parties recognize that circumstances may arise that prevent full utilization of such paid time off, they agreed that employees should be encouraged to take their vacation time, rather than pay in lieu. In this regard, the Company agreed that it would conduct its business in a manner consistent with such encouragement. (n93)
Letter (13.7) Vacation Utilization
During recent negotiations considerable attention was given to the use of vacation entitlement by employees as outlined in the collective agreement. In particular, the Union clearly outlined its position on time away from work and the Company for its pat-t outlined its need for programs
(178)
. VACATION. SPA AND PA A
that minimize operational complexity and administrative burden.
Consistent with these discussions, the parties further agreed to the principle of full utilization of vacation.
As a result, alternatives for achieving the principle of full utilization of vacation will be discussed and studied by the parties during the term of this agreement.
Letter (13.8) Vacation Pay Advance
During recent negotiations, the Company and the Union had discussions regarding the practice of providing employees with the. ability of receiving their vacation pay once full entitlement has been earned.
The Company agrees that once full entitlement has been earned, the employees may submit a Vacation Pay Request after January 1st of the vacation year which will generate a pay for full entitlement under the Payment in lieu of Vacation Plan, less two weeks, as soon as practicable after the request is made. 'This provision is not applicable to skilled trades since these employees may receive full payment with no reduction of the two weeks as they are required to work the scheduled shutdown. (c96)
Letter (13.9) Schedule — Vacation Period
In the negotiations leading to this collective agreement, the Company advised the Union of its plans to schedule vacation periods of one week in duration at plants operating an Alternative Work Schedule, as outlined in Production and Maintenance Agreement Section (13.1) Schedule and Notice.
Management informed the Union that the high demand for its products was the underlying reason for this decision, and, as a result of extensive discussion on the issue, plans were established to provide employees, wherever possible, with two consecutive weeks of vacation, notwithstanding a one week vacation period.
(179)
VACATION. SPA and PAA
When a vacation period of one week in duration is scheduled for a plant operating an Alternative Work Schedule:
•	the plant will operate on two shifts only during the week preceding the vacation shutdown.
•	the plant will operate on two shifts only during the week following the vacation shut down.
•	at management’s discretion, an additional thirty
(30) minutes production will be scheduled each day to maximize production.
•	summer students will be used, to the extent possible, to support requests for vacation leaves outside of the weeks immediately preceding and following the vacation shutdown.
In scheduling vacation shutdowns of one week in duration, management will advise the Union as soon as practicable, to enable employees to formalize vacation plans, but in any case, by no later than March 15. The Union will give due consideration to the use of TPT employees to facilitate vacation leaves of absence.
Issues arising from the vacation scheduling format outlined above may be raised by the Union for review and disposition.(c96)

For the purpose of this Section, Leader classifications shall be regarded as being the same as the classification led.
The Corporation and the National Union may from time to time, agree to amend, delete, add to, or otherwise modify the foregoing List of Classifications.
(14.6)	Lay-Off / Recall
Where there is a decrease or increase in the skilled trades the applicable procedure set out below shall be followed.
(a)	In the event of a seasonal layoff for model change, skilled trades employees shall be laid off, retained or recalled to work on the basis of their seniority in their classification within the department or on the basis of their seniority in their trade group within the department as the case may be, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. During such layoff, classification or trade group seniority within the department shall continue to be the basis upon which employees are laid off, retained or recalled until such time as the layoff has been converted to a plantwide basis. At such time and thereafter skilled trades employees shall be retained in or recalled to the plant in accordance with their seniority in their classification or trade group within the plant, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(b)	Temporary Adjustment
In the case of temporary adjustments due to material short-ages, machinery breakdowns, power failure, fire, flood or similar causes, or due to temporary reduction of production in some departments only, layoffs shall take
(184)
SKILLEDA D E S
place as follows: for the first two days including the day of the layoff; the Corporation may reduce the shift within the department according to the seniority of the employees within their classification or trade group on that shift, provided the employees to be retained are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done, or if the Corporation so elects, for the balance of the shift and one day the Corporation may retain the employees on the shift who normally perform the work to be done (the senior employee being given preference in cases where more than one normal operator performs the work). Thereafter the reduction in the working force for each department so affected shall be adjusted and proceed according to the relative seniority of the employees in the department within their classification or trade group provided that the employees to be retained are able and willing to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. Recall to work following such a layoff shall be by department seniority within their classification or trade group provided the employee is able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. The Corporation shall convert such layoff and recall from a departmental basis to a plant-wide seniority basis within fourteen (14) calendar days (unless otherwise mutually agreed) so that employees are thereafter, retained in or recalled to the plant in accordance with their classification or trade group seniority within the plant, provided however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(c)	Temporary Layoffs
When there is a temporary layoff that is a reduction in force for a definite period of time which is not a temporary adjustment or seasonal layoff for model change, employees within their classification or trade group within the department will be laid off as follows:
1.	Probationary employees will be laid off.
(185)
SKILLED TRADES
2.	Employees with less than one year of seniority within their classification or trade group will be laid off according to seniority.
3.	Employees with one year or more of seniority within their classification or trade group will be laid off in the inverse or descending order of their seniority with the most senior employee being laid off first. They will be advised of the expected duration of the layoff and their scheduled return date. However, such employees may elect to remain at work and if able to perform the available work will be permitted to do so in the same seniority order up to the number of employees required. The arrangement described above must result in maintaining an experienced, qualified work force capable of assuring the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the plant.
4.	If the expected duration of the temporary layoff is subsequently extended to a later but definite date, employees laid off pursuant to Subsection (c) 3 above will be afforded the option of returning to work on the date originally scheduled or remaining on layoff for the duration of the extended period. An employee who elects to return on the original scheduled date will displace the junior employee within their classification or trade group in the department.
5.	(i) If it becomes necessary to recall employees laid off under Subsection (c) 3 above prior to the date originally planned, they will be recalled in the ascending order of their seniority within their classification or trade group with the most junior such employee in each department being recalled first.
(ii) If, after employees are temporarily laid off under Subsection (c) 3, it is determined in a department or group of departments that the temporary layoff will be extended for an indefinite period of time, the work force in the department or group of departments including those employees on temporary layoff will be adjusted within ten (10) working days in accordance with (d) below.
SKILLED TRADES
6.	If the duration of a temporary layoff is expected to exceed ten (10) working days, the Local Union will be so notified. In a temporary layoff of such expected duration, the Local Union may request the Management to waive the Temporary Layoff provisions set forth in this Section (c) and Management will reduce the working force according to the layoff provisions as set forth in Section (d) below. Such requests shall be made in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the Union is notified of the layoff.
7.	The inverse seniority provisions as set forth in Section (14.6) (c) Temporary Layoffs, shall apply to employees on skilled trades classifications. For purposes of clarification, classification shall be deemed to mean skilled trades classification.
8.	It is understood that past practices with respect to Section (14.6) (a), (b) and (c) of the above provisions shall remain unchanged at the Eitobicoke Casting Plant.
(d)	Plant Layoff or Departmental Reduction due to Permanent Discontinuance of Operations, etc. and Recall.
In the event of a layoff or a departmental reduction due to the permanent discontinuance of a specific operation or department or due to an indefinite reduction in production or work to be performed, skilled trades employees shall be retained or recalled to work on the basis of their seniority in their classification within the plant or on the basis of their seniority in the trade group within the plant as the case may be, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work ‘to be done.
(14.7)	List of Apprenticeable Classifications
Appendix I, which includes a list of the current approved Apprenticeable Skilled Trades and Schedules of Work Processes for certain of these classifications, has been agreed upon and signed by the parties hereto. The Corporation and the National Union, by agreement, may modify, add to or otherwise revise said Lists and Schedules.

work in a skilled trades classification or trade group. To be considered, the application must be accompanied by proof that the employee is a journeyman/woman with experience in the work of the kind performed at DaimlerChrysler in the employee’s classification. When a vacancy occurs in a skilled trades classification or trade group in a plant other than the employee's own, which is to be filled by a new hire, consideration will be given to such applications. The vacancy created in Production by the transfer of an employee pursuant to the provisions of this application procedure shall be filled in accordance with the job posting paragraphs of the appropriate Plant Special Provisions. On the written request of the Union, but not more often than two (2) times in a calendar year, notices will be posted in the plant to advise qualified employees that they may submit such application in writing.
(e)	Seniority of a Qualified Journeyman/woman Entering a Skilled Trades Classification
Consistent with the intent of the Agreement, a non-skilled trades employee covered by this agreement who is a qualified journeyman/woman, and who enters a skilled trades classification, shall have seniority as of the date of entry into such skilled trades classification. For the purpose of this paragraph “date of entry” means the date on which the notice of vacancy is posted plant-wide.
(f)	In the event that a qualified journeyman/woman having seniority in a production classification accepts work in a skilled trades classification or trade group and within ninety (90) days thereafter is laid off or disqualified by reason of inability to perform the work in said classification, the employee shall be returned to production with the seniority date the employee had immediately prior to transfer into the skilled trades classification or trade group.
(g)	Replacement of Tools
The Company shall, where reasonably practical, continue its past practice regarding the replacement of
(196)
SKIDLEDA D E S
worn, stolen, broken and lost tools provided the employee's carelessness or abuse has not caused the problem.
The Company agrees to use its best endeavours to speed up the replacement of tools under this subsection.

The Corporation will deduct from the pay of an employee hired, rehired, reinstated or transferred to a skilled trades classification the sum of an amount equal to one-half (1/2) hours pay as dues for the Canadian Skilled Trades Council. Such deductions will be made from the same pay period as the deduction of the Union initiation fee, and thereafter, on an annual basis, from the second pay period in January. Further, from a list supplied by the Union, dues will be deducted from the pay of employees who were not deducted in January and be remitted to the appropriate Local Union together with a list of the employees so deducted in conjunction with regular membership dues.

(m)	In-Plant Training
DaimlerChrysler is cognizant of the continuing need for training in electronics, hydraulics, mathematics, etc. arising from the introduction of new tools, equipment, procedures and processes and plans to continue to conduct training to an increasing extent to meet such needs.
(n)	Training Bonus Temporary Layoff
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (14a. 19), Related Training Apprentices, with respect to affected employees while on temporary layoff, it is agreed that effective October 29, 1979 a temporarily laid off apprentice, journeyman/woman or temporary employee in the skilled trades will be paid a training bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses required pursuant to the Sections Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees, or such other courses that may be designated by the Corporation such as the Industrial Electronics Training Program, for each week the employee attends class while on temporary layoff as specified below.
An employee earns the training bonus by attending the specified training courses while on temporary layoff and satisfactorily completing the applicable training courses in which the employee was enrolled at the time of temporary layoff.
The amount of each week's bonus is calculated by multiplying the employee's straight-time hourly rate on the last day worked exclusive of shift and overtime premiums but including cost-of-living allowance then in effect by:
(1) The number of hours, not to exceed four (4), the employee attends class during a week for which an employee receives a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit; or
(198)
SKILLED TRADES
(2) The actual number of hours the employee attends class during a week for which an employee does not receive a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit.
The total training bonus will be an amount equal to the sum of the training bonus for each week the employee may earn it. It will be paid to the employee within a reasonable period of time after the employee has been recalled and reported back to work or within a reasonable period of time after the employee has satisfactorily completed the applicable training courses, whichever is later.
Section (14a. 19) Apprentices will continue to be applied as in the past with respect to affected employees while on the active roll.
(o)	Annual Fee for Special Licenses
The Company will pay, upon satisfactory proof, the annual fee for special licenses required by the Company which are over and above the basic trade licenses required. (c99)
(14.9)	Temporary Employees in
Skilled Trades Classifications
(a)	The parties recognize that it is more desirable to secure journeymen/women by hiring and by training through established apprentice training programs, and while these sources are the preferred means of securing qualified journeymen/women, they do not at all times meet the needs of the Corporation. Until such time as the preferred sources meet the Corporation's needs, it will be necessary to transfer and promote employees into skilled trades classifications who do not, at the time of transfer or promotion, have the experience and qualifications of a journeyman/woman but have worked in an appropriate skilled trade.
(b)	Temporary employees shall be listed by classification in the order of their transfer or promotion into the department on a list of temporary skilled trades
(199)
TKILLEDA D E S
employees and shall be laid off, or returned to their regular departments, and returned or recalled to their skilled trades classification in the departments according to their position on the list of temporary employees. At such time as it is determined that a temporary employee is unable to perform satisfactorily the work required in the skilled trade classification, the temporary employee shall be so advised and the temporary employee's name shall be removed from the list of temporary employees. While in the status of a temporary employee, the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority in the employee's regular department. Temporary employees shall not be retained or recalled in line with their position on the list of temporary employees if they are unable to perform satisfactorily the work that is available.
(c)	A temporary employee in the skilled trades transferred or promoted after the effective date of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the following provisions, The employee shall be paid a starting rate equal to nine percent (9%) less than the minimum rate of the classification and shall receive an increase equal to one and one half percent(1-1/2%)of the [minimum rate of the classification on the completion of six (6), twelve (12), eighteen (18), twenty-four (24) and thirty (30) months served in the classification. Upon the completion of thirty-six (36)months served in the classification, the employee shall be paid the minimum rate of the classification. These increases shall be effective the beginning of the first pay period following the completion of each of the specified six (6) month periods served in the classification. Temporary employees shall not receive a rate above the mid-point of the rate range of their classifications.
(d)	In the event the Company is unable to fill vacancies from either within the plant or by hiring, the matter may be reviewed with the Union.
(e)	During model change or major plant rearrangement, production employees may be temporarily
(200)
SKILLED TRADES
assigned to assist skilled trades employees. Such production employees will not be listed as temporary employees in the skilled trades department and will not be credited with skilled trades seniority for any purpose. Rather, they shall retain and accumulate seniority in their production department. If such a production employee is later promoted or transferred to the same skilled trades classification which the production employee was temporarily assigned to assist the production employee shall receive credit for the time worked while so assigned for the purpose of acquiring the right to exercise seniority in that skilled trades classification.
(14.10)	Special Procedure — Skilled Trades Work Assignment Disputes
(a)	The skilled trades representative in a plant may request the Plant Labour Relations Supervisor to arrange a special conference to hear the Union's views concerning the work assignments of skilled trades employees.
(b)	Attendance at such special conference will be limited to the skilled trades representatives of the plant. A representative of the Local Union may attend. Plant Labour Relations and a senior representative of Manufacturing Engineering will also attend. A Staff Labour Relations Representative may also attend.
(c)	A written disposition will be made available on resolved issues.
(d)	If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved and the matter involves the appropriateness of work assignments of employees in skilled trades classifications, the Union may reduce the matter to writing in the form of a grievance and present the grievance to the Labour Relations Supervisor. Within five (5) days after receiving the grievance, a written answer will be given setting forth Management's position with respect to the disputed work involved.
(201)
SKILLED^ D E S
(e)	The Local Union may, within ten (10) days after receiving such answer, forward the grievance together with Management’s answer to the National Union. If in its judgement the matter warrants appeal, the National Union may within twenty (20) clays after receiving the grievance and answer, appeal the matter to the Manager of Hourly Labour Relations by requesting a special meeting.
(f)	Such meeting will be attended by the skilled trades representatives involved, a representative of the Local Union and a representative of the National Union. The Plant Personnel Manager and the Manager of Manufacturing Engineering, or their designated representatives will also attend.
(g)	If they are unable to satisfactorily resolve the matter within one (1) month of the date of the special meeting, the grievance may be appealed to the Appeal Board, as provided in Section (3.2) Step 4.
Letter (14.11) Skilled Trades — Inverse Seniority Long Term Layoffs
During negotiations the parties discussed the application of inverse seniority by trade and plant for temporary layoffs. The parties agree to extend these arrangements to longer periods of layoff, by mutual agreement.
Letter (14.12) Skilled Trades New Skills Committee
In recognizing that producing quality products and realizing that successful product launches require continuous education and upgrading of trade:; skills, the Company agrees to establish a New Skills Training committee for Skilled Trades. The committee will be comprised of two (2) Skilled Tradespersons, who will be allowed to function full time to conduct work related to Skilled Trades training, including but not limited to the development, co-ordination and tracking of the trades training programs.
(202)
SKILLED A D E S
This committee will function at both the Windsor Assembly Plant and the Bramalea Assembly Plant only.
The Committee will be afforded notice to the extent possible of new technology coming into the plant or new technology impacting on the Skilled Trades workforce. The Company will involve the Committee as soon as practicable regarding any plant modifications and communicate training requirements that may affect the job responsibilities of Skilled Trades employees.
It is agreed that it is in the best interests of both parties that Skilled Trades employees be afforded the opportunity to receive training required to properly service any machinery or equipment being introduced to the plant production process. This training will be made available through specialized programs and the Committee will meet with Management to determine the training needs for Skilled Trades employees, as well as the most cost effective means of delivering the training, including the utilization of in-plant trainers.
It should also be noted that the two (2) trades Coordinators may be called on to help facilitate trades training programs at other DaimlerChrysler facilities.
Finally, the Company and Union mutually agree that the Co-ordinators will not be required to perform any duties that may lead to a grievance under the current Production and Maintenance agreement.
The parties agree that committee staffing levels will be reviewed in preparation for periods of major launch activity: (n99)

(n96, c99)
Letter (15.5) Job Hazard Awareness
During negotiations the parties discussed the Company's method of providing to the employees information regarding the hazards associated with their particular job.
The procedure known as Job Hazard Analysis is recognized by Management and Union alike as the best
(235)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
way of providing and recording the employee's understanding of job hazards.
Such instruction meets the Supervisors duty as legislated and should be presented before starting the job.
The parties also discussed the Company's program with respect to periodic safety talks with employees. These talks which are usually conducted by members of plant supervision serve the purpose of reminding the employees of the importance of safe work practices and encourages awareness to potential hazards in the workplace. Both parties share the view that conditions, equipment and processes differ by plant and that safety talks must of necessity be handled on a plant-by-plant basis.
The parties are aware that many individual plants have developed safety talk procedures which are effective in their design and manner of presentation and which in some cases, make use of recording and other mechanical devices. The review of these programs is a proper subject for discussion by the National Committee so that this information may be communicated to other DaimlerChrysler Plants for their evaluation.
Further, the parties agreed that the content of safety talks and method of delivery will be addressed by the Local Health and Safety Committees and that they may develop and recommend specific materials for inclusion in the program.
Letter (15.6) Protective! Clothing and
Personal Protective Equipment (P.P.E.)
In the course of the current negotiations between DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. and the CAW, we have advised you that it is the policy of the Corporation to issue protective clothing and P.P .E. at no cost on the basis of the need for such clothing and P.P.E. on a particular job.
In making the determination of the need for protective clothing and P.P.E. consideration must be given to factors such as safety and job requirements.
(236)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Management informed the Union that it would be contrary to Corporation policy for its supervisors to indiscriminately and capriciously withdraw protective clothing and P.P.E. which had been issued in accordance with the principles outlined above. The Corporation's policy is that protective clothing and P.P.E. may only be withdrawn with the discontinuance of an operation for which it had beet- issued or where the conditions for which the protective clothing and P.P.E. was issued no longer pertains or where the issuance or retention is no longer consistent with the basic policy statement outlined above.
Where appropriate the Supervisor must properly instruct the worker on use, fit, care and storage of P.P.E.
Each location may develop a program to provide to employees external appliances, i.e. wrist, elbow or knee braces when the need is recognized by either the company doctor or by the employee’s physician and approved by the company doctor. It should be recognized that these appliances are not a permanent solution to the problem.
When such a device is prescribed the Doctor will advise the plant to review the operation for possible ergonomic improvement, through the Joint Health and Safety Committee and plant Ergonomist.
Complaints arising in connection with the administration of the foregoing should be taken up with the supervisor, and, if unresolved, with the Labour Relations Supervisor. (c96)
Letter (15.7) Safety Glasses
(a) The Corporation will provide prescription safety glasses to seniority employees and temporary part-time employees working on a job or in an area where eye protection is a company requirement provided the employee furnishes a prescription from the employee's own doctor or optometrist.

(239)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
plant to determine those specific work activities they consider hazardous for working alone and shall make recommendations to local Management for consideration. It is the policy of the Corporation that when such assignments are recognized as potentially hazardous, appropriate precautions are taken. Such precautions include providing air sampling and ventilation when necessary, necessary protective equipment, a reliable communication system, appropriate personnel surveillance arrangements, training and, as required, adequate support personnel. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practice.
The National Committee, in consultation with the Local Committees, will develop guidelines for implementing Working Alone procedures at the local levels. (c96)
Letter (15.11) New, Rebuilt or Relocated Equipment
During current negotiations the parties discussed the Union's concern regarding the timely installation of necessary safety measures on new, rebuilt or relocated equipment.
The Company shares the Union's concern and assured the Union that it will give priority to such necessary measures on new and relocated equipment where these measures are required to protect the health and safety of employees. Furthermore, where practicable, management representatives will review with local Health and Safety Committees, plans for major process, equipment and layout changes.
Proper guarding will be in place and adequate training will be provided to the operator to protect the operator's safety.
It is Company policy to encourage the active participation of members of the Local Committee in the health and safety review and approval process of machinery and equipment at the manufacturer's location where practicable, and in the plant prior to start up with a
(240)

view lo providing constructive recommendations to Management.
The Company will continue its present purchasing policy in regards to sound emissions from new and rebuilt equipment and processes as described in the manufacturing standard, “Sound Level Specification for Industrial Machinery and Equipment”.
For most equipment the sound emissions shalt not exceed 80dB(A) average sound level (L(avg)) at a distance of one (1) meter from the perimeter of the machine or at any operator’s position. (c96)
Letter (15.12) Ergonomics
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the value of the application of Ergonomics in the DaimlerChrysler plants.
The Company assured the Union that it is committed to efforts, where feasible, to improve the interface of employees with the workplace. Accordingly, each Plant Manager will designate an Industrial Engineer, or another qualified member of Management, to have responsibilities for Ergonomics. In carrying out job station design at introduction of new process or procedure or the changing of job assignments all Industrial Engineers shall use an Ergonomics check list. The check list will be explained to the JHSC before its launch when they may make recommendations. The check list may in the future be computerized. The Local Health and Safety Committees will address Ergonomic concerns on a continuing basis with this plant Management designate.
In 1990 the Local Health and Safety Committees received 40 hours of ergonomic training with a view to raising committee awareness to ergonomic problems.
When new Health and Safety Representatives are appointed or elected the National Committee will make arrangements for their training internally.
(241)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
It is intended the Local Joint Health and Safety Committees will address ergonomic needs on a priority basis and work progressively toward improving workplace/employee interface. When an ergonomic concern is beyond the scope of the parties and requires further expertise, a consultant may be hired to evaluate the problem. When the parties agree upon ergonomic solutions, they will be implemented on a priority basis.
In addition, where New Technology is to be introduced into a plant, the Joint Health and Safety Committee will be given the opportunity to review the technological changes and to make recommendations with respect to Ergonomic concerns.
It was agreed that the Company would conduct a needs assessment for ergonomic training for industrial engineers to be shared with the National Safety Coordinator. Furthermore, it was agreed to include the Union Time Study Representative in ergonomic training programs provided to industrial engineers.
National Joint Ergonomics Committee:
During negotiations, the company agrees to establish a National Joint Ergonomics Committee (NJEC). The committee will meet quarterly at mutually agreed upon times and places. An agenda will be prepared in advance. This joint committee will consist of two (2) representatives from the CAW and (2) representatives from the company. Each party will appoint to the committee at least one member who has professional training in ergonomics.
Among those matters that will be appropriate for discussion by the committee include:
1.	Plant applications and support of the CAW/DaimlerChrysler Canada Ergonomics Process
2.	Training of Local Ergonomic Committees (LEC)
3.	DaimlerChrysler Production Systems - Ergonomics
(242)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
4.	Results of completed DaimlerChrysler ergonomic studies
5.	Advanced ergonomic applications at the company
The parties agreed that by working jointly, positive gains in employee morale, and quality and that a reduction in injury rates, and costs would be realized. The company and the union further agreed it would be beneficial to share among the various plants what each one is doing with respect to ergonomic activities. As a result, the parties agreed that the NJEC would plan and implement an Annual Ergonomics Meeting of the LECs from each plant location to discuss ergonomic activities at our facilities. The company will pay for scheduled hours worked, registration where necessary, lodging and transportation. The union will be responsible for meals and other expenses for union representatives.
Local Ergonomic Committees:
In negotiations, the company and the union discussed their joint commitments to efforts where feasible, to improve the interface of employees with the workplace through ergonomics. Each assembly plant, manufacturing unit or Parts Distribution Centre of 125 employees will establish a Local Ergonomics Committee (LEC) with the objective of exploring and introducing ways to reduce injuries and illnesses through the application of ergonomics.
This committee will consist of 4 (four) members; the CAW H&S Representative/Ergonomic Representative, and either the CAW Time Study Representative or a committee person and the Management H&S Specialist/Administrator and either the plant ergonomist or another qualified member of management responsible for ergonomics.
(243)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The LEC should consider several factors when identifying priority jobs. Some of these factors may include excessive overhead work, cramped working postures, and walking backwards. Medical tracking tools should be used to verify employees are experiencing injuries on these jobs.
“Fitting Jobs to People”: The CAW/DaimlerChrysler Canada Ergonomics Process
The study of ergonomics examines the interaction between the worker and the work environment, including such factors as machinery, tools, equipment, control panel design, and others. If the match between the worker and their work environment is poor, the worker's ability to perform the job may lead to, in the short term, fatigue, and in the long term, physical injury and/or disability. In addition improper job design may hinder the worker's ability to produce high quality work and may result in increased absenteeism and decreased job satisfaction.
Therefore, the parties agree to jointly develop an Ergonomics Process. for use in all of its plants. The National Joint Ergonomic Committee will develop this Ergonomic Standard Operating Process ■ “Fitting Jobs to People:” the CAW/DaimlerChrysler Canada Ergonomic Process. The primary goal of Fitting Jobs to People is to protect the health and safety of workers by examining the worker's job and reviewing it for risk factors that can contribute to injury and illness. In addition, the parties agree to incorporate basic ergonomic principles into the design of new equipment, machinery, tools, processes, facilities and workplace layouts.
The primary strategies that are used in ergonomics are to be outlined in the Joint CAW/DaimlerChrysler Ergonomic Process:
(244)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
. Identify the cause of injuries and illnesses in existing workstations by:
1.	Identifing priority jobs through either the examination of medical records, employee reports, or risk factor check lists, and assessments.
2.	Evaluating job stresses to reveal the causes of the injury/illness or employee complaint;
3.	Reducing or, where feasible, eliminating these causes by developing changes in work methods, machinery, tools, equipment and workstation design;
4.	Implementing and testing the changes to determine their effectiveness;
5.	Documenting changes
6.	Following-up to ensure the issue is corrected and the job changes are being utilized.
. Use the Ergonomic: Process in the design of appropriate workstations, equipment, tools and other job attributes. The CAW/DaimlerChrysler Canada Ergonomics Process will recognize that a number of factors maybe appropriate to review in job assessments, including:
1.	The movement and postures of limbs and whole body as workers perform a task;
2.	The energy expended in performing a task over a given period of time;
3.	The amount of physical strength required for a task or job;
4.	Relationship between the worker and the machine, equipment, tools, workstation and workplace;
5.	Design and layout of control panels and displays;
6.	Repetitiveness of the task;
7.	Pace of work.
(245)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
In the development of this process the parties agreed to review existing processes used by other companies and that this will be centered on the DaimlerChrysler Advance Manufacturing Engineering (AME) internal guidelines for ergonomics (Do’s & Dori'ts), recommendations from the CAW Productions Standards Task Force Report and the highly successful Windsor Assembly Plant ergonomic checklist.
Pilot Project - Ergonomic Task Force
The parties agreed to establish a joint taskforce consisting of representatives from the CAW and from management to focus specifically on four ergonomic concerns. These concerns include working overhead, walking backwards/sideways, working in cramped posture and over extended reach. The goal of this taskforce will be to identify operations containing these factors and to make recommendations for the reduction/elimination of them.
The parties understand that sound ergonomic principles will be applied when evaluating operations at the pilot facility. The parties agree, to the extent possible, to encourage the implementation of all reasonable control methods to prevent/reduce Repetitive Strain Injuries. As interim measures pending engineering changes or where engineering changes are limited in controlling risk factors administrative controls and feasible work practices will be implemented.
The parties further agreed that this pilot project would be conducted under the auspices of the National Joint Ergonomic Committee at the Pillette Hoad Truck Assembly Plant. The task force results will be reviewed by the NJEC and if successful, the pilot project will be extended to other plants where possible. (c96, c99)

Letter (15.31) Joint Statement on
Health and ‘Safety Work Refusals
During the current negotiations the Company and the Union reaffirmed their commitment to provide a safe and healthy workplace for employees. The parties agreed that practical solutions to health and safety concerns are best achieved by responding to such concerns in a prompt and co-operative manner. Further, the Company committed that the rights offered to employees by the Occupational Health and Safety Act as it exists with the effective date of this agreement would remain intact as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, Health and Safety, notwithstanding legislative changes that may alter these fundamental rights.
The Company recognizes that the workers’ right to refuse to work is clearly defined in provincial health and safety legislation as it read on the effective date of this
(261)
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Agreement and is an integral part of employee rights in the workplace.
However, the parties recognize the importance of resolving health and safety concerns before they become work refusals and without loss of production. Within this context, the parties focused their discussion during negotiations on methods and means by which health and safety issues and concerns could be addressed in a mutually satisfactory manner such that employee health and safety work refusals could be significantly reduced in number.
During these discussion, the parties focused on the Official Safety Complaint Form and the process outlined in Letter (15.28) Official Safety Complaint Form of this agreement, as the foundation for effective efforts in this regard. The use of this process was deemed to be of particular value in addressing the ergonomic concerns of employees, where the hazard is not imminent but of significant concern to the employee, the Union and the Company agreed that forthright efforts must be put into place to alleviate the problem(s) identified by the employee.
The Company expressed its concern over employee health and safety work refusals where Supervisors have no prior knowledge of such concerns or dangers. The parties acknowledged that in these cases it is detrimental to Company and Union efforts to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, production lost during such refusals has a negative impact on the Company's competitive position and the job security of employees. Consequently, both parties re-affirmed their commitment to effectively implement the process outlined in Letter (15.28) Official Safety Complaint Form. Following negotiations, the National Joint Health and Safety Committee will work with each Local Joint Health and Safety Committee to determine and resolve local problems associated with the effective application of the Official Safety Complaint

Letter (1fi.32) Substance Abuse/Drug Testing
During negotiations, the Company and the Union had comprehensive discussions regarding the issue of employee substance abuse. In this regard, the parties agreed that the consumption of certain drugs and/or alcohol may impair an employee's health and endanger his/her safety, or that of fellow employees and the public at large. As worker health and safety are of paramount concern to the Company and the Union, the parties are committed to improving the well-being of employees and maintaining a safe workplace through the effective implementation of the Employee Assistance and Substance Abuse Program.
During these negotiations, the parties also discussed at length the issue of mandatory drug and alcohol testing in the workplace. In recent years, this issue has been the subject of considerable public debate and a number of legal cases in various jurisdictions. The parties agreed that the debate and case law in this area is still evolving and it is yet unclear whether such testing will be unconditionally supported by the courts.
Some governments have also introduced mandatory drug and alcohol testing laws for specific job functions. These laws recognize the concerns of a number of these legislators regarding the adverse effects of substance abuse on families, the workplace and the general public.
The parties acknowledged that as the public: gains a broader understanding of the costs and dangers associated with substance abuse, other governments may also introduce such laws and apply them more broadly.

Letter (15.36) Joint Occupational Health and Safety Scientific Advisory Board
During negotiations, the Union outlined its interest in participating in a joint research effort to determine whether workplace exposures contribute to the development of cancers among DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. employees.
The Company offered that while there are no known cancer causing agents present in the workplace in exposures sufficient to cause concern among its employees, our commitment to continuous improvement in the area of health and safety is supported by a genuine willingness to engage in research that could reveal circumstances unknown to the workplace partners through no lack of diligence on their part.
Notwithstanding the above, the issue of medical research is a highly complex undertaking. Research that fails to employ the required scientific rigour is not only subject to misinterpretation, but leads to unfounded allegations concerning employee health issues. More importantly, these allegations could raise individual employee concerns over health issues that are unwarranted.
The parties agree then, that while research is desirable, it must be conducted within well-reasoned parameters and under proper supervision. Consequently,
(265)

JOB SECURITY
Letter (17.1) Job Security and Work Ownership
Over the years, the company and the union have regularly addressed worker concerns over income and job security. Recognizing that employment levels will fluctuate with changes in the marketplace, the parties have negotiated programs to provide workers and their families with a measure of income security unparalleled in Canadian industry. Further, recognizing that longer term employment levels will be affected by in-plant changes in technology and the in-plant organization of work, the parties have negotiated programs to encourage attrition and thereby prevent or limit potential layoffs.
During the 1990 round of bargaining, a milestone agreement on Job and Income Protection was reached by DaimlerChrysler and the CAW, which was intended to limit and prevent layoffs. The agreement established a workable procedure to deal with the extensive structural change in evidence in the industry at that time, and, which clearly has continued to date.
In 1996 negotiations the company and the union focused on the impact of outsourcing decisions and their impact on individual workers, their families and their communities.
During this set of negotiations, we reviewed our plans with the Union for each operation within DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc.
• The Windsor Assembly Plant operates on an A.W.S. schedule due in large part to the continued and extraordinary success of our line of minivans, and provided the product market remains strong, this arrangement is expected to continue throughout the life of this agreement. In preparation for the launch of the 2001 model year IRS minivan, the plant is currently under construction for an expanded body shop.

The expansion at the Etobicoke Casting Plant is now complete, but new manufacturing equipment continues lo be put into service as the plant is modernized to become a world class source for pistons. Further, funds have been approved for an additional die cast machine, bringing the total die cast capability to 30 machines.
For the Pillette Road Truck Assembly Plant an important m-styling of the AB Van and significant upgrades to the manufacturing process were completed in preparation for the 1998 model year. During the life of this agreement, the Pillette Road Truck Assembly Plant will continue to produce the AB Van. The Corporation continues to assess opportunities that would result in a more balanced schedule at this facility. Investment planned for the plant is the subject of a separate letter in this agreement.
The Bramalea Assembly Plant launched an AWS schedule in August 1998. Provided the market remains strong, this schedule will continue for the term of this agreement, producing the Corporation’s “LH” line of vehicles.
'The Automotive Research and Development Centre, has gained national attention since its launch in 1996. Significant investment has occurred at the facility, with the construction of a Paint Coating Research Facility and a Lighting Evaluation Facility, both of which will be fully operative prior to December, 1999.
The . workforce of the Ajax Trim Plant has established its reputation as a quality producer of automotive trim products. However, it continues to operate at a competitive disadvantage in comparison to other soft trim manufacturers paying labour rates significantly lower than those provided for in this agreement. Further, the
(292)
JOB SECURITY
corporation's research in the area of replacement work for the plant — work of value commensurate with the plant's overall wage and benefit package - failed to identify any viable alternatives. With regard to the soft trim operation itself, the Corporation advised the Union that volume and mix issues expected to occur over the life of the 1999 agreement will result in a loss of jobs at the plant. The parties' understanding in connection with this action is addressed in a separate letter in this agreement. The Corporation has advised the Union that it continues to study investment alternatives to mitigate potential job loss. These studies, the status of which will be reviewed periodically with CAW leadership, are expected to conclude within one year following the effective date of the agreement.
• The special circumstances of CAW represented Office, Clerical and Engineering employees again occupied the attention of the parties. Notwithstanding the transfer of work to the corporation’s Mopar division in the United States, replacement work has been secured for employees represented by CAW Local 1498 -work unique in nature from a corporate perspective when compared to that typically performed by O, C & E employees. A separate memorandum in the 0, C & E agreement deals with this concept.
. In the case of Security Unit employees, various joint initiatives have increased the flexibility enjoyed by operating management which, coupled with significant construction activity, has generated higher levels of employment. Given these circumstances, we advised you we will not reduce employment levels, as a result of outsourcing during the term of this agreement.
(293)
JOB SECURITY
Of critical importance to the Union was the concept of “work ownership”, defined as protection against the outsourcing of work which has been performed on a historical basis in a quality and efficient manner at reasonable cost. From a CAW perspective, work ownership was described as a principle intended to be consistent with on-going changes in the workplace. A particular concern discussed at length by the parties was the potential impact of changes involving modular production. The company indicated that changes in technology and organization of work would continue to be required to assure DaimlerChrysler can be competitive and retain its position as one of the industry leaders in Canada. The Company agreed, however, that if modular production plans were implemented during the term of this Collective Agreement, they would be reviewed with the union and that associated changes in the workplace would be accomplished in a manner consistent with the work ownership and community employment level provisions of the Agreement.
In addition, the parties discussed concerns about the impact various forms of corporate restructuring, e.g., business units or joint ventures, might have on employees. The company confirmed that although various alternatives have been reviewed, there presently are no plans for change in business structure of CAW-represented operations. Further, the company agreed that any such change that is decided on and implemented during the life of this Collective Agreement would be accomplished in a manner consistent with the work ownership and community employment level provisions of this Agreement.
In keeping with the work ownership concept, the company advised the union that it will not outsource any major operations during the life of this agreement. More specifically, the only outsourcing planned at the Assembly Plants for the 2000 through 2002 model years will take place during the 2001 model year at the Pillette Road Truck Assembly Plant and the Windsor Assembly Plant

where outsourcing actions are expected to affect 17 and 91 jobs respectively. These jobs will be replaced through new model year product content and model mix considerations. In the case of Ajax Trim and Etobicoke Casting, employment levels will not be reduced as a result of outsourcing actions during the term of this agreement. (The individual components of specific product actions will be communicated locally.) The Company commits there will be no reduction in community' employment levels as a result of outsourcing during the term of this agreement.
1For the purposes of this agreement, “community” is defined as the Windsor area - referring lo the Windsor Assembly Plant and the Pillette Road Truck Assembly Plant - and separately for communities within which the Bramalea Assembly Plant, the Etobicoke Casting Plant and the Ajax Trim Plant are located.

Letter (17.2) Job Security and Work Ownership - Skilled Trades
In 1996, the Company and the Union focused on the impact of contracting decisions and their impact on individual workers, their families and their communities. The Company and the Union have regularly addressed Skilled Trades concerns over income and job security. Recognizing that employment levels will fluctuate with changes in the marketplace, the parties have negotiated language to provide workers and their families with a measure of income security unparalleled in Canadian history. Further, recognizing that longer term employment levels will be affected by in-plant changes in technology and in-plant organization of work, the parties negotiated the Job Security and Work Ownership agreement during this set of negotiations.
Within this context, the Company confirms the understandings reached during the 1996 negotiations regarding Skilled Trades concerns over work ownership.
(295)
JOB SECURITY
Primary among these understandings is the Company's commitment that there will be no reduction of
skilled trades employees as a result of outside contracting
throughout the life of this iagreement.
More specifically:
(a)	Planning
Plant management shall meet semi-annually to review with CAW Skilled Trades representatives projected work loads regarding the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, service, and warranty work of existing or new equipment, facilities, and the fabrication of tools, dies, jigs, patterns and fixtures.
(b)	Information
Advance notice of outside contract activities will be provided, in situations other than emergencies, at least 10 days in advance to permit meaningful discussion and a careful analysis of the company's workforce capabilities in connection with the subject work. This written notice will provide the Union with all available information on the nature of the work, including plans and the number of trades persons required to perform the work.
(c)	Layoff - Recall
When Skilled Trades employees are on layoff in a classification, the nature of which they customarily perform, and consideration is being given to outside contracting said work, DaimlerChrysler trades employees will be given first priority for the work, before letting the contract provided that they can perform the available work.
(d)	Full utilization
It is the policy of the Company to fully utilize its own employees in maintenance skilled trades classifications in the performance of maintenance and construction work, consistent with local scheduling practices of each facility.
The parties agree this commitment should serve to alleviate the real sense of insecurity prevalent among workers in today's business setting. With this new sense of

security, the parties believe skilled tradespersons may apply themselves to pursuits that are in the best interest of themselves, the Company, the Union, and their communities. (n96)
Letter (17.3) Supplier Relationships
In developing supplier relationships, the company expects its suppliers to have responsible labour relations, treat their employees in a fair and equitable manner, and avoid conduct which violates federal or provincial labour and employment laws.
The union may, from time to time, raise concerns about its relationship with certain suppliers. The company commits to take these concerns seriously. The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are based on the particular facts of the situation, and therefore plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case by case basis as they have in the past and in compliance with all applicable laws. When such concerns do arise, the company has agreed Lo inform suppliers of:
•	The importance the company places on its relationship with the CAW and the positive value of that relationship.
•	The considerations involved in awarding contracts to suppliers, including cost, quality, delivery capability, technology, and responsible labour relations.
» The expectation that suppliers treat employees in a fair and equitable manner, including respecting their right to decide whether or not to join a union in an atmosphere free of intimidation, interference, or risk of reprisal.
•	The expectation that suppliers avoid conduct which violates federal or provincial labour and employment laws and respect the company’s relationship with its CAW partners.
•	The practice by which certain suppliers recognize the union as bargaining agent for employees when the union signs up more than 50% of the employees in a

particular operation, which is currently non-represented, there is no other trade union seeking to represent the employees, and the employee signatures are verified by an independent third party. (In those instances, the appropriate labour legislation will govern the bargaining process in the same way as if certification had been granted by the labour board.) DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. believes that the above process will improve overall labour relations within the broader business community. The parties believe this environment will positively contribute to the company's success and its ability to compete in the global marketplace. (n96, c99)
Letter (17.4) Plant Closing Moratorium
As a result of deep concern about job security in out negotiations and the many discussions which took place over it, this will confirm that during the term of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, until September 17, 2002, the Company will not close or sell any plant, in whole or in part, covered by this Collective Agreement.
It is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Company, e.g., act of God, catastrophic circumstances, or significant economic decline concerning the subject. Should these conditions occur, the Company will discuss such conditions with the National Union. (n96, c99)
Letter (17.5) Task Force on Absenteeism
DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. and the CAW have a long history of working together to address issues of mutual concern. Unauthorized absence from the workplace is one such issue.
The parties recognize employees are required to attend work at the required time for scheduled days of work. Unauthorized absences from such work negatively affect product quality and productivity.
(298)
JOB SECURITY
Discussions on this issue during bargaining revealed its complexity. Situations do arise which can affect the employee's ability to attend work as scheduled. However, the parties agree that with proper manpower planning and a reliance on programs such as bereavement pay, jury duty pay, vacation, Scheduled Paid Absence, holidays and plant and/or office programs which allow employees to request time off in advance, many of these unexpected situations can be addressed to the satisfaction of the employee without affecting the workplace.
The parties also acknowledge, however, that circumstances do arise that are wholly unexpected and beyond the employee's control. In order to prepare for these situations, the corporation maintains a staffing allowance based for the most part on absenteeism trends exhibited by the workforce.
Consequently, the parties acknowledge absenteeism as a feature of the workplace that must be managed.
Despite time away from work as provided by the collective agreement, along with many negotiated plant programs that facilitate time off by way of the Temporary Part-Time Employee Agreement, Code 1, unauthorized absentee rates in our plants remain a difficult issue.
With this background in mind, the parties agree to establish an Attendance Administration Task Force within 120 clays of the ratification of this agreement. The task force will consist of two representatives of the CAW, including the President of CAW Local 444, the Senior Manager, Labour Relations and Safety for the Corporation, and one other representative of the Labour Relations and Safety Department. The parties enter this agreement with a joint commitment that safe, productive workplaces depend on planning and the need for individuals to accept responsibility for their actions within the context of the employment relationship.

Letter (17.6) Retirement Allowance Option -Job & Income Protection Plan During the current negotiations the parties discussed methods of providing retirement incentives to employees retirement eligible under the Regular or Special Early Retirement provisions of the Non-Contributory Pension Plan, on the date of a plant closing or permanent job loss as identified under Letter (17.11) - Restructuring - Job and Income Protection.
Accordingly, any employee who is retirement eligible under the provisions of Letter (17.11) on the date of the closure or permanent job loss, will be given the option of taking a Retirement Allowance of $50,000.
The parties agreed that receipt of the Retirement Allowance is in-lieu of any SUB entitlement that may have been provided under the provisions of Letter (17.11) and the SUB Plan.
Acceptance of this option will result in the immediate retirement of the employee.
All payments made under the terms of this Agreement will be recoverable from future SUB contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all pay periods in which SUB contributions exceed the total amount of Regular Benefits paid and the Percentage Relationship of Fund Assets to Maximum Funding is greater than 40%.

Letter (17.7) Payments Upon Plant Closure
During the current negotiations the parties agreed that upon a stand alone plant closure as defined in Letter
(17.11)	of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, pre retirement income maintenance program (PRIMP) benefits will be payable to eligible employees based on the following terms and conditions:
(a)	Eligible employees are those employees at the affected plant:
(300)
■ JOB SECURITY
(i)	who are between age 50 and 55 with at least IO years of credited service at the date of the plant closure and are not eligible for Regular Early Retirement: or
(ii)	who are at least age 48.1 but under age 50, with at least 9.1 years of credited service at the date of plant closure, who are placed on layoff and who then attain age 50 with at least 10 years of credited service.
(b)	Eligible employees will receive monthly PRIMP benefits equal to (a) the sum of the basic and supplementary benefit rates in effect under the provisions of the applicable pension' plan at date of commencement of PRIMP benefits, multiplied by (b) the employee’s credited service at the date of plant closure or, if later, the date at which the employee attains age 50 with at least 10 years of credited service;
(c)	Unless otherwise elected by both the employee and the surviving spouse (as defined in the applicable pension plan), PRIMP payments will be reduced by 5% of the amount calculated in (b) above, excluding any supplementary benefit amount, in order to provide PRIMP benefits to the surviving spouse, in an amount equal to 66 2/3 % of the portion of the employee’s PRIMP benefit which is based upon the basic benefit amount, after the application of the 5% reduction. In the event the employee's spouse predeceases the employee, the employee’s unreduced PRIMP benefit will be payable, upon notification of the death of the spouse.
PRIMP benefits will be payable until the first date at which the employee is, (or would have been eligible in the event of the death of the employee), eligible for either Special Early or Regular Early retirement;
(d)	On each October 1 following their commencement, PRIMP benefits will be recomputed in accordance with PCOLA adjustments applicable to employees retired under the pension plan on or after October 1, 1999.
(301)
JOB SECURITY
(e)	Employees or surviving spouses in receipt of PRIMP benefits would be eligible for Special Early retirement benefits from the applicable pension plan at age 55 (or at the date the employee would have attained age 55, in the case of a surviving spouse), at which time the calculation of the pension payable will be based on the employee's credited service and benefit rates at the time of plant closure or, if later, the date at which the employee attains or would have attained age 50, adjusted for PCOLA;
(f)	Employees whose Special Early retirement benefits are reduced due to the application of Revenue Canada regulations with respect to maximum pension limitations, will receive upon commencement of the employee's pension, a lump sum payment equal to the Actuarial Equivalent of the reduction in the employee's monthly pension benefit.
(g)	Employees and surviving spouses will be eligible for continued health care and group insurance coverage when in receipt of PRIMP benefits.
(h)	The Maximum Corporate Liability under the Income Maintenance Benefit Plan, Exhibit B to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, will be reduced by the amount of any PRIMP benefits paid to eligible employees,
(i)	Employees age 50 but not yet age 55 who are eligible for PRIMP benefits at the date of plant closure will also be eligible for the lump sum retirement allowance pursuant to Letter (17.11). (n93, c99)
Letter (17.8) Content
During the course of negotiations the Company and the Union held extensive discussions concerning the business and social consequences appendant to the issue of marketplace accessibility, content and sourcing within the context of a global automobile industry.
Consistent with our mutual desire to utilize the full range of employees' abilities to contribute to these
(302)
-S E CJOB R I T Y
objectives, the Company agrees to work with the Union in the exploration of measures to maintain employment opportunities equivalent to those now encompassed by the total of all plants covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement. This would include, where feasible, replacement of jobs lost by outsourcing.
In addition, DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. joins the CAW in supporting the principle that manufacturers who participate in the Canadian market should provide jobs, pay taxes and support the economy of the market in which they sell. As you know, DaimlerChrysler Corporation has for decades based its operations throughout North America on this very principle. We believe that, over the long run, no alternative policy can prevail if there is to be fairness and balance among the major trading nations of the world. As evidence of its commitment to these principles, the Company's Canadian value added gross purchases in 1992 exceeded seventy-five percent (75%) of its gross Canadian sales. Given the scope of its current operations in Canada, the Company affirms its expectation these principles will be maintained.
DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. commits to support acceptance of this principle, so that foreign producers will be encouraged to make their fair contribution to actions that will restore jobs to Canadian automotive and parts manufacturing workers.
It is believed that the principles expressed in this letter will contribute significantly to our co-operatively working together to provide employees in Canada with improved job security.
Letter (17.9) New Technology
It is recognised that the principle set forth in Section (9.1), paragraph (c) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today, will continue to create changes in the scope and work content of job classifications of represented employees. When the Corporation anticipates
(303)
JOB SECURITY
that a technological improvement it is making in its tools, methods, processes, equipment or materials may have a major impact on the work performed by Union represented employees, the Corporation will, as early as practicable, so advise the National Union, and at that time describe the location and nature of such technological changes and the extent to which they may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant or plants involved.
The Corporation and the Union may submit to the National Training Committee their recommendations for any training programs intended to assist present employees to perform work within the bargaining unit which is new or changed as a result of technological improvement.
In the event the National Union Representative considers it appropriate, he may arrange a meeting with the Manager of Labour Relations of the Corporation to discuss the impact of such technological changes and any proposed responses to such changes.
Any problems not resolved in such discussions may be submitted to the grievance procedure or to the deliberations of the National Training Committee, or to any other procedure on which the parties may agree.
Letter (17.10) Understanding
Re: Permanent Job Losses
During negotiations the parties discussed the extensive structural change that has already, and will continue to take place, in the North American automotive industry. Our discussions focused on two key aspects of this complicated issue: the need to maintain each DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. location as a productive manufacturer of world class quality products in the North American automotive market and to ensure that DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. employees, who contribute to the success of the Corporation, have their jobs and incomes protected as restructuring actions are taken. In
(304)
-SECURIUPB
addition, we have recognized the importance of the parties at both the local and national level continuing an ongoing dialogue about all the aspects of the business to ensure that the important goals are achieved.
With these objectives in mind, we have agreed that the understanding listed below will govern the parties in the event that restructuring or productivity-related actions may result in permanent job losses. These permanent job losses are those occasioned by specific actions taken by the Corporation. For example, outsourcing, the introduction of new technology, sale of part of the Corporation, and consolidation of operations would be actions contemplated by this understanding. The understanding would not apply to normal cyclical fluctuations in demand or the reduction of employees on “temporary” assignments. It is also understood that this program does not replace the ongoing discussions which continually take place at the local level regarding production standards and manpower requirements.
(a)	Where such permanent loss of jobs is considered, one year notice will be provided to the Union in the case of plant closure and six months notice will be provided to the Union in the case of a potential permanent job loss related to a restructuring as referred above. The information supplied to the Union will include the number of employees who could potentially be impacted and the rationale for the decision. It is understood that the information will be used for discussions between the parties and the workforce, and will be considered confidential. The Union will have the opportunity to make proposals which could alter or modify the decision.
(b)	During the course of these discussions, the objectives of the parties will be the retention of the jobs in question. To that end, the parties will discuss opportunities to retain or replace the jobs which are being discontinued. The Union will have thirty days from the date of notice to
(305)
JOB SECURITY
make proposals which could make it feasible to retain or replace the jobs in question.
(c)	If job losses become unavoidable and management decides to reduce the size of the workforce, every effort will be made to use attrition to manage the required reductions. The use of attrition is the subject of a separate letter between the parties.
Letter (17.11) Restructuring
-Job and Income Protection During negotiations, in a separate letter between the parties, we described the process that would be followed in the event that restructuring actions may result in permanent job losses. In that letter we agreed that the objective of the parties will be the retention of the jobs in question. We also agreed that if job losses become unavoidable, every effort will be made to use attrition to manage the required reductions.
The instant letter describes the process that will be implemented, and the benefit entitlements that will be provided to employees under three separate scenarios: (1) closure of stand-alone plants, (2) closure of a plant(s) at a multi-plant site, and (3) restructuring actions resulting in permanent job losses at any plant. The scenarios are detailed below as follows:
PLANT CLOSING
Stand-Alone Plants
As closure approaches and operations begin to wind down, employees who (I) are any age and have 28.1 or more years of Credited Service; (2) are age 54 or older but less than age 60 and within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service to equal 85 or more; and (3) are age 60 or older but less than age 65 and have ten or more years of Credited Service or are age 61 or older but less than age 65 and have 9.1 but less than 10
(306)
S E CJUB R I T Y
years of Credited Service, will be contacted regarding retirement under the Regular Early Retirement provisions of the applicable Non-Contributory Pension Plan and, if eligible, for Regular Early Retirement, may retire immediately and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter (17.6), Retirement Allowance Option -Job and Income Protection Plan. Employees who are age 55 or older but less than age 65 and who have ten or more years of Credited Service (including any such employees who are also eligible for Regular Early Retirement) will be offered Special Early Retirement commencing on or before the announced closing date and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter (17.6) upon retirement. Employees who are age 50 or older but less than age 55 and who have 10 or more years of credited service at the date of closure and are not eligible for Regular Early Retirement will be offered benefits under the Pre-Retirement Income Maintenance Program (PRIMP) and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter (17.6) upon commencement of PRIMP benefits.
At time of closure, remaining employees, including eligible employees who declined to elect immediate Regular Early Retirement or who declined the offer of Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will be placed on layoff. All such employees with 5 or more years of Seniority, except those who meet the age and service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan (VTEP). Any laid off employee who elects not to apply immediately for VTEP or who is ineligible for VTEP because the employee has less than 5 years of Seniority at layoff or because the employee meets, at the date of layoff, the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will:

.TOR SECURITY
•	be eligible for Regular Benefits under the
Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) Plan provided the employee has at least one year of Seniority as of the employee's last day worked prior to layoff;
•	be offered employment at other Corporation facilities in accordance with the parties' understanding on preferential placement; and
•	provided the employee had 5 or more years of
Seniority as of the employee's last day worked prior to layoff and does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement upon exhausting the employee's eligibility for Regular SUBenefits and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement or PRIMP at time of layoff, be eligible for IMP Benefits under the Income Maintenance Benefit Plan.
An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who elects not to apply for VTEP at time of layoff will be eligible to make subsequent application for such a payment, reduced by the sum of any IMP Benefits the employee had received while on layoff prior to ultimately making application for VTEP, provided that the employee does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement at the time application is made and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement or PRIMP at time of layoff and provided further that such application is filed within the maximum time limits set forth in the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan.

On a site-wide basis, separately for skilled trades and non-skilled employees and for skilled employees, by trade, before closing layoffs are effected, the number of employees in the workforce will be reduced by:
(308)
■ JOB SECURITY
(1)	Laying off employees with hire or rehire dates on or after the date closing was announced;

(b)	if not eligible to retire, or if option 2(a) not chosen, to be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits;
(3)	Offering the opportunity to employees (excluding those who also may be in (2) above) who are age 54 or older but less than age 65 and who within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service to equal 85 or more to:

If the total number of employees who accept an offer under (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) above exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost due to the closing, individual elections will be effected in Seniority order until the resulting number of separations equals the expected job loss.
At time of closure, the reduction in force provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be implemented. An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who is laid off as a result of the reduction in force and who at time of layoff does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under VTEP. Any laid off employee who elects not to apply immediately for VTEP or who is ineligible for VTEP because the employee has less than 5 years of Seniority at layoff or because the employee meets the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will:

An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who elects not to apply for VTEP at time of layoff will be eligible to make subsequent application for such a payment, reduced by the sum of any IMP Benefits the employee had received while on layoff prior to ultimately making application for VTEP, provided that the employee does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement at the time application is made and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement at the time of layoff and provided further that such application is filed within the maximum time limits set forth in the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan.
PERMANENT JOB LOSS
In the event management decides that workforce reductions resulting in permanent job loss as a consequence of restructuring actions cannot be accomplished in a timely and efficient manner through normal attrition, the following steps will be taken, separately for skilled trades and non-skilled employees and for skilled employees, by trade:
(1)	employees who have not attained Seniority will be placed on layoff:
(2)	If the number of separations that can be accomplished through implementation of (1) above is less than the number of jobs that will be lost, employees at any age who have 28.1 or more years of Credited Service will be offered the opportunity to:
(a) retire immediately, if eligible for Regular Early Retirement, and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter (17.6); or
(b) if not eligible to retire, or if option 2(a) not chosen, be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits;

If at the time of workforce reduction there are employees with less than one year of Seniority at work, step 2(b) will not apply:
If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under (1) above, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order for accepting employees until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
(3)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees (excluding those who may also be in (2) above) who are age 54 or older but less than age 65 and who within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service equal to 85 or more will be offered the opportunity to:

If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under the three preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, Special Early Retirements will be approved in Seniority order until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
(5)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees who are age 60 or older but less than age 65 and have ‘IO or more years of Credited Service or are age 61 or older but less than age 65 and have 9.1 or more but less than 10 years of Credited Service will be offered the opportunity to be placed on layoff with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits. If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under the four preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order for accepting employees until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
If at the time of the workforce reduction there are employees with less than one year of Seniority at work, employees will not be offered the opportunity to be placed on layoff with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits.
(6)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees who have 5 or more years of Seniority (excluding those in (2), (3), (4) and (5) above) will be offered an opportunity to apply for VTEP. If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for
(313)

separation under the five preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost.
These actions will be taken and administered on a site-wide basis at multi-plant sites.
If these measures fail to stimulate sufficient additional attrition to accomplish the necessary workforce reductions, the reduction in force provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be implemented. An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who is laid off as a result of the reduction in force and who at time of layoff does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under VTEP. Any laid off employee who elects not to apply immediately for VTEP or who is ineligible for VTEP because the employee has less than 5 years of Seniority or because the employee meets the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will:
(i)	be eligible for Regular Benefits under the SUB Plan;
(ii)	be offered employment at other Corporation facilities in accordance with the parties' understanding on preferential placement (or at a multi-plant site, be eligible for recall pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, whichever may occur first); and
(iii)	provided the employee had 5 or more years of Seniority as of the employee's last day worked prior to layoff and does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement upon exhausting the employee’s eligibility for Regular SUBenefits and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement at time of layoff, be eligible for IMP Benefits under the Income Maintenance Benefit Plan.

An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who elects not to apply for VTEIP at time of layoff will be eligible to make subsequent application for such a payment, reduced by the sum of any IMP Benefits the employee had received while on layoff prior to ultimately making application for VTEP, provided that the employee does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement at the time application is made and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement at the time of layoff and provided further that such application is filed within the maximum time limits set forth in the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan.
Following the notice of a restructuring event and if, after steps (1) through (6) above have been completed, the number of separations achieved is less than the number of jobs lost then the difference between the number of separations and the jobs lost will be accumulated as a reserve. The Corporation will repeat steps (2) through (6) every six months, or earlier by mutual agreement among the parties, during any period in which employees at the affected location remain on indefinite layoff until a number of additional separations equal to the lesser of the reserve or the number of employees on indefinite layoff, is achieved.
In addition, the Corporation and the Union may through mutual agreement, implement steps (2) through (6) at other Corporation locations during any period of time when the number of required separations has not been achieved.
The above commitments were executed in a spirit that recognizes the need to ensure that DaimierChrysler Canada operations produce world-class quality products as efficiently as possible. That recognition, coupled with the commitments we have negotiated to protect the jobs and incomes of our employees, should help to assure that both parties achieve our shared objective of maintaining

Letter (17.12) Skilled Trades - Permanent Job Losses
During these negotiations the parties agreed to several arrangements which will govern the parties in the event of permanent job losses resulting from productivity-related actions or restructuring.
In response to concerns raised by the Union regarding productivity-related actions or restructuring and their potential impact on maintenance and construction work, the Company reaffirmed the principles and procedures with respect to the letting of outside contracts for maintenance and construction work specified in Sections (17.16),
(17.17), (17.18), (17.19) and (17.20).
Letter (17.13) Vendor Support
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the issue of supplier employees performing rework and/or sorting operations within the plant. The Company explained the necessity for occasionally having vendors perform rework upon their supplied components. To that extent, the Company advised the Union it is not, under normal and ordinary circumstances, the intent of DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. to have vendor employees perform “rework”, to the detriment of CAW represented employees except as it pertains to the below statement on specific techniques or skills.
Nevertheless, the parties recognize that circumstances can and do arise where vendors must have their employees perform such rework within our facilities in cases such as where it is required for the vendor to obtain more knowledge about the quality defect, where specific techniques or skills are required and/or where warranty agreements and vehicle safety items could be impacted. Furthermore, the Company advised the Union that under
(316)
SEC JUBR I T Y
normal and ordinary circumstances, non-corporate supplier employees would only be allowed to perform continuing rework and/or sorting operations within our facilities for up to a maximum of three (3) consecutive working days to correct a specific problem. After such time, the rework for that specific problem would be assigned either to plant employees or the nonconforming material will be returned to the supplier for rework. This agreement would not be in effect for a maximum of six (6) weeks following the introduction of any new part.
In applying the above understanding, the Plant assures the Union that vendor rework will not be performed on the assembly line. Further, in the case of finished vehicles, vendor rework will be performed only in those instances where the vendor's expertise is required due to the criteria referenced in the aforementioned paragraph.
Letter (17.14) Notification — Tooling Outsourcing
In the event a decision to use a non-Company source for tooling work is being contemplated, local management will, except where time and circumstances prevent it, notify the Union in writing and have advance discussion with local union representatives concerning the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason why management is contemplating utilizing a nonCompany source. At such times, Company representatives are expected to afford the Union opportunity to comment on the Company's plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of attendant circumstances.
(17,15)	Job Security and Outside Contracting
Employees of an outside contractor will not be utilized in a plant covered by this Agreement to replace seniority employees on production assembly or manufacturing work or fabrication of tools, dies, jigs and fixtures, normally and historically performed by them when performance of such
(317)
JOB SECURITY
work involves the use of Corporation-owned machines, tools or equipment maintained by employees.
The foregoing shall not affect the right of the Corporation to continue arrangements currently in effect: nor shall it limit the fulfillment of warranty obligations by vendors nor limit work which a vendor must perform to prove out equipment.
In all cases, except where time and circumstances prevent it, the plant management will hold advance discussion with local Union representatives prior to letting such a contract. In this discussion local management is expected to review its plans or prospects for letting a particular contract. The local Union should be advised of the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons (equipment, manpower, etc.) why management is contemplating contracting out the work. At such times Corporation representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Corporation's plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.
In no event shall any seniority employee who customarily performs the work in question be laid off as a direct and immediate result of work being performed by any outside contractor on the plant premises.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice provisions of Section (17.16) (a) Skilled Trades, shall apply when plant maintenance and construction work is let to outside contractors.
(17.16)	Outside Contractors
(a)	It is the policy of the Corporation to fully utilize its own employees in maintenance skilled trades classifications in the performance of maintenance and construction work, as set forth in the Agreement.
In all cases, except where time and circumstances prevent it, the Corporation will notify the Union in writing prior to letting a contract for the performance of
(318)
JOB SECURITY
maintenance and construction work in order to afford the Union an opportunity to hold advance discussion of the matter before the contract is let. In this discussion, the Corporation is expected to review its plans or prospects for letting a particular contract. The Union should be advised of the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons (equipment, employment level, etc.) why the Corporation is contemplating contracting out the work. At such times, the Corporation is expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Corporation's plans and to give weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.
(b)	Discussion of Outside Contract
When discussions are held, in accordance with the provisions of Section (17.16) (a) Skilled Trades and Section (17.17) Skilled Trades, the Supervisor of Plant Engineering may be accompanied by the Superintendent of Maintenance or other personnel familiar with the work involved.
(c)	Notice of Outside Contract
The following memo will be distributed to all Plant Engineering personnel issuing notices of outside contracting work:
“During our recent negotiations there were lengthy discussions in the quality and detail disclosed on the notice of outside contracting form.
To resolve the matter we agreed to advise the responsible areas in the plants, of these complaints and suggest that more definite information be included so that the Union Representatives would be able to identify the work to be performed. The above would be beneficial to both parties as some meetings presently requested could be avoided because the additional information would meet the Union's needs.”
The Company will re-issue the better contained in this Section (17.16)(c) within two weeks of the date of ratification.
(319)
■TOB-SECURIT-Y
(d)	Service Contracts and Warranty Arrangements
Advance written notification for the letting of skilled
trades service contracts, and vendor warranty arrangements will be given to the Union.
The parties will meet periodically to discuss such service contracts and warranty arrangements.
(e)	Use of Outside Contractors While Employees are on Layoff.
During recent negotiations the Union expressed concern regarding the use of contractors while Skilled Trades Employees are on layoff.
As indicated in those sections of the Production Maintenance Agreement dealing with the subject of outside contracting, the Corporation will endeavour to maximize work opportunities for its Skilled Trades Employees.
Discussions on contracting, prior to any layoff or contemplated layoffs, will give full consideration to maintaining future work in house.
(17.17)	Maintenance Contracting
This Section is intended to clarify the intent of Section
(17.16)	(a) pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees.
(a)	It is the policy of DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the employees, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This Section is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
(b)	The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform
(320)
JOB SECURITY
maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
(c)	The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of DaimlerChrysler personnel in mind.
(d)	In applying the provisions of Section (17.16) it is our intention that, except where time and circumstances prevent it, any “advance discussion” held in accordance with those provisions take place before any final decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out.
(e)	In those cases when the work to be performed is not started by the contractor within ninety (90) days following the approximate starting date given to the Union pursuant to Section (17.16) (a), and the Union believes the circumstances in the plant have changed sufficiently to warrant review of the initial decision to let the contract, the Union, upon request, will be given an opportunity to comment on the changed circumstances. To the extent practicable, the Corporation will give weight to such comments.
It is important that the Corporation advise the Union of any or all of the factors mentioned in the above provisions which it will take into consideration in determining whether a particular contract should be let out or not. Such advice will be given in the course of the “advance discussion” so that the Union will be given a better opportunity to make its comments and the Corporation will also be given an opportunity “to give weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.”
(17.18)	Consideration and Advance Discussions
When a stamping or assembly plant is contemplating a decision to let to an outside source die or major jig and
(321)
JOB SECURITY
fixture work, the Plant Management will hold advance discussions with the Local Union concerning the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and, based upon the considerations set forth in Section
(17.19)	Skilled Trades, as well as the magnitude of the construction program, the timing of each phase of the program, the availability of facilities, specialized equipment and necessary skills within the work force, the complicating effect of design modifications and bottleneck operations such as machining limitations and the unavailability of presses to perform necessary tryout work, the efficiencies and economics involved, and the need to maintain a reliable supply base in view of the fluctuations and uncertainties of the die, jig and fixture construction business, will review with the Union why the decision to let the work is contemplated. The Plant Management will take into consideration and afford due weight to any relevant information furnished by the Union before making its final decision.
A Plant Management decision to utilize an outside source for such work should consider, in addition to all the above relevant considerations, any adverse employment impact on the plant's journeymen/women in the affected skilled trades classifications who are laid off or would be laid off as a direct result of the decision. In making a final decision, the Corporation will not act arbitrarily or capriciously in disregard of the legitimate interests of DaimlerChrysler employees.
(17.19)	Tool and Dirt Contracting
You have discussed with us at great length the possible effect on our skilled tool and die and model employees of decisions of the Corporation to buy some of its tools, dies, and models, rather than make them.
As we have pointed out to you in current negotiations, there are many and varied factors that may influence any particular decision to make or buy. We do not believe it is
(322)
■ JOB SECURITY
feasible to list general criteria. However, the Union has stated in our discussions that it recognizes a number of them, such as the need, among other things, to contract work that requires specialized tools and equipment and special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model changes and re-arrangement deadlines.
In view of the foregoing, we have advised you that the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies, and models, or to buy them. However, we wish to make it clear to you that it is our policy, in making such decisions, to give proper consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economics involved and all other relevant considerations, including the effect of the decisions on work opportunities of tool, die and model employees.
Where the Corporation considers that work practices or provisions of local agreements in its Tool, Die and Model Departments may be having an adverse effect on the Corporation's ability to compete in this field effectively, it will discuss such matters on a timely basis with the Local Union and explore with it fully the possibilities of taking practical steps with respect to such matters to the end of improving the employment opportunities of such employees. The Skilled Trades Representative of the Corporation is also willing to meet from time-to-time with the Skilled Trades Representative of the National Union to discuss, and provide information relative to plans the Corporation is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool and die contracting on a corporate-wide basis. A representative of an affected plant is willing to meet from time-to-time with the Skilled Trades Committeeperson at the plant to discuss, and provide information relative to plans the plant is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool and die contracting by the plant.
(323)
JOB SECURITY
(17.20)	Tool and Die Contracting in
General Manufacturing Division, Engine, and Casting Division Plants In our negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated December 11, 1982 we discussed in great detail tool and die contracting by the Corporation, some aspects of which are the subject of Section (17.19) Skilled Trades, Tool and Die Contracting. In the course of these discussions we reiterated that the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies, models, jigs or fixtures or to buy them.
We assure you, however, that when Journeymen/women skilled trades employees in the toolmaking trades, including machine repair where applicable, of a plant of the General Manufacturing and Engine and Casting Divisions are on layoff for any reason or become laid off as a result of the plant’s contracting out work involving the fabrication, maintenance or repair of tools and dies, and of the kind normally performed by such skilled trades employees in the plant, the Skilled Trades Representative of the Corporation, on request, will meet with the Skilled Trades Representative of the National Union to discuss, and provide information relative to, plans the Corporation is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning such contracting. A good faith effort will be extended by the parties to find solution to the problems discussed in these meetings.
Letter (17.21) Quality Initiatives
During negotiations, the parties discussed the competitive nature of the auto industry in Canada and the potential impact upon job security for employees of DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc.
During these discussions the Corporation addressed the importance of quality as one of the critical factors which can influence long-term viability of each of the facilities of
-JOB SECURITY
DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. In this regard, the Corporation reviewed with the Union quality initiatives that are being introduced to ensure that the best possible quality standards are achieved. The programs reviewed included the Quality Improvement Process, Statistical Process Control methods, Performance Feedback Systems, training of employees to enhance operator skills, and other measures to measure and improve quality levels.
The parties agreed the application of these programs and processes is important for achievement of the quality objectives essential to the ongoing viability of each facility of DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc.
Letter (17.22) Employee — Basic Responsibilities
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed at length the issue of job security. It is understood that faced with severe domestic and foreign competition, DaimlerChrysler must improve its manufacturing and other systems and provide for more productive and effective utilization of its capital and human resources if job security is to be attained.
One of the concepts discussed that would enable DaimlerChrysler to work toward meeting these important objectives and providing job security pertains lo basic employee responsibilities. The Company believes setting forth an understanding of the duties that constitute basic responsibilities of all employees will encourage employee growth and co-operation, thereby improving productivity and increasing the flexibility of the Company's human resources.
As such, the Company and the Union agree that all employees are expected to take pride in their workmanship; have respect for other employees, union and salaried alike; be orderly and neat in their own workplace and otherwise respect the rights of others to work in an orderly, clean and safe environment.
(325)
JOBSECURITY
All employees are expected to perform the various duties and basic responsibilities assigned to them.
Employees have the responsibility to ensure the equipment they use or work with is in proper working order. When a problem exists, they are to notify the appropriate personnel of such a problem, to minimize damage to themselves, other employees or to quality production of the product.
When time permits, employees may be expected to perform other tasks, relative to their normal operations.
(17.23) Memorandum of Understanding On Plant Closings
This Memorandum of Understanding supplements the Production and Maintenance Agreement between DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. and the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada (CAW-Canada), and certain of its Local Unions as follows:
WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Union wish to provide work opportunity to employees laid off as a result of the phasing-out of operations prior to a plant closing and those laid off as the result of the closing itself; and
WHEREAS, due to the plant closing such laid off employees have no recall rights to any Corporation plant.
NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed that effective and concurrent with the Production and Maintenance Agreement,
I
Employees laid off from a plant the Corporation has announced its intention to close and who are not expected to be recalled due to the closing will be placed on a list in the order of their seniority at the closed plant. As work they are qualified to do becomes available at other plants of the Corporation as a result of attritional openings, employees
(326)
JOB SECURITY
on the list will be eligible for placement in such jobs insofar as reasonably practicable in the order of their seniority at the closed plant.
An employee placed pursuant to this Paragraph I will be placed only when said employee's seniority is greater than the seniority of a laid off employee of the plant in which the attritional opening occurs and who otherwise would be recalled to the attritional opening.
Employees placed pursuant to Paragraph I, above, in a new plant of the Corporation within twelve (12) calendar months of the date it ships its first production will be credited at such plant with their full seniority at the closed plant at the time of their placement.
Employees who decline an opportunity to be placed pursuant to Paragraph I or II above, shall be removed from the list and thereafter shall be ineligible for placement pursuant to the terms of this Memorandum.
The Corporation shall not incur any liability for claimed violations or errors in administration of this Memorandum, and employees will not accumulate seniority or other’rights by reason of this Memorandum.

Fundamental to the effectiveness of this process is a commitment to open communication and a process of finding satisfactory solutions to issues as they arise. The parties agreed that the following elements are essential:
« Advance discussions concerning planned efficiency initiatives and other workload changes.
•	A process to address operational or employee issues as they arise, including where necessary, bringing in a time study representative from another DaimlerChrysler facility or the national office to review the issues.
■ Exchange of information, including but not limited to, available time study data to facilitate the resolution of work allocation issues.
•	Effective utilization of all resources including, but not limited to, engineering, health & safety,

3)	An attempt will be made to place the injured worker in his/her regular job classification where modifications can be instituted to meet his/her physical restrictions. In addition these modifications will not interrupt the normal rotation within the department. If this is not possible, the work will be of a non-traditional nature not normally performed by other job classifications.
4)	The program objective is to return these employees to their original jobs within an (8) eight week period of time, however the parties recognized the need for flexibility due to each employee’s circumstance.
5)	Overtime during the period of the modified work program is suspended. Overtime hours during this period will be charged. Workers’ Compensation views a successful
32
program as once that does not exceed 40 hours or 5 days work and allows for a period of rest and recovery.
6)	All modified work should be of a meaningful nature and as closely related to the injured workers regular job and shift as possible.
STEPS TO BE TAKEN BEFORE EMPLOYEE STARTS MODIFIED WORK PROGRAM
‘Employee injured during the shift can be accommodated by their supervisor or area manager.
‘Injured worker is to report to First Aid as soon as possible following the injury.
following meeting in First Aid, the injured worker should speak to the WCB placement coordinators to allow them to gain some background regarding the injury and attempt to place the worker in the modified work program.
‘If it is determined that modified work is appropriate, First Aid will issue POX restrictions to Placement coordinators and department supervisor.
‘Placement coordinators, supervisor and shift steward will meet to discuss and agree on modified duties.
*Injured worker will be reviewed on a regular basis until returned to regular duties.
IF LOST TIME OCCURS.
*Supervisor must report it to placement coordinators immediately.
33
• Coordinator will contact injured worker to determine the extent ol lost time. If employee feels that it will be prolonged, an appointment will be scheduled with the company doctor. If employee is found to be PQX, he/she should be directed back for placement on modified work.
*If employee presents a medical note stating he/she is unfit for work, the employee will be sent to company doctor for medical check. This date should be the starting date for future follow up. This follow up should take place on a weekly basis.
*A realistic date should be determined between company doctor and the injured workers family doctor.
The above proposal would create a requirement for interaction among all parties involved in work-related injuries and it would provide a concept to attempt to return an injured employee to work as soon as possible.
Letter (4)
SPECIAL TASK FORCE
During recent discussions between the Company and the importance of quality as one of the critical factors which can influence long term viability at Ajax Trim plant was stressed. In this regard and notwithstanding paragraph 7.4 of the Ajax Special Provisions, it was agreed that when the need arises from time to time to assemble a Task Force to deal with the quality issues it would be done as follows:
1,	The affected department will seek volunteers through a canvass, by department, by seniority. These parties acknowledge that once an employee has accepted a position on the task force paragraph 7.4 section (B) will apply. The parties agree that this task force opportunity is without precedent or prejudice to any matter between the parties.
34
2.	Upon request of the local chairperson, the Company will provide the union with the status reports as to the progress of the quality task force in question. This will ensure the union is aware of the progress of each quality task force.
3.	In the event a task force is required beyond six (6) months, the company and the union will review and mutually agree.
