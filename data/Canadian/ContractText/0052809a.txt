BAKERY, CONFECTIONERY, TOBACCO WORKERS AND GRAIN MILLERS INTERNATIONAL UNION - LOCAL 264 (hereinafter referred to as the "Union")
PURPOSE
The general purpose of this Agreement is to maintain satisfactory relations between the Company and its employees; to promote the mutual interest of the Company and its employees; and to provide orderly collective bargaining relations as hereinafter provided.
RELATIONSHIP
The Union recognizes the responsibilities imposed upon it as the bargaining agent of the unit and realizes that in order to provide maximum opportunities for continuing employment, good working conditions, and good wages, the Employer must be in a strong market position which means it must produce at the lowest possible cost consistent with fair labour standards. The Union, through the Committee herein provided for by reason of its bargaining position, assumes a joint responsibility in the attainment of these goals. The Union therefore agrees that it will co-operate with the Employer and support its efforts to assure a full day's work on the part of its members; that it will actively combat absenteeism and any other practices which restrict production.
It further agrees that it will support the Employer in its efforts to eliminate waste production; conserve materials and supplies; improve the quality of workmanship; prevent accidents and strengthen good will between the Employer, and the employees, the customer and the public.
