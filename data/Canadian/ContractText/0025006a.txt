1.	There is no entitlement to bump for one (1) hour or less, providedthat this cannot bo appliedto an individual Employee more than twice a week;
2.	The onus is on the Employee, at the time ofbeing advised that his shift is ending early, to notify the Company immediately that he wishes to exercise his bumping rights and whether or not such a request has already been refused twice that week;
3.	The most junior Employee exercising bumping rights is matched up with the most junior Employee then working in the Plant. Ajunior Employee being temporarily laid off can either accept the job of the most junior Employee still working in the Plant, if he has the ability to do that job (and if he cannot, he has no other options on the day shift), or bump the most junior Employee on the night shift, if he has the ability do that job. In either case, if the junior Employee being temporarily laid off does not have the ability to do the job of the junior Employee with whom he is matched, there are no other options for the Employee being temporarily laid off. A similar procedure would be followed for the second most junior Employee who is temporarily laid off and who is exercising his burnping rights.

6.	If there are more hours left in the shift of the junior Employee being bumped than in the overlapping shift of the more senior Employee exercising bumping rights, the more senior Employee has to wait until the last part of the junior Employee's shift. For example, if the more senior Employee has lost two (2) hours from his regular shift, he must wait until the last two (2) hours of the junior Employee's scheduled shift: If an Employee is bumping into an evening shift which has not yet started and the Company is able to contact the junior Employee scheduled for the evening shift before he arrives at work, the senior Employee can pick up his hours at the start of the scheduled shift of the junior Employee working on the evening shift and the start time for the junior Employee will be adjusted accordingly. (The two weeks' notice of change of schedule would not be applicable since the change was not initiated by the Company.)
7.	An Employeecannot bump another Employeeso as to deprive the junior Employee of an opportunity to work at least four (4) hours (the minimum under Article 11.08). Similarly, an Employee who works more than four
(4)	hours in total, including time worked as a result of bumping, is not entitled to any benefits under Article 11.08.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
(Re Powerhouse)
BETWEEN:
UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS, LOCAL 864
AND
LARSEN PACKERS LIMITED
The following terms and conditions of employment apply in the Powerhouse:
1.	Hours of work
(a) Powerhouse Operators shall normally work 12 hour shifts. There shall be a two (2) week cycle with alternating weeks of thirty-six (36) hours (three (3) shifts) and forty-eight (48) hours (four (4) shifts), resulting in an average of forty-two (42) hours per week.
(b) The shift schedule shall be as follows:
	Sun.	Mon.	Inaa*	Wed.	Thurs.	Ell	saL
Week 1	Ai0	A/B	CID	CID	Ai0	C/D	C/D
Week2	C/D	CID	AiO	A/B	C/D	A/B	A/B
(c) Night shift: 8 p m. to 8 a m. Day shift: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
(60)
The twenty-four (24) hour day is considered to begin at 8 p.m. of the previous day, for example, the Sunday shift starts at 8 p m. on Saturday.
(d)	An Operator is not entitled to exercise seniority for shift preference under Article 17.04 (a) to displace another Operator.
(e)	Operators may trade shifts among themselves provided the arrangement is approved by the Supervisor involved. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any such arrangement shall not result in additional cost to the Company, either directly (for example, overtime) or indirectly.
(f)	Operators are entitled to four (4) breaks of fifteen (15) minutesduring each twelve (12) hour shift at such times as are consistent with operational efficiency.
(g)	Operators shall not work more than eighteen ( 18) consecutive hours except in cases of an emergency. If an Operator is absent for his scheduled shift and a Relief Operator is not available, the hours would first be offered to the two (2) Operators who were working the shifts immediately before and after the absent Operator, split equally between the two (2) Operators (that is six (6) hours each); hours which are not taken by those Operators would be offered to the fourth regular Operator.
2.	Compensation:
(a) Weekly pay would be based on an average forty-two (42) hours per week at straight time, subject to adjustment for working more or less than the
(61 )
scheduled number of hours. For example, if an Operator was absent for one day, his pay for the week of the absence would be reduced by twelve (12) hours.
(b)	Overtime pay time and one-half straight time rate of pay for hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours per day or in excess of the number of hours scheduled for that week (thirty-six (36) or forty-eight (48) as the case may be); double straight time rate of pay after an Operator has worked six (6) hours overtime at time and one-half on any day.
(c)	Shift premium Operators working the night shift shall receive a shift premium of 50C per hour in accordance with Article 11.10.
3.	Holidays:
(a)	Operators shall have eight (8) paid holidays. (Since these are twelve (12) hourdays,they re present ninety-six (96) hours, which is equivalent to the twelve (12) holidays at eight (8) hours received by other employees).
(b)	Scheduling: Operators must schedule holidays in advance and at such times that a Relief Operator could be available to work the shift. For example, two (2) Operators working back to backshifis could not take the same day off if there was only one (1) Relief Operator because this would require the Relief Operator to work twenty-four (24) consecutive hours.
(c)	Preference for scheduling holidays as between two (2) or more Operators will be based on departmental seniority.
(62)
4.	Vacations:
(a)	Vacation time: Convert weeks to shifts based on the forty-two (42) hour per week average;
For example:	2 weeks - 7 shifts
3	weeks - 10 1/2 shifts
4	weeks - 14 shifts
(b)	Vacation pay: The greater of the following amounts:
(a)	the appropriate percentage of vacation pay base;
(b)	a normal shift's pay (twelve (12) hours at the regular hourly rate) for each shift, subject to reduction in accordance with Article 8.01 (4)(b).
(c)	Vacation Scheduling:
(i)	Operators may be allowed to take vacations other than in blocks of calendar weeks, but normally would not be allowed to take only one (I) or two (2) vacation days. (Single days off can normally be obtained through scheduling of holidays.)
(ii)	Vacation shall be scheduled in April and May in accordance with Article 8.02.
5.	Bereavement Leave:
Operators shall be entitled to two (2) days of bereavement leave with pay (two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts being equivalent to the three (3) days referred to in Article 15.01).
(63)
6.	Sick Leave:
Operators can only draw on their sick leave bank in blocks of twelve (12) hours.
7.	Relief Operator(s):
(a)	The Company will appoint at least one (1) Relief Operator;
(b)	All holidays and vacations of regular Operators will be scheduled so that the shifts can be covered by a Relief Operator(s);
(c)	A Relief Operator is expected to be available to relieve a regular Operator who is absent, including absences for such matters as illness or injury where the Company receivesvery little, if any, advance notice of the absence. In such cases, it will be impossible for the Company to give the Relief Operator the two weeks' notice of change of schedule normally required under Article 11.01(b). That notice is therefore
not required in such cases, but the Company is required to give the Relief Operator as much notice as reasonably possible and at least four (4) hours' notice.
(d)	A Relief Operator shall work in the Powerhouse at straight time rates for up to twelve (12) hours a day and up to forty-eight (48) hour per week or bank the hours in excess of eight (8) hours a day or forty (40) hours per week to be taken as time off,
(64)
8.	Return to Eight (8) Hour Days:
Powerhouse Operators may revert to eight (8) hour days after a six (6) month triai period provided there is mutual agreement between the Company and the Union as to terms and conditions which would apply.
