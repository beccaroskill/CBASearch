a)	New employees shall be considered “Probationary” for the first 400 hours worked. During the probationary period, they must be available and report for all work as required. Accumulated hours toward seniority shall be cancelled in the event an employee is unavailable for work, quits, or is discharged, for just cause.
b)	This probationary period is to afford the Company an opportunity to evaluate
4
the employee’s overall performance on the job and assess their capabilities to perform the work.
c)	Probationary employees who do not establish regular seniority status by season’s end will have their names and total hours worked carried forward to the following season,

5.03.3
All hiring at the commencement of operations shall be on the basis of preferences to those employees who have the greatest length of service consistent with the provisions herein.
n
During the slack periods, employees with the greatest length of service at the plant in the department or occupational group concerned shall be given preference in lay-off and at the termination of such slack period shall be given preference in hiring, providing they are competent and willing to accept such work as is available.
5.03.4	Regular employees shall be called to work in their order of seniority whenever there is work available for them whether during or between major operating seasons. Prior to major operating seasons, employees should communicate with the Company on or about a specified date to advise of their availability for continued employment.

5.04	General Provisions Affecting Non-Regular Seniority
5.04.1	Lists of employees who have not qualified for regular seniority standing will be maintained by the Company in order of date employed. Revised copies of such lists
5
— V\ ^
will be made available to the Chief Shop Steward prior to the herring roe and salmon seasons of each year. Such seniority lists will form the basis for call-outs of probationary employees after all employees on the regular seniority lists have been called out.
5.04.2	Seasonal employees will have their names carried forward on call-outs lists to the next season provided that they work to a specified date prior to Labour Day each salmon season and are available for work by a specified date at the beginning of the next salmon season, both dates to be named by the Company.

Such plant plans shall not necessarily set a precedent either for another plant or the Industry as a whole.
6

5.06.3	During discussion and negotiation of plant seniority plans, every effort shall be made by both parties, subject to proper consideration of overall problems, and to peculiar problems which may exist in the plant to include as many employees and classifications as possible in each seniority grouping to the end that as few seniority groupings as practicably possible are instituted.
5.06.4	During discussion of plant seniority plans the question of seniority determining the order of call-out for overtime work, should such problems exist in a plant, shall also be discussed. Call-out for overtime shall be on a basis equitable to the members of the regular crew, capable of doing the work required. Any unjustified deviation from this practice or any problem arising on overtime call-out shall be discussed between Shop Steward Committee and Management.
5.07	Plant Seniority Lists
5.07.1	The Company shall prepare and maintain seniority lists for each plant on the basis of the conditions as set forth in this article. The plant seniority lists shall provide the basis for lay-offs and hiring whether of a sporadic or seasonal nature, subject to the conditions of this article. The lists shall be amended as new employees qualify for seniority and as employees are dropped from seniority listing. Should mistakes or discrepancies occur in such lists, such mistakes or discrepancies shall be discussed between the Shop Steward Committee and the Management with a view to correcting same.
5.07.2	The plant seniority lists shall be available to the Shop Steward Committee or Headquarters of the Union upon request and shall also be posted in a conspicuous place in the plant.
5.08	Transfers
5.08.1	When an employee is transferred permanently from one group or department or plant to another, the employees’ seniority shall also be immediately transferred.
5.08.2	In the case of temporary non-compulsory transfers from one group or department or plant to another, the employee’s seniority will not be transferred until 400 hours have been worked in the operation into which the employee is transferred.
5.08.3	In the case of temporary non-compulsory transfers, the employee shall retain his or her seniority in the original group, department or plant. After qualifying the employee will also be listed on the seniority list of the group, department or plant transferred to with “temporary” being placed after the employee’s name. An employee shall retain such temporary seniority listing only in the last group, department or plant, in which same was attained. Upon returning to the original group, department
7
or plant, the employee’s temporary listing shall be discontinued six months after return.
5.08.4	No employees shall be transferred from one plant to another without the employee’s consent, except in the event that a specific classification is required and an employee in that classification can be spared from another operation within the Company, then the employee may be transferred without consent, provided the employee’s seniority is retained in the original plant, In the case of such temporary compulsory transfers from one plant to another seniority will be immediately transferred.
5.08.5	The individual involved in such compulsory transfer may be returned to the employee’s “Home Plant” as soon as the circumstances requiring the transfer have been overcome, and/or within a maximum period of six months from the time of transfer and/or at the end of the season. Compulsory transfers shall not subject the individual transferee to a lesser period of employment during the year than the employee would have received if not transferred.
5.09	Leave of Absence
5.09.1	Unless otherwise noted, provisions for leave of absence apply to regular employees only.
5.09.2	Seniority rights of employees shall not be affected if inability to report to work arises from sickness or from reasons acceptable to the Company. Absence for reasons other than sickness, if for a period in excess of one week, must be covered under the following leave of absence conditions.
5.09.3	Employees who for good and sufficient cause require a leave of absence shall be granted same. Such leave of absence if granted, shall be for a maximum period of one year except under unusual circumstances. There shall be no forfeiture of total seniority unless the employee concerned has not reported back for work by the final date of the leave of absence.
5.09.4	All leave of absence, when granted or extended, shall be placed in writing with one copy to be provided to the Chief Shop Steward and one to be retained by the Company. Approved leaves shall list the starting date and expected return date and state the general reasons for the leave.
5.09.5	Time spent on non-medical leave of absence shall not be considered in the calculation of the employee’s total seniority except when the total leave of absence in a year, commencing with the date of the first leave of absence in a 12 month period is for three months or less.
5.09.6	The Company may grant leave of absence to those employees who for reasons beyond their control cannot commence work on the date set, but who, nevertheless, wish to return to their jobs as soon as possible. Employees granted such leave of absence shall be placed first on the list for rehiring. Once they have recommenced
8
5.09.7
5.09.8
their employment they shall return to their place on the seniority list as determined by their fall service with the Company in the occupational group or department concerned.
The upgrading of skills and technical courses, whether related to an employee’s classification or not, shall be deemed just and sufficient cause for the granting of a leave of absence without pay to regular employees. Such leave of absence will not exceed one (1) year in length. An employee granted leave of absence under this article shall suffer no loss of seniority for such leave.

/ £
Appointment or election to a Union position shall be considered good and sufficient
cause for granting leave of absence. Employees appointed or elected to a Union p
tion shall suffer no loss of seniority and time spent on leave of absence shall be ’
included in the calculation of total seniority. After one year’s leave of absence the employee must apply for renewal of such leave of absence or seniority rights are cancelled.
5.09.9 A leave of absence will not be granted to probationary employees for reasons other than sickness or pregnancy. Seniority will not accumulate for time spent on sick or maternity leave by probationary employees. Maternity leaves of absence are not to exceed one year, except under special circumstances acceptable to the Company.
5.09.10Upon the Union’s request, the Company will keep employees on the Company payroll while on short term Union business and the Union will reimburse the Company for such costs.
5.10	Resolution of Dispute
Any dispute in regard to Article 5, Seniority, which cannot be settled in discussions between Management and the Shop Steward Committee at the plant or between Headquarters of the Union and the Company, shall be dealt with under the Grievance Procedure herein.

Consideration should be given to advancing the first relief period of sections of a department in the event of an early call-out.
9
6.03	Should overtime be worked a similar rest period shall be allowed two (2) hours after commencement of overtime providing the work to be done cannot be completed in two and one half (2-1/2) hours or less.
6.04	Where there is a continuous shift operation, there shall be no interruption of production and there shall be no remuneration in lieu of relief periods.

When cold storage employees are required to load railway cars or trucks or to do other heavy work outside of cold storage, those who have been so occupied shall be allowed an adequate period to cool off before being required to re-enter low temperature rooms. In determining the length of the cooling off period it is agreed employees should not go into low temperatures when they are still damp with perspiration nor should they be required to enter cold storage if their clothes are wet.
Meal Periods
6.07	No employee shall be required to work over five hours in any one shift without being relieved for meals except where by mutual consent between the employees and the Company management it is found desirable to extend this limitation to process small quantities of fish thus obviating the necessity of returning to work after the meal period.
6.08	Time and duration of meal periods shall be arrived at in consultation between the Shop Steward Committee and local management.
6.09
6.10
When, because of emergency reasons, a meal period less than one-half hour is given, employees shall be paid for such meal periods.

After four (4) hours’ overtime have been worked following a supper break on week-_ days, a one-half hour meal break shall be given without pay deduction if work is to continue after such break. The Company shall provide sandwiches and coffee without charge to those involved.
In no instance shall the work period be extended beyond four (4) hours without a break for the stated meal period with the exception that on the final day of processing in any particular week the meal period may be waived provided the work remaining can be completed in one-half hour or less.
6,11	No meal period shall be set aside as such for Boilerhouse and Refrigeration Plant Engineers who shall work on a straight shift basis.
10
6.12	In order that no interruption will occur while the reduction plant is processing, it is agreed that relief periods and meal periods will be given on a staggered basis with individuals and the crew relieving each other during such periods.
Shift Arrangements:
6.13	If it is the intention of Management at any plant to institute night and/or graveyard shifts, the Management shall post, prior to commencement of processing, a schedule of the various alternative nights and/or graveyard shift arrangements contemplated during the season showing the precise regular hours (i.e. starting time, lunch period, quitting time) of all such contemplated shifts. The method to be used in determining the calendar day of night shifts shall also be posted. The first day of the week shall be Monday and first shift of the day shall be the day shift.
Alternative shift arrangements and application of same shall be as follows:
6.14	A single night shift when the Company decides on instituting a two shift per twenty-four hours operation (i.e. two twelve-hour shifts). Should the second shift commence processing earlier than its appointed starting time, overtime at the multiple rate of time and one-half shall be paid for all hours worked prior to 7:00 p.m. (prior to 6:00 pm. for start-up crew) in accordance with Section 7.02.3.
6.15	An afternoon and graveyard shift when it is decided to have three shifts per twenty-four hours operation.
6.16	The Company may operate on the basis of either an afternoon shift or a graveyard shift in conjunction with a day shift, thus having two shifts per twenty-four hours under the times as stated for the three shifts per twenty-four hour arrangement,
6.17	Where a continuous shift arrangement is scheduled using vertical plate freezers, the Company may operate on two “12-hour” shifts or three “8-hour” shifts.
Where a two “12-hour” shift arrangement is used, two 1/2-hour meal breaks shall be scheduled during each shift without pay. Where meal breaks and rest periods are staggered for each shift by the Company to allow for continuous processing, a penalty equal to the straight time rate shall be paid for such meal breaks, The time taken for meal breaks shall not be included in the calculation of hours worked to determine payment for overtime.
Where a three “8-hour” shift arrangement is used, a 1/2-hour meal break shall be scheduled during each shift and employees shall be paid for same where work continues after such meal break. Meal breaks and rest periods may be staggered for each shift to allow continuous processing.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
22.01	During the life of this Agreement, should any difference arise concerning the interpretation, application, operation, or any alleged violation of this Agreement, including any question as to whether any matter is arbitrable or should any local trouble arise in a plant, there shall be no stoppage of work or strikes on the part of the Union nor shall there be any lockouts on the part of the Company.
22.02	In the event that a grievance or dispute arises, the Shop Steward Committee shall function as the Grievance Committee and the members thereof shall be afforded such time off without pay deduction as may be required to attend the necessary meetings with the Management. At major plants, where there is a large number of Shop Stewards, the Shop Steward Committee shall elect a sub-committee who shall with the Chief Shop Steward and the Shop Steward representing the section in which the grievance has occurred, constitute the Grievance Committee. Nothing herein shall prevent the holding of meetings between the Management and the full Shop Steward Committee if the need arises.
22.03	It is the general interest of both parties to prevent the elevation of minor questions into formal grievances and, as a possible means to this end, employees are urged to raise grievances imagined or otherwise with their foreman as quickly as possible. Employees have the right to go directly to their departmental Shop Steward if they wish to do so.
22.04	The successive steps to be taken in the handling of any grievance until it is settled shall be set forth as follows:
Step One:
The employee shall notify the departmental Shop Steward of any incident which gave rise to the grievance as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the incident which gave rise to the grievance. The Shop Steward shall immediately approach the Departmental Supervisor, Plant Manager or Personnel Manager (which ever is appropriate) to resolve the grievance with or without the employee in attendance.
At this time, the shop steward may request additional time to investigate the grievance. The company will not unreasonably refuse to grant this request.
32
Step Two:
If the grievance remains unresolved at Step One, the departmental Shop Steward shall apprise the plant’s Chief Shop Steward of the details of the grievance. The grievance shall be placed in writing and include details of the alleged violation and reference to the pertinent section(s) of the Agreement. Upon receipt of the written grievance, a meeting shall be arranged between the Grievance Committee and Plant Management in a further attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is one that is complex in nature or involves the operation of a seniority plan, either party may request the assistance of, and where necessary, the attendance of, a representative from their respective Headquarters.
Step Three:
If the grievance remains unresolved, the Union may provide any additional information deemed necessary in writing to the Company. The Company shall place in writing its reasons for rejecting the grievance. When the exchange of written positions is complete, a meeting shall be arranged between representatives from Headquarters of the Union and Headquarters of the Company for a final attempt to settle the grievance. Should this meeting fail to settle the matter in dispute, step four may be invoked.
Step Four:
If the grievance remains unresolved each party shall appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to nominate a third impartial arbitrator who shall act as Chairperson of the Arbitration Committee. Failing to agree upon such an impartial arbitrator within three (3) days of their appointment, either party may request the Honourable Minister of Labour to appoint such an impartial arbitrator. In the case of a grievance or dispute involving interpretation of this Agreement, the majority decision of arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, no decision of such Arbitration Board shall change this agreement in wording or format. Where the parties mutually agree, a single arbitrator may be used.
22,05	Where, after exhausting the first three steps of the grievance procedure of this agreement, a difference remains between the parties relating to callouts, seniority issues, pay issues (individual cases), leaves of absence, vacation issues, bereavement issues, the discipline of an employee (other than discharge), or any other matters the parties may mutually agree to, including any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable, Mr. D. McPhillips or Mr. B. Greyell, in rotation, or a substitute agreed to by both parties, shall at the mutual request of both parties:
a)	Investigate the difference,
b)	Define the issue in the difference, and
33
c)	Make an order in writing, with reasons, for final and binding settlement of the dispute within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of the request, or such extension of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
d)	Notwithstanding (c), where the parties have mutually agreed before the request is submitted, the arbitrator shall make written recommendations to resolve the difference within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of request, and for those twenty (20) days time does not run in respect of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
As the process is intended to be non-legal, the parties will present their own arguments.
All presentations are to be short and concise and are to include a comprehensive opening “statement”. The parties agree to make limited use of authorities and such witnesses as are necessary during the presentation of their cases.
Prior to rendering a decision, the arbitrator may assist the parties in mediating a resolution to the grievance.
All decisions of the arbitrator are to be limited in application to that particular dispute and are without prejudice. These decisions shall have no precedential value and shall not be referred to by either party in any subsequent proceeding.
The parties shall jointly apply to the Minister of Labour for payment of remuneration and expenses of the arbitrator to be made in accordance with S.l 12 of the Industrial Relations Act. Any remuneration and expenses not paid under that section shall be borne equally by the parties to this agreement.
If both parties agree, other matters may be referred to the troubleshooter for either recommendations on how to resolve the dispute or for resolution, depending on the particular dispute.
22.06	If, after ninety (90) calendar days of its instigation, the grievance has not been settled, either party may refer the matter to arbitration or the grievance shall be deemed abandoned. If either party decides to go to arbitration, they must advise the other party of their nominee within ten (10) calendar days of the decision to go to arbitration or the grievance will be deemed abandoned. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent of both parties, it being agreed both parties are interested in and will strive to achieve settlement of all grievances or disputes in the shortest possible time.

Nothing in the foregoing paragraph shall prevent the Company from placing “Inexperienced or Semi-Qualified” fish workers on the cutting tables for short periods to try out at knife work, provided however, “Semi-qualified” and “Qualified” filleters shall not be displaced by such inexperienced employees.
8.07.9	In instances where a semi-qualified filleter has met the Production Standards in all but one species because of the unavailability of such specie, they may be temporarily upgraded to a qualified filleter until such specie is available. If the standards are not met when such specie becomes available, they will revert back to the semi-qualified rate until such time as the standards are met for ail species.

MEMORANDUM
OF UNDERSTANDING
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT
PREAMBLE
The Parties endorse the principle of equal opportunity for employment and that in so far as is practicable, the order of call out to work should be made without regard to gender. The Parties shall therefore undertake the following measures to achieve the principles.
The Parties signatory to the 1994/1995 Shoreworker Master Agreement agree:
1.	The Parties will endeavour to ensure that there shall be no discrimination between employees with respect to seniority or job opportunity, either in fact or by description.
2.	That each plant shall set up a small working committee to review plant procedures with respect to call-outs, job postings, training and related matters. Each plant committee will include representation of the Shop Steward Committee and local plant management and the committee’s task shall be to:
a)	Assess the application of seniority and call-out arrangements to ensure opportunity for employment is equal without regard to gender.
b)	Review problems and complaints as they may arise to discourage the elevation of such complaints to the level of grievances.
c)	Ensure as much as possible that all procedures shall be designed to provide equal opportunity for all employees to all jobs based on seniority, skill, ability, and requirements of the job.
d)	Shall assist in undertaking a review of classifications and rate structure including the base rate plus premium proposal as well as possible implementation of the 1000 hour rate (by increments if necessary) and forward any recommendations to the 1995 negotiations).
e)	Where the seniority lists for a plant department or working group are impediments to the objectives of this memorandum, Headquarters of the Union and the Company shall attempt to agree to revise seniority lists and/or plant seniority plans in consultation and with the approval of the Company and of the Union’s membership directly affected.
57
The Parties will make every effort to ensure the small working committees shall be set up at each plant. The committees shall meet as often as is required, but at least quarterly. Minutes of all meetings shall be forwarded to the headquarters of the Company and the Union as soon as possible following such meetings.
The Parties acknowledge this is an ongoing process and shall endeavour to have the necessary changes made by April IS, 1995 or such other date mutually agreed upon, Any procedures agreed upon prior to this date may be implemented immediately.
If there is a conflict between this memorandum and the collective agreement, the collective agreement shall apply.

MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY STATEMENT
The Company and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers’ Union recognize and support the right of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment, and to that end, are committed to providing a workplace free of sexual harassment and making every reasonable effort to ensure that no employee is subjected to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment shall be defined as “any unwanted sexual comments, looks, suggestions, or physical contact, directed at an employee, which creates an uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, or defensive working environment.”
The offence need not necessarily infer “compliance” as a condition of employment, or the offer and/or maintenance of some benefit in exchange for sexual favours. Sexual advances outside of normal working hours and away from the working environment may be construed as harassment where there is a critical link to employment.
This policy applies to all employees, both in and outside of the bargaining unit, recognizing that the alleged perpetrator or harasser, and the harassed, may represent any level of the organization. Harassment as defined is not limited to male-female, but also includes female-male, male-male and female-female incidents. Harassment need not be accompanied by threats or rewards to be termed such.
Any employee who feels his or her rights under this policy have been violated is encouraged to report the incident to his or her supervisor either verbally or in writing. The employee may be accompanied by another person of their choice during this process if they deem this necessary. The supervisor will advise the Personnel/Human Resources Department of the complaint and all pertinent information.
The Company and the Union shall each appoint a designate to conduct a joint investigation and each designate must have experience and/or training concerning sexual harassment. The joint investigation shall be a fact-finding investigation and the designates shall submit a report, detailing their findings and recommendations, to the Personnel Human Resources Department and Union headquarters as soon as possible after receipt of the complaint. Management will take immediate action if necessary. Nevertheless management shall within thirty (30) days of receiving the report, give such orders as may be necessary.
Nothing shall preclude an employee from involving a Shop Steward outside official or a union official at any stage of the investigation.
60
No complainant shall be transferred to positions against his or her will.
Anyone who is found to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. The amount and form of the discipline will depend upon the circumstances of the harassment, whether the person recognizes the seriousness of his or her conduct and whether the person has previously been disciplined for such conduct,
The Company and the Union agree that extreme care will be taken to ensure that confidentiality will be respected throughout.
Employees should be aware that provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act provide for redress in respect to sexual harassment,
