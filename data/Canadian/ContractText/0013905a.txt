ISSUE #9 -VACATION ROTATION
The following shall, subject to Article XV of the Agreement, outline the general procedures to establish and schedule rotating summer vacations. Any error, omission or
disagreement arising out of the interpretation of the following shall be referred to the Vacation Scheduling Committee. If not resolved by the Committee, the matter may be taken up in accordance with Article 7.07 b).
a)	The purpose of the vacation rotation system is to provide
50% of the employees in a department (Group A) the opportunity to schedule a summer vacation during odd numbered years and the remaining 50% (Group B) the opportunity to schedule summer vacation during even numbered years.
b)	The summer vacation period is defined as the thirteen week period commencing with the first Monday following June 15th of the vacation year. Block ‘I shall include
163
weeks one through five, Block 2 shall include weeks five through nine and Block 3 shall include weeks nine through thirteen, all periods being inclusive. The Company must allow a minimum of 17% of each classification within a department to schedule their vacation within each of the blocks outlined above.
c)	Employees in the group entitled to scheduling priority that vacation year shall, on a seniority basis, select their annual vacation. An employee may elect to split their vacation into a maximum of three periods, none of which shall be less than one week in duration. Only one of these may be scheduled during the summer vacation period and must fall entirely within a block as defined in b) above. If splitting, the employee will only select the second portion after all other employees in his/her group have made a first choice, and select the third portion after all other employees in his/her group have made a second choice. Once this process has been completed the alternate groups will select their annual vacation in the same fashion.
cl) It is recognized that due to workforce adjustments, classifications within departments may, from time to time, not be composed of equal numbers of Group A and Group B employees. In these situations the vacation scheduling
shall be conducted in accordance with c) above.
If during scheduling, there are available summer vacation slots not filled by the priority group, they will be offered to the senior employees from the non-priority group who, during their previous priority year, did not have an opportunity to schedule a summer vacation due to group imbalance.
164
However, in situations where group imbalance is causing a significant problem, the Union may meet yearly with Employee Relations and agree upon a method of
balancing that group.
e)	In a classification where vacations have exceeded 50% in
the summer period, the Company will, where possible,
maintain that level.
f)	Should production requirements necessitate a temporary
shutdown of the Carol Project, vacations will be scheduled during the temporary shutdown.
g)	Employees scheduling three separate vacation periods will not be awarded leaves of absence or changes to theii regularly scheduled shifts during the weeks immediately preceding or following a vacation period of 7 days in
duration.
ISSUE#10-VACATION REPLACEMENT
a)	Should it become necessary to recall less than sixty (60) employees for summer vacation relief, the normal recall
procedure will be followed. The normal job vacancy rules will be suspended and such relief will be achieved in the
order outlined below should it become necessary to recall sixty or more employees for summer vacation relief.
i)	Assignment of qualified employees within the
occupation.
ii)	As determined by the Company, offer the position to
the qualified employees from within other occupations by seniority. Should no employee accept the position, the junior employee will be assigned. An employee so
165
assigned shall receive the rate of pay of his/her regular job or the rate of pay of the job to which
he/she is assigned, whichever is greater.
iii)	The recalling of senior qualified employees laid off from active service with the Company.
iv)	The recall of active qualified employees reduced or displaced from the classifications. The vacancy
created by such a recall will be filled as in iii) above.
v)	The hiring of temporary summer vacation relief not
subject to Articles V and VI of the Collective Agreement where temporary status will end at the
expiration of the summer vacation period.
vi)	The hiring of summer students as per the Collective Agreement, Summer students may also be hired as the temporary vacation relief mentioned in v) above provided they have the necessary qualifications and the work period does not conflict with their college or universary return date.
vii)	In the case of a job vacancy arising during the term of the summer vacation period, employees working as vacation relief will be subject to normal recall
procedures.
b)	The summer vacation relief period shall be defined as the
fifteen (15) week period commencing two weeks before the summer vacation period as outlined in b) of letter Item #9 above, in order to facilitate training and familiarization.
c)	Vacation relief occurring during the period outlined in b)
above shall not be considered as temporary vacancies as set out in Article VI.

ISSUE#11 -SPECIAL ISSUES
This is to confirm the agreement reached during
negotiations of “special issues” pursuant to Article XX.

procedure to monitor these activities:
a)	That each area (Mine, Mill, Pellet Plant, Common Services) would have a management and union representative charged with the responsibility of monitoring Contracting Out issues. The management representative will have the responsibility to review with their counterpart all issues associated with the requirement to bring contractors on site, and the work that is sent outside for repair.
b)	Where further discussion is required, the area manager
will meet with the Contracting Out Committee and the area representatives. Normal application of the Collective Agreement will apply if agreement is not reached at this
level.
c)	On an annual basis (January) the Company will sit down
with the Contracting Out Committee and area representatives and document the work planned for that year that involves Contracting Out. Any additional Contracting Out will be kept at a minimum and will be reviewed in the proposed manner.

appointment.
