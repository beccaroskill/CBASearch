If an employee has a complaint which he cannot resolve with his supervisor, a Steward may attempt to resolve the complaint on behalf of the employee. The employee will have the option of having a Union Shop Steward present at any meeting or hearing involving discipline.
Should a dispute or complaint become a grievance between the Company and employee(s) relating to terms and conditions of employment, or regarding an interpretation or alleged violation of this Agreement, an earnest effort will be made by both parties to settle the grievance through the grievance procedure.

The Company Management will provide an answer in writing within five (5) days.
Failing a satisfactory resolution, the grievance may proceed to Step 4.

SUBJECT: Counselling Interviews
The Company uses a counselling procedure regarding improvements or lapses in employee work performance and recognition of meritorious work performance. Generally, the supervisor involved prepares a Counselling Interview Report (C.I.R.) after such counselling sessions. A counselling session is a matter between the supervisor and the individual employee.
One purpose of counselling is to identify and correct lapses in work performance so that formal disciplinary action will not be necessary. Without such a procedure, it is likely that there would be far more discipline given out for what could be easily correctible work performance situations.
In all cases where a C.I.R. is prepared for filing, the employee will be advised and given the opportunity to read, discuss, and sign (as acknowledged of having read) the C.I.R. with his supervisor. Each employee will be given a copy of the Counselling Interview Report if requested.
The counselling procedure is a positive step in establishing and maintaining good relationships between employees and supervision.
The parties agree to meet to discuss any concerns re: the application of this procedure.

The benefit to employees would be to allow longer duration consecutive days off for example in the Christmas period. The benefit to the Company would be a reduced number of starts/stops to the operations.
All such exchanges would have to be agreed to by the crews affected, the Union and the Company prior to implementation in any given year.
