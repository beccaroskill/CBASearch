2.	Different parts of an operation may be scheduled on different shifts.
3.	This Section shall not change existing operational alternate shift agreements, unless mutually agreed to by both parties. The Employer will not introduce any alternate shift that has the result of replacing an existing operational alternate shift. An existing alternate shift agreement will cease to exist if it has not been operational for one year.
4.	Earned vacations will be scheduled on the same basis as days and hours worked under the alternate shift schedule.
5.	Other Articles of the Collective Agreement, which provide benefits after eight (8) hours, are extended by the amount the regular hours of work have been increased beyond the eight (8) hours per day.
6.	An employee whose rest days are changed by the Company under an established alternate shift schedule shall receive rate and one-half for work performed on his rest days unless a change in rest days results from the application of seniority or has been agreed to between the employee and the Company.
7.	There shall be no premium pay paid to any employee whose rest days are changed because of the implementation of an alternate shift schedule.
8.	When an alternate shift schedule is in effect, hourly-based benefits (LTD, Pension, Education Trust Fund, SHARP), under the Collective Agreement will be administered on the basis of hours paid.
9.	The Company will not change an employee’s work schedule to avoid a statutory holiday.
22
10.	For ten (10) hour shifts, rest periods will be one (1) ten (10) minute break and one (15) minute break plus a one-half (1/2) hour unpaid meal break.
11.	For twelve (12) hour shifts, rest periods will be one (1) ten (10) minute break and one fifteen (15) minute break plus a one-half (1/2) hour paid meal break.
12.	Remembrance Day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day are operational down-days.
13.	Statutory and Floating Holidays will be paid as per the employee’s regular schedule.
14.	Bereavement Leave and Jury Duty shall be paid consistent with Article IX. These days will be paid at the regular daily wage consistent with the work schedule.
15.	Shift Differential shall be paid only for those hours worked outside the recognized dayshift for those employees working the alternate schedule in effect for that crew working in that part of the operation.
16.	The Company will provide notice of two weeks prior to the introduction of and/or the discontinuance of any alternate shift, except where a change in shift schedule is due to other circumstances not in the control of the Company.
17.	For those employees working an alternate shift, the thirty (30) working days referenced in the probationary period section of the Seniority Article will be changed to two hundred and forty (240) working hours.
18.	On a split 4x10 shift, the schedule will delineate the employee’s rest day.
19.	All other provisions of this collective agreement will apply except for those that are modified by this section.
23
b)	Management, Plant Committees and the Local Union shall have the right under the terms of the Collective Agreement to agree upon and implement other schedules which, except for production shifts in manufacturing operations, may include Sundays, without overtime penalty, provided the principle of the forty (40) hour week is maintained over an averaging period. Rate and one-half shall be paid for hours worked on Sunday unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
c)	Any variation(s) to the preceding Sections denoting normal hours of work, other than those addressed in (a) above, shall be implemented only upon completion of the following steps:
i)	Negotiated agreement between the Local Union and Local Management.
ii)	At any point in the negotiation of an Alternate Shift Agreement either Party may request the assistance of West Fraser Corporate Labour Relations and/or the USW District 3 Office in the negotiation of an Alternate Shift Agreement.
iii)	At any point in the negotiation of an Alternate Shift Agreement either Party may request the assistance of a mediator in the negotiation of an Alternate Shift Agreement. The individual selected to act as mediator will be by agreement.
iv)	Majority approval by the employees involved in the proposed variations.
d)	When alternate shift schedules have been implemented in accordance with b) and c) above, the following overtime provisions will apply:

Attention: Gordon Gray Dear Sir:
Re: Agreement on New and Evolving Work
This letter is intended to clarify IWA-Canada's intent with regard to the terms and conditions of the Letter of Understanding in 1994 negotiations on New and Evolving Work.
During discussions on this, the Industry raised concerns that we answer as follows:
1.	It is not the intentions of IWA-Canada to use this
agreement to replace existing logging contractors with IWA members or crews.
2.	It is IWA-Canada's desire to have opportunities to discuss with employers the possibility of either using IWA company crews, or IWA contractors, to perform work under Forest Renewal, but it is not our intent
147
to cause companies to purchase equipment without having the costs of such equipment considered as part of the efficiency and cost effectiveness that IWA agrees to address under the New and Evolving Work agreement.
3.	It is IWA-Canada's intention that discussion
concerning new operations under the agreement may lead to voluntary recognition and certification - it is not our intentions to achieve certification first and enter into discussions later unless certification occurs as a direct result on an IWA organizing drive.
As stated earlier, this letter is to clarify our intentions concerning our agreement. It is not intended to form part of the agreement, as is not arbitrable by either party.
Sincerely,
Harvey Arcand 4th Vice President IWA-Canada
