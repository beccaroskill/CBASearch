Definitions
a)	Sexual Harassment shall be defined as "any unwanted sexual comments, looks, suggestions, or physical contact, directed at an Employee, which creates an uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, or defensive working environment". '
The offence need not necessarily infer "compliance" as a condition of employment, or the offer and/or maintenance of some benefit in exchange for sexual favours. Sexual advances outside of normal working hours and away from the working environment may be construed as harassment where there is a critical link to employment.
b)	Personal harassment is any behaviour by any person in the workplace that is directed at and is offensive to an Employee, endangers an Employee'sjob, undermines the performance of that job or threatens the economic livelihood of the Employee.
^'vrsonal harassment may be defined as repeated, intentional, offensive comments or actions w Jiberately designed to demean an individual or to cause personal humiliation. The definition includes such blatant acts of misuse of power as intimidation, threats, blackmail and coercion. Also included is favouritism of one Employee to the disadvantage of another.
Personal harassment occurs when an individual uses his/her authority or position, with its implicit power, to undermine, sabotage or otherwise interfere with the career of another Employee.
The Employer hereby agrees that the behaviour in a) and b) will not be tolerated and persons conducting such behaviour will be appropriately reprimanded.
Prevention
This policy applies to all Employees, both in and outside of the Bargaining Unit, recognizing that the alleged perpetrator or harasser, and the harassed, may represent any level of the organization. Harassment as defined is not limited to male-female, but also includes female-male, male-male and female-female incidents. Harassment need not be accompanied by threats or rewards to be termed such.
Any Employee who feels their rights under this policy have been violated is encouraged to report the incident to their supervisor either verbally or in writing. The Employee may be accompanied by another person of their choice during this process if they deem this necessary. The supervisor will advise the Personnel/Human Resources Department of the complaint and all pertinent information.
The Employer and the Union shall each appoint a designate to conduct a joint investigation and each designate must have experience and/or training concerning sexual and personal harassment. The joint investigation shall be a fact-finding investigation and the designates shall submit a report, detailing their findings and recommendations, to the Personnel/Human Resources Department and Union headquarters as soon as possible after the receipt of the complaint. Nevertheless management shall within thirty (30) days of receiving the report, give such orders as may be necessary. Management will take immediate action if necessary.
Nothing shall preclude an Employee from involving a Shop Steward, outside official or a Union official at any stage of the investigation.
In cases where sexual or personal harassment may result in the transfer of an Employee it shall be the harasser who is transferred except that the harassee may be transferred with their consent.
Anyone who is found to have sexually or personally harassed another Employee will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. The amount and form of the discipline will depend upon the circumstances of the harassment, whether the person recognizes the seriousness of his or her conduct and whether the person has previously been disciplined for such conduct.
The Employer and the Union agree that extreme care will be taken to ensure that confidentiality will be respected throughout.
Employees should be aware that provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code and the
Canadian Human Rights Act provide for redress in respect to sexual or personal harassment. ARTICLE 9	LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING

ARTICLE 37	HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
37.01	a) The regular work week for all plant Employees covered by this Agreement shall consist of five (5) eight (8) hour days commencing on Monday and ending on Saturday, with Saturday remaining a voluntary work day offered by seniority. The regular working day shall commence not earlier than 6:00 a.m. and shall finish not later than 6:30 p.m. The lunch period shall be one-half hour scheduled between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. Sunday will comprise an additional voluntary work day, offered by seniority, for the duties of unloading, grading and distribution of product for customers which is not subject to further processing. The Company agrees not to abuse this principle and abuse will constitute a grievance proceeding under the Collective Agreement.
b)	When an Employee with seniority has achieved 40 hours work during a regular work week including work on the voluntary Sunday for unloading, grading and distribution, the Employer may "call out” a less senior employee that has not yet achieved 40 hours work for the regular work week, including on the voluntary Sunday for unloading, grading and distribution.
c)	The formula for separating day shift from night shift will be: day shift, 6:00 a.m. -6:30 p.m. or 8:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m., and night shift, 3:00 p.m. - 3:30 a.m. or 8:00 p.m. -8:00 a.m. The Employer may implement staggered scheduling in all departments during these hours based on the following concepts:
1.	Employees will have the opportunity to select their shifts by seniority.
2.	If sufficient Employees do not volunteer for the required shifts, the shifts will be rotated.
d) During times of "Double Shifting" such as during the Roe Herring season, Employees will be given the option of working either "Day Shift" or "Night Shift", with preference of either shift given in order of seniority.
e)	Employees working night shift will be eligible for day shift work requirements, either in their own department or other departments, if and when they have not worked the night shift for one (1) shift, and there will be no requirement for them to work night shift on the second day free from work. i.e.: Employee worked night shift Tuesday from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Wednesday morning; should there be no night shift Wednesday night and there would be no work for this Employee Thursday night either, the Employee would be called in for work, in their own department, for day shift work on Thursday, in line with their seniority.
f)	When a department is scheduled to work overtime hours and more senior Employees are working in departments other than their home departments, the more senior Employees may “bump” the less senior Employee to work the overtime hours. The more senior Employee may only “bump” the less senior employee at the end of a regular scheduled shift, i.e.: Employee A - more seniority - shift ends at 4:30pm (8 hour shift); Employee B - less seniority - shift ends at 6:30pm (8 hour shift); overtime will be worked in department where Employee B is working which is Employee A’s home department, Employee A may “bump” Employee B; however, only at 6:30pm.
g)	When overtime is worked immediately following the regular work day or shift, Fillet Plant Employees assigned to work on skinning, sizing, filleting machines, fresh orders and/or icing fish will complete the task so assigned, providing that the work is not to exceed 1/2 hour overtime for the day, Also, the persons assigned to ice fish will be appointed from the highest seniority person within the tunnel and packing room at the time the work is to commence.
37.02	All other hours except as otherwise provided shall be computed at overtime rates.
37.03	If an Employee works thirty minutes or more through any part of the regular scheduled lunch period he shall receive payment for one-half hour at the multiple rate of time and one-half where straight-time hours are in effect, or at the multiple rate of double time in all other instances, and in addition the Employee shall be granted a lunch period of not less than thirty (30) minutes duration at the earliest possible time.
37.04	Overtime at the multiple rate of time and one-half shall be paid in the following instances:
i)	For the first three (3) hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours, or after 6:30 p.m. or after 8:00 p.m. for day shift, or after 3:30 a.m. for night shift with a one-half hour lunch period on Monday to Saturday.
ii)	For all hours worked prior to 6:00 a.m. or before 8:00 a.m. for day shift, or before
3:00 p.m. for night shift Monday through Saturday.
iii)	For the first three (3) hours worked on Sunday in all departments, with the exception of unloading, grading and distribution.
iv)	For unloading, grading and distribution, items (i) and (ii) shall be interpreted Monday to Sunday.

a)	If an Employee works one hour or less immediately following his regular working day or shift, time worked will be recorded to the next higher quarter hour, and the Employee shall receive payment at the prevailing overtime rate.
b)	In all other instances, the Employer agrees that if an Employee is asked to report for work after the completion of the regular day or shift, he shall receive a minimum of two (2)hours time at the prevailing rate.
37.08	Minimum Overtime Guarantee - Non-regular Working Day (including Statutory Holidays)
If an Employee is asked to report for work on a non-regular Working Day, or on Statutory Holidays, he shall receive:
a)	a minimum of four (4) hours time at the prevailing overtime rate for the first call-out.
b)	a minimum of two (2) hours time at the prevailing overtime rate for the second and each subsequent call-out.
37.09	a) The maximum payment for multiple call-outs will not exceed the total overtime which would have been payable had the Employee worked continuously from the beginning of the first to the end of the last call-out.
b) The foregoing conditions as outlined in Articles 37.06, 37.07 and 37.08 shall not be invoked in cases where there is a circumstance beyond the control of the Employer, such as a general B.C. Hydro failure. Employees shall be paid up to the time the decision to cancel the shift is announced. If the Employees are recalled and a second circumstance occurs within the same shift, Articles 37.06, 37.07 or 37.08 shall apply.
37.10	All Employees shall be granted without pay deduction a rest period of fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the afternoon, such rest periods to be as close to 10:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. as possible.

37.12	In the event overtime work can be completed in two and one-half hours or less immediately following the end of the prior meal break, an Employee who works two and one-half hours following his last meal break, that is, two and one-half hours elapsed time from the end of the prior meal break, shall be deemed to have earned such rest period and shall receive payment for the rest period regardless of whether work is to continue after such rest period.
37.13	If emergency conditions arise which are beyond the control of the Employer, Management may vary the time at which the rest period is usually taken. Any abuse of this Article by either Party shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.

This shall apply from the first day in which the eight (8) hours rest was not received in that particular week.
37.16	Report Time Penalty
A report time penalty of one (1) hour at the straight time rate of an Employee’s regular job, which will not be construed as working time, will be paid in the following instances:
a) if the Employer does not provide Employees with a minimum of 15 minutes verbal notice in advance of the regular quitting time that overtime is to be worked immediately following the one-half or one hour supper break scheduled following the end of the regular work day.
The Employer will post at the commencement of each working day a “tick list” in which the Employee will indicate by seniority their willingness to work overtime at the end of the scheduled work day, should overtime be available. This listing will removed from its

After completion of the probationary period, the three (3) months served shall be included towards completion of the apprenticeship.
A total of four years (48 months) seniority will be acquired during the four years ot apprenticeship training and will be accumulated as follows:
First year 12 months Secondyear 12 months Thirdyear 12 months Fourthyear 12 months
At the successful conclusion of the apprenticeship, only the 48 months of accumulated seniority will be applied. If, at this time, any of the tradespersons already in the department wherein the apprenticeship has taken place do not have 48 months and one day of seniority, then the qualified apprentice will assume the higher seniority rating.
During the four years apprenticeship, plant-wide seniority will be accumulated as usual. This clause does not affect the application of seniority regarding benefits and vacations.
If the period of apprenticeship differs from the four years as described above, the same format will apply.
39.12	The Parties recognize that the basic hourly rates detailed in the foregoing wage schedule include a Northern living allowance of thirty-five (35) cents per hour.

iii)	transmitting the Supervisor's instructions to other Employees,
iv)	assisting the Supervisor in his responsibilities by providing on-the-job detailed training to Employees with respect to the performance of their job duties.

b)	the work to be done will take more than 1 hour to complete during a shift.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Employee may be assigned to perform the work which comes within the scope and classification of any Employee who holds a "Classified Job" unless:

\
ii) the Employer, after complying with the provisions of Articles 33.15,33.16, and 33.17 was unable to contact the Employee.
If the Employee completes the work coming within his scope and classification on any given day, the provision of Article 37.06 shall not be applicable in the event the Employee, if requested by the Employer, refuses to perform the balance of the minimum of four (4) hours of such available work as the Employer may assign. If it is shown the foregoing provisions have not been complied with resulting in the Employee with the "Classified Job" losing pay, the Employer will be liable for payment of such lost earnings.

The crew for this area will be identified via canvas in line with their seniority and capability from the Cannery Seniority List. Those Employees identified as the Cannery Warehouse Crew will be working in the Cannery Warehouse and these Employees will not be subject to bumping by senior Cannery workers employed outside the Cannery Warehouse. When no work is available in the Cannery Warehouse these Employees can work, in order of seniority, elsewhere in the Cannery but under no circumstances will they work in the Cannery and then be assigned to work in the Warehouse during that shift. If work in the Warehouse is to start later in the shift, the crew will be called in order of seniority and
perform sanitizing duties within the Warehouse until the Warehouse functions begin.

1.	Clarifying any ambiguities
2.	Eliminating unnecessary duplication
3.	Consolidating topical issues
4.	Converting gender references to gender neutral language
However, the original signed Collective Agreement shall govern in the resolution of grievances. No. 4 - Ergonomics Assessment
The Union and the Employer agree to establish a Committee to conduct an ergonomics assessment in the Bargaining Unit.
Letter of Intent - Re: Plant Liaison Committee
The Union supports the concept that teamwork must be promoted to enhance productivity gains. Expansion of the role of the Plant Liaison Committee is viewed as a key component to undertaking this initiative. Further analysis respecting this role is outlined in the Collective Agreement.
Areas will be reviewed in which the Plant Liaison Committee could effect change and procedural issues will be developed to allow Union members of the Plant Liaison Committee to defer final resolutions based on Union Executive review.
Letter of Interpretation - Contracting Out
The Employer agrees that fish landed in Prince Rupert is not to be contracted out unless the Plant is unable to handle product because of market or quality considerations. The Employer agrees to notify the Union if and when the situation occurs. The Employer may contract out some electrical, painting and maintenance work if there is no Employee within the bargaining unit with the necessary skills or equipment or it is work that would not normally be performed by members of the bargaining unit. The provision respecting the Employer contracting out work shall not be abused and disputes will be processed through the grievance procedure.
