A reasonable trial shall not exceed six (6) weeks. However, if mutually agreed, this period may be extended. Employees shall receive the applicable job rates provided for in the wage rate schedule for the job orjobs they have been posted or appointed to when they become qualified.
The word qualified, as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted to mean ability to regularly perform the job without instruction or assistance.

give employees ample time to apply. A vacancy exists when the same job function is performedfor twenty (20) hours or more in a payroll week for sixteen (16) consecutive weeks.

In the case that no application is received for a posting, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment of a floater, and the appointee shall obtain posted status upon qualifying in the normal fashion as specified in 4(a). An appointmentto a job shall not constitute one (1) of the two (2)job postings per calendar year. Transfers to jobs will be made within ten (10) working days from the date the posting was awarded with the proviso that wherever this proves impossible, suitable arrangements will be arrived at after consultation with the Union. When a posted employee is laid off for longer than four (4) weeks, they will be deemed to have lost their postedjob and shall return upon recall to any work available as a floater. Where an employee loses their posting due to a layoff or through theirjob being discontinued as set out in Article 8-7(a), they shall be allowed an additional posting to compensatethem for the posting lost through such layoff or job discontinuance.

After an absence of five (5) years, seniority shall cease unless the employee remains on temporary Saskatchewan Workers Compensation Benefits or the Company Long Term Disability Plan. As well, should the employee find other employment, seniority will cease immediately.

(3)	Those with Plant seniority.
In the latter case, seniority shall be the determining factor provided the senior operator, after a reasonable time to qualify, is capable of doing the work performed by an employee with less seniority, except where immediate essential qualifications are necessary for the efficient operation of the Plant. In such cases, the Company will discuss the matter with the Union. Any disagreement will be subject to the Grievance Procedure beginning at the Third Step.
11-8(a) Recall Procedure
In cases of increases in the working force, rehiring shall be in reverse order to that of layoffs. The Company shall advise the Union two (2) days in advance when a layoff is about to take place and shall give the Union a list of employees to be laid off or rehired. In cases where it is necessary to secure workers in less time than the required notice, the Company, if unable to make contact with the senior eligible employee, may recall the next senior employee and so on down the list until the vacancies are filled. However, should the senior employee subsequently report within the required time, they shall be given work for which

11-8(c) Temporary Recall
Employeeswith seniority may be temporarily recalledfor not less than three (3) working days and not more than ten (10) working days as casual help with no layoff notice given, provided that this shall not be used as discriminationto any employee and provided that the employee and the Union are informed that such work is of a temporary nature. When the ten (10) days are worked consecutively or have accumulated, the layoff notice shall apply.

(b)	Junior qualified posted employees in the department.
47
An employee who, because of previous experience in a department, is temporarily transferred to that department on a repetitive basis may register their objections to such repetitive transfers in which case the Company will, subject to seniority, make a reasonable effort to obtain a replacement who can perform the work satisfactorily or to train another employee who possesses suitable qualifications and can qualify reasonably quickly for such temporary transfers.

In the application of rates or adjustments cf bracket values, such an employee will not be paid a rate greater than the rate paid them at the time of the above mentioned posting except for reasons of a general wage increase after the date of transfer.

The Company will include a template with the sick form. Employees unclear about what information is required in a certain circumstance should contact Human Resources in advance of seeing their Doctor.
If the employee provides the proper information, however, the Company requires further clarification, the cost, if any, of the subsequent note will be paid by the Company. This will include situations where there is a disagreement between the employee's Doctor and the Insurance carrier when establishing the length of time the employee will be initially off work.
In circumstances where a Doctor is unable to diagnose an employee, the Company will work with the employee to ensure any cost of providing the necessary medical information does not create an undue hardship for the employee.
