APPENDIX G
September 16, 1993
United Steelworkers of America Local 6166 19 Elizabeth Drive Thompson, Manitoba R8N 187
Dear Sirs:
This will confirm our understanding with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan fManitoba Division).
For any calendar quarter for which Inco Limited reports positive consolidated net earnings and positive Primary Metals operating earnings, in both cases after talking Into account any and ail applicable cost of living allowance payments (Manitoba Division and Ontario Division), a profit sharing payment, if applicable, will be made to eligible employees if both earnings amounts would remain positive after deducting the cost of all payments to be made to individuals based on the results of that quarter pursuant to,:

a)
#•
any nickel price bonus or profit sharing plans in effect for individuals covered by collective bargaining agreements ana employed by Inco Limited in the Ontario Division;
b) the Inco Limited employee profit sharing plan for eligible employees introduced on June 128,1991, or any successor plan, and
Page 129
c) the Profit Sharing Plan (Manitoba Division).
With respect to any quarter for which the aggregate cost, in whole or in part, of the plans set out above would result in negative Primary Metals operating earnings or negative consolidated net earnings, no payment will be made with respect to this plan.
In the case of the Profit Sharing Plan (Manitoba Division), the cost of payments under that plan shall be determined on the basis of the formula described below prior to deducting the! costs of payments made or to be made under the plans set out in a), b) and c) above.
The profit sharing payment for an employee shall be determined by multiplying the product of the Average Hourly Base Rate for the quarter times the total number of hours worked by the employee in the quarter by .00055 (point zero five five percent) for each U.S. one million dollars (U.S. $1,000,000), or part thereof, of the Primary Metals operating earnings for the quarter.
The Company shall determine the Average Hourly Base Rate for the quarter by dividing the total of all base hourly wages set out in Schedule "B” of the collective bargaining agreement paid to employees for hours worked during the quarter by the total number of hours worked by employees in the quarter.
The Plan provides for varying percentages of payments based on Primary Metals operating earnings. For example, ifPrimary Metals quarterly operating earnings amounted to U.S. $50 million and the Average Hourly Base Rate for the quarterwas $22, an eligible employee would receive 2.75% of $22, or 60.5 cents for each hour worked by the employee in the quarter. If the employee
Page 130
worked 400 hours In the quarter, the profit sharing payment would be $242.
The maximum profit sharing payment to an employee is 25% of the Average Hourly Base Rate for the quarter times the total hours worked by the employee in the quarter.
Attached is a chart which lists examples of the percentages to be paid as profit sharing In relation to varying levels off positive quarterly Primary Metals operating earnings.
Yours truly,
INCO LIMITED,
MANITOBA DIVISION J.M. Fulton

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement between us respecting summer employment of students.
Every effort will be made to give preference to students having a parent who is an employee.
There are instances where the Company is obliged to give special opportunity to some students for other reasons. One example of this might be a student holding a scholarship under the Inco Scholarship Program for Children of Employees, Another example would be compassion&e grounds. There may be other special instances,
However, subject to the special cases that arise, Company policywill continue to be the giving of preference to students whose parent is an employee.
Notwithstanding the definition “probationary employee” in the Collective Agreement, every student shall be deemed to be a “probationary employee" subject to termination at any time prior to the month of October, without such termination being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.

responsibility and involvement in the workplace!.
c)	To further promote a safer, less stressful, less hazardous workplace environment.
d)	To continue to promote a workplace
environment that is free of discrimination and harassment.
e)	To reduce costs.
f)	To provide quality products to our customers at all times.
g)	To provide a forum for joint consultation which increases the influence employees have In the workplace.
Recognizing that employees have concerns regarding employment security, when work reorganization could result in workforce reduction, we willjointly examine the impact on employees of such reorganization and alternatives to layoff prior to implementation of such layoff.
When layoff becomes unavoidable, it is agreed that alternatives shall be considered to reduce the impact of the needed workforce adjustment. In such circumstances, the Company and the Union shall give consideration to the application of work sharing.
Page 171
The role of the local Union in the process of developing and implementing work reorganization programs will be:
(I) to encourage employees to get involved to help find solutions to enable the planned reorganization,
(ii)	to influence the decisions which affect employees,
(iii)	to advise the Company of employees’ concerns surrounding the planned reorganization, and
(iv)	to actively participate in developing solutions to problems that arise.
With respect to decisions which are made about work reorganization programs, it shall be the local Union’s role to act in a consultative capacity and to express views for the purpose of having influence upon the decisions to be made. The views expressed by the Union will be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in Its decision making process.
Changes which may result from work reorganization programs will in no way replace, modify ordiminish any of the existing provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, unless such changes are mutually agreed.
A joint Union/Management committee shall be \ established with tne responsibility to make v recommendations regarding the development and implementation of work reorganization programs.
Page172
All work reorganization programs which will result in workforce adjustment or layoff, will be referred to the Committee. Other matters, as mutually agreed, may also be referred to the Committee.
This Committee shall be governed by the following terms of reference:
1.	The committee will be known as the Cooperative Problem Solving Committee (CPS Committee).
2.	The CPS Committee will consist of up to seven (7) members of the bargaining unit selected by the Local Union President, including the Local Union President, and up to seven (7) representatives of the Company selected by the Company, including the Manager of Employee Relations. A representative of the United Steelworkers of America may also attend CPS Committee meetings and otherwise be involved in matters dealt with by the CPS Committee. It is recognized that it is most desirable thattheCPS Committee initially be comprised of the Negotiating Committees for the 191)3 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	The CPS Committee will meet at least once in each month or more frequently if mutually agreed. The CPS Committee meetings will be co-chaired by the Local Union President and the Manager of Employee Relations.
Page 173
4.	A member ofthe CPS Committee, appointed, by the Local Union President following consultation with the Manager of Employee Relations and paid by the Company, will act in the capacity of Facilitator and Resource Person. The individual appointed to this position will be paid at Job class twenty (20) and upon completion of his term, will return to his regular job which will have been considered a Temporary Vacancy for the period of his absence.
5.	The duties of the individual appointed to this position will include but not be limited to the following:
i)	facilitating CPS Committee meetings in conjunction with the Company facilitator;
ii)	liaising with other joint committees;
iii)	reviewing material provided by the Company concerning a work to be contracted out;
iv)	developing and maintaining a working relationship with Department Heads;
v)	carrying out special projects and tasks as may be assigned from time to time by the CPS Committee.
6.	It is recognized that replacement of CPS Committee members will from time to time be necessary. In order to minimize the impact on the functioning of the CPS Committee, the parties will endeavour to keep to a minimum
Pag«174
the number of individuals replaced on the CPS Committee at any given time.
