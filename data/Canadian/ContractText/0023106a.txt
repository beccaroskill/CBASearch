8.01	a) The Company and the Union recognize that job opportunity and job security should increase with an employee's length of service with the Company. In all cases of promotion, demotion, training, layoff or recall, the senior qualified employee shall be entitled to preference except where otherwise provided herein.

17
e)	In the event of a demotion caused by layoff, an employee with more than three years service in the job he was demoted from will retain his rate of pay on a "red circled" basis for a period of one year. No wage increases shall apply to the "red circled" rate.
If a demoted employee does not qualify for maintenance of rate because of his service, as above, he will qualify for the rate of any lower job he spent the most time at during the previous three (3) years.
Apprentices who are demoted will qualify for the rate for the job they held for three (3) years prior to entering the apprenticeship program. The maintenance of rate, as per this paragraph, will be for one year on a "red circled" basis as above.
An employee who is laid off on a workforce reduction who meets the above qualifying criteria and is recalled will also be paid on a "red circled" basis from the time of recall to a maximum of one year from the original date of lay-off.
8.02	a) "Seniority" as used in this Agreement shall be defined as:
General (or Company) - the length of continuous service with the Company since the employee's date of hiring, except as expressly provided herein.
18
Departmental - the total length of time an employee with continuous service has spent in a department.

a)	he voluntarily quits, or
b)	he is discharged, or
c)	he is laid off for a period equal to his seniority or twenty-four (24) months whichever is lesser, (minimum of twelve (12) months), or
d)	he fails to return to work within the required time after lay-off, unless he gives a reason satisfactory to the Company for such failure to return to work, or
e)	he fails to return to work immediately upon completion of an approved leave of absence, unless he gives a reason satisfactory to the Company for such failure to return to work, or
f)	he is absent without leave for three (3) consecutive working days. His absence will be considered as a voluntary separation or "quit without notice".
19
8.04	In any reduction of work force or recalling after lay-off (except lay-offs of six (6) days or less) the Company shall consider the following two (2) factors in determining which employee or employees shall be laid off or recalled:
a)	The Company Seniority of each employee concerned;
b)	The qualifications of each employee concerned to meet the normal requirements of the job.
A reduction in the number ol employees in a classification in a Department is deemed to be a workforce reduction arid the process outlined in 8.05 will be followed for employees affected by such a reduction.
8.05	a) In any reduction of the workforce, for more than six days, employees with the least Company seniority will be laid off, except that the Company will not be required to retain an employee because of his Company seniority unless such employee possesses the
necessary qualifications to perform, arid is willing to perform the work of the employee who would otherwise be laid off in accordance with this provision.
An employee who was assigned to his job in accordance with the provisions of Article 17.01 shall not be subject to the bumping provisions in this Article except where the employee does not have enough Company Seniority to remain on site. This protection
20
only applies if the employee's job still remains following the reduction.
b)	Within each Department affected by the reduction, the Company will determine the specific positions required, and employees will be reclassified to available positions within their Department on the basis of qualifications and Company seniority.
c)	If there are vacancies available in departments due to the reduction of employees by Company seniority, employees who have been unable to remain in their respective Departments will be assigned to fill such other vacancies on the basis of qualifications and Company seniority, except that a journeyman may displace junior employees in the same trade in another department providing they are qualified and meet the full requirements of the position.
d)	The reasonable trial or training period
as referred to in Article 8.01 (d), does not apply in the case of layoff or recall. However, a senior employee will be entitled to a 3-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. The Company may refuse to grant the 3-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. It is understood the Company may refuse to grant the 3-day familiarization period if it can demonstrate that the employee	could not	meet the
requirements of the job even if a 3-day familiarization period were granted. An employee who fails to meet the requirements
21
of the job during the 3-day familiarization period in a job above Job Class 8 will be eligible to displace a junior employee in a position at or below Job Class 8 (excluding Apprenticeship jobs) or Wagonmaster, Dispatch and Chute Operators, on the basis of Company seniority.
e)	Subject to Article 17.01, when it is determined that a subsequent permanent vacancy is to be filled, qualified employees who have been displaced from the job in question, as a result of a workforce reduction, within the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date the vacancy is being filled and who are working on site on a permanent basis, will be offered the vacancy on the basis of Company Seniority.
If the employee declines the vacancy, he will lose any options provided by this clause and the Company will not be required to offer him any future vacancies in that job classification. If the employee was being paid at a red-circled rate, that will cease at the time of refusal.
If the vacancy cannot be filled as above, the provisions of Articles 0.13 and 8.18 will bo followed and, where applicable, Article 0.05
f)	Employees will be recalled from layoff on the basis of their Company seniority and
22
ability to meet the qualifications of the job for which they are being recalled.
g)	Except for jobs of a temporary or emergency nature, an employee being recalled will be sent notice by registered mail to the employee's last known address. It is the responsibility of any employee to notify the Company of any change in postal address. The employee shall notify the Company of his intention to return to work within five (5) days and shall return to work within ten (10) days from the mailing of such notice, or on the specified date of recall, if later. The employee shall lose the right of such recall on the failure to comply with these conditions.
h)	An employee may be granted an additional ten (10) days to return to work for reasons satisfactory to the Company. If he fails to return at the end of the ten (10) day extension, the employee shall lose the right of recall. This period will be extended if disability prevents immediate return if the employee notifies the Company of the disability within the ten day period.
i)	However, an employee recalled to a temporary assignment may refuse recall without loss of subsequent recall rights.
j)	An employee who returns to work following recall and is subsequently laid off will again qualify under the provisions of Article 8.03 (c).
23
k)	If at the time of a layoff the Company gives an employee a definite date in writing upon which he is to return to work, further notice of recall will not be required and tho employee shall lose the right of such recall, subject to Article 8.05 (g), if he fails to return on the date specified.
l)	An employee may elect layoff in lieu of a demotion to a lower job classification without loss of subsequent recall rights.
m)	An employee with five or more year: of Company Seniority who is laid off as a result of technological change, as defined by tho Trade Union Act, 1994, shall receive a severance payment of one week's pay at the employee’s base wage at tho time of lay-off, for each complete year of accumulated service prior to this lay-off, up to a maximum of thirteen (13) week's pay. in the event an employee who received a severance payment as provided above, is recalled within the period covered by the payment (maximum of thirteen (13) weeks), he shall repay a prorata amount of the severance payment based upon the date of recall. The parties agree that for the purpose of this agreement, the term “significant numbers" as referred to in the Trade Union Act shall mean one or more persons, and as such any provisions outlined in this agreement or in the Trade Union Act shall apply should a technological change affect one or more employees.
24
An employee who is demoted due to a technological change will maintain his base rate for a maximum of eighteen calendar months from the original date of demotion providing he has three years of service with the Company. An employee who is maintaining his rate in accordance with this provision shall be required to accept any higher paying permanent vacancy in the department he was demoted from providing he has the seniority and qualifications to fill that classification. Failure to do so will result in the loss of these rate maintenance provisions.
8.06	Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen days will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than:
- one week's notice if the employee's period of employment is less than three years;
-	three week's notice if the employee's period of employment is three years or more but less than five years;
-	five weeks' notice if the employee's period of
employment is five or more years.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six days or less, or if an employee is recalled for a specified, limited period of work.
25
The Company will pay the employee's base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
8.07	TRANSFERS:	If the transfer of an
employee from one department to another is required by the Company for the efficient conduct of operations, the employee, upon
completion of three (3) months from the date of his transfer, shall elect:
a)	to remain in the department to which he was transferred and his departmental seniority shall be from the date of his transfer, or
b)	to return to the department from which he was transferred, and his departmental seniority shall include the departmental seniority acquired in the department to which he was transferred.
The Company will place such employee in a job classification equal to, or higher than, the job from which he was originally transferred.
8.08	a) If the transfer of an employee from one department to another is required by the Company because of considerations of health, his departmental seniority in such other department shall be deemed to be equal to his departmental seniority in the department from which he was transferred.
26

8.11	If the senior employee in a job classification or assignment refuses to avail himself of training opportunities or refuses a promotion, the Company may assign a less senior employee in that job classification or assignment to another shift or assignment consistent with his departmental seniority and qualifications if required to allow for promotional opportunities for other employees.

It is understood that temporary vacancies which occur during the course of a shift may not always be filled by the senior qualified employee.
When filling temporary vacancies, the Company will determine in a fair and equitable manner the qualifications of an employee to fill the particular vacancy which exists.

COMPRESSED WORK WEEK (Production employees and others on rotating 12 hour schedules)
Addendum to the Collective Bargaining Agreement effective April 7, 1992, concluded between Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., Allan Division, hereinafter called the "Company" and the United Steelworkers of America, C.L.C., for itself and on behalf of its Local 7689, hereinafter called the "Union".
The terms of the cited Collective Bargaining Agreement are the applicable terms to be applied except as modified herein.
This addendum applies only to those employees working a twelve (12) hour Compressed Work Week Schedule.
This Addendum shall continue in effect, unless terminated by either party upon written notice. In the event this addendum is terminated, there will be a thirty (30) day cancellation provision with no cost to the Company for discontinuing the schedule and returning to the original schedule.
It is the intent that the Company does not incur any additional costs under the provisions of this addendum that would normally be incurred under the previous eight (8) hour work schedule. The parties agree that the provisions in this agreement are more favourable than related provisions of the Labour Standards Act.
The following is agreed to as a part of the negotiating process between the Union and the 88
Company and reflects a new and unique approach
to the hours cf work.
ARTICLE XII - VACATIONS WITH PAY
12.08 If a public holiday as designated in Article XIII occurs during an employee's vacation period, he shall receive an additional working day of vacation and shall be paid for the public holiday in accordance with Article 13.06 of this addendum,
ARTICLE XIII - PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
13.01 c) Each Public Holiday will be observed as commencing at 8:00 a.m. the calendar day of the Public Holiday, and ending 8:00 a.m. the calendar day following the Public Holiday. Article 13.04 does not apply to employees covered by this agreement.
13.06 An employee who was not scheduled to work and does not work on any or all Public Holidays, shall be entitled to eight (8) hours pay at his regular basic wage, provided that he has worked his last scheduled shift prior to the public holiday and his first scheduled shift after the public holiday.
However, the Company may give an employee another day off without pay to shorten the hours of work in the pay period and in such case his public holiday pay will be the greater of his basic wage times eight (8) hours or times the hours he was scheduled to work on the other day off. Such other day off will be consecutive with the employee's other scheduled days off in the pay period.
89
ARTICLE XIV ■ HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
14.03	(a) Averaging periods commence at 8:00
a.m. on a Sunday.
The work week for the purposes of averaging hours shall be based on an average of forty (40) hours per week over the averaging period.
14.11 The daily lunch period for any employee who is on a continuous shift schedule shall be thirty (30) minutes after approximately four (4) consecutive hours of work and thirty (30) minutes after an additional approximate four
(4)	hours of work, which will be paid as though the employee worked, during which time he shall continue all necessary supervision cf machinery and maintenance of service.
14.15 Overtime will be voluntary, except when an employee cannot be relieved or in the event of an emergency. Due to the length of shifts under this Addendum, overtime will remain voluntary provided there are adequate numbers of qualified employees who serve notice to the company cf their availability to work in case of an operational necessity in any shift. If the requirement of voluntary employees are not met, it is understood and agreed, for the continuance cf this Addendum, a compulsory rotation selection cf employees for such operational necessities shall be mandatory.
90
APPENDIX B- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
B1.04	(a) Apprenticed employees, while taking
an off-site training course, will be paid the equivalent of their regular salaries (basic straight time rated based on eight (8) hours per day with no premium pay), less any training allowance monies received from Government sources.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
between
PCS POTASH-ALLAN and
UNITED STEELWORKERS CF AMERICA, C.L.C. DISTRICT3, LOCAL 7689
This Memorandum of Agreement is designed for the purpose of re-affirming the basic principles of the Cooperative Wage Study Program (referred to as C.W.S.). This re-affirmation is necessary because of recent trends within the workforce that employees feel that C. IV. S. is to be used as a detailed job description, used to determine one's day-to-dayjob duties.
The following principles are statements cited from the Job Wescription and Classification Manual published in August 1971 by the United Steelworkers of America - AFL - C10 CLC:
A. Significant details concerning the function and requirements of each job shall be set forth in aj ob description which shall:
Provide a means of identifying the job under consideration, the processes, equipment and products with which it is concerned, and shall serve only as a basis from which to classify the job.
99
Reflect the general details considered necessary to describe the principal functions of the job Identified arid shall not be construed as a detailed description of all the work requirements that may be Inherent In thejob.
Provide, together with the reasons for the classification, the basis from which to judge changes in the job content which may result from new or changed conditions when such are established from time to time.
B. The job classification of a job shall serve only to assign the job into a proper job class for application of the standard hourly wage scale.
In summary, these principles outlined are designed solely for the purposes of determining wage rates and not to provide any basis for determining the day-to-day job activities of any individual employee. Referring to the term "inherent" as outlined on the bottom of each job description, this term is defined as: Job duties that have been common to a particular job prior to the implementation of C.W.S., whether they were specifically addressed In the job description or not, shall continue to be part of that particular job.
