Subject to the express limitations of the agreement the Union acknowledges that it is the exclusive function of the Company to hire, promote, demote, classify, transfer and suspend employees, and also the right of the Company to discipline or discharge any employee for just cause, provided that a claim by an employee, who has acquired seniority, that he has been discharged or disciplined without just cause may be the subject of a grievance and dealt with as hereinafter provided.

The Company will provide 7 days advance notice to the Union of changes to Plant Rules in writing prior to their implementation except with respect to safety and legal issues.
Without limiting the generality of the forgoing provisions, it is expressly understood and agreed that breach of any of the plant rules, or of any of the provisions of the agreement may be deemed to be sufficient cause for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal of an employee.
ARTICLE 5
Union Grievance Committee
The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise select, a plant Committee, otherwise known as the Union Committee, which shall be composed of not more than nine stewards. All stewards, shall be regular employees of the Company actually at work who have completed their probationary period. The
Company will recognize and deal with the said committee as hereinafter set forth.

The name of each of the stewards who are members of the Union committee from time to time selected, shall be given to the Company in writing and the Company shall not be required to recognize any such steward until it has been notified in writing by the Union of the name of the same.
The Company undertakes to instruct all members of its supervisory staff to co-operate with the stewards and Union Officers in the carrying out of the terms and requirements of this agreement.
The Union undertakes to secure from its officers, stewards and members their cooperation with the Company and with all persons representing the Company in a supervisory capacity, in the carrying out of the terms and requirements of this agreement.
The right of stewards to leave their work without loss of pay to investigate or adjust grievances is granted on the following conditions:
An employee may have the right to have a Steward present when a recorded verbal discipline or a written discipline is being presented to the employee.
A steward or his/her designee will request the permission of his/her Supervisor to leave his work station to participate in the processing and investigation of grievances after the completion of the grievance procedure as outlined in 6.01 and/or preliminary meetings with management. Such permission will not be unreasonably withheld. Compensation for such time off shall be at the employees then current rate of pay. Except in the case of a discharged employee or in a suspension over one week which procedure is outlined in Section 9.03, employees having a grievance shall not leave their work station to discuss it with the steward or his designee during working hours without permission of the Supervisor.
The Company reserves the right to limit such time if it deems the time so taken to be excessive.
The Company agrees that stewards shall be compensated for such time off from their regular working hours as necessary to investigate grievances. The Company further agrees that Union stewards and the Union President or his/her designee shall be compensated for such time off from their regular working hours as is necessary to investigate and attend meetings under the grievance procedure. In all cases compensation shall be at the employee’s then current rate of pay.
There shall be no coercion, restraint, or discrimination by the employer or any of its agents, against any members of the Union because of membership therein, or the carrying on of any proper Union activity.

ARTICLE 6 Grievance Procedure
It is the intention of the parties to settle as equitably and as quickly as possible, any grievance which might arise related to a violation of this agreement. A formal grievance shall not be filed until the employee has presented his/her complaint to his/her immediate Supervisor verbally within 3 working days after the employee might reasonably have become aware of circumstances giving rise to such grievance. The Supervisor will render his/her decision on the complaint within 3 working days.
The employee may consult with the available steward following the procedure outlined in 6.01 above providing the employee first obtains his/her Supervisor’s permission.
The aggrieved employee shall present his/her written grievance to his/her immediate supervisor at which time the employee shall have the assistance of a steward or an officer of the Union.
The aggrieved employee shall present his/her written grievance to his/her immediate supervisor at which time the employee shall have the assistance of a steward or an officer of the Union. The Supervisor shall render his/her disposition to the grievance in writing within three working days. If a settlement satisfactory to the employee is not reached, the employee may then proceed to the next Step of the grievance procedure any time within three working days thereafter.
The aggrieved employee shall present his/her written grievance to the Human Resources Manager and at that time the steward shall be present. The Human Resources Manager’s decision shall be rendered in writing, within three working days of such meeting, and failing satisfactory settlement, the employee may proceed to the next Step within three working days thereafter.

The Supervisor will respond verbally to the grievance within one working day and failing satisfactory resolution of the grievance it may be brought forward in writing at Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure within three working days after the Supervisor has rendered his/her decision.

Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union as to the interpretation or alleged violation of the provisions of this agreement affecting the Union as such, the Union President or designee shall have the right to bring forward to the Plant Manager or his/her designee any such complaint. If such complaint is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of the conferring parties, it may be treated as a Third Step grievance and referred to arbitration in the same way as the grievance of an employee.

ARTICLE 7
Arbitration

ARTICLE 8
Management Grievances
It is understood that the management may bring forward to the Union any complaint with respect to the conduct of the Union, its Officers or stewards and that, if such complaint by the management is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of the conferring parties, it may be treated as a grievance of an employee. All preliminary steps of the grievance procedure prior to step 3 will be omitted in such case.
ARTICLE 9
Suspensions over One Week or Dismissals
In the event that an employee who has attained seniority is dismissed from employment, or suspended from employment for more than one week, and the employee alleges that the dismissal or suspension was improper, the case may be taken up as a grievance as outlined in the following clause. A suspension of less than one week may be taken up through the normal grievance procedure.
A claim by an employee, who has attained seniority, that he/she has been unjustly dismissed or suspended for over one week from his/her employment shall be treated as a grievance if a written statement of such grievance is lodged with the Plant Manager or his/her designee within three working days after the employee ceases to work for the Company. All preliminary steps of the grievance procedure prior to Step 3 will be omitted in such case. All such cases shall be taken up within three working days and replied to within seven working days of the date the employee is notified in writing of his/her dismissal or suspension over one week, except where a case is taken to arbitration.

If the matter is not settled through the grievance procedure and is taken to arbitration, and it is finally determined by a Board of Arbitration that dismissal or suspension over one week was too severe a penalty, the employee shall be reinstated, either with or
without compensation for time lost, or by any other arrangement which the Board of Arbitration finds just and equitable.

In view of the orderly procedures established by this agreement for the settling of disputes and the handling of grievances, the Union agrees that during the life of this agreement, it will not sanction, counsel, procure or encourage any picketing, slowdown or stoppage of work, either complete or partial, and the Company agrees that there will be no lockout.
The Company shall have the right to dismiss or otherwise discipline employees who take part in or instigate any illegal strike, picketing, stoppage or slowdown, but a claim of unjust dismissal or treatment may be the subject of a grievance and dealt with as provided in Article 6 above.
Should the Union claim that a cessation of work constitutes a lockout, it may take the matter up with the Company at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 11
Wages
During the term of this agreement, the Company and the Union agree that all payments of wages will be made in accordance with the wage rates set forth in Schedule “A” hereto which is hereby made a part of this agreement.
ARTICLE 12
Hours of Work and Overtime
The following paragraphs and sections are intended to define the normal working hours of work and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week, or of days of work per week.
The standard work week shall consist of forty hours per week, and eight hours per day. The duration of each shift is to be eight (8) hours including a one half hour eating period.
An overtime rate of time and one-half of the employee’s basic rate will be paid for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any normal work day.
Time and one-half will be paid for all work performed on a Saturday except for work on a Saturday that is performed as a part of a shift commencing Friday night or a lieu day at straight time which may be worked at the mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
12.03(c)
12.03(d)
12.03(e)
12.03(f)
12.04
12.05(a)
12.05(b)
12.05(c)
12.06(a)
Except as outlined in 12.03(b) double time will be paid for all work performed on a Saturday in excess of an 8 hour shift, provided that the 8 hour shift is not part of the employees’ regular scheduled work week.
All work performed on a Sunday will be paid for at double the employee’s basic rate except for shift work commencing Sunday night which is considered as a Monday shift.
An employee who has completed his/her regular shift and leaves the premises and is then recalled to work, shall receive a minimum of four hours pay at the employee’s regular straight time rate or one and one half times the employee’s rate for hours actually worked, whichever is the greater. Employees called in to work on Sunday shall receive a minimum of 4 hours pay at the employee’s regular hourly rate or double the employee’s regular hourly rate whichever is the greater.
None of the foregoing Section 12.03 concerns the special provisions for premium payment on continuous shift operations as these payments are described in Section 12.07.
When work on a Saturday or Sunday is not part of a regularly scheduled shift, the Company shall endeavour to post the schedule 40 clock hours in advance of the commencement of such work. Otherwise such overtime work shall be voluntary.
The Company will attempt to provide an employee two hours of notice for overtime at the end of a shift. Should the Company fail to provide such notice, the working of such overtime will be voluntary.
When overtime is required to be worked through the failure of a shiftmate to appear on time for an employee’s shift, the Company will require the affected employee to work up to the first four hours of the extra shift only. Employees will not leave their work station until they are relieved by another employee, or obtain permission to do so from their Supervisor. The two hour notice period referred to in 12.05(a) does not apply to the circumstances stated in this section. The Supervisor will, whenever possible, endeavour to obtain another qualified replacement as per the overtime selection guidelines. Shiftmate is the person who has the lowest overtime hours in the particular classification on shift.
Whenever two hours or more of overtime are being worked consecutively beyond the first eight hours of normal work, a fifteen minute rest period will be provided before the overtime commences. This constitutes the required meal break which must be provided at such intervals so that no employee works longer than 5 consecutive hours without an eating period. This will be the only rest period provided if the overtime work is less than four hours. If four hours or more of overtime is worked the provisions of Section 20.01(a) apply in addition to this Section.
All overtime including weekend overtime will be evenly distributed as circumstances will permit in the spirit of the overtime distribution guidelines.
When overtime is required, the supervisor will start by asking the employee with the lowest overtime hours charged and moving up the charging list in each of the following:
(1st) the permanent posted employee in the job and successful applicants of permanent and temporary job postings retain overtime rights of their previous job classification until they become qualified and are entitled to overtime in their new job classification..
(2nd) the qualified employee in the department.
(3rd) the qualified employees temporarily transferred into the department.
(4th) qualified employees working outside the department.
(5th) qualified probationary employees will be offered overtime last.
At steps 2 and 4, overtime will be distributed first to people qualified by having been permanently posted for six (6) weeks or more and then to those having filled the requirements as per the training master. After exhausting all the steps of 12.06(a) and no one was found to work the overtime, the “permanent posted” person with the lowest overtime charged will be required to work. Employees eligible to be asked for overtime, but not available for overtime, will be charged the actual number of hours, if entitled under equal distribution, in their job classification during the period. The only exceptions would be when an employee is on vacation entitlement or union business.
When weekend overtime is required, an Overtime Volunteer List will be used. Volunteers will be selected following the steps listed above. Weekend Overtime Volunteer List Guidelines will be followed.
12.06(b) When an employee moves from one job classification to another, the employee will enter with the average between high and low overtime hours in that classification for the purpose of equal distribution of overtime.
12.06(c) The Company will not schedule more than 12 consecutive hours of work to an employee.
12.06(d) The Company agrees that overtime will be equally distributed and records kept of the distribution for discussion as necessary with the Union representatives and/or employees and that such overtime will be distributed among regular employees and lastly among temporary (those hired for specific temporary periods) and Summer (student) employees. The departmental Supervisor will keep accurate records of all overtime worked in the department and make same available for employee review upon request. To provide for equal distribution of overtime, a charging system has been developed, a copy of which may be obtained from the Human Resources department.
12.07	The Company shall endeavour to schedule as many employees as possible, in
accordance with good operating procedures to work on a Monday through Friday basis. Changes from the schedule to Continuous Shift operations shall not be made arbitrarily and it is recognized that the following are examples of situations which may require the change to Continuous Shift:
(a) Introduction of new products or processes into the Plant.
12.08
12.09
12.10
12.11
12.12
12.13
(b) Additional production requirements for existing products or processes.
For the purpose of this Agreement, a continuous shift will be a situation that incorporates an ongoing seven day a week production schedule.
It is understood and agreed between the parties that when Continuous Shift operations are established, the following conditions shall apply:
(1)	That five days notice will be given before such Continuous Shift schedule is instituted.
(2)	That a Continuous Shift schedule, once established, shall remain in effect for a minimum of ninety days.
(3)	All work performed on the seventh consecutive day shall be paid at the rate of double time.
(4)	The Company will continue its past practice of paying time and one half for work performed on a Saturday, double time for work performed on a Sunday and double time for time worked on the 7th consecutive day during a continuous shift. The sixth consecutive day worked will be compensated according to provincial law at straight time for the first 4 hours and time and one half the next consecutive 4 hours worked.
The work week of the plant cleaners will be scheduled by the Company in accordance with the requirements of production.
No employee shall be required to take time off from his/her regular work week in order to off-set overtime hours worked.
Normally, employees on shift work will rotate shifts every week. Shift employees will not be required to change shifts more than once per week (a change is from one shift to another, then back to the original shift) and if such a shift change is necessary it will commence with the most junior qualified person in the department, and a minimum of 48 hours notice will be given. It’s understood that five days notice will be given of the start up of a third shift and that once established it will not be changed mid week.
See Letter of Understanding re: Inventories.
Commencing no later than July 1, 1990, employees scheduled on three (3) shifts will start the “A” shift Sunday night.
A $5.00 allowance is provided to employees working a 16 hour shift.

When an employee’s vacation entitlement changes as a consequence of service achieved subsequent to June 1st and prior to December 31st, the employee will be granted the higher vacation entitlement in the current vacation period between June 1st and December 31st.
For purposes of determining the vacation pay of employees, earnings shall include all premium pay, and pay for statutory holidays and vacations as set out in Article 14.

Those employees with vacation entitlements greater than the plant shutdown will submit requests in writing to their Supervisor before March 1st, and the Supervisor will reply in writing to the employee by March 21st, finalizing their vacation schedule. Vacations will be scheduled by order of seniority and production requirements prior to end of calendar year. Vacation requests submitted after March 1st will be granted on a first come first service basis.
Employees who work in departments scheduled to operate during plant shutdown will be advised by February 15th of each year, as to the number of employees by job classification that will be required to work during plant shutdown. By March 1st it will be determined which employees will work during plant shutdown.
In departments operating during plant shutdown, employees in the department will be given first preference by seniority whether they wish to work or schedule these weeks as their vacation.
In the event that a substantial number of employees wish to take their vacation during plant shutdown, then junior employees by job classification will be scheduled to work if necessary.
Employees who are required to work during plant shutdown will be so informed by their Supervisor and the employee will take his/her vacation at a mutually agreed upon time.
Approval in writing of the 4th, 5th and 6th weeks of vacation will be given prior to March 30th of the same year.
As of April 1st, any employees having vacation entitlements yet to be scheduled will within 30 days determine with their supervisor the time that remaining vacation entitlement will be taken from the remaining weeks available.

There will be plant wide seniority and one seniority list will be maintained for all employees. This list will be revised and posted in the Plant each four months and a copy provided for the Union. Grievances concerning alleged inaccuracies in the lists must be filed with the Human Resources Manager within five working days of the date the list is posted. Any employee absent from the Plant at the time a seniority list is posted will have five working days from the date of their return to challenge the accuracy of the seniority list. Otherwise the lists will be deemed to be conclusive.
If one or more employees seniority date is coincident, seniority will be determined first by shift (A), (B) and (C) and second by alphabetical order.
Change of name shall not effect the employee’s original position on the seniority list.
ARTICLE 16
Job Postings and Transfers
All new jobs and established permanent job openings after exhausting recall shall be posted in the Plant for three working days and employees in the bargaining unit may make application for such jobs. The name, grade and training time for the specific job that is open will be typed on each posting form. Probationary employees may apply for plant job postings but their applications will only be considered should no employee with seniority have applied.
Job posting application forms are to be handed in person or by proxy to Supervision or the Human Resources office. Supervision or the Human Resources office will record date and time of receipt on application form. A copy of receipted application form will be provided to employee or proxy as provided by 16.01(j).
The name of the successful employee shall be posted in the Plant normally within three working days but not exceeding five working days. Successful applicants of permanent job postings will retain overtime rights as permanent posted employees of their previous job classification until they become qualified and are entitled to overtime as permanent posted employees in their new job classification.
From the date of actual movement to a permanent posting by job posting, an employee may not bid on another permanent job posting before a ten (10) week period has elapsed. If the employee is disqualified by the company, the ten (10) week period mentioned above is waived. Once an employee has bid successfully on a permanent job posting, that employee will only be permitted one (1) further successful bid on a permanent job posting during the following twelve (12) month period. A successful bid is defined as the notice of the successful applicant, and the twelve (12) months begin on the date of that notice.
16.01(e)
16.01(f)
16.01(g)
16.01(h)
An employee who has successfully bid on a job posting shall be released within a four week period from the time of acceptance. If the move is delayed beyond the four week period the employee will be paid at the higher rate of pay and the Union will be informed of such delay.
In the event of a temporary job opening for a period expected to be less than 30 worked days, whenever possible the employee who was previously reduced from that job classification will be returned first. If this is not feasible then the most senior qualified employee will be considered for transfer next and so on, if no senior qualified employee accepts the transfer then the most junior qualified employee will be transferred. Temporary transfers to job grades 1, 2 and 3 will be by seniority only, except into the Night Sanitation Department where employees who waived their right will not be considered eligible.
In the event of a temporary job opening expected to exceed 30 worked days, whenever possible the employee who was previously reduced from that job classification will be returned first.
Failing that, a temporary job will be posted and be identified on the face of the posting as temporary and also state the expected time period of the opening.
Temporary postings will normally be limited to a maximum duration of 26 weeks.
Extension may be necessary if complications arise from uncertainties such as S.T.D. and WSIB situations.
A temporary opening for job grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 which is expected to exceed 30 worked days will be posted and be identified on the face of the posting as temporary. The Company will make a selection from the applicants on the basis of seniority only.
A temporary opening for job grades 6 and above which is expected to exceed 60 worked days will be posted and be identified on the face of the posting as temporary. The Company will make a selection from the applicants on the basis of seniority only.
A temporary opening for jobs grade 6 and above which is expected to exceed 30 worked days but less than 60 worked days, will be posted and be identified on the face of the posting as temporary. The Company will make a selection from the applicants on the basis of qualifications first and seniority second. The minimum qualification is 10 worked days in the job that is posted.
The successful applicant will return to the job he/she held previously on completion of the temporary posting. Experience gained on a temporary posting will not be considered in filling a non-temporary job posting. Employees who have successfully bid into a temporary posted job must complete the duration of the temporary job before being eligible to bid on a temporary job of a different classification, but may bid on permanent job postings and will move according to the provisions of 16.01(e).
16.01(i)

16.01(k)
16.02(a)
16.02(b)
16.02(c)
16.02(d)
The Company shall be subject to the same limitations as set forth in Section 16.02. It is recognized that if applicants with sufficient qualifications are not available, the Company retains the right to hire outside.
Employees who are absent from work due to sickness, injury or bereavement at the time a permanent job posting or temporary job posting of over 12 weeks, may make application for the posted job up to thirty calendar days from the date of such posting. This will allow a reasonable amount of time for employees to bid on jobs that they are interested in and otherwise would have missed because of illness. Employees applying for a temporary posting must be medically cleared to return to work within 30 days of the date of the posting. An application may be submitted in person or by proxy by a Union Steward. Job openings will not be posted during Plant Shutdown. Should a job opening be posted less than three working days before Plant Shutdown, it will continue to be posted after Shutdown to fulfil the required three working day period.
Employees going on vacation must indicate to the Human Resources Office in advance in writing their interest in specific job postings in order to be considered for such job postings.
In all cases of movement as a result of permanent job postings, other than a promotion to a position outside the bargaining unit, the following factors shall be considered:
(1)	Seniority
In the event that there is marked difference between the top applicants (2) shall be invoked otherwise (1) shall apply.
(2)	Skill, efficiency, experience and past work record with the Company.
In the event of failure on a job posting the employee concerned and subsequent employees posting behind will return to their former posted jobs regardless of seniority. Employees other than employee being failed, will establish bumping and recall rights on that posting provided they had fulfilled the requirements of 16.02(c).
The next applicant will be found through selection of the next senior qualified bidder from the original job posting, provided the requirement still exists and the next senior qualified bidder has not accepted any other permanent job posting. Failing qualified applicants, job will be reposted.
From the date of actual movement to a permanent job posting the incumbent must complete the job training period as outlined in the job specification. In all cases, minimum of six calendar weeks will be provided excluding shutdowns, holidays, and other absences, for the incumbent to demonstrate that they can satisfactorily perform the job and thus establish bumping and recall rights. To establish bumping and recall rights, the employee must complete the job training as outlined in the job specification.
Should the Company for any reason require an extension of the six week qualifying
period referred to in 16.02(c), a written request will be made to the Union President or designee in advance of expiry date of the qualifying period.
16.03
16.04
16.05
When an employee is transferred to a job other than his/her regular job for the convenience of the Company, the employee will have his/her rate maintained if the rate of the job scheduled is lower than the employee’s regular job rate. Should the rate of the job the employee is scheduled to be higher than the employee’s regular rate, then the employee will be paid the higher job rate on an exception basis.
This clause does not apply in the case of a temporary posting where an employee will be paid at the rate of the job that the employee has successfully posted to, effective at the time of the actual physical move to a temporary position.
No person shall be transferred to a job position, above grade three (3) unless they are capable of performing the work. Days spent in a job under this clause, are not to be deemed as “training days” for other contractual applications.
Employees transferred to or relieving on a higher rated job for:
(a)	fifteen consecutive minutes up to two hours, will be paid for the duration of the transfer
(b)	two hours or more, will be paid the higher rate for the whole shift, including any overtime which continues from the shift.
Employees who are transferred and scheduled for the week to a higher rated job in which a statutory holiday is observed, will be paid the rate of the job for the statutory holiday.
In the event that an employee is transferred to a position outside the scope of this agreement, seniority will be treated as follows if and when he/she returns to the Bargaining Unit. Temporary transfer has a maximum duration of twenty-six (26) weeks.
(a)	Expected temporary transfer: The Company will specify the expected time period in advance of the transfer, and during this period seniority will continue to accumulate.
(b)	Expected permanent transfer: Seniority will continue for the first six consecutive months and employees may be returned to the bargaining unit with accrued seniority. In the event that the employee has insufficient seniority to return to his/her previous posted position, his/her seniority will be exercised bumping laterally or downward. Employees who are not returned to the bargaining unit within six months may do so after six months as an employee who has completed the probationary period only.
(c)	An employee accepting a permanent job with the Union will continue to accrue seniority, and they may be returned to the Bargaining Unit with accrued seniority at any time, and bumping laterally or down.
ARTICLE 17
Reduction of Workforce and Recall Procedures
17.01(a) In a reduction of workforce, the Company may transfer the employees affected to any other job in the plant, providing that the rates of pay of the transferred employees are maintained. No person shall be transferred to a job above grade three (3) unless they are qualified to perform the job.
(b)	If the Company does not exercise this right, then the affected employee(s) will:
(1)	Exercise their seniority plant wide bumping laterally or downward to and including Job Grade 4, provided the employee is qualified to perform the job.
Qualified in this instance will be defined as a person having been
a)	permanently posted as described in 16.02(c).
b)	temporarily posted or;
c)	trained as outlined, under Job Evaluation, always provided the job has not significantly changed since the employee last performed the job. Management shall determine if there has been a significant change.
The intent of this clause is to allow employees to bump by seniority into jobs that they can perform immediately in a competent manner. An objective measure of this intent is that an employee would be able to perform the job competently with up to a maximum of ten days refamiliarization.
2)	Will exercise their seniority alone to bump into Job Grades 1, 2 and 3 plant wide, with the exception of Night Sanitation jobs.
3)	Will exercise their seniority alone to bump into Night Sanitation jobs provided they have not waived this right under the terms of 17.01(c). Employees may only bump into Night Sanitation jobs if they have insufficient seniority to bump into Grade 1, 2, & 3 jobs outside the Sanitation Department.
(c)	(1) Employees who wish to waive their right to bump into Night Sanitation jobs must sign a waiver to this effect. Such a waiver may be signed on the first Monday of any calendar month. Bumping rights into Night Sanitation may be reinstated by job posting under the terms of 16.02(c) or by the terms of (2) below.
(2)	An employee who has signed a waiver limiting his/her right to bump into Night Sanitation may revoke this waiver during the second week of January to be effective the first Monday in February or during the second week of September to be effective the first Monday in October.
17.02(a)
17.02(b)
17.02(c)
17.02(d)
17.03(a)
(d)	Movement brought about by a reduction in the workforce of one or more employees shall start with the most junior affected employee who shall bump the most junior employee of same or lower job classification into which the employee may bump and consequently there will be no job preference. Bumping movement at all job classification levels will be lateral or downwards with the exception of job grades 1, 2 & 3.
(e)	In the event that a person would be laid off, upward bumping will be exercised after exhausting lateral or downward opportunities. The employee will exercise their seniority plant-wide, upward, provided the employee is qualified to perform the job. Qualified is defined as in 17.01(b)(1).
(f)	After exhausting all bumping options outlined above, the employee will exercise their seniority to move into Job Grades 4 to 10 displacing the person with the lowest seniority. The employee will be trained and required to meet the terms of 16.02(c).
(g)	Employees who have exercised their rights under 17.01(e) or 17.01(f) will be subject to recall to their previous position whether it is to a higher or lower grade job.
The recall procedure will be exercised when a job opening is expected to exceed and does exceed one scheduled work week due to an increase in production or when an incumbent permanently vacates the job classification in question.
An employee will also be considered as having been recalled should they return for 20 worked days to the job classification from which they were reduced previously due to the need to replace another incumbent who is absent for any reason.
In recalls to job Grades 4 and above after a lay-off, seniority will be the governing factor provided the employees involved are qualified to perform the available work by the terms of 16.02(c) and that the recall does not take them to a job grade above their last permanent posted position.
Seniority alone will be the determining factors on recalls to jobs in Grade 1, 2 and 3.
For a recall of one week or less, employee(s) will be contacted by telephone only (from layoff from outside the plant). In the case where the employee is given less than 4 hours notice and may have prior commitments that prevent them from returning to work, they will waive their recall right until the next recall requirement.
Employees who have gained seniority, and are informed in writing that they are downgraded as a reduction of the workforce and seniority has been exercised shall:
17.03(b)
17.03(c)
18.01
18.02
18.03
19.01
19.02
(1)	retain their rate for the balance of the week.
(2)	retain their rate for the three (3) following full weeks.
Employees will re-qualify for rate retention when they meet the terms of 17.02(a), or 17.02(b), or are downgraded to a position for a period exceeding one scheduled week, following the completion of any previous period of rate retention.
The provision of 17.03(a) concerning rate retention shall not apply in the cases of temporary transfers and temporary job postings.
ARTICLE 18 Severance Pay
Severance Pay
Employees with 3 years seniority at the time of lay off and who remain on lay off for more than two (2) years (as per 15.03(b)) will receive severance pay at the rate of two weeks pay (80 hrs. at the employee’s straight time classified job rate) for each year of service.
The two (2) year period the employee has been on lay off, in this instance will not be considered to be part of the employees service for severance pay calculation purposes.
In the case of the Company closing and relocating the plant, all present employees would be offered employment before any new employees would be hired within three months of the move. If no employment is available, the employee would receive severance as outlined in article 18.01. Should an employee choose not to relocate, the above provisions for severance pay would continue to apply.
ARTICLE 19 Leave of Absence
The Company may grant leave of absence without pay to an employee provided that such absence does not adversely affect the operations of the Plant. Leave of absence may be granted for legitimate personal reasons.
Application for leave of absence will be made in writing by the employee to his/her immediate Supervisor. The employee should provide as much notice in writing as possible.
A written decision on requests for leave of absence will be provided within thirty days of the request and such approval will not be revoked.
However, written approval for leaves of absence during June, July and August may not be given prior to May 31 of the same year as requests for vacations by employees with vacation entitlements greater than the Plant shutdown must first be satisfied.

APPENDIX B
JOB EVALUATION SYSTEM
This letter refers to the Job Evaluation system for jobs in the Bargaining Unit at Brampton, put into effect
in October 1970.
Both the plan and its administration are modelled after, but not exactly the same as, that used by Lever
Detergents Ltd. The following guidelines are adopted.
1.	The classification of jobs and the wage scale to which such classification is related is set out in Schedule A hereto.
2.	Subject to clause (4) below there shall be no change during the life of this Agreement in the job rates as set forth in Appendix “A”, except to add to those rates established to cover any new jobs established. If subsequently, as the result of the Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, the resulting rate is higher, it shall be retroactive to the date the job commenced. However, if the resulting rate is lower than the tentative rate, the rate adjustment shall be made currently.
3.	(a) New jobs established shall be evaluated as promptly as is reasonable by the Management
Evaluation Committee on the basis of Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, with the result being submitted to the Union for review.
(b)	If the Union is not in agreement with the evaluation made by the Management Evaluation Committee, they shall, within ten regular working days of the date on which the evaluation was submitted for their review, file in writing a protest with the Human Resources Manager.
(c)	If such a protest is filed, a meeting shall be arranged within ten regular working days between the Management Evaluation Committee and the Union Review Committee to discuss such differences as may exist.
(d)	Within five regular working days of such meeting, the Human Resources manager shall communicate to the Union the decision of the Management Evaluation Committee.
(e)	The evaluated rate shall then be made effective as of the commencement date of the new job, subject to Clause (2) above.
(f)	If the decision of the Management Evaluation Committee is not satisfactory to the Union, they shall within ten regular working days, request that the matter be submitted to the Umpire.
(g)	The umpire shall then judge the issue as presented solely on the basis of the Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, and his decision shall be final and binding on both parties.
(h)	Each party shall bear one-half the expense of the Umpire.
(I) In respect to all new jobs and jobs involving re-evaluation, the Company agrees to adhere to a 30 calendar days time limit, in regards to a final decision on the above said new job or reevaluation.
(j) Time limits provided above may be extended by mutual consent of the parties.
4.	Jobs shall be re-evaluated as promptly as is reasonable by the Management Evaluation Committee on written request by either employee, the Union or the Company, providing there is sufficient evidence submitted to show that there has been sufficient change in job content that a change of at least one degree in one or more factors can be reasonably anticipated. The re-evaluation shall concern itself solely with the change. The same process shall be followed to resolve differences as provided for new jobs, except that the re-evaluation rate shall become effective on the date the request for re-evaluation was received by the Human Resources Manager. A question of whether or not there has been sufficient change in job content may also be submitted to the Umpire.
5.	Any rate for a new job or a re-evaluation job shall be implemented on the second Monday following the date Management’s rating is officially provided by the Union.
6.	During the life of the Agreement, the Umpire in respect to job evaluation will be a person as may be mutally agreed by the parties. Failing mutual agreement, either party may request the Minister of Labour for Ontario to appoint a person who is conversant with Job Evaluation as an Umpire.
7.	An employee holding a Red Circle Rate will receive no increase as long as he/she holds the job and until the rate for the job equates with his/her Red Circle Rate. At that point he/she will cease to be Red Circled.
To facilitate the prompt disposition of jobs being evaluated, it is the intent of the parties to schedule
meetings no less than once per month until such time as all jobs are current.
APPENDIX C
Salary Plan
On December 1, 1970 the hourly-rate system was replaced with a salary plan system. It is designed to protect one’s income when prevented from attending work for occasional illness or reasons judged by the Company to be bona fide. The plan provides continuity of your salary system during the so-called “waiting period” in cases of lengthy illness and then the Weekly Indemnity Plan will go into effect.
Calculation of the Salary Plan
Your weekly salary will be forty times your current hourly rate as established by the collective agreement.
The arrangement will not affect your unemployment insurance coverage. You and the Company will continue to make the usual contribution and you will be eligible for the same benefits that you are now.
The Salary Plan, as outlined above will be paid on a weekly basis.
Administration of the Salary Plan
The essential rule is that you keep your Supervisor fully advised of any absence and the reasons for them. There will also be some circumstances when he/she will request a statement from a doctor regarding the state of your health during or after an illness.
The plan is a means of income continuance, not an approval for truancy. Therefore, if an employee is frequently absent - regardless of the reasons for the absence - his/her case will come under review just as it does now. It is costly and unfair to continue to extend privileges to any who abuse them and it is the Company’s responsibility to discontinue their services if they prove they are unwilling to successfully maintain satisfactory levels of attendance.
It is important that we remember, continued excessive plant absenteeism may jeopardize the continued existence of Salary Plan benefits as they exist at present.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - Inclement Weather
re: Article 20, 20.04
Should the Company decide to close the plant due to extremely bad weather conditions, (i.e. severe snow storm) every reasonable effort will be made to
a)	Contact employees of the affected shift prior to the start of the shift.
b)	Request the local radio station, CFRB Radio 1010 and CFTR 680 News, to announce closure of the plant.
Employees should, in such circumstances, attempt to contact the Company to determine whether it will be operating or not.
As such a plant closure is beyond the control of the Company, affected employees will not be paid reporting pay whether they manage to report or not.
If, during a period of bad weather conditions, the Company decides to continue its operations, employees reporting for work will be provided with a minimum of 4 hours work. Employees who do not report for work as scheduled when the plant continues operations will not be paid. The exceptions to the above will be when an employee is on Company sick leave, is hosptialized, received emergency treatment or is treated by a physician, for reasons which would have prevented him or her from working on the day(s) of inclement weather. The above exceptions must be certified in writing by a medical practitioner.
The Salary Plan does not supersede the provisions of Article 20, 20.04 of the Collective Agreement which addresses itself to the Company’s inability to provide work not an individual’s ability to report to work as outlined in the Salary Plan.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING Re: Inventories
The taking of inventories is not considered to be bargaining unit work; however, when extra personnel are required in addition to the management and clerical staff, such employees will be selected in the following manner.
1)	Senior qualified employees working in the Department.
2)	Senior qualified employees working outside the Department.
All interested employees must sign a posted list in order to be considered for work on an inventory. Dated this 17th day of August, 1987.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING Re: Guidelines to Overtime Distribution
1.	When overtime is required, the supervisor will ask the person with the lowest overtime as per 12.06 (a) (1st). The critical issue here being “posted” to the job and low overtime. If “posted” employee, for whatever reason, has been temporarily assigned somewhere else, he/she is still entitled to be asked to work overtime.
2.	After exhausting all the steps of 12.06(a) and no one was found to work the overtime, “permanent posted” person with the lowest overtime charged will be required to work.
3.	12.06 (a) Step 5: Qualified employees working outside the department.
A procedure, for distributing overtime equally outside the department are not available, therefore, the clause is not applicable.
A master list of employees “qualified” for all jobs will be kept and updated by Human Resources. This will provide guidance for selection at Step 5.
4.	Qualified has two definitions.
(a)	permanently posted for six (6) weeks or more
(b)	someone who has filled the requirements as per the training master
It is understood that these ten (10) days of training are representative of the normal job content.
Therefore, in steps 3 and 5, overtime will be distributed first to people qualified under definition (a) and then under definition (b) before moving to the next step.
5.	If two (2) people have equal overtime charged, the senior person will be asked first.
6.	If person refused overtime, providing the 2 hour limit of 12.05 (a) or the 40 hour limit of 12.04 have been met, the person will be charged regardless of the reason with these exceptions:
If a member of the union executive, steward or committee member is required to attend and attends a union activity, then no charging will take place on refusal.
A two-tier charging method will be established. One list is just for work in their classification. The second list is all overtime worked in or outside classification and department. This way working outside one’s class does not limit one’s availability for work inside their classification.
7.	If the conditions of 12.05 (a) and 12.04 are not met, but the person works the overtime, the person will be charged. If a person refused, no charging will take place.
8.	Employees eligible to be asked to work overtime, but not available for overtime, will be charged the actual number of hours if entitled under equal distribution, in their job classification during the period. Employees who are laid off will have their overtime hours averaged when they are recalled. The only exception would be when an employee is on vacation entitlement or union business.
9.	If the Company has a duty to call a person at home, then a refusal will be charged. If no contact is made with the person, no charging will take place.
10.	If a person is late, and works overtime at the end of the regular core shift hours, the person will be charged overtime hours worked after the end of the core shift hours.
11.	All overtime will be charged at straight hours and regardless of rate paid.
12.	On a (2) shift operation, if overtime was required:
(I) provision of 12.04 must be met.
(ii)	The “posted” person with the lowest overtime would be asked first (12.06)(a), then the “posted” person with the next lowest overtime would be asked and so on (until the requirement is met) regardless of what shift they worked on Friday, filling the B shift first and then the C shift if required.
All hours scheduled to be worked on Saturday are added to overtime hours before Sunday selections. Sunday shift would follow the same procedure as Saturday.
(iii)	In all these cases, if scheduling is required, the person with the lowest O.T. would be required to work.
13.	Shiftmate - Is the person who has the lowest overtime hours in the particular classification on shift.
14.	If two (2) or more people are posted in a temporary job:
(a)	the temporary with the lowest overtime would be asked first as in 12 above.
(b)	the temporary posted employee would enter the job with the average of the “high” and “low” overtime hours of the other temporaries.
15.	Overtime will be scheduled as per the Employment Standards Act.
16.	On a three (3) shift operation, if overtime was required overtime will be scheduled like in Section 12 in order of shifts, A, B, and C.

OVERTIME HOURS CHARGED
-	Employees eligible for overtime who did not volunteer by signing the volunteer list will be charged refusal.

-	Employees must accept overtime opportunity in their own classification and department first.
