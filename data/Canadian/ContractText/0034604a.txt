factor to be considered along with skill, ability and requirements of the job, in respect of transfers, demotions, promotions, temporary layoffs and recalls to work thereafter within each separate group and when skill, ability and requirements of the job are relatively equal between employees, then group seniority is recognized as the prevailing factor in the making of a selection.

2.	(a) A "change" in a job as referred to herein is one which
materially affects its contents or requirements.
Changes in a job description alone are not adequate to warrant regrading of an existing job;
(b)	When a new job is established or an old job is substantially changed, a job description for such new or changed job will be assigned to the appropriate job grade, based on comparison with the other jobs in the respective wage schedule which applies;
(c)	A copy of the job description of the new or changed job will be sent to the Union for approval at the earliest possible date after the job has been created, or the changes to the existing job have been made, together with a notation of the job grade;
(d)	Upon commencing an experimental job, changed job, or a new job, an employee will remain at the job classification rate which he regularly received prior to this job, until a job grade rate is assigned to the job. The job will be graded within a three (3) month period where possible;
(e)	If the Union believes that an existing job has changed to an extent sufficient to warrant an adjustment in job grade, it shall notify the Company in writing of its contention ana of the adjustment in job grade it contends to be appropriate.

(v)	The proceedings of the Arbitrator will be
expedited by the parties and the decision of the Arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties hereto and the employee or employees concerned;
(vi)	The parties will jointly bear the expenses of the Arbitrator.

compliance with the following rules:
(a)	The description and grading shall be of the job, not the person performing it;
(b)	Duties not assigned or approved by Management shall not be considered;

(e)	The job descriptions are to be sufficiently accurate to reveal those features of the job that determine its classification.
