SUPPLEMENT #2
ARTICLE 24 - PENSION PLAN
BETWEEN: CANADIAN FOREST PRODUCTS LTD.
Grande Prairie Operations
AND:	UNIFOR NATIONAL UNION OF CANADA, Local 446
The parties agree that the following guidelines will be used in the administration of the
Pension Plan.
1.	All employee members of the Union will be members of the Plan subject to provision 5 below.
2.	The parties agree that effective the first day of March, 2002, the benefit levels shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per month for each year of past service for eligible employees. Effective the first day of October, 2013, the benefit level for the pension plan for service for all actives shall be adjusted by two percent (2%).
Effective March 1, 2002, employees will commence contributing thirty cents ($.30) per hour to the pension plan. The contribution hours will be in accordance with Supplement #2, item 9, of the Collective Agreement.
3.	Effective March 1, 2002, the Company agrees to a Pension Bridge of seventeen dollars ($17.00) per month per year of service for any employee retiring on or after their fifty-fifth (55th) birthday, to be paid at age sixty (60) or upon retirement if after the age of sixty (60) and to continue until age sixty-five (65). Those employees who retire between March 1, 2001 and February 28, 2002 will have their Pension Bridge increased to this level effective March 1,2002.
This section will apply to anyone retiring after March 1,2001.
4.	Normal retirement shall be at the age of sixty five (65) years.
5.	A vested employee member may elect early retirement with no reduction in earned pension after he/she has passed his/her sixtieth (60th) birthday. A vested employee member may elect early retirement with an actuarially reduced pension after he/she has passed his/her fifty-fifth (55th) birthday.
6.	Subject to provision 8 below, an employee will be vested when he/she has two (2) years of continuous service or in accordance with legislated requirements in the Province of Alberta, whichever is less.
E. & O. E.
50
7.	For the purpose of this plan, service is considered to be continuous until a member fails to work six hundred forty (640) hours in two (2) consecutive calendar years. Banked hours will not extend continuous service.
8.	If an employee who is vested has a break in service prior to retirement, that employee will receive a deferred vested pension when that employee retires. The pension will be based on the employee’s service before the break in service and at the benefit levels in effect at the time of the employee’s break in service.
If that employee should later return to employment with the Company, that employee will also receive credit for all service after the break. The amount of pension that the employee will receive will be based on the rate in effect each time that there was a break in service.
9.	To receive a full year’s credit, an employee must accumulate fifteen hundred (1,500) pensionable hours in a calendar year. Pensionable hours shall include:
(a)	Worked hours to a maximum of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
(b)	Firefighting hours up to a maximum of eight (8) hours in a day and for (40) in a week.
(c)	Apprenticeship hours spent attending school on an apprenticeship program.
(d)	Short shifts. Employees who, because of their work schedule, work less than eight (8) hours per day but are paid eight (8) hours per day shall be credited eight (8) hours per day.
In any year where an employee accumulates more than fifteen hundred (1,500) pensionable hours as described in parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, hours in excess of fifteen hundred (1,500) will be banked. In years in which an employee does not work fifteen hundred (1,500) hours, the banked hours may be used to bring the total hours worked during that year up to fifteen hundred (1,500) hours. Banked hours will also be used when an employee retires if he has not accumulated fifteen hundred (1,500) hours in his last year of work. Banked hours cannot be used to delay a break in service.
The following shall also be considered as pensionable hours. These hours may not be banked, but may be used when an employee has used all of his/her banked hours.
a)	Layoffs. If a full-time employee is laid off for one (1) or more full weeks, he/she will receive forty (40) hours credit for each week up to a maximum of two hundred (200) hours per year.
b)	Illness or Injury. If an employee is in receipt of wage loss benefits from the Workers’ Compensation Board or Weekly Indemnity benefits for a disability that occurred off
E. & O. E.
51
the job, he/she will receive a credit of (8) hours for each day he/she receives benefits. The maximum credit shall be fifteen hundred (1,500) hours per year.
c)	Total and Permanent Disability. If an employee is totally and permanently disabled, he/she will be credited with one hundred twenty-five (125) pensionable hours per month upon providing proof of the disability. These credits will continue until the employee recovers or begins to receive a pension, whichever happens first. If an employee is disabled and cannot continue to work at the Grande Prairie lumber mill but is capable of working elsewhere, he/she will not receive any further pension credits after his/her Workers’ Compensation or Long Term Disability Benefits stop.
d)	Vacation. If an employee is eligible for more than five (5) weeks annual vacation, he/she will receive forty (40) hours credit for each week after the fifth (5th) week.
10.	The following shall apply to those plan members who made contributions to the plan at its inception.
a)	If a participant’s employment is terminated with the Company prior to the employee’s retirement date, the employee will be entitled to a refund of his/her contributions with interest in accordance with the established interest tables of the plan. If the employee has completed five (5) or more years of credited service with the Company, he/she may elect to leave his/her contributions in the plan and receive on his/her normal retirement date under the plan a deferred pension in accordance with the pension benefit levels in effect at the time of the employee’s termination.
11.	All other requirements of the administration of the plan will be determined in accordance with the applicable pension legislation of the Province of Alberta or the Government of Canada.
12.	The Company will provide each plan member with a statement of the employee’s standing within the plan once each year. This statement shall include a record of the hours accumulated during the past year and a summary of credits from previous years.
13.	The Parties agree that this supplement replaces all previous Letters of Understanding regarding the Pension Plan and that all previous Letters of Understanding regarding the Pension Plan are hereby cancelled.
14.	The Company and the Union agree to establish a Joint Committee to explore, within two years of ratification of this Agreement, alternate pension systems or changes to the plan that may include employee contributions.
