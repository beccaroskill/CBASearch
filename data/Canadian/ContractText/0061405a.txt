Any disagreement with the Company's decision may be processed through the grievance procedure commencing at the second step.
An employee has responsibility for informing his supervisor immediately with respect to a disability.

If he is back at work for at least a four-week period, and is then absent, due to a disability not associated with the previous disability, the minimum period of seventy-five (75)days of basic benefits will apply.
If he is absent again due to the same or associated disability that caused the first absence, and this second absence occurred before thirteen (13) weeks had elapsed since the initial absence, the disability will be considered to be the same disability, and the employee will resume Basic Benefits as if he had not returned to work.
Basic Benefitsare payable to employees after a waiting period of two (2) scheduled work days. Further, if the first day following the waiting period is not a regularly scheduled working day for the employee, Basic Benefits will not begin until the employee's next regularly scheduled working day.

Further, if the employee is unable to work because of disability for fourteen (14) calendar days beginning with the first regularly scheduled working day of disability, Basic Benefits are payable retroactively for all regularly sched-
86
uled working days in the waiting period, if such benefits have not been exhausted.

d)	Employees NotActivelv Employed
An employee who becomes disabled while on leave of absence or vacation or on lay-off, or while on strike, suspension from work or otherwise not actively employed, is not eligible for benefits during any such period. The employee will be eligible for benefits under this Plan on the first regularly scheduled working day on which he would have returned to work but for the disability, and absence on such day will be deemed the first day of the waiting period for purposes of determining when benefits start.
e)	Part-Time Employment Duo to Disability
An employee, who because of disability, is not able to work full regularly scheduled working
87
days, may receive less than the full amount of daily benefits for which he is eligible. This provision only applies when the Company can provide part-time employment. Otherwise, such employees will receive the full amount of daily benefits.
