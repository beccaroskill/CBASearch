ARTICLE 29 - ALTERNATE SHIFT AGREEMENT
The continued success of Nestle Canada and Sterling Road depends upon our ability to improve and grow the business. Better utilization of the Sterling Road factory can be achieved by adjusting existing work schedules, which can generate additional employment opportunities and additional time off with no loss of pay. To achieve this growth, the Company and the Union understand the need to look al how the factory operates, specifically, the new opportunities for the business and increased jobs that a new work schedule could provide.
The following agreement recognizes the additional capital investments in a new Chocolate Making plant and the Kit Kat layering line. The need for a different shift pattern, allows for both the needs of the workers and the business. Any changes agreed on have not resulted in benefits being adversely affected, nor granting of lesser rights for employees adopting the new work schedules.Should a consistent need for a seven day operation arise, the Company and the Union will review all other options to satisfy production, including the weekend worker concept.By this agreement, Sterling Road is
40

RE : SUBSTANCE ABUSE
The Company and the Union jointly recognize substance use and abuse to be a serious medical and social problem that can be successfully treated.

An employee who undergoes a prescribed rehabilitative process will be entitled to Sickness and Accident benefits in accordance with the Sickness and Accident plan.
Should the Substance Abuse Representative come from the workplace covered by this collective agreement, he/she shall be granted a leave of absence, with full accumulation of seniority and pension service for the duration of time that he/she performs the job of Substance Abuse Representative.
