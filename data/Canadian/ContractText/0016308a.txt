(B) Comer Bonus
For the purpose of this Agreement, the copper bonus payable during the calendar quarter (the payment quarter) shall be determined by the average price of copper in Canadian dollars in the preceding calendar quarter (the measurement quarter).
The average price of copper in a measurementquarter shall be determined by averaging the average monthly copper price for each month in the measurement quarter as determined using the London Metal Exchange settlement quotation for copper as published in Platt’s Metals Week underthe heading'!.M.E. Settlement,” converted to Canadian dollars using the average monthly U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate. The conversion to Canadian dollars will be made using the monthly average of the Bank of Canada’s daily Canadian dollar to U.S. dollarclosing rate. The average price of copper in Canadian dollars shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent.
Based upon the average price of copper in Canadian dollars in the measurement quarter, bonus payments, as a percentage increase to the base rate shall be payable for the payment quarter to the following schedule.
Average Copper Price:	Bonus Payment:
$1.27 Cdn, or greater	+6%
$1.26	+5%
$1.25	+4%
$1.24	+3%
$1.23	+2%
$1.22	+ 1%
The above bonus payment calculation shall be applied to all wage dependent earnings of all bargaining unit employees during the measurement quarter. Any funds payable under this plan will be allocated to the purchase of improved pension benefits under the Highland Valley Copper Pension Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees. (the “Plan”).
Each $2,000,000 increase in the total cumulative copper bonus shall increase the monthly rate of lifetime pension, for past and future service by $1. The Plan shall be amended to increase the life time benefit for past and future service. The monthly rate of lifetime pension shall be increased by the greatest multiple of $1 allowable such that the value of the increase does not exceed the cumulative copper bonus. After such amendment, the cumulative copper bonus shall be reduced by $2,000,000. These benefit improvements will be effective as of the start date of the payment quarter in which the cumulative copper bonus from the measurement quarter reaches $2,000,000. Any employees who retire during the payment quarter shall receive the amended pension amount.
At September 30, 2011, any then remaining cumulative copper bonus shall be used to increase the amount of lifetime pension. For each $2,000,000 in the cumulative copper bonus, the lifetime pension will increase by $1 for past and future service. The amount of increase shall be such that the value of the increase equals the remaining cumulative copper bonus, even if such calculation results in an increase that is not in a whole dollar increment. The plan will be amended to incorporate this increase in the benefit level.
A quarterly statement will be provided to the Union on the status of the copper bonus account and this will also be subject to an annual review by the Partnerships external auditors.

HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
PREAMBLE:
The objective of the Human Rights Policy is to ensure that all employees of Highland Valley Copper are assured of a work environment that is free of all forms of discrimination, including personal and sexual harassment. By introduction of this policy, it is the intention of Highland Valley Copper to ensure proper work place behavior and that the treatment of individuals is fair and equitable and in full compliance with all applicable Human Rights Legislation as well as Section 14 of the Mines Act and Article 1.01(c) of the Collective Agreement.
The Human Rights Code of the Province of British Columbia protects individuals from acts of discrimination with respect to employment, or any term or condition of employment because of a person's race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age of that person or because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offense that is unrelated to the employment or the intended employment of that person.

Harassment:
Harassment is a form of discrimination and therefore a violation of the Human Rights Code. Harassment may be direct or indirect. When Harassment is indirect, it results in a work environment that is considered to be "Poisoned".

Sexual Harassment:
Sexual Harassment has been defined by the Supreme Court of Canada as any conduct of a sexual nature that is known or ought to be known to be unwelcome. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favours, unwelcome remarks of a sexual nature, jokes about a person's body or sexual orientation, taunting, repeated unwelcome requests for dates, touching or brushing against, hugging, kissing, patting, grabbing, pinching, and displaying sexually oriented printed material or pictures.

3.	Prior to an application of this letter, the Parties agree to meet and discuss all practical areas of concern that may affect the situation of the laid off employees or the viability to the operation of such application.
4.	Any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of this agreement, including whether or not it was practicable to recall laid off employees, or whether or not the opinion of the Company was reasonable, may be referred to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Collective Agreement as a policy grievance.
5.	Where employees are recalled pursuant to this agreement and the work to be performed by the laid off employees is intended to last less than fourteen (14) days, the provisions of Article 9.01,9.10, 9.11, 9.13 and 10 shall not apply except that the senior qualified employees on layoff shall be recalled in order of seniority.

of the Second Part
SUBJECT:	CONTRACTING OUT PROCEDURES
In an effort to improve communications and increase the effectiveness of the contracting out
committee the parties agree to implement the following procedures.
Long Term Projects
Develop and maintain a project list which will allow for:
•	A preview involving the project originator, Company and Union contracting out representativesand at times a consultant. The preview will involve discussions as to the nature of the work to be performed, involvement of Highland Valley Copper employees in the project prior to the contractor (vendor) being chosen, the approximate number of contractor employees, the number of days they will be employed and their union affiliation.
•	The issue of a preview number if the work or a portion of the work is to be contracted out
•	The issue of a contracting out notice
•	Project updates
•	The tender of the project if contracting out is required
At times the vendor will not have been chosen prior to the issue of contracting out notice.
However, the Union agrees this will not be a problem as the union has participated in the
preview process.
Unplanned Work Where Contracting Out Mav be Required
When a situation arises where unplanned work is necessary and will require contracting out the following procedures will be followed:
• The staff employee responsible for the work will contact his Company contracting out representative and provide him with all details
•	Then the Company contracting out representative, will inform the Union representative about the unplanned work. If he is unable to make contact with a member of the Contracting Out Committee, he will inform the Contracting Out Chairman. If he is unable to make contact, he will call the Union President and failing to contact him, will notify the Contracting Out Chairman via e-mail.
•	The representative will inform the person he has contacted of details of the unplanned work, when it will occur, who will be doing the work, what manpower, skills, equipment and facilities will be involved.
The representative will then ensure that a Contracting Out Incident is issued.
Contracting Out Committee Meetings
Contracting out meetings will follow a regular agenda profile. Both Company and Union
contracting out representatives will review issues prior to meeting and come prepared to
discuss contracting out issues. The parties will:
•	Update the projects list
•	Review contracting out projects
•	Prepare a plan on how and what to communicate to Highland Valley Copper employees regarding contracting out matters, (i.e., advertise successes etc)
•	Where there is a dispute the parties will make every effort to resolve the issue through open discussion and all members will participate.

SUBJECT: VALLEY PIT EXTENSION PROJECT
During bargaining the Company identified a project called the “Valley Pit Extension Project”. The Valley Pit Extension Project involves an increase in stripping, which will allow the release of enough ore to operate the mine to 2013.
The increase in stripping will require a graduated increase in manpower of approximately sixty, (60), employees between 2006 and 2009. Following the completion of this project, should it become necessary to reduce the workforce, the Company and the Union shall meet to discuss options to mitigate the impact on the workforce.
The Company and the Union further agree that, once the option noted above are discussed, agreed to and implemented, layoffs will proceed and contracting out limitations contained in the Letter of Understanding, “Recall of Laid Off Employees to do Contract Work, the “Contracting Out Procedures”, and the restraints contained in this agreement on preapproved notices on contracting out, shall not apply.
In witness whereof the Parties hereto have executed this Letter of Understanding on the 19th day of September, 2006.

The supply, installation, and programming of the PLC and all electrical and signal line connections between the well heads and the control rooms to be completed by the contractor.
Commissioning of system to be conducted by the contractor. This will involve a period of intensive system monitoring and adjustments to optimize pumping rates, data collection intervals, and download cycles.
Operation and maintenance of the system to be conducted by the contractor. This includes daily remote monitoring and data collection and weekly site visits to complete regular maintenance and pump adjustments.
The Company agrees without precedence or prejudice to pay the U.S.W Local 7619 union dues when the contractor employs non-union employees to perform work that is normally performed by the Bargaining Unit.
The union dues paid will be equivalent to the terms of Article 3.02 (a) of the Collective Agreement
FOLLOW UP:
It is recognized that changes to the project scope may be required based on the results of the 2005 portion of the program, and from time to time as the project progresses. The project is planned in phases in order to allow well numbers and depths to be optimized based on early results. The Union Contracting Out Committee Chairman will be kept apprised of project progress and substantial changes to the scope of the project through annual meetings to be conducted at a mutually acceptable time during the first quarter of each year.
It is understood that this Letter of Understanding is acceptable notice of contracting out and will replace the normal notice of contracting out procedure.

SUBJECT: EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME MINE OPERATIONS
The parties agree that there have been times when the amount of overtime available in Mine Operations has gone well beyond that which is normally available on an “Incidental Overtime” basis. At times Mine Operations has had to introduce “Campaign Overtime” measures.
i al tin
Is available when there is a need to work overtime to cover for budgeted manpower levels. Examples of this are when there are manpower shortages because employees are away from work due to sickness, leave of absence, weekly indemnity, long term disability, vacation etc.
Campaign Overtime:
Is available when the budgeted manpower level does not enable the mine to meet production requirements.An example of this is when the planned strip ratio can not be maintained and waste removal falls behind. This will require the mine to operate more than the budgeted amount of trucks resulting in an abnormal amount of overtime.
The following procedures will be implemented in order to ensure the equitable distribution of overtime during times when it is necessary to apply “Campaign Overtime” measures.
PROCEDURE - “CAMPAIGN OVERTIME MEASURES”
•	The Superintendent of Mine Operations or his designate will inform the Union President or his designate prior to applying “Campaign Overtime” measures.
•	All Mine Operation employees who are qualified to drive truck will be eligible for this overtime.
•	The “Incidental Overtime” hours worked will be included with the “Campaign Overtime” hours worked to ensure that all overtime hours worked are balanced as equitably as possible.
•	The parties will meet with representatives from Mine Operations and arrange a method of recording the overtime hours worked and the distribution of the overtime that is in the spirit of Article 13.12 (a) and (b) of the C.B.A.
•	“Campaign Overtime” will not be put into effect in the event of that truck drivers have been put in motion and have not been recalled.
