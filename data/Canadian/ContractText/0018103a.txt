United Steelworkers of America Local 6166 19 Elizabeth Drive Thompson, Manitoba R8N 1S7
This will confirm our agreement with respect to the payment of a Nickel Price Bonus to employees, as set out below.
This Bonus will be based on the average realized price per pound of nickel, in US. dollars, including intermediates, published by the Company in its Quarterly Reports for periods ending March 31 st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st (hereinafter called the 'Average Realized Price”).
If the Average Realised Price for any Quarter in which the Company has consolidated net earnings is $3.30 U.S., each employee will receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the number of hours worked by him in that Quarter multiplied by thirty cents (30$) Canadian. If the Average Realized Price exceeds $3.30 U.S., the multiplier usedto calculate the lump sum payment will be increased by one cent (1 ®) Canadian for each one cent (10) U.S. by which the Average Realized Price exceeds $3.30 U.S.
All payments will be made in the second pay period following the publication of a Quarterly Report containing an Average Realized Price of $3.30 or greater.
Dear Sirs:
120
The Nickel Production Cost Index will be equal to the Costs of Operations of the Primary Metals business segment divided by the number of pounds of nickel delivered to customers and to other Inco business segments in the same year, rounded to two decimal places. The Costs of Operations of the Primary Metals business segment will be equal to Total Net Sales less Operating Earnings for the Primary Metals business segment as published in the Company’s Annual Report. For the purpose of this calculation: (1) deliveries of purchased nickel will be deducted from deliveries; of nickel to customers and to other Inco business segments; and (2) net sales of purchased nickel, based on the Company's Average Realized Price for its nickel products, will Jje deducted from Total Net Sales. The Nickel Production Cost Index for 1989 is 3.74.On October 1,1991, the trigger price of $3.30 U.S, will be adjusted by the same percentage that the 1990 Nickel Production Cost Index exceeds or is less than 3.74. A Similar procedure will be followed on October 1 of each succeeding year. When the Company's Average Realized Price for its nickel production in any Quarter equals the then applicable trigger price, each employee will receive a lump Sum payment in an amount equal to the number of hours worked by him in such Quarter multiplied by thirty cents (30c) Canadian. If the Average Realized Price for such Quarter exceeds the then applicable trigger price, the multiplier used to calculate the lump sum payment will be increased by one cent (1 ?) Canadian for each one cent (1 c) U.S. by which the Average Realized Price for such Quarter exceeds the then applicable trigger price.
The Company agrees to continue to publish Total Net Sales and Operating Earnings of the Primary Metals business segment in its annual reports and to supply separately to the Union for purposesi of this agreement total deliveries and net sales of purchased nickel to customers and to other Inco business segments.
121
The accounting principles assumed for purposes of this agreement are the same as those used in the Company's 1989 Annual Report which are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as established in Canada applied on a consistent basis. Any change in the calculation of the Nickel Production Cost Index for 1 990 and subsequent years occasioned by changes in Canadian generally accepted accounting principles will be recognized for purposes of calculating the Nickel Production Cost Index for such years. With reipect to any changes in accounting principles affecting the calculation of the Nickel Production Cost Index which are not in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, the Company will inform both United Steelworkers of America, Local 6166 and the National Director of United Steelworkera of America, in writing, explaining the change and agrees to amend the formula of the EJonus to offset the effect of such change.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement between us respecting summer employment of students.
Every effort will be made to give preference to students having a parent who is an employee.
There are instances where the Company is obliged to give special opportunity to same students for other reasons.

There may be other special instances.
However, subject to the special cases that arise, Company policy will continue to be the giving of preference to students whose parent is an employee.
Notwithstanding thedefinition“probationaryemployee"inthe
Collective Agreement, every student shall be deemed to be a ‘probationary employee” subject to termination at any time prior to the month of October, without such termination being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
