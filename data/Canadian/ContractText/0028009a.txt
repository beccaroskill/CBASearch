Re: Temporary Assignments and Overtime
Notwithstanding Articles 11.06 and 11.07, any hours less than eight (8) hours will be identified as reduced hours as per Article 11,07.
Regular employees temporarily assigned to another department for that day, in accordance with this Letter of Understanding #3, will remain in that Department for eight (8) hours or conclusion of the shift, whichever occurs first.
Any overtime beyond eight (8) hours will be offered according to Plant seniority that is signed on the Daily Reduced Hours and Overtime list.	*
Employees who return to work extra hours will be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in that Department where the overtime premium commences upon completion of that shift.
The requirement to pay overtime to an employee returning to work to fill an overtime position will not become effective until that employee has worked eight (8) hours, if the reason the employee had reduced hours was due to his leaving work for any reason other than the Company had no work for the employee at the time the hours in the Department the employee was working were reduced.
For the purpose of this provision, the requirement by the Company to recall workers to fill overtime positions will not extend beyond the Daily Reduced Hours and Overtime list which will be posted daily.
