PROMOTION, SENIORITY, TRANSFERS, TRAINING AND PROGRESSION CHARTS
11.01	a) i) Permanent progression within any area shall be in accordance with progression charts and notes, Appendix "B". Qualification is based on the employee's knowledge of the theories, procedures and equipment related to the job in question. The Company undertakes to evaluate the qualifications of employees in a fair and just manner. The Company agrees that all employees will be given every opportunity to qualify for the next higher jobs within the minimum time periods, as set out in the progression charts. Employees shall be provided with special instruction, instructional material and/or any other advice or means for self-improvement. If an employee has not qualified for the next higher job because the Company has not given him the opportunity to train within the minimum time period, the Company agrees that within a further ninety (90) day period the employee shall receive the opportunity to train and qualify. Providing the employee qualifies during this ninety (90) day period he shall receive his wage increment retroactive to the date of completion of the minimum time period as outlined in Appendix "B".
ii)	When a permanent vacancy occurs the most senior man in the next lower classification or phase will be given the job provided he is qualified for move up or phase progression. In the event that it is found that an employee has not sufficient qualification for move up or phase progression he will be informed as to the areas in which he is expected to improve and will be given extra assistance in those areas. If time is such that it would not be practical for re-evaluation of said employee before the vacant job must be filled, the next most senior employee will be given the job, subject to the same conditions. It is agreed that the senior employee will be given the same opportunity for all subsequent vacancies in the next higher classification or phase. However, if the senior employee, providing he meets the certification requirements where required as outlined in Appendix "B", has not been given the opportunity to train for the job, the position will be filled on a temporary basis for up to thirty (30) working days, during which time the senior employee will be given the opportunity to train and qualify.
iii)	Pay classification seniority will be the governing factor to determine move up, however if pay classification seniority is the same, the qualified employee with the most area seniority will be given the job. If the area seniority is the same, then the qualified employee with the most Company seniority will be given the job. Pay classification or area seniority begins on the date an employee is given a permanent
- 25-
assignment in the pay classification, phase or area. If there is no one qualified in the given pay classification, phase or area, then persons in the next lower pay classification or phase will become eligible. An employee may, with the approval of the Area Superintendent, decline a permanent move up. In such case his rate of pay will be fixed at his currently assigned position rate in accordance with Appendix "B". This agreement will remain in effect until cancelled by either party with 30 days written notice. The date of cancellation will determine the employees pay classification seniority for subsequent progression.
b)	Move-ups caused by temporary vacancies as well as training for the next job shall be in accordance with the Progression Charts and Notes for each area.
c)	Temporary shift vacancies will be filled by the next most senior employee on the shift concerned, or as outlined in Appendix "B", provided the employee has sufficient training. If it is determined that a temporary job opening will last in excess of thirty (30) days, it shall be considered as a permanent job opening and shall be filled by the normal procedure as defined in 11.01(a) except as follows:
i)	When filling job vacancies on a temporary basis, resulting from vacations, injury, sickness, leave of absence, training or emergency, the temporary procedure may apply beyond thirty (30) days.
ii)	Specific projects of limited duration, not to exceed six (6) months, provided the Union is notified of such specific project.
d)	When two or more employees begin employment on the same day, the order of Company seniority will be established at that time by a draw in the presence of all employees concerned. Badge numbers will be assigned to new hires in the order of the lowest number representing the most seniority. If required, a similar draw shall be held to determine the order of Company seniority for any employees whose order of Company seniority has not been previously determined.
e)	It is the Company's intent that, when the equipment or plant area is in operation, all shift positions will be manned. It is also the intent that when the equipment or plant area is not in operation, but is ready and available for operation, and it is evident that it may be required to operate during a shift, then in the event any employee is absent, move-up will be made to man each position.
f)	Summer student employees will receive move-up, overtime and promotional opportunities only after all employees hired into permanent positions.

An applicant who is not available for contact or who declines the offer will not be permitted to apply for the same job for the balance of the calendar year. Employees may file standing applications with Suncor Energy Inc. Employment Office for a specific job opportunity. Such applications will be valid for the calendar year in which they are submitted.
c)	A successful job applicant shall be released to his new job as soon as possible but in any event not later than thirty (30) working days after the closing of the job posting. In the event the successful applicant’s home area decides to fill the resulting vacancy within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified then the standing applications on file that date will be the applicants for this resulting vacancy.
d)	The Company shall notify each unsuccessful employee of the reasons why he was not selected for the posted job vacancy.
e)	The ‘request for re-assignment’ process that exists in some progressions is integrated with this process. The re-assignment process is activated when a job posting occurs.

(A process flow chart is set out in Appendix ”E”. In addition the parties may refer to the original memorandum signed July 11, 2001 to support a claim under Article 11.08)
11.09	Any employee who accepts a promotion or transfer out of the Bargaining Unit in excess of one thousand and forty (1040) accumulated working hours per contract year shall be notified by the Company of his loss of bargaining unit seniority and may only re-enter the Bargaining Unit at the trainee level.

If retraining is required to fill the open position, the Company will provide such training where possible, or co-operate with government retraining departments to provide such training in order that the displaced employee may qualify to continue in the employ of the Company. Employees who remain in the employ of the Company will have their regular rate of pay maintained until permanently reassigned to their new job.

However, in the event of lay-off in a trade or progression common to more than one Department, then the junior of the qualified employees affected will be laid off regardless of the department, with the remaining employees being transferred to fill the resulting vacancies.
b) i) If an employee who has transferred from one department to another while

JOURNEYMAN: A holder of a certificate of proficiency or certificate of qualification in his trade recognized by the Province of Alberta. Journeyman with twelve (12) month’s service is a certified Journeyman who has been employed in a maintenance capacity at Suncor Energy Inc. for l2 months or longer.

APPRENTICE II: Completed the first year of a four-year apprenticeship program.
APPRENTICE I: An employee upon being indentured into an apprenticeship program shall be classified as an Apprentice I.
3.	While every effort will be made by the Company to ensure that an employee is given the opportunity to complete his annual course work and examination prior to each twelve month point on his progression being reached, it is recognized that scheduling difficulties arising from the necessity of maintaining the efficiency of the Suncor Energy Inc.; Maintenance Departments may result in the completion of such course work and examination at a date after the twelve (12) month period(s). In such cases of Company occasioned delays and upon successful completion of his apprenticeship for a given year, including the passing of the examination, the apprentice who, as a direct consequence is reclassified according to Note 2 above, shall receive a retroactive pay adjustment for all hours worked from the anniversary date upon which he was eligible for reclassification, pending only the successful completion of the apprenticeship examination and preceding course work.
4.	a) While the Company has every desire and intention to continue the apprenticeship
- 50 -
program indefinitely, it reserves the right to amend, alter, suspend, or cease the program or any part of it, should conditions so indicate. In such event, however, the Company would still allow all apprentices then enrolled to complete their Journeyman qualifications through the apprenticeship program.

7.	While reserving the right, subject to legal restrictions, to utilize the abilities of Maintenance personnel as required in jobs other than their specialty, the Company recognizes the desirability of maximizing the utilization of an employee's certified skills.
8.	If the Company regularly and routinely assigns a Journeyman who, in accordance with note 2 above, is certified in more than one trade to tasks requiring one of their other certificates then such employee will be paid the rate of pay indicated in Appendix "A”. For this purpose regular and routinely will mean approximately 25% or more of the time or duties.
9.	In selecting employees for job-related training, selection shall be based on both seniority and departmental training needs with first consideration being given to senior employees who have not previously received such training.
10.	Where qualifications and experience required for a permanent Bargaining Unit vacancy are relatively equal among two or more day, shift or continuous shift employees, the senior of such employees on a different shift schedule will have the first preference to fill the vacancy.
11.	Apprentices while at school will receive their normal rate of pay and will reimburse the Company (through the payroll deduction program), with any Government Training
- 51 -

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2
This letter outlines the intentions of the parties with respect to Article 6.08 (a). It is not intended to affect the operation of existing chit systems.
It is understood and accepted that this provision is a "best efforts" overtime opportunity and not an absolute equalization clause. It is not intended that a Supervisor endeavour to equalize overtime on a day-to-day or a week-to-week basis, nor is it intended that he always offer overtime to the employee with the least hours in the pay classification.
Overtime lists are zero at the beginning of each calendar year. The list published mid-year is used as check point to determine where the emphasis should be to have the overtime opportunity distribution reasonably equalized by the end of the year.	,

LEITER OF UNDERSTANDING #7
HARASSMENT
The Company and the Union recognize the right of employees to work in an environment free from sexual or workplace harassment, and to be treated fairly and with respect in the workplace. The purpose of this letter is to outline activities for both the Company and the Union to provide a workplace environment that is productive and promotes both the dignity and self-esteem of all employees.
For the purpose of this joint initiative, Sexual Harassment means any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that causes offence or humiliation to any employee or that might be perceived by the employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on any employment relationship.	\
Workplace harassment means any unwelcome behaviour, which creates an intimidating, threatening or hostile work environment such that an employee's performance is impaired, the employment relationship is adversely affected or the employee’s dignity or respect is denied.
t
For the purpose of administering this joint initiative, two (2) harassment Co-ordinators shall be jointly responsible to:
-Assist in communicating/educating all employees on the parties' policies and procedures.
- Act as contacVresource people for harassment complaints.
These co-ordinators (preferably one of each gender with one selected by the Company and one selected by the Union) will be trained to carry out their duties.
Knowledge and awareness is a critical part of combating harassment. The co-ordinators will recommend programs to inform and encourage fellow workers to recognize the problem and take control of their own situation through exercising their rights.
It is both a right and a responsibility of all employees who believe that they have been subjected to unacceptable behaviour to first ask the instigator to stop the unwelcome behaviour.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #9
BANKED OVERTIME
This will confirm our discussions with respect to personal time off needs of employees assigned to "R" type shifts. These employees normally would not work on Statutory Holidays and therefore have limited opportunity to accumulate banked time.
The Company will undertake to modify the Payroll system to accommodate banking of overtime for Bargaining Unit personnel assigned to "R" shifts.
"R" Shift employees will be permitted to accumulate up to fifty-six (56) hours of banked time, inclusive of Banked Statutory Holiday time. This means that for e,ach Statutory Holiday hour banked, one less overtime hour bankable. (If all of the Banked Time is due to Statutory Holidays, then the Collective Agreement provisions apply in full.) Banking of overtime hours will be either two (2) for each hour worked or one (1) banked, one (1) paid for each hour worked. The most cost effective of these will be used in the programming of the payroll system.
Debanking of banked overtime will normally only be permitted provided overtime does not result on that day and provided the supervisor can reschedule the work the person would otherwise do that day. It is intended that best efforts will be made to accommodate the employees request with due regard to the cost effectiveness of the operation.
