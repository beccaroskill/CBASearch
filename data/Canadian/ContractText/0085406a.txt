Re:	Training
It is recognized by the parties that it is necessary to install and
maintain new equipment and machinery in order to compete with larger and newer production facilities around the world. The Company will notify the Union promptly after the decision to add new equipment or machinery. It is also recognized that the maintenance and/or operation of such equipment may require new skills and knowledge not already possessed by the employees presently performing comparable duties.
The Company will make reasonable efforts to train existing employees to perform this work.
An employee who is unwilling to take such training or unable to satisfactorily perform such work after a reasonable amount of training will be retained in his present classification as long as there is work available which he can perform full time and thereafter shall be dealt with according to the Layoff and Recall provisions of Article 12.
