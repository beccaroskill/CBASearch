15
vacancy exists at such desired new location, the employee requesting the transfer shall be offered the opportunity of filling the vacancy in preference to a new hire. On assignment to the new location, the employee will be credited with his original seniority date; provided, however, that he will not be permitted to exercise full seniority under the job posting procedure during the first six (6) months of his employment at the new location.

(I) Such opportunity will first be made available on a seniority basis to
those regular employees who normally perform the work on which such
overtime is required, and
17 -
(II) in the event that the Company's needs cannot be entirely satisfied In that manner, the overtime opportunity will then be made available on a seniority basis to other hourly rated employees In the same seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
It is further agreed that overtime will not normally be assigned to temporary or probationary employees while regular employees in the appropriate seniority group are willing to perform such overtime and are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
In the case of unscheduled overtime, other than overtime to be performed as a continuation of work In process, the Company will endeavour, In so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to make such overtime available on a seniority basis to employees In the appropriate seniority group who are available on the Company’s premises at the time such overtime Is to commence and who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required. It is further agreed that overtime will not normally be assigned to temporary or probationary employees while regular employees in the appropriate seniority group are available on the Company’s premises at the time such overtime is to commence who are willing to perform such overtime and are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
it is understood that to facilitate the distribution of overtime work, employees may be required to Indicate their desire for such assignments by signing an “employees available for overtime” list and that repeated refusal of overtime work after having indicated availability for such assignments may result in that employee being excluded from further consideration under these provisions, it is further understood that In the event that ail overtime requirements cannot be filled on a voluntary basis, such work may then be assigned (subject to applicable law) on a reverse-seniority basis to those employees In the appropriate seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
it is agreed that the Company will not normally offer opportunities for overtime work If doing so may reasonably be expected to result In an employee working more than 16 consecutive hours. However, In the event that an employee should work for more than 16 consecutive hours (excluding unpaid meal breaks), he shall not be considered available for any assignment until 8 hours have elapsed from the completion of the overtime assignment. In such an event, the Company will make every reasonable effort to reschedule, by up to 2 hours, the start time of the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift so that he will still have the opportunity to work a regular 8 hour shift.
9.13	Where an employee has left the Company's Plant on completion of his day's work and is then called by the Company and requested to return to work at a time before the commencement of his next schedule day's work, such request shall constitute a 'call-out”. An employee reporting for work on a “call-out” shall be entitled to be paid for work performed by him outside his scheduled working hours at the rate of one and one-half (1) times his hourly rate or four (4) hours’ work at his hourly rate, whichever is greater.

However, it shall remain the responsibility of an employee who has been absent from work to check with the Company to determine if work is available before returning and failure to do so shall result in his being considered as unavailable for work on that shift. If an employee is absent from work with approval on a Friday, it will be presumed that he will be available for work on the following Monday, unless he advises the Company to the contrary. Therefore, should such an employee be unable to report by Monday, he must notify the Company to that effect prior to his scheduled starting time.

Should such discussions fail to produce agreement between the parties, then the Company may initiate changes only to the extent that they are necessary to satisfy the needs of the business and the requirements and efficiency of operations.
it is understood and agreed that this undertaking with respect to the method of staffing shifts (i.e. 'fixed” vs. “rotating”) does not in any way limit the Company's right to establish or discontinue shifts per se, or to modify the starting or stopping time of shifts, in order to satisfy the needs of the business and the requirements and efficiency of operations.

On occasion, however, the Company may elect to also consider applications from persons not then in the Company’s employ. In making Its final decision between two or more candidates who In the opinion of the Company are equally suitable, the Company shall always give preference to the more senior of two existing employees and to an existing employee over a new hire. It is understood that determination of the job skills and personal attributes required to fill any particular vacancy, as well as the final selection decision against such criteria, are an exclusive responsibility of the Company.

5.	Should a Sales Representative be unable to fulfill the normal requirements of that position to the Company’s satisfaction he may, after having been given a reasonable opportunity to achieve satisfactory performance levels, be reassigned to delivery work and, If necessary, may displace an employee In that job category. Before taking such action, the Company will review the circumstances in detail,

Letter of Intent
UNITED FOOD AND COMMERICAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION
Gentlemen,
The purpose of this letter Is to confirm the Company's Intentions with respect to its endeavours to accommodate the Individual preferences of employees In regard to their regularly assigned duties.
INSIDE EMPLOYEES”
1,	(a) Effective on and after October 17, 1978, all job postings made, at
Production Centres only, under the provisions of clause 8.06 (a) of the Collective Agreement to fill the position of General Help or Production Man will Identify the shift, department, and “function” within the Job Classification in which the vacancy exists. For this purpose (and this purpose only), the following “functions” will be recognized:
W.B. No. 1 - Job Classification: General Help Functions:
(a)	Principally Truck Washlng/Gassing
(b)	Principally Sweeplng/Cleanlng
(c)	General Duties
W.B. No, 2 - Job Classification: Production Men Functions:

(b)	Principally Fork Lift Operator
(c)	Principally Load Consolldation/Sortlng
(d)	Principally Plllng/Unplllng
(e)	Washing/Fllling Product Tanks
(f)	General Duties
(b) To the degree that It Is practical to do so, the more senior employees at Distribution Centres will receive preference In the assignment of available fork lift operation duties.
2.	It Is expressly agreed that the function descriptions set out above are intended solely to Identify the general or predominant nature of the tasks assigned to any employee and shall not In any way limit the Company’s ability to assign other duties or tasks within the Job Classification.
“OUTSIDE EMPLOYEES”
3.	The Company will Identify the Sales Areas Into which the particular plant’s sales territory Is divided (e.g. Sales Area ‘A’, Sales Area ’B’ , etc.).
- 42 -
This Identification will permit employees to identify the general or predominant nature of the work assignments In a particular Sales Area. It shall not, however, be construed as an exclusive definition of the work to be performed; rather, It Is understood and agreed that employees may from time-to-time be assigned deliveries which are of a kind or location other than those associated with the general or predominant nature of the Sales Area.
4,	For each such Sales Area, the Company shall establish a basic D.S.I.C. complement representing the number of D.S.I.C. 's which it anticipates will be required in the specific Sales Area on a year-round basis.
5.	When a regular, full-time vacancy (as referred to in clause 8.06 (a) of the Collective Agreement) should occur In the basic D.S. I .C. complement for any Sales Area, the ensuing job posting will identify the Sales Area in which the vacancy exists.
6.	D.S.I.C. ’s who are assigned to a specific Sales Area, either as a result of the general reassignment or as a result of application of the job posting procedure will (for the purpose of this understanding) be referred to as “regularly” assigned D.S.I.C.’s, while all other D.S.I.C.’s will be referred to as “spares”.
7.	If on any day the sales volume of a Sales Area is such that not all regularly assigned D.S.I.C.'s are required, the most junior of the employees In that Area will be temporarily reassigned to another Sales Area in which there Is a vacant route that day. In the event that there should be no vacant route, then such employee shall displace the most junior of all regularly assigned D.S. I.C. 's who, In turn, shall become a Delivery Salesman for that day.
3.	Any routes which remain vacant after the assignment of all available regularly assigned D.S.I.C.'s shall then be assigned to spare D.S.I.C.’s.
9.	Should an additional Sales Area be required on a temporary basis, the D. S.I.C. 's required in such Area will be assigned on a temporary basis, similarly, should a Sales Area be temporarily discontinued, the affected D.S. I. c. ’s will be temporarily re-assigned elsewhere.
10.	When it is determined that an additional Sales Area will be required on a “permanent” basis, the basic complement of D.S.I.C. 's for that Area will be filled by the job posting procedure.
11.	When it is determined that a Sales Area Is to be “permanently” discontinued and if there are no corresponding additions to complement In other Sales Areas, then the D.S.I.C.’s who were so displaced shall In turn displace the most junior of all regularly assigned D.S.I.C.’s.
12.	It Is understood that the expression “job posting” as used herein refers to the procedure set out In clause 8.06 of the Collective Agreement (i.e. the initial
- 43 -
vacancy and the vacancy created as a result of the filling of the initial vacancy shall both be posted).
GENERAL
13.	Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it Is mutually understood and agreed that inculpable inability to meet satisfactory standards of performance may be grounds for a non-dlsclplinary change of assignment within the Job Classification of Production Man or Delivery Salesman In Charge.
This expression of Intent to provide further recognition of Individual preferences, on an experimental basis, shall not be construed as a contractual obligation nor shall It in any way diminish existing management rights and prerogatives with respect to conduct of the business or deployment of the workforce.

Re: Collective Agreement Executed nn Dr h->lw13.1988
In the event that the Consumer Price Index, All Canada (1971 =100), for the month of July 1989 stands at a value which Is greater than such Index number for July 1988, Increased by 6%, then a cost-of-living adjustment will become payable during the period from July 31, 1989 until July 30, 1990. The amount of such adjustment will be $.01 per hour for each 0.3 points by which the July 1989 Index value exceeds the “trigger” value (l.e. the July 1988 value, plus 6%, rounded to the nearest 1 /10th of a point).
Such cost-of-living allowance will be Implemented immediately following the release by Statistics Canada of the July 1989 C.P.I. value, retroactive to July 31,1989. It will be treated as a separate adjustment (not part of the regular hourly rate) but will be paid for all hours paid for by the Company. It will be paid to all Regular Employees, and not to Temporary Employees. No account will be taken of any Increase In the C.P.I. value which is In excess of the July 1989 value, increased by 9%.
A further adjustment will be payable between July 30,1990 and July 28,1991 if the July 1990 C.P.I. exceeds the July 1989 C.P.I. by more than 6%. The adjustment will be capped at 9%. The formula and application will be as described above.
