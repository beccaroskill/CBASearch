(B)	(1) Before new jobs are created or the duties of old jobs are merged during the term of the contract, the Company will meet with the Union executive at a monthly management meeting to discuss the merger or new jobs. Such new or merged jobs will be classified, and the rates put into effect by the Company. It is agreed that in the event the Union does not agree with the Company, the matter may be taken up under Grievance Procedure.
(2)	Jobs which are practically identical from the standpoints of duties shall be classified under the same occupational title.
(3)	Rates of compensation for the same rate classification shall prevail throughout the plant regardless of Department or Drvision in accordance with Schedule "B" .

Page 4
(6)	(a) When an employee is awarded a job in a higher wage group, he will receive his old job rate until he takes over the full responsibility of the job. He will then receive the new job rate of the job to which he has been assigned.
In the case of a Replacement Operator being awarded a job in a higher wage group, he will receive the rate of his replacement job for training time, for the days he would otherwise have been working on his replacement job. For the days he would have been working from the general plant schedule, he will receive rate 1 (or rate 1A if applicable).
(b) When an employee is awarded a job in a lower wage group he will receive the rate of the job to which he has been assigned.
In the case of a Replacement Operator being awarded a job in a lower wage group, he will receive the job rate of the new job for training time for the days he would otherwise have been working on his Replacement job.

Page 5
(c)	An employee who has been working on his own job, and because of lack of work may be temporarily assigned to work for part of the day or shift on another job, will be paid for the balance of the shift at his own job rate or the rate of the job to which he has been temporarily assigned, whichever is the greater.
(C)	. Employees will be paid each Thursday for
earmncjs up to 7:00 am the preceding Sunday. Deductions will be made as per schedule as mutually agreed upon. In the event of Thursday falling upon a recognized holiday, wages shall be paid Friday.
ARTICLES 6 HOURS OF WORK
(A) Working Hours-
The working day begins at 7:00 am and ends at 7:00 am. As recognized by the Company, Sunday begins at 7:00 am on the calendar day Sunday and ends at 7:00 am. on the calendar day Monday. The same applies to recognized holidays.
The recognized work week shall consist of five days or shifts of eight (8) hours, or a total of 4 0 hours between 7:00 am Sunday and 7 : 00 am the following Sunday. However, in the cases listed in Schedule C which is part of this Agreement "Jobs on Monday to Friday Work Week" the recognized work week shall consist of eight (8) hours per day Monday to Friday, and work on Saturdays and Sundays on these jobs shall be on a call back basis. Nothing in this paragraph is to be interpreted as a guarantee of work or as a limitation on assignment of overtime work outside the recognized work week.
Page 6
The Company has the ri^ht to terminate work in the department or division at noon the day before Christmas and, or New Year's Day.
It is the duty of all employees to report for their scheduled work periods unless they have obtained their Foreman's permission to be absent. If an employee is prevented from reporting for duty through exceptional circumstances, he should notify his Foreman or Superintendent at least fourteen (14) hours before his work period begins indicating the anticipated time of return to work.
If an employee has been absent from his work for more than one day because of sickness or any other cause he must report to his Foreman or Superintendent at least sixteen (16) hours prior to the beginning of the work period in which he intends to begin duty.
Employees are responsible for keeping their Foreman advised of a phone number by which they may be contacted. Without such advice the Company cannot be responsible for notifying employees concerning extra work, call backs, schedule changes, etc. An employee will not be considered available, for that job, if two phone calls to the phone number given is unsuccessful in contacting the employee, provided that one of the calls is made and recorded by the Security Office personnel. As an exception to the above, in case of mechanical breakdown, one telephone call, not necessarily from the Security Office will suffice.
Day workers will be allowed five (5) minutes before quitting time at noon and night to put their tools away and wash up.
Page 7
Employees up to 15 minutes late will lose 1/4 hour's pay. Employees 16 to 30 minutes late will lose 1/2 hour's pay, etc.
The same regulations will apply for employees leaving work ahead of time.
Employees working overtime will be paid to the nearest 1/4 hour as authorized by their Foreman.
An employee reporting late for work must work eicjht (8) hours before overtime rates can be applred.
To meet our product demand and ensure customer service, it is the duty of the employees to remain on the job if reguired to meet special circumstances. If an employee does not wish to remain, the Foreman will endeavour, in accordance with the Collective Agreement to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work, but failure to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work without increasing the cost, to the Company, does not relieve the employee on the job of the responsibility towards his job.
(B) Day Work-
The normal hours of work are:
7:00 am to 12:00 noon and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
or 7:00 am to 3:00 pm
or 8:00 am to 12:00 noon and 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm
or
and
9:00 am to 12:00 noon 1:00 pm to 6:00 pin
Page 3
or such other eight (8) hour schedules that may be necessary to meet special conditions resulting from production demands, delivery schedules, the type	of	job,	or	seasonal
variations which might affect the daylight hours. Except as otherwise provided, the Company will not schedule less than 8 hours.
(C) Shift work-
The normal hours of work for shift workers are any one of the following shifts: First Shift	-	7:00	am	-	3:00	pm
Second Shift	-	3:00	pm	-	11:00	pm
Third Shift	-	11:00	pm	-	7:00	am
Each revolving shift shall rotate in sequence weekly. Employees are not to exchange shifts without permission from their Superintendent or Foreman.
When a shift begins each shift worker is required to be at his place. At the end of a shift no shift worker may leave his place to wash up or dress unless his mate has changed his clothes and reported to take on the responsibilities of the position. If a shift worker does not report for his shift, and has not given the required notice, the employee on the job	shall	notify the Department
Superintendent or Foreman. He shall then remain at his post until a substitute is secured.
hfhen a replacement is required for a shift job or a day job after the Schedule has been posted for the following work week, the Foreman will attempt to make the replacement in accordance with Article 6	(E) using the
following	priority provided no overtime
results,
Page 9
(1)	Regular Operator, provided using the Regular Operator does not involve moving him from one shift to one of the other two shifts.
(2)	Replacement Operators in order of priority.
If overtime cannot be prevented the Replacement will be made in the following priority :
(1)	Person on the job.
(2)	Regular Operator on his assigned day off
(3)	Other Regular Operators in order of seniority.
(4)	Replacement Operators in order of prrority.
The Foreman may at his discretion use any of the above in an effort to minimize the amount of overtime or avoid the need for any operator to work in excess of 16 hours cont inuous1y.
(D)	Replacement Operator-is an employee who replaces a Regular Operator or other Replacement Operator during their temporary absence due to sickness, vacation, assigned days off, or other similar cause. The Replacement Operator will have the same rights and obligations of the job for the days he is on the job, as if he were the Regular Operator, but he shall not have the rights and obligations of any other Replacement job he may have for those days. A Regular Operator who also holds a Replacement job will not have the rights and obligations of his Regular job for the day he is working on his Replacement job. Replacement of Regular Operators Rate 5 or higher will be made from Replacements (in order of priority) who have received their jobs in accordance with Article 11 (A)(7) as a result of a bulletin.
Page 10
When there is more than one Replacement Operator for a job the priority of the Operators shall be indicated as Replacement Operator no. 1, Replacement Operator no. 2 -etc., and such priority shall be indicated on the job bulletin when the vacancy is posted. A Replacement Operator no. 1 regularly on shift work is limited to that job, iei he may not hold another Regular job or Replacement job. Similarly, a Regular Operator regularly on shift work is limited to that job. A shift worker Replacement Operator no. 2 is limited to holding one other Replacement no. 2 or no.
3 job within the Division.
A day worker is limited to two (2) Replacement jobs plus a Regular Job within the Division.
The following Replacement Personnel are not restricted to the job limitations imposed by 6(D)	(i.e. They may be selected to an
additional Replacement #2 Job.):
Corn Elevator Operator Replacement #1 Bldg 43 Operator & Loader Replacement #1 Dextrine Operator Replacement #1
(E)	Work Schedules-
A work schedule is to be posted on the bulletin board in each department on Thursday on which is shown the planned working days and shifts, for the following week. This schedule will indicate "assigned day off" and "down days", if any, and in the event that any work which is Rate 2 or higher shown on this schedule to be performed by an employee at overtime	rates then such work will be
scheduled to the Regular Operator or the Replacement Operator enjoying the rights of the Regular Operator unless it is assigned in accordance with Article 6(C).
Page 11
As an exception to the preceding paragraph the existing system of scheduling week-end relief and days off will continue. The present common practice is the scheduling of the 3 - 11 shift Saturday to Replacement Operators three Saturdays out of four, with the 4th such shift being scheduled to the Regular Operators. There are exceptions to thrs general rule in various departments and in situations where Replacement Operators are not available.
The schedule may be changed by the Foreman or Supervisor by advising the man concerned at least M22M hours before the shift or day concerned for an assigned day off or down day change if such change is caused by production demands, or by at least "12" hours notice if the change is for any other reason, provided, however, that not wrthstanding the foregoing, no notice of a change in schedule is required if caused by serious breakdown. In any of these cases, the additional time worked is not on a "call back" basis.
Assigned Day Off is a day of relief from the regular job assigned to an employee to conform to the recognized work week.
When owing to a change in the work schedule and the employee has not been advised that regular work is not available and reports for work, he will be supplied with at least four hours work or pay, at straight time on week days, but such time will not be included in the work week. If on a Sunday or holiday or assigned day off, his work will be treated as a call back. The above does not apply in the case of a serious breakdown.
Page 12
When an employee is required to come in to work ahead of his regular starting time he will be given twelve (12) hours warning. Without twelve (12) hours warning his early starting time will be on a call back basis.
Except as otherwise provided, when employees are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs, they will be guaranteed 8 hours work or pay in lieu thereof.
All employees assigned to work at overtime rates, who are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs are not required to work 8 hours because of lack of work on their job will be guaranteed at least 4 hours work or pay on a call back basis.
(F)	For reasons of product demand or efficiency, assigned days off and down days will be determined by the Foreman concerned. Recognizing that employees would like their two days off consecutively, the Foreman will prepare the schedules accordingly when feasible, providing additional cost is not incurred.
ARTICLE 7 OVERTIME
(A)	Overtime rates of time and one-half the regular rate will be paid for:
(1)	a) work in excess of eight hours continuously
b)	work in excess of eight hours in any one day.
c)	hours worked between 3 P.M. Saturday and 7 A.M. Monday
d)	hours worked between 7 A.M. Saturday and 3 P.M. Saturday exept hours worked from the general schedule.
OR
Page 13
(2)	Scheduled time worked in excess of 40 hours in any one work week.
No more than 3 scheduled hours per day will be included in calculating the work week.
(B)	(1) When an employee is scheduled to work 8 hours on Sunday and is not required to
work 8 hours because of lack of work on his job, the time worked will not be included in calculating the work week under Article 7 (A) and will not be included as 'opportunity of working1' under Article 11 (B) .
(2) When an employee is scheduled to work 8 hours on Sunday and has the opportunity of working 8 hours or more on Sunday, time worked up to but not exceeding 8 hours will be included in calculating the work week under Article 7	(A). Such time scheduled will be
included as 8 hours in determining the "opportunity of working" under Article 11 (B) .
(C)	Work on Recognized Holidays - As shown in
Article $	(A) will be paid at the rate of time
and one-half of hourly rate with the exception that work on New Year's Day, Christmas Day and Labour Day will be paid at double time. If an employee works 8 hours or is scheduled to work 3 hours or is paid for 8 hours on a Recognized Holiday, such time worked or paid for wrll be included in computing the work week.
(D)	(1) Time worked on call back basis will be paid at time and one-half, and will not be included in the forty hour work week.
Page 14
(2)	Call backs or overtime will terminate at the beginning of the employee's	regular
scheduled day or shift. When an employee continues on his	regular shift without
interruption after a call back, overtime rates will again become effective eight hours after he started his call back work.
(J) Work on an Assigned Day Off or a Down Day-When an employee is required to work on his assigned day off or his down day without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6(E) , he shall be paid on a call back basis.
(E)	(1) Call Back or Call In - The Company is not obligated to call in any employees for any job of approximately one-half hour duration, that can be done by other hourly employees available in the departments concerned. In addition the Company is not obligated to call in any employee for any mechanical task that can be done by the utility mechanics. Nor is the Company obligated to call in any employee who	is scheduled	on vacation,	floating
holidays, Union business, labour relations, or requested time off.
(2)	Employees who are called in to work without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6 (E) for a limited period of time will get a minimum of four (4) hours regular pay, except that the minimum pay will be 6 hours regular pay if the employee is called in to work without notice between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am. If the employee's services are not required for two hours and forty minutes he can with the Foreman's or Foremen's permission
Page 15
leave the plant. If, however, while he is in the plant on a call back another emergency arises requiring his attention he must remain on the job and subject to the instructions of the Foreman or Superintendent concerned.
(3)	If an employee is called upon after his regular quitting time and after having been relieved from his work to work overtime he will be paid on a call back basis.
(4)	When requested by the Company, an employee is obligated to return to the plant to remove his lock out device. The Company will not pay such employee if the lock out device was left in place because of his own fault.
(F)	Work on Split Shifts - Employees may be required at the request of their Supervisor to work a split shift. In such cases the actual hours worked within the span of their normal working hours will be paid for at regular rates, and any time so worked outside of normal working hours will be compensated for at time and one-half.
(G)	Shift Relief - Overtime will not be paid in the case of a mutual agreement between two shift workers on the same job to relieve at a time other than the normal shift change time. This arrangement must have the permission of the Foreman concerned.
Employees may be required by their Foreman or Supervisor to work 12 hour shifts in situations in which two operators are only available to cover the 24 hours duty per day. Such 12 hour shifts will be considered as normal hours of work in accordance with Article 7(A)1.
Page 16
(H)	Noon Hour Work - Employees who are advised before noon that they are required to do unscheduled work during the noon hour, will be paid one and one-half hours' pay. Such time will be included in the 8 hour work day.
Work during the noon hour will be paid for on a call back basis only if the following conditions prevail:
(I)	The employees concerned must have worked during the morning and be scheduled to work that afternoon.
(2)	The employee concerned was not advised before 12 noon of the noon hour work.
Such call back pay will terminate at the time the employee would normally begin his afternoon work.
(I)	Employees who during their normal working hours are notified that they will be required at a definite time on a later shift during that day will be paid a minimum of two hours and forty minutes at time and one-half their hourly rate.
An employee may be required to stand by at home for dut-7 at an indefinite time later during that day for which he shall receive a minimum pay equal to a call back whether or not his services are required.
(J)	Employees who during their normal working hours are notified that they will be required to start their day's work the following morning before 7 : 00 am will be paid time and one-half for time worked before 7:00 am and time and one-half after eight (E) hours work.
Page 17
(K)	It is not the intention of the Company to schedule overtime work in one department to avoid overtime in another department.
For example, an employee under ordinary circumstances, will not leave his regular job to go to another job to act as a replacement if so doing creates overtime on the regular job.
An R2 holding two R2 jobs will replace in the lower rate job when available.

conflict in so doing.

Page 25
probationary employee shall be retained. The Company's decision on retention or discharge of a probationary employee shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

Page 26
shall be notified by registered mail to his last known address of recall after lay-off. Absence for which special permission in writing has been given by the Company shall not break seniority, or sever employment. An employee wishing to be absent from hrs work in excess of 3 working days for reasons other than lay-off or illness must apply for a Leave of Absence.

In the case of employees with less than 5 years seniority, the period is 24 months (instead of 6 months) for all job vacancies posted after April 15, 1990. The above shall not be applicable if the employee withdraws within 3 days of the posting of their selection.

expected work week of less than the Recognized work week and work on Rate 1 jobs is avarlable on days they are not scheduled to work on a Divisronal Schedule, then such Rate 1 work will be allocated to the more senior employees provided no extra cost results.

(2) In any job displacement the Company will transfer	the Regular	Operators and	the
Replacement	operators	who are affected,	to
Rate 1 jobs provided they have sufficient seniority and are able to do the work available. Vacancies in Rate 1 jobs will be created by transferring the least senior employees with regular Rate 1 jobs from the Rate 1 jobs. The Regular and Replacement Operators	permanently	displaced will	be
guaranteed a minimum of not less than the rate of their former job for the work done during a period of 18 months after the displacement.
(E)	The Company agrees except in cases of urgency, not to let or enter into contracts for Plant maintenance work or the performance of other bargaining unit work at the Plant, which work is normally performed by Mechanical employees or other bargaining unit employees, while Mechanical or other regular bargaining unit employees who are qualified and capable of doing the work are on layoff status.
Maintenance work is defined to mean repair and replacement of existing equipment in kind.
Page 33
Exceptions to the foregoing are jobs which are normally contracted out such as roof and road repairs, elevator maintenance, etc., together with jobs that require special skills not possessed by employees, or equipment which is not owned by the Company.
The Company will give the Union five (5) days prior notice (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) of the letting of contracts mentioned above in Article 11(E)/ paragraph 1.
The Company will continue its efforts to undertake selected non-routine jobs such as building demolition when necessary skilled and unskilled regular employees are available within the work force.
