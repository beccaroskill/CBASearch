GETTING STARTED
Eligibility
You are eligible to participate in this Benefits Program if you are a permanent, full-time employee. Your participation in the Benefits Program starts as soon as you begin working for Mosaic Potash Esterhazy.
If you have dependents, their coverage starts when yours does. There's one exception: If a dependent is hospitalized when coverage is to start, coverage for that dependent will be postponed until they get out of the hospital. (This limitation does not apply to newborn children.) Should your dependency status change, be sure to notify the Human Resources Department.
It is a good idea to sign up for your benefits right away. If you enroll yourself or a dependent more than 31 days after first becoming eligible to do so, you will have to provide a proof of good health in order for coverage to start.
If your spouse works for Mosaic Potash Esterhazy and is eligible to participate in this Program, you may be listed as dependents under each other's coverage through coordination of benefits.
Benefits cease on the date of termination of an employee. For employees who retire, benefits cease at the end of the month in which you retire.
Paying for Your Benefits
Mosaic Potash Esterhazy pays the full cost of most of the plans. You pay the full cost of the optional term life and AD&D insurance and 40% of the cost of the long-term disability insurance.

Benefits Handbook for Hourly Employees
SUMMARY OF BENEFITS
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS
As you read about your health care benefits, please keep in mind that they are designed to provide valuable supplementary protection but not to duplicate provincial health care plans under which you are or could be protected. Therefore] the Benefit Plan excludes:
(1)	services and supplies to the extent that benefits can be obtained for them under a provincial plan by fulfilling the requirements of that plan, and
(2)	services and supplies for which reimbursement is not permitted. (For the life of the current labour contract, Mosaic Potash Esterhazy’s medical and dental benefits will be based on the terms of the provincialcoverage in effect on February 1, 2004.)
Eligible Dependents
In additionto covering you, your Health Plan offers coverage for your dependents - your immediatefamily. That includes your spouse* and your unmarried]dependent children (including dependent stepchildren, legally adopted children and children for whom you are the legal guardian) under age 19.
Regarding children]there are two exceptions to the above rule:
♦	An unmarried child who is a full-time student at an accredited school and remains dependent upon you is eligible for coverage until turning age 23.
♦	A covered child who, because of mental or physical incapacity] continues to be wholly dependent upon you can remain covered as long as your own coverage continues.
♦	The person to whom you are married or the person with whom you reside and whom you represent as your spouse.

Benefits Handbook for Hourly Employees
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS
Medical Benefits
After you pay your deductible, as explained later, the Medical Plan pays 80% of your eligible expenses (50% of expenses for outpatient treatment by a psychologistfor mental or nervous conditions) for the rest of the calendar year.
About the .Deductible
The deductible is the first $50 of eligible expenses during the calendar year. Ordinarily, each family member has to satisfy their deductible before collecting benefits underthe Plan. However, once three members of your family pay their deductibles in a particularcalendar year, no more deductibles will be required of your family during that year.
Eligible expenses that count toward the deductible during the last three months of a calendar year also count toward the next year's deductible. This keeps you from having to satisfy two complete deductibles for any one person during a short period of time.
If two or more family members are injured in the same accident, only one deductible will be charged each year to their combined expenses resulting from the accident.
Vision Benefit
The Plan features a vision benefit that is not subject to the annual deductible or the 80%/20% coinsurance. The Plan covers all reasonable and customary charges for glasses or contact lenses for the correction of vision problems not related to cataract surgery up to a maximum benefit of $250 and an additional $50 per individualduring any period of 24 consecutive months for eye exams. (The 24-month period is measured from the date of receipt of the glasses, contact lenses, or eye exams.)
Example
If a claim is made for eyeglasses in February 2004 for $200.00, you will receive $200.00. Ifyou have another claim for $100.00 in February
2005,	you will receive$50.00 as $200.00 was used in 2004. In February
2006,	you will only have $200.00 available for vision care reimbursement, as the other $50.00 will not be available until February
2007,	representing the two full calendar years.

MEDICAL BENEFITS
ELigiMe.Expens.es
It is important to note that not all medical expenses are covered by the Plan.
If you are unsure if a medical expense is covered by the Plan, please contact the insurance carrier. (See contact information on the inside of the back cover.)
To the extent they are not paid by a provincial plan or by your satisfying the $50 deductible, reasonableand customary charges for the following services and supplies are included as eligible expenses, providing the services and supplies are medically necessary:
♦	Prescription drugs listed on the insurance carrier's approved drug formulary. The formulary covers the generic or lowest-cost drug that contains the same active ingredients, strength and effectiveness as a specific and more expensive brand-namedrug. If no generic equivalent is available, the brand name drug will be dispensed. Rememberthat you will normally use your drug card to purchase prescription drugs. Using the card submits your claim electronically to the insurance carrier and you will simply pay your portion to the pharmacist. The electronic claim will considerthe deductible and the dispensing fee cap of $5.50 before determining your share.
♦	Ambulance service, if your condition requires it, to the nearest hospital where treatment facilities are available.
♦	Services and supplies of a licensed hospital, including semiprivate or private accommodations (written recommendationby the attending physician is required for private accommodations). If you are hospitalized outside of Canada and it is an emergency while you're traveling or on vacation, the Plan pays up to the reasonable and customary level of charges for the area in which the services are received. For an elective hospital confinement outside of Canada, the Plan sets a limit on eligible expenses of $75 per day.
♦	Medical care and treatment while hospitalized.

♦	The Plan does not cover expenses that are covered by some other portion of your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy Group Benefits Program.
Benefits from .Other. Sources
Your Medical Plan coordinates with other group plans to give you the maximum amount of coverage and prevent the duplication of benefits. When a person is covered by more than one group plan, one plan is primary. The primary plan pays benefits first and without considering the other plans. Then the secondary plans pay.
Here are the guidelines for determining which plan is primary:
a)	The Plan covering the patient as an employee, rather than as a dependent, is primary.
b)	If a child is covered as a dependent under more than one plan, the plan of the parent whose birthday comes earlier in the calendar year is the primary plan.
c)	If a determination cannot be made on the basis of (a) or (b) above, the plan which has covered the patient for the longest period of time is the primary plan.

Applying, for Benefits
When you receive routine dental care, just fill out your part of the claim form, have your dentist complete their part, and return the form directly to the insurance carrier.
Nate:
Many dentists will bill the insurance carrier electronically and you will only pay your portion of the bill directly to the dentist In cases like this, you are not required to fill out a claim.
Pr:<_idi__t(__!;n~ni-t(()ii<--1F--Bi-!.ii(}fjts-
The procedure is a little different when you have a serious dental problem. Predetermination of benefits- having the benefit amount determined before treatment starts - is required wheneverthe dentist’s charges are likely to be $600 or more.
Here is howto have benefits predetermined. Before your treatment starts, have your dentist submit a treatment plan (on a Dental Claim Form) to the insurance carrier. The treatment plan should describe the proposed treatment and its cost, and it should be accompanied by evidence supporting the need for treatment.
The treatment plan will be reviewed and returned to you showing what portion of the total bill will be paid by your Dental Plan. The predeterminationwill remain valid for 12 months. When the dental work is completed, your dentist should enter on the form the dates of treatment, certify that the services were performed and return the form to you. You should then return the completed form to the insurance carrier.

Predeterminationof benefits protects you. Knowing the amount of your benefits before treatment starts means you will not be faced with surprise expenses. If for some reason benefits are not predetermined, payment will be made only for that portion of your treatment determined to have been necessary.

INCOME WHEN YOU CAN’T WORK
SHORT-TERM DISABILITY BENEFITS
Your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy Benefits Program includes a Short-Term Disability Plan - a plan that provides you with a basic income if you get sick or hurt and cannot work.
If you are disabled by a nonoccupational illness or injury and have exhausted your sick pay benefits, you get a weekly benefitfrom this Plan. The benefit equals 70% of your normal weekly earnings.
If you are disabled by an injury, benefits are payable from the first scheduled workday you are unable to report for work. If your disability is caused by an illness, benefits start on the fourth day after the first scheduled workday you are unable to report for work.
Benefits are payable for a maximum of 30 weeks during any one period of disability. Successive disabilities separated by less than one week of fulltime regular work are considered one disability, unless the second one is due to a different cause and does not start until after you return to full-time regular work. Successive disabilities due to injuries received in one accident are considered one disability.
To receive these benefits, you must be under a physician’s care and medical proof of your disability will be required. To be considered disabled, you must be unable to perform your job.
Mosaic Potash Esterhazy can accommodate injured or ill employees through modified work. If you are under an active rehabilitation plan as recommended by your physician, modified work may be available to assist in your recovery. Please contact Human Resources if your physician approves your participation in modified work.
If you return to work in a modified capacity (i.e., modified duties), you will receive your regular hourly wage; however, the time you spend performing modified duties will not affect your 30-week STD period.

LOOKING AHEAD TO RETIREMENT
YOUR MOSAIC POTASH ESTERHAZY RETIREMENT PLAN
A portion of your income during retirement will come from your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy Pension Plan. During retirement you will receive monthly cheques from the Mosaic Potash Esterhazy Limited Partnership Pension Plan for Employees Represented by Local #892 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union. Your pension will provide a regular income that you can never outlive.
Membership.aiiji£exvice
You are automatically a member of this Plan if you are a permanent, full-time, hourly Mosaic Potash Esterhazy employee and are covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and Local #892 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union.
While you work, you earn credited service. When you leave Mosaic Potash Esterhazy, your credited service will determine whether or not you are entitled to a pension. Your credited service will be used in determining your pension amount. You become vested in your pension rights when you complete two years of credited service.
Your credited service consists of all periods of your employment up to age 65 while a member of this Plan or the prior plan (the Retirement Plan for Employees of International Minerals& Chemical Corporation (Canada) Limited.)
Credited service is measured in monthly increments. If you participate in the Plan for one day in a given month, you receive credited service for that entire month. Information about special service situations appears on Page 32.
Page 27
Benefits Handbookfor Hourly Employees
RETIREMENT
Pension. Benefit Level.
Your monthly pension will be calculated by multiplying your years of credited service by the applicable benefit as described in the table below (date is period at which new benefit level begins):
Monthly Benefit Per Year Of Credited Service
February
Your. Pension at .NoimaLRetirement
You qualify for a normal retirement pension if you retire after reaching age 65 In this case, your monthly pension will be figured by multiplying your years of credited service by $55.50.
Example
For someone at age 65 with 35 years of credited service, their pension will be calculated as follows:
35 years X$55.50/month/year ofservice = $1,942.50/month
Your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy pension will be in addition to your Canada Pension Plan benefits. Both the Company and employees contribute to CPP as per government regulations.
Early Retirement
You do not have to wait until age 65 to retire. Once you become vested, you may retire anytime after reaching age 55. You become vested when you complete two years of credited service.
If you retire early, your pension will first be calculated as described above. It will then be reduced by 4% for each year by which your pension starting date precedes your 61st birthday The younger you are when your pension starts, the more cheques you will receive over your lifetime and therefore the greater the reduction.

Conversion Rights
Your Term Life Insurance Plan has a conversion provision. This means that when your group coverage ends, it is possible for you to obtain individual life insurance coverage without taking a medical examination. To convert to an individual policy, you must apply to the insurance carrierwithin 31 days after your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy coverage ends.
If your Mosaic Potash Esterhazy term life insurance coverage ends and you die during the 31-day conversion period, your beneficiary receives the benefit that would have been payable had you converted to an individual policy.
