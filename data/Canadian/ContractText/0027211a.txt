Letters of Understanding
Between:	Sofina Foods Inc. (Lilydale Division)
And:	United Food and Commercial Workers
Canada Union, Local No. 401
1. Re: Temporary Foreign Workers
Should there be a conflict or potential conflict in the language of the Collective Agreement and the temporary foreign workers, the Company shall meet with the Union to discuss and attempt to resolve the issue.
2. Re: Hand Slaughtering for Religious Purposes
The Union recognizes that the Company processes “Halal” poultry products which requires expert hand slaughtering services in accordance with Islamic law.
The Union further recognizes that neither the Company nor its employees currently have the required expertise to perform this work.
Accordingly, and notwithstanding any Article to the contrary, the Union agrees that the Company may use third party contractors to perform hand slaughtering services in connection with its “Halal” products.
These individuals will not be performing work that is normally performed by employees.
65
The Company agrees that as part of this letter of understanding, there shall be no reduction in hours or in the work currently being performed by members of the bargaining unit as a result.
This letter will expire with the Collective Agreement.
