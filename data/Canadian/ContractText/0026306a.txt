HOURS OF WORK
The Company intends to operate a normal work day schedule of eight (8) hours and a normal work week schedule of forty (40) hours but this will not be a guarantee of hours per day or per week. If the demands of the business cannot best be met in areas of the plant with a normal work day schedule of eight (8) hours, the Company may operate such areas of the plant on a normal work day schedule of up to twelve (12) hours and a normal work week schedule of up to forty-eight (48) hours.
If the Company makes application to the Director of Employment Standards to adopt a regular schedule of up to twelve (12) hours per day and up to forty-eight (48) hours per week, the Union agrees that such application will be supported by the Union.
An employee will be informed by their supervisor of their normal daily and weekly hours of work schedule and will remain on such schedule unless changed by the Company to another schedule in accordance with the provisions set out in schedule below (PROPOSAL FOR CHANGING SCHEDULES).
Subject to the provisions of the Employment Standards Act of Ontario, it is agreed by both the Company and the Union that, as a result of fluctuating livestock receipts, variable volume, breakdowns and other circumstances which are beyond the reasonable control of the Company, employees will be required at times to work in excess of the number of hours in their daily schedule or in excess of forty-eight (48) hours in a calendar week. When employees are required to work in excess of the number of hours in their daily or weekly schedule, their supervisor will inform their department steward and will post notice of such in a conspicuous location in the department as early as reasonably possible.
OVERTIME
All overtime will be distributed as equally as possible amongst all employees by seniority who can perform the required work within the department. When it becomes necessary to have employees work in excess of their scheduled shift, the Company will first solicit volunteers within the department based on seniority and qualifications to perform the required work. If there are not enough volunteers, the Company will require the least senior employee(s) in the department with the qualifications to perform the required work.
(a)	11/2 Times After Forty-Four Hours. The Company will pay one and one half (11/2) times
their regular rates to employees for all hours worked in excess of forty-four (44) hours in a calendar week.
30
(b)	1 1/2 Times for Non-Scheduled Sunday. The Company will pay to employees one and
one-half (1 1/2) times their regular rates for work performed on Sunday, except to those workers whose schedule calls for work on Sunday. If an employee’s regular day off, in place of Sunday, falls on a weekday, they shall be paid one and one-half (11/2) times their regular rate for hours worked on such weekday. Where an employee normally works on Sunday and has two (2) weekdays off, the second day shall be considered to be the day off in place of Sunday.
(c)	If an employee is paid one and one half (1 l/2)times their regular rate for any hours worked
prior to reaching forty-four (44) hours worked in a calendar week, such hours paid at time and one-half (11/2)will not count as part of the forty-four (44) hours worked that are necessary to require further payment of one and one-half (1 1/2).
EMERGENCY CALL IN
An hourly rated employee who, after leaving the company premises, is specially called in at any time outside his normal working hours, shall be through when the emergency is over, but shall nevertheless, be paid for a minimum of five (5) hours at time and one-half (11/2 )for the time spent on the emergency outside his scheduled hours,
PROCEDURE FOR CHANGING SCHEDULES
When the Company changes an employee’s scheduled hours of work from their present schedule to another schedule, the employee will be entitled to twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of the schedule change unless the schedule change is with the agreement of the employee. If the schedule change is not with the agreement of the employee and the Company fails to provide twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of the schedule change, the employee will be paid one and one-half (11/2) times their regular rate for all hours worked outside their previous schedule until the expiry of the twenty-four (24) hours’ notice.
GUARANTEED MINIMUM WEEK
Regular full time employees with seniority , are entitled to a weekly guarantee of thirty-seven (37) hours. However, notwithstanding the Articles of this Collective Agreement, the Company may, for each shift in a department, reduce the weekly guarantee to thirty-two (32) hours to a maximum of ten (10) occasions per year.
The above guarantee will be reduced by all hours the employee is absent from work for any reason including personal breaks when work is available and the employee is qualified, or when work is not available due to reasons beyond the control of management.
All hours worked and paid will be counted towards the weekly guarantee. The weekly guarantees do not apply to employees who are laid-off or recalled during the week.
