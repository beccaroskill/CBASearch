It is general policy of the Company not to contract out production or maintenance work that is normally performed by members of the bargaining unit however, abnormal circumstances may arise that require such contracting out. Therefore, in order to minimize the requirement for contracting out, the Company proposestheformationofa projectteamas described in Appendix T. Both parties agree to meet quarterly of each year to review all the project work plannedfor the comingquarter.
When the Company contemplates and decides to contract out productionor maintenancework that has not previously been contracted out, it shall give the Union as early written notice as is feasible but no later than twenty (20) days before the contract is awarded providing details of the work to be contracted out. When the Company cannot give twenty (20) days notice, a verbal notice will be given immediately it becomesfeasible to do so. On receipt of such notice, the Union may request a meeting to discuss the possibility of qualified employees and available equipment starting and completing the work within the required time. Such a meeting may be attended by four (4) representatives of the Union and will be held within five (5) days of the notice. The Union
representatives will suffer no loss of pay for the time spent at such a meeting. Within seven (7) days following such meeting, the Company will advise the Union of the final disposition of the contract. Further, if the Company is unable to provideall the details for the work to be contracted out at the above meeting, it will provide such details to the Union as soon as the informationbecomesavailable.
In no case will the Company contract out production or maintenance work while employees who normally perform that work are laid off or reduced as a result of a decrease in the work they normally performed or that would result in the reduction or lay-off of such employees. No employees of any contractor will displace the regular production and maintenance employees.

Even though notice from the Company will not be required in the case of continuing work which has been contracted out in the past, the Company will notify the Unionwhen a new contract is to be made for work which has been contracted out in the past and will, upon request, meet the Union concerning such work.

APPENDIX I - OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN
123
2010WABUSH MINES BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEE OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN
The purpose of the Operations Performance Incentive Plan (OPIP or Plan) is to encourage continuous improvements in certain areas including: energy utilization, labor productivity and other controllable production elements by providing incentive compensation to USWA represented employees for improvements in these areas. Financial benefits gained will be shared between the employees andthe Company.
General
♦	Plan Participants - All hourly and salaried bargaining unit employees of WABUSH Mines, are covered by this Plan.
♦	Employees who terminate prior to distribution of the awards shall not be eligibleto receivean award for the period.
♦	Periods containing shutdowns, idle productive capacity, or significant unplanned downtime may not qualify for incentive compensation and actual awards made for a calculation period may be proratedbased on actualtime worked.
♦	Students and temporary employees are not eligible.
♦	The OPIP is administered by the Financial Control and HumanResourcesfunctions.
♦ The Pian may be suspended or modified at the discretion ofthe Company.
PLAN PHILOSOPHY
♦	Cost control, cost reduction and increased productivity are vital to the long-term survival ofthe mine.
♦	The Pian is designed to reward employees for meeting or bettering the mine's current year objectives for operating specific metrics.
♦	The Plan is adaptable to the mine's evolving objectives and designedto be "self-funding" through achievement of performance targets.
METHOD OF BONUS CALCULATION AND PAYMENT
♦	The Bonus payment shall be determined by multiplying the appropriate hourly bonus amountsforthe Plan Quarter or Plan Year by the number of Hours for each employee during the Plan Quarter or Plan Year.
♦	The failure to meet the targets in one Plan Quarter shall not affect the calculation during the remaining (or preceding) Pian Quarters in the Plan Year.
♦	The Bonus amount for each employee will be paid on a calendar quarter and annual basis within 14 days of Cliffs Natural
125
Resources Inc's public release of its financial statement each quarter.
♦	Any payments made pursuant to this Plan shall not be included in the employee's earnings for purposes of determining any other pay, benefit or allowance.
COMMUNICATIONTO EMPLOYEES
♦	Quarterly and annual KPI with Plan Bonus per Plan Hour, shall be reported to employees periodically.
ADJUSTMENTS
♦	The Actual Operating Cost and Actual Productivity may be adjusted for the following factors when such changes materially affect Budgeted Operating Costs or Budgeted Productivityfor a period:
o	Changes in stripping ratio
(adjusted to actual)
o	Changes in timing of major furnace
repair
o	Other implemented events as
deemed appropriate by the Executive Vice President of Operations or Chief Executive Officer
♦	Generally, the Budgeted Operating Cost, Actual Operating Cost, Budgeted Productivity and Actual Productivity shall not be adjusted further for purposes of bonus measurement during the Plan Year or for any Plan Quarter calculation period. Changes in such factors as market
conditions and purchase prices or unexpected operating problems or financial penalties reflect the reality of the business environment and must be overcome by improved performance in order to beat the competition who face similar situations. Likewise, the mine may benefitfrom unusual favorable events. Following are examples of the limited unplanned (unbudgeted) events that may be considered by the senior operations officer and the CEO for possible adjustment of the bonus performance measurements if such individualadjustment has a material impact on costs or productivity for the period.
o Production volume changes (if greater than 100,000 tons) during the year due to a change in owners' actual requirements. A mine short fall against scheduled production would not be eligible for adjustment.
o	Major capital expenditure change,
e.g., significant cost improvement projects included in the budget that are delayed or cancelled due to unusual factors outside the mine's control.
o	Unusual penalties or refunds from
governmentalagencies.
o	Change in accounting principle.
o	Act of nature (e.g., fire, flood, etc.)
excluding"abnormal" weather.
o	New labor contract or bonus
payments.
127
o	Imprudent current cost reduction
action at the expense cf long-term results, or prudent current cost incurred to benefitfuture years.
o	Other substantial factors, e.g.,
inventory adjustment, in-process inventory change, asset write down,or"windfail" cost credit.
♦	If the mine requests an adjustment that would benefit the mine's bonus payout, the mine is expected to be equally objective in identifying any adjustments that would adversely impact the bonus payout.
♦	Any adjustments shall be made on a timely basis rather than waiting until Plan Year end. Any adjustments made during the Plan Year will not be applied to the payments made for previous Plan Quarter(s) but may be applied to the current Plan Quarter or future Plan Quarter payments in the Plan Year(s).
ACCESS TO INFORMATION
♦	The local union presidents, staff representative and/or designated representatives of the International Union shall have access to relevant information used in the annual mine cost budgeting process. Persons having access to information under this Plan may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement satisfactoryto the Company.
128
ADMINISTRATION
♦	This Plan will be administered by the Company in accordance with its terms and the costs of administration shall be the responsibilityof the Company.
♦	Any differences arising between the parties regarding the application of this Plan shall first be submitted to the Local Union Presidentand Company Director of Human Resources for resolution. If it is not resolved at that level, the matter will be referred to the Union staff representative and Company Vice president General Manager for resolution. Failing to reach agreement, either party may appeal the matter through the grievance procedure to arbitration. The arbitrator shall adhere to the standard of avoiding windfall gains or penalties to either the employees or the Company.

APPENDIX K- PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT COMMITMENT
134
PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT COMMITMENT
The parties are aware that intense domestic and international competition in the iron ore business including competition from electric furnace mini-mills demands aggressive steps to allow the company to remain a viable supplier to the domestic and international steel industry. The Company can only attract capital from its owners for necessary improvements so long as there are productivity improvements and other cost reductions resulting from those investments to justify the investment. Investment alone, however, will not ensure competitive, high quality products. The parties agree that even though Company employees have made contributions to improve productivity, much more must be accomplished. The way that work has traditionally been performed must change in order to ensure the future viability of the Company and enable it to provide its employees the quality of life they deserve. Employeesmustbebss restrictedand more efficient in the performance of their jobs. Employees will be required to function as they have not been required in the past. During the life of this collective agreement, the parties agree to develop means by which to maximize the effective use of the work force and equipment through implementing new and innovative approaches and the way work is performed. The CWS system will be utilized when required and the provisions of this document will not detract in any way from the rights and obligations of the partiesunderthe CWS system.
ProductivityImprovementCommittee
The parties will, from time to time at the request of either the Company or the Union, establish Productivity Improvement Committees. Each committee shall be made up of an equal number of hourly and salaried employees, not to exceed three of
135
each. Committee members shall be experienced in the area to be examined. Bargaining unit employees on the committee shall be selected by the Union. The specific purpose of each committee shall be agreed upon in advance by the Resident Manager and Local Union President. The general purpose of such committees shall be to examine operating and maintenance standards and practices to seek improvements that meet the guidelines of the Productivity Improvement Commitment of this Agreement. Such committeeswill meet promptly and regularly when established and will receive required technical assistance from appropriate Company and Union resources. Such committees shall have the duty and responsibility to work in good faith, consistentwith thisAgreement.
The committees shall develop specific findings and recommendations which shall be delivered jointly to the Resident Manager and the Local Union President. In the event the committees cannot reach consensus on all findings and recommendations they shall report such findings and recommendations as they may deem appropriate separate and apart from those upon which they do agree. The committees shall be dissolved after they report out unless they are extended by mutualagreement.
Upon receipt of the findings of the committees, the Resident Manager and Local Union President may:
1.	Approve the agreed upon findings and recommendations of the committee which shall then be implemented.
2.	Modify the findings and recommendations of the committees as they may mutually agree and implement them; or (3) disagree, in whole or in part, with the findings or recommendations submitted by the
136
committees.The application of this Agreement will not preclude either party from pursuing their existing rights and obligations under the collectiveagreement.

Early and Safe Return to Work		Revision Date: August 18, 2006
POLICY
Wabush Mines is committed returning an injured worker to safe and suitable employment in accordance with all legislative requirements and recognizes the importance of working with key stakeholders to accomplish this goal.
An authorized company representative will contact an injured worker as soon as possible after the injury to jointly develop an appropriate return to work plan. The plan will focus on the individual needs of each worker and will incorporate all relevant information. Workplace Health Safety and Compensation Commission's Policy RE-18 Hierarchy of Return to Work and Accommodation and Section 89 of the Workplace Health Safety and Compensation Act will be used as the foundation of return to work options. If an employee is unable to return to their preinjury position as a result of a work related injury, than the company will consider alternate options in accordance with section 89.1 of the Workplace Health Safety and Compensation Act as well as Human Rights legislation.
Workers will be treated fairly and consistently and are expected to participate and cooperate in the ESRW program. All managers are expected to understand and value the importance of returning an injured worker to work and must provide assistance where appropriate. Any personal information received or collected that can lead to the identification of an injured worker will be held in the strictest confidence. Information of a personal nature will be released only if required by law or with the approval of the worker who will specify the nature of the information to be released and to whom it can be released. This statement has been developed jointly by Union and Management consultation. Any issues arising from the goals in this statement will be monitored and evaluated through this joint consultation mechanism.

Early and Safe Return to Work		Revision Dale: August 18,2006
PURPOSE&OBJECTIVES
This procedure is to clarify the hierarchy of return to work priorities, the types of programs and the accommodation requirementsfor the various stages of returnto work.
To facilitate return to work services and programs Wabush Mines uses a hierarchical sequence, the goal of which is to safely return the worker to preinjury employment through an early and safe return to work program. This sequence is based on the Workplace Health Safety and Compensation Commission policies related to early and safe return to work.
Wabush Mines, Management, Union, workers and health care providers, should keep this hierarchy in mindwhen making decisionsregardingearly and safe return to work so that the injured worker's functional rehabilitations enhancedand facilitated by the return to work program.While the hierarchy i s intendedas a guideline for most cases, there may be situations where the prioritiesof a specific case may differ as the most effective method of returning the worker to the pre-injury, comparable, orsuitable employment. Modificationscan be made or purchased at any ofthe phases within the ESRW plan. All phasesshould be reviewed regularly and regular communications should occur with the injured worker. Where appropriate, the return to work plan should have a rehabilitative component, which uses work as part of the worker's physical recovery from the injury. There may be combinations of the return to work strategies that are appropriate for a particularworker's return to work program.

Early and Safe Return to Work		Revision Date August IS. 2006
The primary objective, where possible, isto maintain the worker's connection to the pre-injury job during the return to work program. The first priority in this procedure is to return the worker to the pre-injury job (with accommodation, as required) or to modify the pre-injuryjob. An alternate comparablejob may also be offered (referto WHSCC Policy RE-06 Alternative Work Comparable to the Pre-Injury Job). Where the specific functional abilities prevent a return to the preinjury or a comparablejob, then the most suitable work that is available must be offered to the worker. All the factors of the case must be considered when making decisions on return to work.
