ARTICLE 6	- UNION ACTIVITIES
6.01	There shall be no Union activities during working hours which interfere with the duties of any employee unless permission is first obtained from the employee's immediate supervisor. Such permission will not be unreasonably withheld and all such time off during any employee’s regular working hours shall be without loss of pay.
6.02	The Company will make available for the use of the Union one (1) bulletin boards whereon the Union may post notices which it desires to bring to the attention of employees provided that no such notice may be posted at places other than these bulletin boards. No such notice may be posted until it has been signed by an Officer of the Union and by a representative of management.
6.03	Upon the written request of the Union, the Company will grant leaves of absence without pay to the employees named in such request to enable them to participate in Union activities. No such leave of absence shall be for a period of less than one day or more than seven days except that where a leave is granted to an employee to enable him to attend a Union convention, the maximum of seven (7) days may be exceeded to the extent of necessary travel time to the place of convention and return. No more than eight (8) such leaves will be granted in any one year of the currency of this Agreement and no more than three (3) employees may be absent on such leave at any one time. If the maximum of eight (8) leaves in any year of this Agreement has been granted, the Company will consider any further request for such leave in that year on an individual basis. The Union shall promptly reimburse the Company, the wages paid to such employee.
6.04	Upon the written request of the Union, the Company will grant a leave of absence without pay to any employee for the purpose of attending to Union
7
6.05
6.05
business. Such leave of absence shall be for a period of not less than one (1) month and not more than two (2) employees shall be entitled to any such leave of absence at any one time. Where such leave is to be for a period of less than one (1) year, the Union shall specify the period to be covered. If the leave is expected to be required for a period in excess of one (1) year, it shall be treated as an indefinite leave of absence and the Company's approval of such leave shall be considered to continue throughout the life of this Agreement. To the extent that it is practical to do so, the Company will endeavour to arrange for the continuance of both Company and Government welfare benefits while an employee is absent on such leave.
With respect to employees granted leave of absence under the provisions of clause 6.04 above, it is agreed that on the written request of the Union:
(a)	Each employee shall receive from the Company in respect of each day of absence on such leave, an amount equivalent to:
(i) the regular straight-time hourly rate then in effect for his employment classification, multiplied by eight (8) hours or ten (10) hours, as applicable
-- LESS -(ii) all deductions normally withheld by law from an employee's pay and, if applicable, the employee's contributions to the Extended Group Insurance Plan and the Employee Savings and Investment Plan.
(b)	The Union shall promptly reimburse the Company for the sum of:
(i) the gross amount of the payment calculated as set out in (a) (i) above,
-- PLUS -(ii) any amount which becomes payable by the Company as a result of the Company having made to any employee a payment under the provisions of (a) above (e.g. Company contributions to the Employee Savings and Investment Plan, the Extended Group Insurance Plan, Employment Insurance, Government Pension Plan and Health Plan, etc.).
In the event of failure of the Union to so reimburse the Company, all payments to employees under (a) above shall immediately cease.
(c)	In consideration of the agreement of the Company to make payments as provided above, the Union agrees to indemnify the Company and save it harmless from and against any and all claims, payments, and costs of any kind which it may receive, make or suffer, directly or indirectly, through having agreed to make and having made such payments, deductions and contributions or by reason of any imputed employment relationship which might be alleged to exist between such employee and the Company by reason of the making of such payments.
8
6.06
6.07
The granting of any leave of absence under clauses 6.03 or 6.04 may be refused by the Company when the granting of the same would be unreasonable having regard to the requirements of operations.
(a)	Every Union Steward and every officer of the Union who is an employee shall be allowed such time off as may be necessary to enable him/her to attend those appointments with management personnel at which his/her presence is required under the grievance procedure in order to enable him/her to give evidence at such hearing.
(b)	Provided he/she is an employee, the Union Steward and the Chairperson, or his designate shall be allowed such time off with pay, as may be necessary to enable him/her to attend those appointments with management personnel at which his/her presence is required under the arbitration provisions of this collective agreement. In addition, the Company will pay the regular wages for employees called by the Union as arbitration witnesses, provided that such employees actually give evidence at the arbitration hearing on the day that they are off work at the Union’s request. The Union will act reasonably in all cases when making requests for employees to be released from work for purposes of their attendance at an arbitration hearing.
(c)	The Company will also be responsible for the wages for arbitration witnesses who would otherwise give testimony save for the Company making a preliminary objection, requesting an adjournment or seeking some other form of delay of which the Union was not previously notified. In the event that the Union is given advance notice of such Company position, the Union will only require those employees necessary for dealing with the preliminary issue to be absent from work. The Company will pay the regular wages for the grievor to attend at arbitration in all circumstances, provided that the grievor is still an active employee of the Company on the date of the arbitration hearing(s).
(d)	Should a Union Steward or Union Officer be scheduled to be on duty during the time in which a regularly scheduled meeting of the general membership of the Union is to be held, such Steward shall (provided his/her request is made at least four (4) days in advance) be allowed such time off work as may be reasonably required in the circumstances to permit him/her to attend such meeting.
(e)	The allowing of time off under the provisions of this Article 6 shall be subject to the employee having obtained permission to leave his/her work from his/her Supervisor.
(f)	All such time off under the provisions of Article 6 during an employee's regular working hours shall be without loss of pay. However, the Company may discontinue paying for such time off, if, in its opinion, the privilege of requesting such time off under any provision of Article 6 is being abused.

ARTICLE 7 7.01
When stewards are elected or otherwise appointed to such position, every effort shall be made by the Union to ensure adequate steward representation on all shifts and days of work.
At the request of the Union, the Company will grant time off, without loss of pay during the employee's regular working hours, to the President, the Plant Chairperson, one (1) employee from the Inside seniority list, one (1) employee from the Outside seniority list, and one (1) Member-at-Large to allow them to be members of the Union Negotiating Committee and to enable them to attend arranged meetings with Company representatives or with a Conciliation Officer for the purpose of negotiating a renewal of this Collective Agreement.

The Company will provide the designated Plant Chairperson with eight (8) regular hours of pay per week to attend to Plant Chair duties.
The Company will provide a further three (3) days per month to be used by the President or the Financial Secretary to attend to Union business.
The Company will provide the designated Union Health and Safety Committee Representative, the designated WSIB/Placement Representative, the designated Women’s Advocate and the designated Substance Abuse Representative with time off without loss of pay on an as required basis to deal with applicable issues.
It is understood that the taking of such time away from regular duties for each designate referenced in clause 6 above shall be kept to a minimum and that permission will not therefore, be unreasonably withheld. In addition, such designates will first seek permission from his/her supervisor prior to conducting such duties and will notify his/her supervisor upon return to work.
The Union Stewards herein referred to shall be employees of the Company and shall not be greater than six (6) in number. The Union will notify the Company in writing of the names of such stewards and will also notify the Company of the names of six (6) alternate stewards who may serve in the absence from work of a regular steward. The Company will not recognize any individual as a steward until it has received such notification from the Union.
- GRIEVANCES
The parties acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties’ recognition of this principle has contributed stability and certainty to the grievance procedure. Accordingly the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violates the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
10
However, in those instances where the National Union CAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee, has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative, the National Union CAW may inform the Coca-Cola Labour Relations Director in writing, that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is specifically understood however, that the Company shall not be responsible for any liabilities which may have accrued from the date of the initial withdrawal of the grievance by the Union, up to and including the date on which the grievance is reinstated.
In addition, in those instances where the Company, by either its Director of Labour Relations or a Coca-Cola Bottling Executive member, has reviewed the disposition of a Company grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Company or a Company representative, the Company may inform the National Union CAW in writing, that such Company grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is specifically understood however, that the Union shall not be responsible for any liabilities which may have accrued from the date of the initial withdrawal of the Company grievance, up to and including the date on which the grievance is reinstated.
7.02	(a) In this Agreement a "grievance" shall consist only of a difference concerning the
interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable.
(b)	Should any complaint or misunderstanding arise which is not a "grievance" as defined above and if the matter is not resolved with reasonable promptness, it may be taken up through the procedure provided herein for the hearing of grievances; it being understood and agreed, however, that such a matter shall not, under any circumstances, be taken to arbitration.
(c)	If any question arises as to whether a particular difference is or is not a grievance within the meaning of this Agreement, that question may be taken up through the grievance procedure and determined, if necessary, by arbitration.
(d)	There shall be an earnest effort on the parties to this agreement to deal with grievances promptly through the procedures outlined below; however, time limits specified in the grievance procedure may be extended by mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union.
(e)	A grievance shall not be considered where the grievance originated more than fifteen (15) working days after the employee and/or the Union became aware of the circumstances or ought reasonably to have been aware of the circumstances giving rise to the grievance. For the purpose of this Article, Public Holidays, Saturday and Sunday shall not be considered working days.
11
(f)
7.03
7.04
A Steward shall be permitted reasonable time off work without loss of his/her regular pay for purposes of investigating and processing grievances. Such time off shall be granted within 24 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, unless a Steward is available at work on Saturday or Sunday. The steward shall first seek permission from his/her supervisor and will notify his/her supervisor upon their return to work. It is understood that the taking of such time away from regular duties shall be kept to a minimum and that permission will not, therefore, be unreasonably withheld.
INDIVIDUAL GRIEVANCE
An employee who has a complaint or a grievance will ordinarily discuss the matter with his immediate supervisor and if the matter is not resolved in that discussion, he may refer the question to a Steward for consideration. However, should the nature of the complaint or grievance be such that the employee prefers to refer it to a Steward first, then he may do so.
Step 1
If a complaint or grievance is referred by an employee to a Steward and if the Steward considers that there may be a reasonable basis for the complaint or grievance, the employee and/or the Steward may refer the matter orally to the appropriate management representative within fifteen (15) working days of the time the grievor became aware, or should have become aware, of the event giving rise to the grievance.
Step 2
If the complaint or grievance remains unsettled for three (3) working days after its presentation at Step 1 it will within a further five (5) working days be referred in writing at Step 2 by the steward in sufficient detail to define the issue, to the appropriate management representative (or his designate). Step 2 meetings shall be held on a bi-weekly basis, and the grievor and Steward may be present.
Step 3
If the complaint or grievance remains unsettled for ten (10) working days after its presentation at Step 2, it may, within ten (10) working days after the hearing at Step 2 be referred in writing at Step 3, to the appropriate management representative. Within thirty (30) working days of the submission of a complaint or grievance at Step 3 the management representative (and/or such other persons, up to two (2) in number, as he may designate) shall meet with the employee, the Plant Chairperson and President, the Steward and a National Representative, or his designate, to discuss the matter. The Company's decision will be given in writing, with sufficient explanations, to the employee and the Union within five (5) working days after such meeting.
COLLECTIVE GRIEVANCE
Should a group of two (2) or more employees who have a complaint or grievance based upon the same provision or provisions of this Agreement or upon similar facts, desire to have such matter dealt with collectively rather than
12
as individual complaints or grievances, they may do so within the time limits outlined in 7.03, Step 1 herein. Such grievance or complaint shall commence at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
7.05
7.06
7.07
7.08
7.09
COMPANY/UNION GRIEVANCE
Should any grievance or complaint arise directly between the Company and the Union it shall be submitted to the other party within the time limits outlined in 7.03 Step 1 herein. Such grievance or complaint shall commence at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
SUSPENSION OR DISCHARGE
(a)	When an employee is to be suspended or discharged, the steward shall be present as outlined in 3.04 herein. The reasons for such suspension or discharge will be given at the time of the suspension or discharge and will also be confirmed in writing as outlined in 3.04 herein. The Company shall provide a copy of the disciplinary letter to the Plant Chairperson or designate.
(b)	Grievances relating to the suspension or discharge of any employee shall be submitted directly at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure within the time limits outlined in 7.03 Step 1 herein. In the event that it should be decided that the suspension or discharge of any employee is without just cause, the Company shall reinstate such employee and pay full compensation at the employee's regular hourly rate for time lost (to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week) after written complaint against such suspension or discharge has been received by the Company. Upon such reinstatement, there shall be deemed to have been no break in such employee's service with the Company.
APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIVE
The "appropriate management representative" as referred to in the grievance procedures shall be as follows:
Step 1	Supervisor
Step 2	Department Manager or	designate
Step 3	Sales Centre Manager or designate
GRIEVANCE TIME LIMITS
The Company and Union agree that the time limits contained in the Grievance Procedure (Article 7) are discretionary in nature and are to be used as guidelines, except for the time limits to file a grievance at Step 1 and to refer a grievance to arbitration which shall be considered mandatory. Either party may request an extension of the time limits for referring a grievance to arbitration, in writing. Otherwise, the matter shall be deemed to be abandoned.
ARBITRATION
13
Any grievance which is not satisfactorily resolved may be submitted to arbitration by the Company or the Union by notifying the other party in writing within thirty (30) working days of the written decision at Step 3 of the grievance procedure of its intention to proceed to arbitration as provided for in Appendix "A” hereto. It is understood and agreed that complaints and misunderstandings as referred to in clause 7.02 (b) hereof, shall not be arbitrable.
Any matter referred to arbitration as provided for in Article 7 hereof shall be heard by a single arbitrator who shall be chosen having regard to his impartiality, his qualifications in the interpretation of agreements and his familiarity with industrial matters.
An earnest effort will be made by both the Company and the Union to reach mutual agreement on the person to be requested to serve as arbitrator but if such agreement cannot be reached within fifteen (15) working days of the date of notice of arbitration, then the parties shall request the Minister of Labour for the Province of Ontario to make the appointment.
7.10	MEDIATION
The Company and the Union agree that there is a mutual benefit to the mediation process that has been developed and endorsed over the past several years. As a result, in addition to the regular arbitration procedure provided for herein, the Company and Union Chairperson or designate may, by mutual agreement, refer a grievance (s) to a mediation process. This process does not prejudice either party’s right to pursue such grievance (s) at arbitration. The mediator will be selected by mutual agreement and the parties will equally share the cost of the mediator. In an effort to better appreciate the benefits of mediation, the Company and the Union agree to fully disclose all relevant facts of the grievance at the third step meeting.
ARTICLE 8 - SENIORITY
8.01	(a) Seniority of an employee shall mean the length of his continuous service;
after completion of the probationary period as outlined in Article 2.05; with the Company in the Bargaining Unit covered by this Collective Agreement, except as provided in Articles 8.01 (b) and (c) below.
(b)	It is agreed that clause 8.01(a) above shall not be applied to alter any seniority date which has been established prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
(c)	An employee who is or has been transferred from the Bargaining Unit to a job with the Company outside the Bargaining Unit may only return to the Unit to fill a vacancy which would otherwise be filled by a new hire. In such a case, the employee's seniority date would be the date on which he re-entered the Unit.
(d)	An employee who transfers from another CCB location of the Company as a result of that employee’s work being transferred to the Hamilton location shall
14
8.02
8.03
8.04
8.05
8.06
retain his/her seniority status at the Hamilton location determined using his/her seniority date from the transferred facility provided that facility has a reciprocal agreement.
For the purposes of this Article 8, inside employees, outside employees and office employees shall be considered as separate seniority groups.
Separate seniority lists shall be maintained by the Company for each of the seniority groups referred to in clause 8.02 above, showing the name and seniority date of each employee who has acquired seniority under this Agreement. If two or more employees are hired on the same day, the times of hiring will determine their seniority ranking.
These lists will be brought up to date every three (3) months and, at each revision, will be posted on the Union bulletin board for a period of five (5) working days. During that interval, any employee whose name appears on the list for the first time may question his seniority ranking if he is in disagreement with it. If no written complaint is received by the Company within five (5) working days of the posting of a seniority list, the revisions contained in that list shall be deemed to be correct by all concerned.
A copy of each updated list will be mailed to the Union Office and a copy given to the Plant Chairperson or designate.
An employee's service with the Company shall be broken if that employee:
(a)	quits,
(b)	is laid off for a period of eighteen (18) months or more,
(c)	is discharged and is not reinstated,
(d)	fails to return to work on the expiration of any period of leave granted by the Company unless excused by the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
(e)	is absent from work for more than three (3) consecutive working days without having notified the Company and received permission to be absent, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld,
(f)	otherwise ceases to be employed by the Company.
In making transfers, promotions, demotions, layoffs, and recalls from layoffs, seniority shall govern, provided the employee can satisfactorily fulfil the normal requirements of the job.
JOB POSTING
(a)	When a regular full-time job in the Inside or Outside seniority group becomes vacant, the Company shall post a notice of such job vacancy on the Union bulletin board for a period of five (5) working days. During that period, any regular employee in the Inside or Outside seniority group may make written application for the vacant job and all such applications will receive consideration in accordance with the provisions of Clause 8.05. For certain technical or highly skilled jobs (e.g. Equipment Service Trainee, Equipment Service Technician); the Company may require qualification testing prior to the

applicant being considered for a job vacancy. The job posting will state the classification, function, shift, hours of work and rate of pay.
It is understood and agreed by the parties that an employee wishing to transfer between seniority groups under these arrangements must be capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. In keeping with that understanding, it is agreed that a three (3) month trial period shall apply from the date of transfer during which the transfer may be reversed, if so requested by the employee or by the Company. In such case, the reverting employee may displace the employee who replaced him in his previous position.
(b)	The Company will select the successful applicant within five (5) working days of the close of the posting period and will within a further three (3) days, advise the employees in the seniority group concerned of its decision by posting that information on the Union bulletin board.
(c)	The job vacancies which may be created as a result of the selection of an employee under the provisions of 8.06(a) and (b) hereof shall also be posted in accordance with the provisions of those paragraphs.
(d)	If an employee was absent on vacation or an approved leave of absence not exceeding eight (8) weeks, excepting Maternity/Parental Leave,_at the time of posting of a job for which he is qualified, he may apply for consideration for that job within five (5) days of his return to work, and if accepted by the Company, he shall then displace any employee previously selected to fill such vacancy.
(e)	Any job vacancy (or vacancies) which may be created as a result of the selection of an employee to fill a job vacancy posted under the provisions of 8.06(c) may be filled by the Company in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof, but posting of such ensuing vacancy (or vacancies) shall not be required.
(f)	In the event that the Company has no employee in a seniority group who can satisfactorily fulfil the normal requirements of a job vacancy in that seniority group, and if there is, at that time, no qualified employee on layoff from any other seniority group covered by this Agreement who wishes to exercise the right of temporary transfer provided for in clause 8.09(d) hereof, the Company may hire a new employee to fill such vacancy. The Company may fill any vacancy, temporarily, pending completion of procedures set out herein.
(g)	Where possible, the Company will provide personal preference in the assignment of regular duties. Selection for these assignments will be dictated by operational needs and will not be exercised in a discriminatory manner. It is agreed that it shall remain the sole responsibility of the Company to determine the number of experienced personnel required on any job or shift.”
(h)	A copy of each job posting and notice of successful applicant will be given to the Local Union and copies of same will also be e-mailed to the Plant Chairperson or designate.
16
8.07	(a) It is understood and agreed that the provisions of clause 8.06 shall apply only
in the case of "permanent” vacancies. However, when there is a temporary vacancy in a seniority group (including vacancies created by the addition of temporary shifts), and the Company expects such work to be available for a period of four (4) or more working days, if on a 4 x 10 shift, or five (5) or more working days, if on a 5 x 8 shift, the Company shall, insofar as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, make such temporary assignment available to qualified employees on a seniority basis. For this purpose, seniority shall be recognized within the following seniority groupings:
Inside employees	Outside employees
Warehouse Person	Sales Representative
Garage	Delivery Driver
Sales Equipment Service	Transport Driver
On completion of such a temporary assignment, the affected employee will revert to his regular job and/or shift, provided such work is available for him, or otherwise he shall be re-assigned having regard to his seniority and the provisions of this Agreement.
Where possible, the Company will provide personal preference for temporary assignments. Selection for these assignments will be dictated by operational needs and will not be exercised in a discriminatory manner. It is agreed that it shall remain the sole responsibility of the Company to determine the number of experienced personnel required on any job or shift.
In the event that a position which has been filled on a temporary basis should continue to be required for a period in excess of six (6) months, such position will thereupon be considered as a "permanent" position and shall then be posted as provided for in clause 8.06 hereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it is agreed that in making any temporary promotion in the outside seniority group the Company will, whenever practical, endeavour to give due consideration to the relative seniority of the available and qualified employees.
(b)	When in the judgement of the Company it is practical, appropriate and timely to do so, the Company will endeavour to make available to employees who are likely to be candidates for a promotion (and who would otherwise be qualified for such promotion) or who are likely to be subject to layoff, the opportunity of receiving such training as may be necessary to enable them to satisfactorily perform the work so made available to them. An employee who has received such training shall not then be entitled to refuse an assignment to the position for which he has been trained.
8.08	DEMOTIONS
If, as the direct result of a reduction in the work force, one or more demotions should become necessary, it is agreed that the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof
17
8.09
shall be observed. It is understood, however, that this clause 8.08 shall not apply in the case of an employee who is demoted as a result of his misconduct or his inability to satisfactorily perform the work required; it being further understood, however, that if within three (3) months of receiving a promotion an employee requests to be relieved of his new responsibilities or is demoted due to his inability to satisfactorily perform such new duties, he shall be permitted to revert to his former position and in so doing may displace the employee who succeeded him in that position.
LAYOFFS
Whenever layoffs in a seniority group are necessary, they shall be accomplished as follows:
(a)	The Company shall first layoff temporary employees and then probationary employees, if any, in that seniority group. If further reduction of staff is required, the Company shall then lay off regular employees in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof, it being understood that, in this instance, seniority is reversed (i.e. the most junior man will be the first laid off). If any regular employee is to be laid off for a period of more than five (5) working days, he shall receive five (5) days written notice of such layoff and the Union shall be provided with a copy of same. Layoff notices will expire after three (3) months.
It is mutually agreed that for the purposes of administration of the foregoing paragraph, the term "in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05" shall mean that the following procedure will be observed:
(i)	any regular employee for whom work is not available may displace the less senior employee within the same shift and department, providing he has greater seniority;
-or-
(ii)	the employee displaced in (i) above may then displace the less senior employee whose job he is capable of satisfactorily performing within the same shift, providing he has greater seniority;
-or-
(iii)	the employee displaced in (ii) above may then displace the less senior employee within his seniority group whose job he is capable of satisfactorily performing.
A regular employee may displace a less senior employee in accordance with points (i), (ii) and (iii) above only if such employee can satisfactorily fulfill the normal requirements of the job occupied by the less senior employee.
(b)	An employee having seniority standing in the Inside or Outside seniority group who is laid off shall have the option of:
18
(i)	displacing a temporary or probationary employee in the Inside or Outside seniority group, or
(ii)	if there are no temporary or probationary employees to be displaced, of displacing the most junior employee in the Inside or Outside seniority group,
provided that such employee submits a written request for such temporary transfer to another Inside or Outside seniority group and is capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. It is understood that junior employees shall be laid off in sufficient numbers to permit the exercising of this option and that the resulting temporary transfer of more senior employees shall not become effective until the commencement of the next regular day of work scheduled for the employee to be displaced. The transferred employee will receive the rate of pay of the job to which he is assigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Company is able to arrange the transfer between seniority groups without the one (1) day waiting period, it shall do so.
(c)	An employee exercising the option outlined in (b) above, shall not acquire seniority in the group to which he is transferred, but shall retain his recall rights in his original seniority group. In the event of a layoff, the employee would be able to exercise his seniority for any vacant non-posted positions.
(d)	The Company shall maintain a list of employees (other than probationary or temporary employees) laid off by it from each seniority group within the prior eighteen (18) months and such list shall show the seniority of such employees. A copy of the daily layoff list will be provided to the local Union Plant Chairperson. When workers are required for a seniority group, the layoff list for that seniority group will be examined and, to the extent of the number of jobs available, the employees listed therein will be recalled from transfer or layoff in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof. If, following such recalls, there is still a deficiency of workers in the Inside or Outside seniority groups, then employees on the layoff list from the other (Inside or Outside) seniority group shall be offered, in seniority order, the option of transferring temporarily to the vacant position. Such temporary transfers shall be subject to the provisions of clause 8.09(c) hereof.
(e)	Employees being recalled shall be notified by telephone as soon as is practical. It shall remain the responsibility of the employee to ensure that the Company has an up to date telephone number. In the event that an employee is unable to be reached by telephone, the Company will move to the next name on the recall list, and shall then send a registered letter to the employee requesting him to notify the Company if they wish to remain on the seniority list. Failure to respond to the registered letter within five (5) working days of receipt shall result in the employee’s name being removed from the seniority list. Prior to sending such registered letter, the Company shall notify the Plant Chairperson or designate.

ARTICLE 9 -
9.01
9.02
9.03	(a)
Notwithstanding anything herein contained it is agreed that if an outside employee has not presented himself for assignment of the day's work prior to the time his shift is scheduled to commence he shall be considered to be unavailable for work on that shift and in such circumstances the layoff provisions set out above shall have no application.
It is mutually agreed that an employee who would otherwise be on layoff may request that part or all of such layoff period be regarded as annual vacation time and be paid accordingly. The Company will honour such requests, provided that the employee has sufficient unused vacation entitlement to accommodate the request.
An employee covered by this agreement who wishes to transfer to another CCB location represented by any Bargaining Unit which has the same reciprocal language or similar transfer provisions may notify the Company in writing of his/her desire to do so. When following completion of the job posting procedures, a vacancy exists at such desired new locations, the employee requesting the transfer shall be offered the opportunity of filling the vacancy in preference to a new hire. On assignment to the new location, the employee will be credited with his original seniority date, provided, however, that he will not be permitted to exercise full seniority under the job posting procedure during the first six months at the new location. For purposes of this provision, employees will be classed as "inside employees” or "outside employees”, and it is understood that in exercising this provision, the employee must remain within such current classification. It is also agreed that an employee wishing to accept a transfer under these provisions must do so within five (5) days of receiving the job offer and must report for duty at the new location within sixty (60) days of the job offer or such job offer may be withdrawn by the Company.
- HOURS OF WORK -- OVERTIME
The workweek shall commence at midnight Saturday-Sunday and all work performed in a shift or other similar work period (including any extension thereof) shall be deemed to have been performed in the same day in which the majority of hours are worked.
For the purposes of this Agreement, time worked shall be calculated in units of six (6) minutes and periods of work of less than six (6) minutes per day shall be disregarded.
BASIC WORK WEEK
The basic workweek for regular full-time employees shall consist of either five (5) eight (8) hour days or four (4) ten (10) hour days. Temporary employees will be assigned work subject to Article 2.06 on an as needed basis. The Company does not guarantee, however, to provide work for any employee nor to maintain the work week or working hours presently in force. Employees on the 8 hour shifts will be scheduled for five consecutive days with two consecutive days off. Employees on the 10 hour shifts will be scheduled for four consecutive days with three consecutive days off. However, it is
20
9.04
recognized that the consecutive days off may overlap work weeks. Further, this clause is not intended to guarantee two (2) or three (3) consecutive days off if changing the weekly shifts from one week to the next prohibits this.
(b)	LOST SHIFT MAKE-UP & PULL BACK (Articles (b), (c) and (d))
In the event that a regular employee (including a probationary employee) has been laid off for at least one day during his scheduled work week, he shall have the option of displacing the least senior or a temporary employee who is scheduled to work in his department on one of his scheduled off days in that work week provided he is capable of satisfactorily performing the work required and provided that such shift is not scheduled to begin or end within eight (8) hours of the employee’s regular shift. Such work will be performed at regular straight time hourly rates plus any night shift, Saturday or Sunday premium, if applicable.
(c)	If the Company has need to use a temporary employee on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, such work will first be offered to regular employees (including probationary employees) in that department who are not scheduled to work on that day. Such offer of work will be made on a seniority basis to such employees who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required and provided such substitute shift is not scheduled to begin or end within 8 hours of the employee’s regular shift. If a regular employee accepts the Sunday, Monday or Tuesday work, he will be paid straight time and his previously scheduled shift for that week will be reduced by an equivalent number of days, starting from the last scheduled day of the week. If any employee hereunder works a combination of 8 and 10 hour shifts in a week and such combination results in work being performed in excess of 40 hours in the week, the employee shall not be paid at the overtime rate for such excess hours worked in the week. Employees who wish to be offered such work will be asked to sign a list maintained by the Department Manager indicating a desire to be called for such work. Only employees who sign such list will be called. Employees may add or delete their name from such list at their option.
(d)	In applying Article 9.03 (b) and (c), the Company will advise the appropriate employees either by telephone or in person of the opportunity to work a substitute shift. Employees must either accept or refuse the substitute shift when offered. If the employee fails to answer the phone call, he will be bypassed as if he had refused and the supervisor will continue calling the next employees by seniority. However, if the supervisor is able to leave a message at the employee’s phone number, the employee may return the call to that supervisor and may claim an available substitute shift if it is still available at the time of the return call.
OVERTIME PAY
Overtime at the rate of time and one half (1 %) of the employee’s regular rate of pay will be paid for all hours worked in excess of a employee’s eight (8) or ten (10) hour days or an employee’s scheduled day off. Staffing shall be administered as per article 9.09 outlining the Priority for Staffing.
21
9.05
9.06
9.07
An employee who works on one of his/her scheduled days off will be compensated at the rate of time and one half (1 %) the regular rate of pay for all hours worked.
An employee who works on his/her second or third scheduled day off in a week will be compensated at the rate of two (2) times his/her regular rate of pay provided the employee has previously worked on one of their previously scheduled days off.
An employee, other than an employee whose regular schedule includes Sunday, shall be compensated for all hours required to be worked on Sunday at two (2) times the employee’s regular rate of pay.
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY PREMIUMS
Every regular full-time hourly rated employee who is regularly scheduled to work on a Saturday and/or Sunday shall, while so scheduled, be paid a premium as shown below:
For Saturday	$1.50
For Sunday	$1.75
for work performed by him and required by the Company, unless he is entitled under the other provisions of this Article to be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1-1.5) or two (2) times his hourly rate, as the case may be, for work so performed by him and required by the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement, such premiums shall not be considered as forming part of an employee's hourly rate.
REPORTING PAY
Should any employee who reports for work at his scheduled time, not having been previously notified to the contrary, shall be entitled to a minimum of four (4) hours pay at the rate of pay to which he would have been entitled for the work he had been scheduled to perform on that day, but it is agreed that he shall perform any suitable work for this four (4) hour period, if so required. However, it shall remain the responsibility of an employee who has been absent from work to check with the Company to determine if work is available before returning for work on that shift. If any employee is absent from work with approval on a Friday, it will be presumed that he will be available for work on the following Monday, unless he advises the Company to the contrary. Therefore, should such an employee be unable to report by Monday, he must notify the Company to that effect prior to his scheduled start time.
BREAKS
(a)	Every employee will be allowed one (1) paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes during each one-half (%) shift. Rest periods will be arranged as near the mid-point of each one-half (%) shift as possible.
22
9.08
9.08
(b)	Where it is anticipated that an employee will perform additional work required by the Company for a period of two (2) hours or more immediately following his normal work period of eight (8) or ten (10) hours, he shall be granted a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes, with pay, as close to the commencement of the additional work as is possible or, at the employee’s option, shall be paid for the fifteen (15) minutes.
(c)	A 30 minute unpaid lunch break is provided to Delivery Drivers, IPT Drivers and Equipment Service Employees to be used between the 4th and 6th hours of work but subject to meeting business and customer needs and legal requirements.
OVERTIME ASSIGNMENT
(a)	Pre-Scheduled Overtime
The Company will endeavour, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to assign planned overtime work (i.e. overtime scheduled at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance) to employees who are not scheduled to work on that day on the following basis:
(i)	Such opportunity will first be made available on a seniority basis to those regular employees who normally perform the work at which such overtime is required. For this purpose, the expression "normally perform the work” shall be defined on the "inside” as Warehouse Worker (including Shipper/Receiver), Sales Equipment Service and Garage; on the "outside” as Sales Representatives, Delivery Drivers and Transport Drivers.; and
(ii)	in the event that the Company's needs cannot be entirely satisfied in that manner, the overtime opportunity will then be made available on a seniority basis to other regular hourly rated employees in the same seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required;
(iii)	In the event that the Company’s needs are still not satisfied, the overtime opportunity may be offered to probationary and temporary employees in the seniority group after an offer and refusal by regular full-time employees in both seniority groups.
(b)	Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from using temporary employees, properly employed under Article 2.06, to perform the work in order to avoid the necessity of pre-scheduled overtime, provided the temporary employee has worked fewer than 5 days in that week (or four days if employed on a 10 hour shift).
(c)	Un-Scheduled Overtime
23
9.09
In the case of unscheduled overtime, other than overtime to be performed as a continuation of work in process, the Company will endeavour, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to make such overtime available on a seniority basis to regular employees on the following basis:
(i)	in the appropriate department;
(ii)	then to regular employees in the appropriate seniority group;
(iii)	in the event that the Company’s needs are still not satisfied, the overtime opportunity may be offered to probationary and temporary employees in the seniority group;
who are available on the Company's premises at the time such overtime is to commence and who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
(d)	If the unscheduled overtime work is for a pre-shift period, the overtime shall be offered and assigned in the same manner as above to employees on that incoming shift.
(e)	It is understood that to facilitate the distribution of overtime work, employees may be required to indicate their desire for such assignments by signing an "employees available for overtime" list. Employees who sign the list for overtime and refuse to work the overtime on three occasions within a three month period shall be excluded for overtime for three consecutive months from the last date of refusal. It is further understood that in the event that all overtime requirements cannot be filled on a voluntary basis, such work may then be assigned (subject to applicable law) on a reverse-seniority basis to those employees in the appropriate seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
(f)	It is agreed that the Company will not normally offer opportunities for overtime work if doing so may reasonably be expected to result in an employee working more than thirteen (13) consecutive hours. However, in the event that an employee should work for more than thirteen (13) consecutive hours (excluding unpaid meal breaks), he shall not be considered available for any assignment until eleven (11) hours have elapsed from the completion of the overtime assignment. In such an event, the Company will make every reasonable effort to reschedule, by up to two (2) hours, the start time of the employee's next regularly scheduled shift so that he will still have the opportunity to work a regular eight (8) hour shift or regular ten (10) hour shift.
(g)	All overtime to be worked by employees must be approved, in advance, by the Company.
PRIORITY FOR STAFFING
Where extra shifts are available, the priority for staffing those extra shifts will be as follows:
(i) regular employees (including probationary employees) exercising rights under Article 9.03 (b);
24
9.10
ARTICLE 10
10.01
ARTICLE 11 -11.01 (a)
(ii)	regular employees (including probationary employees) exercising rights under Article 9.03 (c);
(iii)	temporary employees engaged at straight time rates as contemplated in Article 9.08 (b);
(iv)	overtime as set out in Article 9.08 (a);
(v)	overtime as set out in Article 9.08 (e).
CALL-OUT
Where an employee has left the Company's Plant on completion of his day's work and is then called by the Company and requested to return to work at a time before the commencement of his next schedule day's work, such request shall constitute a "call-out". An employee reporting for work on a "call-out" shall be entitled to be paid for work performed by him outside his scheduled working hours at the rate of time and one-half (1%) times his hourly rate or four (4) hours' work at his hourly rate, whichever is greater.
-- NIGHT SHIFT PREMIUM
Every hourly-rated employee shall be paid a night shift premium of one dollar ($1.00) per hour for work performed by him and required by the Company after five (5:00) p.m. in a day and before five (5:00) a.m. in the following day, however, such premiums shall not be paid for any time worked in respect of which overtime premium is payable. For the purposes of this Agreement, such night shift premium shall not be considered as forming part of an employee's hourly rate. In the event of the introduction of four (4) by ten (10) work weeks, the above night shift hours will be revised accordingly.
- HOLIDAY PAY
The expression "holiday" wherever used in this Agreement, shall mean any one of the following:
DAY OF NEW YEAR'S EVE
NEW YEAR'S DAY
DAY AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAY
GOOD FRIDAY
VICTORIA DAY
DOMINION DAY
CIVIC HOLIDAY
LABOUR DAY
THANKSGIVING DAY
DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
CHRISTMAS DAY
BOXING DAY
Effective in the calendar year 2002, regular employees shall be entitled to one “Float Holiday.” Such day shall be scheduled between the employee and his supervisor.
25
(b)
(c)
11.02
11.03
11.04
If a holiday should be declared by government which is not listed above and which is to be generally observed in the Province of Ontario, such holiday shall be observed and paid by the Company under the same terms and conditions as apply to the holidays which are listed above.
A regular full-time employee required to work on a day observed as a paid holiday shall be paid two (2) times their regular rate of pay. The "Priority for Staffing” shall be followed in assigning work for non-statutory paid holidays.
Should any of the holidays mentioned above fall on a Saturday or on a Sunday, the regular working day which is closet thereto will normally be designated as the holiday. If an employee should be scheduled to have one of his regular days off on a day designated as a day to be observed as a holiday, that employee shall be allowed to shorten their work week or opt for another day off with pay in lieu of the holiday with pay. For purposes of this Agreement, such lieu day will be considered as his "holiday”. If, however, any question should arise as to the day in the year to be designated as any one of the holidays mentioned above, the Company shall decide the question for purposes of this Agreement. If an employee should be scheduled to have one of his regular days off on a day designated as a day to be observed as a holiday, that employee shall be allowed another day off with pay in lieu of the holiday with pay and, for purposes of this Agreement, such lieu day will be considered as his "holiday". The Employer further agrees not to switch employees back to 5x8 to alter this clause.
Where it is expected that a regular full time employee will be laid off on_a day following a holiday listed in Article 11.01 and another employee or employees will accrue a lieu day as a result of the holiday, the employee who will accrue the lieu day will take the lieu day on the day following the holiday. To the extent that it is possible, the most junior employees who have accrued the above -mentioned lieu days will take the lieu days in sufficient numbers to match the number of employees laid off.
Each employee who has completed his probationary period shall receive holiday pay for each such holiday, provided that he is at work on his last regular workday before the holiday and his first regular workday after the holiday. An employee's holiday pay for each such holiday, shall be an amount equal to his regular hourly rate, multiplied by
8 hours if scheduled for a 5 x 8 hour work week
10 hours if scheduled for a 4 x 10 hour work week
7-1/2 hours for office employees
If, in the week in which the holiday falls, an employee works in two (2) different wage classifications, he will be paid for the holiday at the wage rate in effect for the classification in which he works on the day following the holiday.
An employee who was absent on his last regular workday before and/or his first regular workday after the holiday will qualify for holiday pay (as set out in clause 11.03 above) if such absence:
26
(a)	is paid for under the provisions of clause 15.01 hereof (Bereavement Pay),
---or---
(b)	is paid for under the provisions of clause 16.01 hereof (pay for Jury or Witness Duty),
---or---
(c)	has been approved by the Company,
---or---
(d)	is due to a layoff which commenced not more than five (5) working days prior to the holiday or on the first work day after the holiday, provided, however, that such holiday pay shall not be payable if the employee is eligible for full or partial payment for the day on which the holiday is observed under any other clause of this Agreement or from any plan or fund to which the Company contributes (e.g. the Company's Extended Group Insurance Plan, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, Employment Insurance, Government Pension Plan, etc.).
ARTICLE 12 -- VACATION
12.01
12.02
12.03
12.04
12.05
The vacation year shall be the calendar year. Employees will not be entitled to vacation until after they have completed one complete calendar year of employment. During the first year of employment, an employee shall be paid four percent (4%) of their earnings from their start date until December 31st. During the first complete calendar year of employment, employees shall not be entitled to receive time off for the purposes of vacation, but may be granted a leave of absence without pay for time off as required by the employee.
Vacation entitlements will be taken in the year following that in which they were accrued. The length of vacation to which each employee will be entitled will be governed by the total length of his continuous service with the Company, and will be determined from the schedule in clause 12.04 below.
The amount of pay to which each employee will be entitled in respect of his vacation will be determined in accordance with clause 12.04 below. The earnings on which the calculation will be based shall be total earnings from the Company for the calendar year of service in respect of which the vacation is granted including any premium pay (overtime, night shift, etc.) and pay for time not worked (vacation, observed holidays, sick pay, etc.).
Schedule of Vacation With Pay Entitlement
Length of Service Length of Vacation	%of Earnings Payable
1 but less than 5 yrs.	2 weeks	4%
5 but less than 10 yrs.	3 weeks	6%
10 but less than 20 yrs.	4	weeks	8%
20 but less than 30 yrs.	5	weeks	10%
After 30 years' service	6	weeks	12%
If an employee's vacation pay calculated on the basis of his regular hourly rate, multiplied by forty (40) hours for each week of vacation to be taken would be
27
greater than the amount to which he would be entitled under clause 12.04 above, then he will be paid the greater amount. If during the year of service in respect of which the vacation is granted, the employee has been absent from work (in the aggregate) for more than twenty-five (25) working days due to layoff, or for more than ninety (90) working days for any other reason other than an absence on WSIB), then vacation pay shall be calculated only on the percentage basis set out in clause 12.04 above. If, during any year of service, an employee has been absent for more than ninety (90) working days, (other than absence on WSIB) he may, if he so wishes (but only to the extent permitted by law) waive one or more weeks of his vacation entitlement for that year without reduction in the percentage basis (only) vacation pay for which he qualifies.
12.06	For the purposes of this Article 12, a week shall mean a period of seven (7) consecutive days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays falling within the period of vacation.
12.07	Should one or more holidays named in clause 11.01 hereof fall within the period of an employee's vacation he may, not later than 15 days before such vacation is to commence, request an additional day off, with pay, in lieu of each such holiday. Such lieu days will be granted during the months of January, February, March, April, October, or November only, but, subject thereto, the Company will endeavour to arrange for the day(s) off at a time suitable to the employee. If an employee does not so elect time off in lieu of the holiday, then his pay for the week of vacation containing such holiday(s) shall be increased by twenty percent (20%) for each such holiday (per week). In the case of employees on regularly scheduled 4 x 10 hour shifts, his/her pay for the week of vacation containing such holiday(s) shall be increased by twenty-five percent (25%) for each such holiday (per week).
12.08	Every employee will be paid, immediately prior to his going on vacation, the vacation pay to which he is entitled.
12.09	(a) Employees who are entitled to either two (2) or three (3) weeks of vacation may take up to two (2) weeks vacation during the period between the third Monday in May and the third Friday in September.
(b)	Employees who are entitled to four (4) or more weeks of vacation may take up to three (3) weeks vacation during the period between the third Monday in May and the third Friday in September.
(c)	The tentative list of summer vacations will be posted not later than February 15th of each year.
(d)	The vacation schedule will be finalized and a list of vacations posted on the Union bulletin board not later than March 15th of each year.

Re:	CCWIPP Pension Plan and Collective Agreement (expiration date of December
31, 2007)
All members of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall participate in the Canadian Commercial Workers Industry Pension Plan (the "CCWIPP”), rather than in the Employees’ Retirement Plan of TCC Beverages LTD. ("E.R.P.”). More particularly, the following specific arrangements have been agreed to:
1.	Members of the subject bargaining unit shall not be eligible to participate in the E.R.P. with respect to service after December 31, 1988.
2.	It is recognised that the provisions of the Pension Benefits Act, 1987 (Ontario) restrict the ability of the E.R.P. members to withdraw prior contributions to the E.R.P. so long as they continue to be employed by the Company.
3.	Members of the E.R.P. shall, subject to the Plan provisions, retain their right to
benefits accrued for service up to December 31, 1988. Such accrued benefit shall not be subject to increase by reason of future service or increases in earnings after December 31, 1988. However, service rendered with the Company after December 31, 1988 will be counted towards eligibility for vesting and early retirement under E.R.P., based on benefits accrued at December 31, 1988.
4.	On retirement, death or termination of service after December 31, 1988, benefits payable to former E.R.P. members will be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of that Plan.
Current Service Pension Contributions
5.	Effective July 1, 2001, and for the life of the renewed Collective Agreement (expiration date of December 31, 2007), the Company shall contribute $1.08 per hour for all hours paid by the Company to seniority holding members of the bargaining unit (hours paid shall include hours worked, vacation, observed holidays, sick days, jury duty, bereavement leave, paid time off for negotiations, etc.), to the CCWIPP for $60.00 pension unit as set out in the CCWIPP guide.
57
6.	It is understood and agreed that the contributions listed in paragraph #5 hereof shall not apply to probationary or temporary employees (as defined in the Collective Agreement), so long as they are so classified. However, when a regular, full-time employee completes his probationary period and achieves seniority standing, the Company will retroactively calculate the contributions (as set out in paragraph #5 hereof) with respect to such employee for a period from his last date of continuous employment to the completion of his probationary period and shall then remit such contributions in accordance with paragraph #7 hereof.
7.	Contributions, along with a list of employees for whom they have been made, the amount of the weekly contributions for each employee, and the number of hours worked or paid accordingly to the above paragraph #5, shall be remitted to the trustees of the cCwIPP (the "Trustees”) by the Company within the fifteen (15) days after the close of the Company’s four (4) or five (5) week accounting period. The Company agrees to pay interest at the reasonable rate established by the Trustees on all contributions not remitted as stipulated above, not in excess of the rate established for all other employers participating in the CCWIPP.
8.	The Trustees may allocate the employer and employee contributions at the direction of the Union provided that in the event that the Union or the Trustees receive notice from the Revenue Canada Taxation or its provincial counterpart or any successor thereto, that any Company contributions allocated at the direction of the Union or any part thereof are not deductible by the Company for the purposes of Income Tax Act (Canada) or its provincial equivalents or threatening to challenge such deductibility, it is agreed that such notice will be immediately delivered to the Company. In the event of receipt of such a notice by the Company either delivered by the Union or the Trustees or direct receipt itself, the Company shall be entitled to direct the Trustees as to the allocation of the contributions made by it.
The Union hereby agrees to indemnify and save the Company harmless from any additional taxes or penalties (including any interest charges) which the Company may suffer or incur as a result of the allocation of contributions by the Trustees at the direction of the Union such that the tax deductions claimed by the Company in the ordinary course of its business for contributions to the CCWIPP as a registered plan is denied by the applicable taxing authorities. Such indemnity will not be applicable if the denial of the deduction results from the Company seeking a ruling from the Revenue Canada Taxation as to the allocations.
It is agreed that the responsibilities of the Company under this Agreement are discharged by making such remittances within the period stipulated above. It is further acknowledged and agreed that the Company is not responsible for the administration of the CCWIPP or the payment of any benefits under the CCWIPP, or for any funding deficiencies resulting from the withdrawal of the Company from the CCWIPP (except if due to a closure where the Company remains responsible for contributions during the term of the current collective agreement) or termination and wind-up of the CCWIPP.

The contributions shall be for the purposes of providing such pension benefits for eligible employees as shall be determined from time to time by the Trustees of the CCWIPP pursuant to the terms of the CCWIPP.

Accordingly, the Company shall pay such amounts monthly, yearly, or in a lump sum, beginning July 1, 2004 and no later than December 31, 2007 to the Trustees of the CCWIPP; and

It is agreed that the Company’s obligation is only to make contributions, and in the event of a closure during the term of this collective agreement, then the employer is obligated to ensure that such contributions continue. When the amount in item 1 (one) above has been completely satisfied, unless the Company pays the amount in a lump sum, or by the latest date of December 31, 2007, the Company agrees to implement the agreed upon wage increase as specified in the Collective Bargaining Agreement on the pay rate by the latest date of December 31, 2007.

Re:	Substance Abuse
Substance Abuse is recognized to be a serious medical and social problem that can affect employees. The Company and the Union have a strong interest in encouraging early treatment and assisting employees towards full rehabilitation.
Accordingly, following execution of the Collective Agreement, a representative of the Company and a representative of the Union will be appointed by the respective parties to establish and administer a Substance Abuse Program. Such program will basically consist of methods to communicate to employees the availability of confidential referral services, including the Company sponsored Employee Assistance Program, as well as referrals to appropriate counseling services or treatment and rehabilitation facilities. In addition, from time to time, the Union member may have to act as Union Coordinator with troubled employees, and time off for such duties shall not be unreasonably denied by the Company, provided that such time off is requested from the Union Coordinator immediate supervisor, as per the current practice.
The Company will provide normal group insurance benefits subject to group insurance policy provisions to employees who are undergoing a medically prescribed course of treatments. Union Substance Abuse Counsellor will be provided such time off as is reasonably required for the administration of the program.
The preferred treatment and rehabilitation facilities are the Homewood and Renaissance Centre.
The Company and Union will meet to facilitate employees into vacant positions where substance abuse has affected their everyday duties.
The operation of this program will be subject to review after its first year of operation, or earlier at the request of either party.

Re: Workplace Accommodations
The following is intended to fulfill the parties’ obligation to make reasonable accommodation for both permanently and temporarily impaired employees due to illness or injury.
This accommodation process shall consider many variables such as hours of work, duties assigned and shift assigned.
Employees with Permanent Medical Restrictions
The Company and the Union agree there is a need to maintain a dialogue between the Union, the Company and permanently impaired employees. In support of this objective, the Company and Union agree to maintain a Placement Committee to meet at least once per month and/or as necessary for the purpose discussing and reviewing opportunities for permanently impaired employees to perform suitable and meaningful work. The Placement Committee will be comprised of the Plant Chairperson and the WSIB/Placement Representative. Such Union representatives will have no loss of pay for time spent meeting with the management representatives of the Placement Committee. In addition to the union representative the Placement Committee will be comprised of the Employee Relations Manager and a Supervisor.
In order to facilitate this process, the employee shall be required to sign an appropriate release and disclosure form directed to the "Placement Committee” and must submit all relevant medical information to the Company. All information released shall be considered confidential. The details of the accommodation shall be discussed with the employee.
Employees with permanent medical restrictions will have their situation reviewed by the Placement Committee for an opportunity to perform meaningful work that meets their medical restrictions.
At the meeting, the Placement Committee will review the following information:
•	seniority;
•	relevant medical reports pertaining to the impairment;
•	permanent restrictions information from the WSIB/or specialist
•	the physical demands of the employee’s current posted position and essential functions of that position; and
74
• the physical demands of other potential positions and their essential functions to determine whether they are within the scope of the employee’s capabilities.
Process
1.	In the event that an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her pre-injury job even with accommodations, the Company and the Placement Committee shall investigate and pursue accommodations elsewhere in the employee’s home department and, failing that, in other departments where suitable and meaningful work is available. All exceptions to the seniority provisions of the collective agreement must be mutually agreed to by the parties.
2.	Administration of the foregoing paragraph shall mean that the following procedure will be observed:
i)	An employee that can not be accommodated within his or her own pre-injury job and function can displace a junior employee within their shift and function in his/her department, provided such job meets the employee’s medical restrictions and capabilities.
ii)	If the employee was unable to be accommodated in accordance with (i) above, then he/she may displace a junior employee within their shift and all departments, provided such job meets the employee’s medical restrictions and capabilities.
iii)	If the employee was unable to be accommodated in accordance with (i) or (ii) above, then he/she may displace a junior employee within any shift and all departments, provided such job meets the employee’s medical restrictions and capabilities.
iv)	In consideration of the aforementioned, if the employee was unable to be accommodated he/she may put forth an application to WSIB or Insurance Agent for benefits.
v)	Any displaced employee in (i), (ii) or (iii) will bump in accordance with Article 8.09.
3.	In the event of a dispute regarding the suitability of work for the employee as a result of their restrictions, an Independent Medical Examination (IME) and/or Functional Abilities Evaluation (FAE) shall be acknowledged as the appropriate mechanism to resolve the dispute.
Understandings
In the event of a dispute regarding the suitability of work for the employee as a result of his/her restrictions, an Independent Medical Examination (IME), Functional Abilities Evaluation (FAE), medical information submitted to the WSIB from a specialist at either the employee’s or the Company’s request, or a letter from the WSIB received by the Company or the employee, shall confirm what constitutes a permanent impairment. This understanding shall not in any way be used to prejudice or otherwise influence the WSIB’s determination or payment of benefits.
Where a permanent impairment with a WSIB claim is in dispute, the Company and the Union shall continue their efforts to accommodate the employee, pending a final decision from the
75
WSIB (which may include additional information further clarifying the employee’s permanent impairment).
For non-work related illness or injury, the Company will consider medical information provided by a specialist, an IME or an FAE. Where a dispute exists, the Company and Union shall continue their efforts to accommodate the employee, pending a final decision from the insurance provider on the payment of benefits.
Employees with Temporary Medical Restrictions
The Company and the Union acknowledge their obligations to provide temporary modified work opportunities for temporarily impaired employees. Modified work is defined as any job or combination of tasks that an employee may perform on a temporary basis without risk of re-injury. This work may consist of the regular tasks of the pre-injury job or specific tasks designated for employees participating in a modified work plan. The work must be productive and the results must have value to the Company. The following guidelines will be adhered to:
1.	The program will ensure that there is a consistent standard for all employees (occupational or non-occupational).
2.	The employee must submit all relevant medical information pertaining to the injury to the Company. It is understood that in order to facilitate this process, the employee shall be required to sign an appropriate release and disclosure form.
3.	The temporary modified work plan will be individualized to meet the needs of both the temporarily impaired employee and the Company.
4.	Where required, the Company and the Union Placement Committee Representative will review all the temporary modified work plans that exceed fifteen (15) working days.
5.	This process will not be used to circumvent the process for employees with permanent medical restrictions as outlined above.
6.	Temporary modified work will not be extended indefinitely and a specific duration shall be determined in each case. If an accommodation concern arises that cannot be resolved by the Company and the Placement Committee Representative, the Company may require an IME and/or an FAE.
7.	The Company will provide a copy of the employee’s IME and/or FAE to the employee and to the Union if the employee provides his/her written consent for such disclosure.

Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Hamilton Re: Disability Dispute Resolution Process
The Company and the Union wish to see short and long term disability claims processed in a fair and expedient manner. The following provisions will be implemented upon date of ratification of this agreement.
(A)	Notice of Suspension of Disability Benefits
The insurance carrier will provide an employee on disability with at least two (2) weeks written notice of intention to suspend benefits. The notice will state the intended date of suspension, the reason for suspension, and, if appropriate, any actions the employee may take to maintain benefit continuation. The Union WSIB/Placement Committee Representative and the Company will receive a copy of the notice.
(B)	Dispute Resolution Process for the Disallowance, Suspension or Review of Claim for Benefits
Where there is a dispute between the employee’s treating physician and the insurance carrier’s medical advisors regarding the employee’s ability to return to work or regarding the payment of benefits, or where the Company would like to have an employee’s claim for benefits independently reviewed, the following procedure shall be applied:
1.	In the case of a dispute between physicians, the Company will first ensure that they have complete information regarding the employee’s job duties. The physicians will then discuss the case by phone to see if their differences of opinion can be reconciled. If further information is required the employee is responsible to ensure adequate medical is received and forms are duly completed.
2.	If the physicians still disagree, or in the case of an independent review requested by the Company, a mutually agreed upon independent physician will be selected to conduct a review of the matter. Preferably, this independent physician will be a board-certified specialist in the field of medicine where the dispute exists. The employee will be referred to the independent physician for examination and impartial recommendation, and the physician will be provided with full details regarding the employee’s
78
status, clinical findings, treatments, etc, as well as complete information regarding the relevant requirements of the employee’s job duties. The impartial recommendation of the physician will be provided to the parties and will be final and binding upon the Company, the Union, the employee and the insurance carrier.
3.	The employee will be given 48 hours advance notice of the scheduled independent examination. If the employee fails to attend the examination as scheduled without a valid reason, benefits will be suspended.
(C)	Conditions
During the process as described in Section (B) above, the following conditions shall apply:
1.	If an employee fails to show up for a scheduled examination, a reasonable effort will be made to determine why the employee failed to show up for such examination.
2.	In all cases, the employee will be required to sign an appropriate Release and Disclosure Form authorizing the release of medical information to all relevant parties. All information so released will remain strictly confidential.
3.	The independent physician’s report (both verbal and written) will include a statement of "able to work” or "not able to work”. The written notification of results to the employee determined to be "able to work” will include instructions to report to the Company to inform it of his or her status.
(D)	Termination of Disability Benefits
1.	In cases regarding a pending suspension of benefits, the employee shall continue to receive disability benefits during the process outlined in Section (B) above. The benefits shall continue from the date of the intended suspension until the date of final determination.
2.	If it is determined that the employee is capable of returning to work, disability benefits will cease on the day following the IME.
3.	Disability benefits shall continue if it is determined that the employee is unable to return to work.
(E)	Costs of Independent Examination
1.	In all cases where the independent medical examination (IME) is requested by the Company, the costs of the examination will be paid for by the Company.
2.	The Company will also pay the costs for the independent examination when requested by the employee in cases where the initial decision of the insurance carrier was to deny the employee’s entitlement to benefits.
79
3.	Notwithstanding point two (2) above, when the Company has reason to believe that an IME is being, or has been, unreasonably requested, it will raise its concerns and/or objections with the union.
4.	The Company will provide a copy of the employee’s IME and/or FAE to the employee and to the Union if the employee provides his/her written consent for such disclosure.

Before being classified as a Service Technician, an Equipment Service Trainee must successfully complete a training matrix which comprises four (4) consecutive sections of study. These are: Coolers, Vendors, Fountains and Major Equipment. A trainee must achieve a minimum passing grade of 65% to proceed to the next level of training. It is mutually understood that:
(a)	The trainee may choose to write both the Coolers and Vendors sections at the same time;
(b)	If the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that a trainee may have acquired previous training and expertise in any one or more specific piece of equipment the Company may then be able to use that trainee to work on that equipment without the need for supervision. Despite this, the trainee must still complete the required training to be able to become a Service Technician.
(c)	A trainee may choose to fast track and write a test prior to the completion of the sectional training. If so, he will only be allowed additional training if he failed (with a mark of between 55% and 64%) and time limits will not be extended. The trainee must spend at least the route ride time with a technician prior to writing any tests.
The Company is prepared to meet with the Union to discuss any amendments to this matrix, but it is agreed that the Company reserves the right to exercise its sole discretion in the implementation of this or any amended training matrix.
The following constitutes the requirements for trainees in each section of study:
Coolers:

•	At the end of the eight (8) weeks, the trainee may write the Coolers test and, if successful, will receive an incremental wage increase and move onto the Vendors section of study.
Vendors:
•	Route rides with a Service Technician for four (4) weeks.
82
•	Rides alone for eight (8) weeks working on Coolers and Vendors calls and calls into supervisor if he encounters problems. A Supervisor and/or a qualified technician may meet him at the call to assist.
•	The trainee shall write the Vendors test at the end of the twelfth (12) week and if he chose not to write the Coolers test at the end of that section, must also write it at this point. If successful, the trainee will receive an incremental wage increase and move onto the Fountains section of study.
Fountains:
•	Route rides with a Service Technician for six (6) weeks.
•	Rides alone for eight (8) weeks working on Cooler, Vendor and Fountain calls and calls into supervisor if he encounters any problems. A Supervisor and/or a qualified technician may meet him at the call to assist.
•	The trainee shall write the Fountain test when he has completed the eight (8) weeks of riding alone. If successful, the trainee will receive an incremental wage increase and move onto the Major Equipment section of study.
Major Equipment:
•	Route rides with a Service Technician for six (6) weeks.
•	Rides alone for eight (8) weeks working on any service calls and calls into supervisor if he encounters any problems. A Supervisor and/or a qualified technician may meet him at the call to assist.
•	The trainee shall write the Major Equipment test when he has completed the eight (8) weeks of riding alone. If successful, the trainee will be reclassified as a Service Technician and receive wages in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Agreement.
Other agreed to items:
Subject to the above provisions:
•	The Company and Union agree that a one (1) week refresher route ride will be allowed for any trainee who does not pass a section but does receive a mark between 55% and 64%. A trainee receiving a mark below 55% in any section will be released from the training program.
•	The Company and the Union agree that there is no final exam for the trainee and that successful completion of the four sections is sufficient.
•	The Company and the Union agree that each trainee will spend a minimum of two (2) weeks with the installation crews.
•	The Company will agree to provide the trainees with access to the Company’s internet site to allow them to access the training material available (coketech.ca).
•	The Company and the Union agree that when the two (2) or three (3) week training course is made available, the training schedule will be on hold for that time period and the trainee will return to the schedule at the completion of the course.
•	The Company and the Union agree that in the event of a layoff, any and all trainees will be laid off regardless of seniority prior to a Service Technician.

Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Hamilton Re:	Banked Overtime Trial
The Company and the Union agree to implement a trial system of Banked Overtime in Year 2 of this Collective Agreement. The Company and the Union will meet beforehand to determine the best implementation of this trial. The trial will run from April 1, 2009 to April 1, 2010.
For the purposes of the trial, a limited number of employees may make arrangements with the employer to bank accumulated overtime to a maximum of 80 hours. The employee may then request in writing (on a form provided by CCB) overtime into time off. Notice must be given at least 3 weeks in advance and will be honoured by a first come first serve basis. Upon request by the employee such time off will be taken at the Employers discretion consistent with the efficient operations of the business during the months of October, November, January, February and March. The minimum unit of banked overtime to be utilized will be 40 regular hours in time off or pay.
(i)	Any regular fulltime hourly paid employee who wishes to bank overtime will make a request in writing and this decision will be final and binding until the last pay period in March,
(ii)	Overtime which is banked shall be credited in terms of complete hours (overtime less than 1 hour per week will be paid in his/her current pay period) and when taken as time off shall be paid out on the regular pay cheques at the same hourly rate as banked. When an employee leaves the employer all banked hours will be paid out in total.
(iii)	The employer will keep a record of all banked overtime. Employees wishing to confirm the amount of accumulated overtime they have banked may do so through requesting with their immediate supervisor 24 hours in advance and off working hours
(iv)	Example of banked hours:
1 hour @ 1.5 times the rate of pay 1.5 straight time hours banked 1 hour @ 2 times the rate of pay 2 straight time hours banked
(v)	The employer will pay out all unused banked hours in the last pay period of each March and these hours will be paid out at the same rate as banked.
91
At the end of the trial, should either party deem this system of banked overtime to be an unsatisfactory arrangement, such trial shall be discontinued.

Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Hamilton Re: Temporary Employees
For the purpose of this letter a temporary employee will be defined as outlined in Article
2.06	(a).
For the first sixty-five (65) shifts of this agreement, a temporary employee shall have no rights under the seniority provisions of this agreement. Their retention will be solely at the discretion of the Company. For the purposes of the above, once a temporary employee has achieved a minimum of sixty-five (65) shifts worked, he/she will be reclassified as a "preferred temporary”. The Company will not dismiss preferred temporary employees without just cause.
Temporary employees will be assigned work as follows;
1.	Temporary employees will be used to replace employees on vacation, Leaves of Absence as well as to cover additional work loads.
2.	Preferred temporary employees will make themselves available for any and all work assigned by the Company.
3.	To facilitate the assignment of work to temporary employees, the Company will establish, maintain and post a list of temporary employees by department. Such list will indicate each employee’s accumulated shifts worked. A copy of such list will be provided to the union on a bi-weekly basis.
4.	Assigned work will be made available to temporary employees in the following order: preferred temporary employees; temporary employees; students
5.	A temporary employee will not normally be scheduled to work in excess of forty (40) hours per week. (i.e. in order to maximize opportunities for obtaining forty (40) hours of work per week so that the temporary employee with the most days worked (by department), is assigned work in that department ahead of other temporary workers.
Any preferred temporary employee who has worked fifty (50) countable shifts during a rolling seventeen (17) week window in the periods February 1st to May 31st and September 1st to January 31st (excluding the month of December) will be reclassified as a regular full-time employee. His/her seniority date and service date (for the purposes of vacation and pension) will be determined by the date at which the employee attained his / her sixty-five (65) shifts.
97
For clarification purposes only "countable” shifts will be recorded. Countable shifts are those shifts required for any reason other than as replacements for full-time employees. This includes absences as a result of Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability (duration no greater than 2 years), WSIB approved absences, Union Leaves of Absences, , 16.02 (Sick Leave - exceeding annual paid allotment) and 22 (Maternity/ Parental Leave).
For the purposes of calculating the shifts referred to in the above paragraph, the departments shall be identified as Distribution (including FSV) and Warehouse.
Upon request of the Union, the parties will convene a meeting to review the prior year’s use of temporary employees governed by this process. The Union will have the opportunity to review and present discrepancies with calculations related to the transition from temporary to full time status. If the application of this process dictates, full time positions will be initiated.
As has been the practice of the company, it will give due consideration to all temporary employees prior to hiring from outside sources when hiring regular full time employees.
All current temporary employees will be grandfathered with their current days worked.

Re: Advancement of Pay While Off On Medical Leave Pending Approval of Benefits
Should an employee apply for any occupational or non-occupational medical leave, and require the continuation of pay pending approval of claim, the Company will advance the employee one thousand dollars ($1000.00) per pay period until the claim is adjudicated, to a maximum of three thousand dollars ($3000.00). Pay advance(s) will not commence until all forms, including those providing for authorization of deductions/repayment, are duly completed and the applicable forms are sent to the third party for processing.
Should the claim be approved, the employee will be required to reimburse the Company within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the first payment from the carrier or WSIB. Should however, the claim not be approved, the employee shall authorize the Company to deduct two hundred and thirty ($230.00) per pay period, or in the case of employees who are laid off, to repay $23.00 per day worked, in order to reimburse the Company from the initial payment(s) until all such advances have been recouped in full. Such payments shall commence on the employee’s first pay date upon return to work.
Further, all balances from outstanding pay advances must be fully recouped prior to an employee being eligible for subsequent pay advances for subsequent claims.
It is understood that the process of pay advance may be used in situations where an employee receives a government issued certificate of Quarantine (i.e. SARS etc.).
