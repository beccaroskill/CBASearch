ARTICLE 7 - SETTLEMENT OF COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES
7.01	Purpose. Both the Company and the Union emphasize the desirability of a satisfactory grievance procedure, the purpose of which will be to settle as many grievances as possible promptly. It is agreed that consultation at any step in the following procedure will take place quietly and speedily so that any possible cause of friction may be reduced to a minimum.
7.02	Stewards. The Union agrees to appoint or elect and the Company to recognize stewards, who shall be regular employees of the Company, to deal with matters affecting employees in departments or groups of departments in the Company’s plants. If an employee is being interviewed during the course of an investigation, where possible, and provided the employee being interviewed consents, the Company shall have a steward present. A list of these stewards shall be supplied to the Company. The Company shall be advised immediately by the Union in writing of any change in this list. A list of the names of the members of supervision shall be supplied to the Union and the company shall advise the Union immediately in writing of any permanent change in this list. The Company agrees that the Chief Steward or their designate may request to leave their workstation, after obtaining permission from his/her Supervisor, to investigate any grievance by his/her fellow Steward or worker. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
7.03	Grievance Committee. The Union also agrees to appoint or elect a Grievance Committee, not to exceed three, all regular employees of the Company, to deal with questions which may not be decided in the 1st, or 2nd steps described in Section 4 below. The Grievance Committee shall include the Chief Steward and the Plant Chairperson of the Local Union. A list of Grievance Committee members shall be supplied to the Company. The Company shall be advised immediately in writing of any change in this list.
Subsection 3 (a). If an employee so desires, he/she may be accompanied by his/her steward or chairperson when discipline is being given to that employee.
Negotiating Committee. Two (2) employees from the bargaining unit who have completed their probationary period shall be elected or appointed by the Union to the Negotiating Committee with the Chief Steward and Plant Chairperson.
7.04	Grievance Steps: Alleged grievances shall be dealt with progressively in the following manner:
8
Where possible, the Union Steward and employee shall endeavour to have a discussion with the supervisor and/or manager prior to a grievance being filed.
1st Step:	Between the aggrieved employee, or the Steward or both, and the
foreperson of the department which the employee works. If the complaint affects the rate of pay of an employee, the Department Steward shall be informed.
2nd Step:	Between the Steward and/or Chief Steward and/or the Unit
Chairperson and the Department Manager or his/her designated representative and other members of his/her staff as required by the Company. If requested, complaints presented at this stage shall be in writing. If they allege violation of the Agreement, they shell set out clearly the respects in which the Agreement has been violated.
3rd Step:	Between the Grievance committee and the Plant Management. A
full-time representative of the Union may be called in if desired by either party. Complaints presented at this stage shall be in writing.
The aggrieved employee or employees may be present during the three above steps, if so desired.
Grievance Committee Meetings: Meetings of the Grievance Committee shall be held at times suitable to the operation of the business, by arrangement between the Company and the Union. The Company will pay the aggrieved employee concerned and the members of the Grievance Committee at their applicable rates for time spent at meetings of the Grievance Committee with management representatives.
7.05	Arbitration. If settlement is not reached by the above procedure, the matter in dispute shall be referred by the Union or by the Company to an Arbitration Committee of three members, one to be appointed by the Union, and one by the Company, and a third, who shall act as Chairperson, to be mutually agreed upon by the other two. Upon receipt of the name of the member appointed by the party submitting the grievance to arbitration, the other party shall name its nominee. If it fails to do so within two weeks, its nominee will be appointed by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Ontario upon request by the party submitting the grievance to arbitration. If agreement cannot be reached within one week as to the appointment of a third member, he/she shall be appointed by the Minister of Labour for the Province of Ontario.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the parties may agree to the
9
appointment of a single Arbitrator with the same powers as an Arbitration Committee. In such cases, the party referring the grievance to arbitration shall, instead of submitting the name of its nominee, submit the name of the Arbitrator it wishes to suggest to the other party. If agreement cannot be reached on the appointment of a single Arbitrator within 5 working days, an Arbitration Committee will be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the above paragraph except that in the case of a grievance submitted under Article 7.9 the Union will name its nominee within five working days following the period provided for appointment of a single Arbitrator.
The time limits set out above may be extended by mutual consent between the parties.
A decision of a majority of the Arbitration Committee shall be deemed to be a decision of the Committee. In reaching its decision, the Committee or the single Arbitrator shall be governed by the provision of this Agreement and such decision shall be final and binding upon all parties concerned.
The Company and the union request that the Arbitration Committee meet within one month following appointment if possible and to render a decision within one month of that meeting if possible.
The cost of the Chairperson shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall pay its own costs including those of its nominee, representatives and witnesses.
7.06	Actions of Officials. If either the Company or the union alleges violation of the Agreement through action of the officials of either, the complaint may be dealt with through the Grievance Procedure established by this Article, beginning with the 2nd Step, and discussions between the Company and the Union apart for the Grievance Procedure shall not preclude resort to the Grievance Procedure later, if so desired.
7.07	Wage Grievance. When a grievance which affects the rate of pay of an employee is settled and as a result of the settlement the employee receives an increase in his/her rate, the increase shall be paid retroactively to the date on which the complaint was first submitted to the Company in writing. A request for wage increase, if not answered within 72 hours, may be treated as a grievance and handled progressively as set forth in Section 4 of this Article.
7.08	Dismissal. If an employee is dismissed for any reason whatsoever and feels that he/she has been unjustly dealt with, he/she shall promptly notify a member of the Grievance Committee who shall, if a grievance is to filed, notify the Operations Manager in writing within five (5) working days of receipt of notice of dismissal by the aggrieved employee stating the grounds of objection to the dismissal. The
10
dismissal shall then constitute a grievance and shall be dealt with according to the grievance procedure as set out above beginning with the 2nd step of Section 4 of this Article. If subsequently it is decided that the employee was unjustly dismissed, he/she shall be reinstated in his/her former position and shall be compensated for all time lost at his/her regular rate of pay, or granted such lesser compensation as may be deemed fair in the circumstances or by unanimous decision of an Arbitration Board. To ensure prompt handling of any such grievance, except by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, not more than five (5) working days shall be allowed for consideration under each successive step until the matter is brought to arbitration.
The company will notify the Unit Chairperson or Chief Steward or his/her designated representative within one working day if an employee with seniority is dismissed or suspended. Where notification of dismissal or suspension is not given within one working day, and if a grievance is to be filed, it may be submitted within three (3) working days of the receipt of the notice by the Unit Chairperson or Chief Steward.
7.09	Continue Work During Grievance Investigation. If an employee feels he/she is suffering a grievance, he/she should report the complaint at once in the manner described in Section 4 above. Pending its investigation and settlement, he/she should meanwhile try faithfully to perform the duties assigned to him/her by his/her foreperson or by any supervisory officer of the company.
7.10 Discussion between Steward and Foreperson. A Union Steward, or in his/her absence the Chief Steward, may discuss with the foreperson of hi/her department, direct matters which may affect the welfare of his/her department as a whole, even though at the time same may not continue a grievance. Similar discussion may take place between the Unit Chairperson or Chief Steward and the Operations Manger or his/her designated representative.
7.11	Slowdowns and interruptions of production. It is agreed that the Union and its members, individually and collectively, will not, during the term of this Agreement, cause, permit or take part in any slowdown or other curtailment or restriction of production or interference with work in or about the Company’s plants or premises.
7.12	Strikes and Lockouts. It is agreed that there shall be no strike by or lockout of employees affected by this Agreement during the life of this Agreement or during negotiations for its renewal.
7.13	Labour/Management Committee. It is agreed that two Bargaining Unit members elected by the Union and two Management members will make up this committee. Unless otherwise agreed, this committee will meet every two months to discuss policies, procedures and matters of mutual concern.
11
7.14	The Company will remove from the employee’s personnel file, any notices of verbal or written reprimand eighteen (18) months following the date of occurrence and any notice of suspension twenty-four (24) months following the date of occurrence, provided however, there has been no further disciplinary action taken against the employee during such time.
ARTICLE 8 - WAGES
8.01 Regular, probationary, part-time and student employees shall be paid in accordance with the provisions set out in Appendix D, Job Category Classification System and Schedule of Wage Categories.
8.02	Within one (1) month following the signing of this Agreement, the Company will provide the Unit Chairperson or the Chief Steward with a list of the rates paid to all regular and probationary employees and will, thereafter advise him/her in writing of changes that occur.
ARTICLE 9 - NIGHT AND WEEK-END PREMIUMS
9.01	The Company agrees to pay a premium of 35 cents (.350) per hour to all regular and probationary employees for all hours worked between 3:30p.m. and 6:00am. This premium shall not be considered as part of such employees’ basic rates.
Regular and probationary employees whose schedule calls for work on calendar Saturdays and/or Sundays shall be paid one and one-half times their regular rates for all scheduled hours worked on such days. Such premiums shall not be considered as part of such employees' basic rates.
Sanitation employees required to work a regular shift on Saturdays (5th Shift) will be paid at their regular rates.
ARTICLE 10 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
10.01	All hours worked by regular and probationary employees in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty 40 hours per week, on a basis of five (5) days per week, shall be paid for at one and one-half (1%) times their regular hourly rates. Overtime premiums will only be paid following forty (40) hours of work provided the time missed was not a result of being sent home or laid off.
10.02 Alternate schedules, considered to be more in keeping with the wishes of employees, may be submitted by the Union. Such schedules will be implemented by the Company provided Management agrees they satisfactorily meet the requirements of the business and, in this respect, Management's
12
decision shall not be made arbitrarily or unreasonably. In the event a grievance is processed to arbitration and the Arbitration Committee determines that Management's decision was made arbitrarily or unreasonably and that the alternate schedule submitted by the Union is to be implemented, the arbitration award shall be made effective the week following receipt of the award.
The Company will continue to post the schedule by noon each day, however if it is not posted, the Company will call the employees. If the employee leaves early for their own reasons, it is their responsibility to call the plant to find out where and when they are working.
10.03	Weekend Overtime: The following shall apply for assignment of all overtime scheduled on a Saturday and Sunday. Once the Company has determined that overtime is required, they shall immediately post a notice for said overtime seeking volunteers. Such notice shall be posted for a reasonable period of time. The overtime shall be assigned from employees signing the notice as follows:
(i)	Senior qualified employee on the same shift as the overtime required.
(ii)	Senior qualified employee on an alternate shift.
If work is not available on an employees’ home shift, the employee may choose to displace a junior employee working in a position they are qualified to perform, subject to any hours of work restrictions as prescribed in legislation.
In the event there are not enough volunteers, the Company shall assign employee(s) with the qualifications to perform the work required, in reverse order of seniority, on a rotation basis.
Management will continue to apply the existing scheduling practice.
10.04	Double their regular hourly rates shall be paid to all regular and probationary employees for those hours worked on Sunday, except for those whose work regularly falls on Sunday.
10.05	Because, however, receipts of raw materials and the demand for the Company's products vary from season to season and from day to day, the Union agrees that it may at times be necessary to exceed or to reduce these basic hours of work.
10.06	Emergency Call-In. Regular hourly-rated employees, if specially called in at any time outside their regular working hours, shall be through when the emergency is over, and shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked, but with a minimum guarantee of four (4) hours at their regular rates.
13
10.07	Daily Guarantee. Any regular or probationary employee reporting for work as usual unless previously notified not to report, who is dismissed for that day by reason of some cause for which he/she is not responsible, shall receive for that day at least four (4) hours' pay at his/her regular rate. The above guarantee shall not apply if work is not available due to Acts of God. Employees will be notified two (2) hours prior to their shift start not to report, if not required for their shift.
10.08	The Union agrees that its officers, stewards and members shall not transact Union business during hours for which they are paid by the Company, except with the permission of the Company. No steward may leave his/her department without securing permission from his/her foreperson. Permission will granted as soon as reasonably possible.
10.09	Employees shall not be regularly required to work more than five (5) hours without a meal period. When employees are required to work three hours or more beyond their scheduled working hours, they will be entitled to an allowance of $6.00, which will be added to their gross earnings for that fiscal week.
Employees, if required to work in excess of five hours on Sunday (except for those employees whose schedule calls for work on calendar Sundays), will be entitled to an allowance of $5.50.
Lunch periods will be scheduled between three and one-half (3%) and five (5) hours into the shift, unless a mutual agreement is reached to vary the lunch times.
10.10	There shall be no accumulation of overtime premiums for the same hours worked, but the highest single premium shall apply.
10.11	Injury-Shift Guarantee. An employee injured while working in the plant shall suffer no loss of earnings for the balance of hours necessarily lost in the scheduled shift in which the accident occurs and/or for hours necessarily lost from up to three subsequent scheduled shifts within three weeks of the date of the accident if, as a result of such injury he/she is sent home or to the hospital or for medical attention on instructions from the medical department but, if such is not possible, then by a Company representative. If the injury occurs on a non-scheduled day, the employee will be paid for the hours necessarily lost which would have been worked had the injury not occurred. Workers' Compensation for such injury shall be deducted from benefits due under this section.
ARTICLE 11 - PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
11.01	The Company agrees to pay all regular and probationary employees at their regular rates of pay, for the normal number of hours of work on each of the

11.05	If a paid public holiday falls within the employee's vacation period, he/she may elect to receive holiday pay as provided in the first paragraph of this Article or receive a compensatory day's holiday.
If the employee elects to receive a compensatory day's holiday with pay, it shall be taken at a time to be agreed upon between the Company and the employee. If subsequently the employee does work on the day agreed upon as the compensatory day's holiday, it shall be considered as work performed on a paid public holiday and the employee shall be paid as set out above.
11.06	The Company agrees to pay to an employee who would otherwise qualify for holiday pay under Article 11, but who is receiving sick pay or Workers' Compensation, the difference between sick pay or Workers' Compensation as the case may be and eight (8) hours' pay at his/her regular rate when the employee returns to work, as long as he/she continues to receive sick pay or, if on compensation, for such period as the employee would have been entitled to receive sick pay had he/she been sick.

All other employees shall be regarded as probationary employees when hired and shall have no seniority. After three (3) months' service they shall become full-time employees and shall receive credit for seniority from the date of their employment, provided however, that for the purpose of determining the probationary period each full day of absence from work for any reason, will be added to the stipulated three (3) month period.
Probationary employees, if laid off and later rehired, will be given credit for past service as a probationary employee, if they complete the probationary period within nine months from the date they became probationary employees.
13.03	(a) Lay-Off. In case it becomes necessary to reduce the working force, the order
of lay-off shall be as follows:
First:	Student employees will be laid off.
Second:	Part-time employees except by agreement with the Union.
Third:	Probationary employees will be laid off, provided
regular employees remaining can perform the required tasks satisfactorily.

(b) If an employee is affected by a shortage of work within their scheduled work week, they may be retained in order of seniority
17
provided there is work to be performed and provided those employees who are retained can perform the required work satisfactorily or they have the options of bumping to another shift or choosing an excused day or the use of a vacation day, providing the needs of the business are satisfied.
13.04	Recall. When increasing the working force, the order of recall shall be full-time employees in order of their seniority, regardless of the departments in which they were previously employed, provided they can perform the required work satisfactorily.

13.05	An employee transferred from one plant of the Company to another shall retain his/her seniority, subject to approval by the management and local union of the plant to which he/she is transferred.
13.06	Accident or Sickness Leave. If an employee is absent from work because of accident or sickness, he/she shall accumulate seniority while off work, up to the time limits corresponding to seniority as set out in Article 13.11 and shall be returned to the position previously held or to a position carrying a rate equal to that previously held subject to seniority and ability to perform the required work satisfactorily. If such positions are not available, the employee shall, subject to seniority and ability, be placed on a job he/she can satisfactorily perform. Applications for reinstatement after the expiry of the allowable periods shall be considered on their merits.

3.	CLASSIFYING NEW OR CHANGED JOBS
(a)	The Company will classify the job into the wage category schedule, based on comparisons with other jobs in the plant, and notify the Chief Steward, in writing.
(b)	In case of disagreement, the Union will give written notice to the Company stating the wage category in which, in the Union's judgement, the job should be classified, and a list of job comparisons explaining the basis upon which the Union's judgement was made. If notice of disagreement as set out above is not received by the Company within 60 days of the date the Chief Steward was notified of the wage category in which the job was classified by the Company, the category in which the job was placed by the Company will be considered the agreed category for the job.
Similarly, when the Company has advised the Union that there is no justification for reclassifying a job in a higher rated category where the Union alleges a job has been changed, the Union may give written notice of disagreement to the Company stating the wage category in which, in the Union's judgement, the alleged changed job should be classified, and a list of job comparisons explaining the basis upon which the Union's judgement was made.
38
Following receipt of the Union's notice of disagreement, the Company, within 30 days, will submit the Union in writing, a list of job comparisons explaining the basis upon which the Company's judgement was made.
(c)	The disagreement will then be discussed by the Chief Steward and/or Unit Chairperson and Management representatives. A full-time representative of the Union may attend this meeting.
If no agreement is reached, the Union may refer the disagreement to arbitration as set out in Article 7, Section 6 by giving written notice to the Company, within 30 days following the above meeting, stating the Union ' s final judgement of the appropriate wage category and the list of job comparisons on which it will rely at arbitration. Following receipt of the Union's notice the Company will submit its final judgement of the appropriate wage category and the list of job comparisons on which it will rely at arbitration.
The Arbitrator, or Arbitration Committee, shall have only the authority to decide in favour of the wage category set by the Company or the wage category submitted by the Union, based on comparisons with other jobs in the plant as submitted on the final lists of job comparisons submitted by the parties. The Arbitrator's, or Arbitration Committee's, decision will establish the wage category which will be binding on both parties.
(d)	After the job is started the wage category set by the Company will be implemented and the applicable rate will be paid retroactive to the date that the job reached normal operation. Similarly, if subsequently the job is placed in a higher rated category as a result of a disagreement submitted by the Union, including at arbitration, the rate increase will be paid retroactive to the date that the job reached normal operation.
