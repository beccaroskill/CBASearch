Should any part of this Agreement be rendered or declared illegal by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation or by any decree of a court of competent jurisdiction or by decision of any authorized government agency, such invalidation of such part or provisions shall not invalidate the remainder thereof.

Step 3
Should the said grievance not be settled in the second step of the Grievance Procedure, the subject in dispute shall be submitted to a mediator to be mutually selected by both parties for a ruling. Failing the agreement of a mediator within five (5) working days, either party may refer the grievance to arbitration and, in this case, shall notify the other party in writing of its desire to do so within ten (10) working days and the notice shall contain a statement of the difference, the section(s) of the collective agreement violated, any relevant particulars, the remedy requested and the name or list of names of the persons who will be willing to accept the arbitrator's position.

(a)	If it accepts the person suggested as an arbitrator, notify the other person within five (5) working days indicating its acceptance of such an arbitrator, or if the receiving party does not accept any of the persons suggested by the party presenting the notice, it shall, within five (5) days notify the party accordingly and send the name or list of names of the person or persons that it would be willing to accept as the arbitrator.
(b)	Where the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of the arbitrator, either party may request the Minister of Labour, in writing, to appoint the arbitrator.

19:02
19:03
19.04
18
developed from Time Study on local Levi Strauss conditions, or from available Predetermined Sewing Data adjusted for local Levi Strauss conditions. New work methods will be developed by the Company's Industrial Engineer with as much involvement as possible by the operators concerned.
All standards will be reviewed and equity established so that quotas reflect effort required.
Once a time standard has been established, it shall stay in effect until there is a change in the conditions under which it was established.
The Company and the Union will co-operate in the introduction of incentive time standards on as many measurable operations as possible.
The Company shall furnish the operators and the Union Business Representative with copies of all rate notices. Predetermined Sewing Data Analysis Summaries, for all operations, will be available on the Company's premises to the Union Business Representative.
A tentative standard will be used for a maximum of ninety (90) days while a permanent standard is being established.
For both job groups of sewing machine operators, a training program has been established. The program's period will be:
For Group I operators - to a maximum of 15 weeks, and For Group II operators - to a maximum of 20 weeks.
When any such work methods, work assignments, or quotas have been instituted, a training period will follow, the length of which shall depend upon the severity of the change. During this training period, the operators shall be paid their hourly rate. It is the operators' responsibility to apply themselves, and to make every effort to achieve quota and the Union will co-operate in this regard. If after the new rates have been in effect for a period of thirty (30) calendar days any operator questions the fairness of a time value, she/he may request a review of the time standard in question, and the Union may call upon the Union Time Study Engineer to examine the standard in dispute. The Company shall
19:05
19.06

be notified of the name and qualifications of such Time Study Engineer. He shall be accompanied during his studies by one of the Company's Industrial Engineers.

In the event that the parties cannot agree upon a time standard within thirty (30) days after the review, the employee may thereafter file a grievance with the Plant Manager. If no such grievance has been received within a further thirty (30) day period, then the standard shall be deemed final and shall be accepted by both parties.
All new or revised job classifications are to be established mutually by job evaluation acceptable to both parties.
The Employer shall establish thresholds of production and quality standards for collective groups of jobs and team(s) or individuals. Employees assigned to such groups or teams shall be eligible to receive additional wage payments for collectively achieving such threshold standards (see Appendix II).
