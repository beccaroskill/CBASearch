Step 1

Step 2
The Grievance Committee shall take the matter up, in writing, with the Production Manager, and if following this stage, the grievance is not settled to the satisfaction of the employee(s) concerned within
5
(24) hours, or within any longer period of time which may be mutually agreed to between the two parties, the grievance shall be progressed to Step 3.
Step 3
a.	The grievance shall then be taken up at a meeting of the Grievance Committee, the General Manager, Flour & Food Service Division or in his absence his designate, at which meeting a Representative or his nominee of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union may be present if his presence is requested by either the Company or the Union.

(25) working days, request that the grievance be referred to a Board of Arbitration referred to in Article 10.

a.	A grievance to be accepted must be initiated by or on behalf of an aggrieved employee in respect to a specific action of which there is a complaint within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of the action. A grievance submitted by the Grievance Committee shall be processed commencing at Step 2 of the procedure.

In the event of an employee's work not being satisfactory, woth a verbal and a written warning will be given to the employee, with a copy to the Department Shop Steward and a copy to the Local Union President stating the specific reason or reasons why the work is not satisfactory. Should the employee continue to perform his duties in an unsatisfactory manner, which in the opinion of the Supervisor warrants dismissal, written notice of dismissal will be given to the employee with a copy to the Department Shop Steward and a copy to the Local Union President stating the specific reason or reasons for dismissal.
If, after having received a written notice of warning, an employee's services prove to be satisfactory over a period of one year, the original notice of warning shall become void.
The Company reserves the right to dispense with the warning in cases where an employee is guilty of dishonesty, intoxication, willful destruction of company property or product, insubordination or breaking of safety regulations that might endanger the safety of his own or other employee's person. Dismissal of an employee under these circumstances could be the subject of a grievance under the procedure as outlined in Clause 3 above.
f.	A claim by an employee that he has been unjustly discharged from his employment shall be treated as a grievance if a written statement of such grievance is lodged with the Company office within three (3) working days after the employee ceases to work for the Company. All preliminary steps of the grievance procedure prior to Step 2 will be omitted in such cases. Such special grievance may be settled by confirming the Management's action in dismissing the employee, or by reinstating the employee with full compensation for time lost, or by any other arrangement which is just and equitable in the opinion of the conferring parties.

The two arbitrators so nominated shall meet immediately and if, within two (2)working days, they fail to settle the grievance, they shall attempt to select by agreement a Chairman of an Arbitration Board.
7
If they are unable to agree upon such Chairman within a further period of five (5) working days, they shall then request the Minister of Labour for Canada to assist them in selecting an impartial Chairman.

ARTICLE 11 - SENIORITY
1. a. Until an employee has completed forty (40) days of actual work with the Company, accumulated over a continuous period of six (6) months, he shall be considered a probationary employee. Commencing with the forty-first (41st) day of employment, (ie. the day after he has completed 40 days of actual work in the Company's employ) an employee shall be granted seniority retroactive to the initial date of hiring and his name shall be entered on the seniority list as a regular employee. If there is doubt about an employee being able to qualify during the probationary period, his probationary period may be extended by an additional twenty (20) days of actual work by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union Negotiating Committee. Any further extension of the Probation Period of up to a maximum of (20)working days may be mutually agreed upon between the Company and the Union negotiating committee.
b. Seniority shall be divided into two categories, ie.
8
(i)	Plant seniority:	which shall be an employee's accumulated
over-all service in the Company's employ. The Company and the Union agree that the principle of Plant Seniority shall apply in situations where seniority is a consideration unless specifically stated otherwise.
(ii)	Departmental seniority:	which shall be the accumulated
seniority of an employee in a department.. Department seniority shall prevail m the jobs listed m Clause 5(c) . After 90 days the Departmental Seniority begins in the department where the employee is working retroactive to the date the employee began working in that department.
Temporary transfers of less than ninety (90) days shall not break the continuity of the seniority of an employee in the department to which he returns.
2.	With the exception of the jobs listed in Article 11/ Clause 5.c., in the event of any reduction in the working force or lay off, probationary employees shall be laid off before any employees with seniority are laid off. No employees shall be on lay off status while a junior employee is employed, subject to the senior employee having the immediate qualifications and being capable of satisfactorily performing the work available. If there is any disagreement between the Company and the Union regarding an employee's qualifications or capabilities, the matter shall be discussed and if there is still a reasonable doubt, a trial period of up to thirty (30) days of actual work shall then be permitted.
3.	Subject to all other conditions of this seniority article of the agreement, when reducing or increasing staff, the Company and the Union agree that the principle of plant seniority shall govern. The last laid off shall be the first rehired and the first rehired shall be the last laid off. In cases of recall from layoff, the Company shall have met its obligations under this article if it has attempted to reach the employee by phone as per the telephone numbers posted on the Seniority List, or given to the Company in confidence. It will be the employee's responsibility to advise the Company if they are available at some different telephone number. The Company agrees that in the event of a temporary lay off, reasonable notice will be given to the employee whenever possible. The tentative production schedule for the following week will be posted on Thursday, p.m. Employees transferred from their position, due to a layoff occurring in the plant, shall revert back to their former position once such position becomes available.
4.	The Company shall maintain and post every Three (3) months, a Plant
seniority list, and in addition, a Departmental seniority list for each of the following departments:	Flour Mill, Bakery, Packing Room,
Warehouse, Maintenance and Elevator.
5.	All vacancies shall be posted for a period of Forty-Eight (48) hours
(exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and Statutory Holidays), so that
employees desiring the vacant job may apply. The Union shall be informed within Ten (10) working days, after Close of applications, who
the successful applicant is.
9
Filling of vacancies shall be based on qualifications, ability and seniority. Vacancies will be filled in the following manner:
a.	The regular position department employees with Plant Seniority in the department in which the vacancies occur, and who apply on the posting, will be awarded the job.
b.	Should there be no applicants from within the department in which a vacancy occurs then the job will be awarded to the senior applicant applying on the posting.
If there is any disagreement between the Company and the Union regarding a senior applicant's qualifications or ability the same trial procedure shall be followed as is outlined in Clause 2, above.
If at the end of Thirty (30) actual working days, an employee is not satisfied with his new job, he shall be returned to his former position, or if at the end of Thirty (30)actual working days the employee doesn't prove satisfactory he will be returned to his former position.
c.	Vacancies in the position of millwrights, millwright trainee, and all lead hands, shall be filled on a departmental seniority basis.
6.	When it is necessary to move employees from one classification to another for a period of one week [Five (5)working days] or less, the Supervisor in charge may make appointments in a manner most convenient to Plant efficiency and minimum disruption to the work schedules in effect at that time. Every consideration will be given to Plant seniority, but it will not necessarily follow that Plant seniority will be the governing factor.
7.	The seniority of an employee shall be considered broken and all seniority rights forfeited (including the Company’s obligation to rehire) for any of the following reasons:
a.	If the employee voluntarily quits.
b.	If the employee is discharged and is not reinstated pursuant to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
c.	If the employee is laid off and fails to report for work within Seven (7) calendar days of being requested to do so without furnishing a reasonable excuse for such failure to report or without securing leave-of-absence.
Leave of absence for reasonable cause, granted by the Company, shall not break the continuity of an employee's seniority rights and an employee granted leave-of-absence shall return to the position held prior to the absence or to one of equal rating providing he is capable after a fair trial of handling the job.
10
Employees absent from work because of sickness or accident Shall be obliged whenever it is reasonably possible to notify the Company their approximate length of absence.
8.	The Company will not be obliged to retain seniority records for employees who have been laid off for periods exceeding those listed below:
a.	Employees with two years or more service - two (2) years.
b.	Employees with less than two (2) years' service - length of seniority, with a minimum of six (6) months.
Recognizing that the Company has no obligation to call in employees whose seniority records have been discontinued by reason of their lay off exceeding the above limits, it is nevertheless mutually agreed that, when hiring, consideration will be given to those employees who have previous experience and who make application for work; always provided that all employees with seniority are first rehired.
ARTICLE 12 - LEAVE-OF-ABSENCE
1.	The Company may grant leave-of-absence, without pay, to any employee for legitimate personal reasons and any person who is absent with such written permission shall not be considered to be laid off, and his seniority shall continue to accumulate during his absence.
Union business will be considered a good cause for leave-of-absence and such leave-of-absence shall be granted by the Company, and seniority shall accumulate during such leave-of-absence.	It is agreed that not
more than one employee from any one department or a maximum of three employees from the Plant will be granted such leave-of-absence at any one time.
The Company agrees to notify the Secretary of the Union when extended leave-of-absence is granted to an employee. This does not apply when leave-of-absence is granted for anything up to a forty-eight (48) hour period.
2.	The maximum period for which leave-of-absence without pay may be granted shall be three (3) months except when the leave-of-absence is for the purpose of handling the affairs of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
3.	Should an employee fail to return to work at the expiry of his leave of absence or alternately fail to seek renewal of his leave-of-absence, he shall be considered to have terminated his employment with the Company.
