Vacation Scheduling Procedure
A. 1. Vacations will be granted at such times through the calendar year as is found most suitable, considering both the wishes of the employees and the Company.
2.	However, they will be scheduled in such a manner as to provide for even distribution of the number of people who are absent due to vacation. Vacation
143
9:02
weeks will begin on Sunday, however, the Company may permit a change, if practical, for individual employees. Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their department scheduler.
B.	1. Vacation lists will be posted prior to October 1st
for the first time frame, and prior to April 1st for the second time frame.
2.	Preference will be indicated in advance, in writing, and separated into two time frames of January 1st to the 2nd Sunday in June, and the 2nd Sunday in June to December 31st. The deadline is September 30th 4 p.m. for the first time frame and March 1st 4 p.m. for the second time frame.
3.	Protest of assignment of vacation dates must be made within two weeks following the posting of the lists. Otherwise, allotted dates will be assumed as correct.
C.	The following procedure will be utilized:
1.	The minimum allotment allowed will be 15% for vacation. The allotment will be applied on a departmental basis so that the total number of employees absent from the department on vacation at any given time will equal the total allotment and will not be less than two (2) employees per week.
2.	When the departmental allotment is allocated, it will be applied so that there are an equal number of employees who may be off on vacation on each
144
9:02
shift, by seniority. The vacation openings that are left to be filled, will be filled by the senior employee(s) who has/have requested the opening from another shift in the department, except as outlined in 7. ii) a) & b) below.
3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this process is not filled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this time, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.
4.	It is understood that there will be no artificial creation of overtime due to the process of shift balancing under item 3 above.
5.	In the event that there is a vacation opening that becomes available after the vacation scheduling process is complete because of the cancellation of scheduled vacation, the senior employee(s) on the shift involved who are on the vacation waiting list will be offered such openings first, then to the other employee(s) by seniority on the waiting list in the department.
145
9:02
6.	As operational needs permit additional openings, the senior employee(s) on the waiting list will be offered such openings, within the department.
7.	i) Vacation scheduling for Weekend Workers
will be as per Section 6:12.
ii)	Guidelines for Scheduling
a)	Maintenance by seniority, by shift, within each primary and secondary trade. Those trade employee(s) who did not get at least one week between July and August will be afforded one-week vacation on their day shift in July or August.
b)	Stores Keepers by seniority within their classification.
c)	Packing by seniority within their classifications and shifts.
d)	All other departments by seniority and shifts.
iii)	Employees who are not eligible for three or more weeks vacation will be given preference in selecting their vacations as against the second portion of the vacation of those entitled to three weeks vacation who wish to split such vacation period.
iv)	Senior employees who split their vacation but take one portion outside the holiday season (2nd Sunday in June to the year end) will still have preference over junior
146
9:02
employees in obtaining one vacation period between the above dates.
v)	Vacation cancellation will only be accepted by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday the week before. Unscheduled vacation requests will only be accepted by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday the week before. In the event that additional people can be permitted on vacation at any period upon short notice, first consideration will be given to those who did not have sufficient seniority to get a scheduled vacation in either July or August.
vi)	Vacation will be completed each calendar year with the exception as outlined in 9:03.
vii)	Employees with more than three weeks vacation must take that excess vacation outside of the prime period (2nd Sunday in June to September 1st), unless there are additional openings after all other employees have scheduled their vacation.
147

Section 9:03
Vacation Pay In Lieu Of Time Off

B.	Employees would not be allowed to work their vacation if regular employees are on layoff.
C.	A minimum of two (2) weeks vacation will be completed each calendar year. Employees entitled to more than two (2) weeks vacation may carry-over up to two (2) weeks vacation to be taken the following year.
D.	Vacation carry over may be taken as long as it does not interfere with vacation scheduling procedures for the current scheduling period as outlined in 9:02.

If it is not satisfactorily settled it may be processed by Step 4 and to arbitration in the same manner and to the same extent as the grievance of an employee.
Section 10:02
Grievance Procedure
A.	An employee believing he/she may have a grievance shall discuss it in the first instance with his/her Group Leader within three (3) work days of the event occurring, or of its becoming known to the employee. He/she has the option of requesting that the departmental Union Steward accompany him/her.
B.	The Group Leader will give his/her answer within three (3) work days. Following that reply, if an employee believes he/she may have a grievance as defined above, he/she may prepare it in writing, sign it, and present it to the Department Steward for further processing. When an employee’s Steward is absent from work he/she may contact another Steward in the department on that shift or if unavailable, a member of the Union Negotiation Committee.
C.	Steps
Step 1:	After the previous procedure has been
completed and within five (5) work days of the time that the Group Leader gave his/her
152
10:02
reply, the employee and the Union Steward may proceed by presenting a copy to the employee’s Group Leader. The Group Leader will give his/her reply to the employee and the Department Steward within three (3) work days of the time he/she receives the written grievance, unless mutually agreed to extend that time. At completion of this step, the Group Leader and Steward will initial and date the grievance. If the matter has not been settled, the Union Steward within five (5) work days may take the grievance up at the next step.
Step 2:	The grievance will then be discussed by the
Department Steward and Department Manager, the Department Manager will give his/her reply within three (3) work days from the time he/she received the written grievance unless it is mutually agreed to extend that time. The Steward and Department Manager will then initial and date the grievance. If the grievance has not been settled it may be taken up at the next step within five (5) work days.
Step 3:	If the Chief Steward feels that the grievance
is justified, the Chief Steward may request that it be investigated by the Human Resources Department. A reply will be given within five (5) days unless it is mutually agreed to extend that time. They will initial and date the grievance and note their comments.
153
10:02
Step 4:	If the grievance has not been settled by Step
3, it may be submitted for the next joint meeting of the Union and Management Committee. If it is not settled there, the matter may then be submitted to the arbitration procedure within ten (10) work days of such a meeting upon request of either party and, if necessary, an additional twenty (20) days may be allowed by agreement of the parties.

The hearing will provide an opportunity for all concerned to be fully informed, and for the Company to receive full information from the
154
10:04
employee before making its decision as to the nature of the disciplinary action to be taken.
B. 1. Any grievance claiming that the disciplinary action was unjustified must be filed within three (3) work days of the time that the action was taken, and will be considered promptly at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.

Representative

K.	Co-Ordination of Extended Health Care Benefits:
If you or your eligible dependents are insured for similar benefits under another Plan (e.g. Group Life and Health Program, or other arrangements covering individuals in a group), the carrier will take this into account when determining the amount of expenses payable under this program.
This process is known as Co-ordination of Benefits. It allows for reimbursement of insured medical and dental expenses from all Plans, up to a total of 100% of the actual expense incurred.
Order of Benefit Payment:
1.	A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the "Primary Carrier" (i.e. Responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the "Secondary Carrier” (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).

a) The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
183
15:03
b)	The Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child (i.e. if the parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child), then
c)	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
d)	The Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child (i.e. if the parent without custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child).
4.	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Plans.

iv)	However, if you and your Spouse are
separated or divorced, the following order applies:

Retirement Income Plan (Pension)
A.	Retirement Income Plans

239
15:10
2.	The Company pays the full cost of the Kellogg Retirement Income Plan.
B.	Eligibility For Membership
Regular full-time employees are automatically included in the Retirement Plan after completing one year of continuous service.
C.	Normal Retirement Pension
1. Normal retirement is on the first day of the month immediately following your sixty-fifth (65th) birthday.
2.	This plan provides a pension income at age sixty-five (65), based on your credited or length of service in any year as follows:
Hours Worked	Credited Service
0 - 349	0 year
350 - 749	1/4 year
750 - 1,124	1/2 year
1,125 - 1,499	3/4 year
1,500 or more	1 year
3.	For employees suffering from long term illness (over thirty [30] days), up to fifteen hundred (1500) banked hours may be withdrawn over a three year period, in order to supplement credited service for pension purposes.
240
15:10
D.	At age 65, your monthly retirement income benefit will be equal to the monthly pension amount in effect, multiplied by your years of credited service since January 1st, 1980.
Monthly Defined Benefit
	April 14, 2003	April 11, 2004	April 10, 2005
Single Pension	$69.00	$69.00	$69.00
Group			
1.	This plan covers only your service with the Company from January 1st, 1980. Your pension is calculated by multiplying your years of service by the appropriate amount shown in the table above, which will equal your monthly amount.
2.	Any pension benefits you may have earned from former plans are in addition to the pension from this Retirement Income Plan.
E.	Annual Benefits Statement
Your Annual Benefits Statement shows your pension earned to date and estimates your pension for future service based on your current earnings. These levels may change each year and your estimated total pension will change accordingly. The nearer you get to age sixty-five (65), the more accurate the total estimated pension on your benefits statement will be.
241
15:10
F.	Early Retirement
You may retire and receive a pension any time after
reaching age fifty-five (55). Certain subsidies may
apply according to your years of service and your age.
1.	If age fifty-five (55) or over and age plus years of service total eighty-five (85) or more, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension with no reduction.
2.	Furthermore, you receive a Bridge Benefit of $12.00 a month for each year of service to a maximum of $360.00 a month. This Bridge Benefit is paid until age sixty-five (65) at which time the government pensions begin.
3.	With twenty (20) years of service, but age plus years of service are less than eighty-five (85), your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced. The reduction is 2% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62), down to age sixty (60) and then 4% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty (60).
4.	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62). There are no adjustments to the calculation after age sixty-two (62).
242
15:10
G.	Pension Payment Options
1.	Spousal
i)	If you have a spouse when you retire, the
Pension Benefits Act states that your pension must be paid on a joint and survivor basis with at least 60% of the pension payable to you continuing to your spouse after your death, should your spouse survive you.
ii)	The normal pension fund distribution if you take the spousal option is 90/60%. The retiree will collect 90% of his/her pension until death and then their spouse will collect 60% of the pension until death.
iii)	If you have a spouse but wish to select a form other than the Joint and 60% Survivor form then you and your spouse must sign a Spousal Waiver form.
2.	Life Only
If you do not have a spouse when you retire, the normal form of pension is "Life Only" which means that payments stop when you die.
3.	Guaranteed 5, 10 Or 15 Years
Under each of these options, the pension is payable for as long as you live. If you should die before the guaranteed period ends, pension payments are continued to your beneficiary for the balance of the guaranteed period.
243
15:10
H.	Termination of Benefits
1.	If you leave the Company after completing three (3) or more years of service you will be entitled to a deferred pension payable at age sixty-five (65).
2.	You may elect to transfer the commuted present value of the earned pension to a "locked-in" vehicle. Locked-in pension amounts must be used to purchase a life annuity at retirement unless paid as a death benefit prior to retirement.
3.	You will be 100% vested for all earned benefits in this Plan as well as any benefits you may have earned from former plans, after three (3) years of service for full-time employees.
4.	You earn one year of service for each year you have worked fifteen hundred (1500) hours in a calendar year.
I.	If You Die Before Retirement
1.	If you have less than two (2) years of participation in the plan, there is no death benefit. If you should die after completing two (2) or more years of participation in the Plan, your beneficiary or estate will receive the value of your pension accrued at date of death.
2.	In addition, any death benefits from previous plans would be payable.
244
15:10
J.	Special Disability Provision
If you become disabled, you may be entitled to receive a Disability Retirement Benefit provided you have at least ten (10) years of continuous service. This will be based on your accrued pension at the time you become disabled. The Plan will pay a monthly pension as though you had retired at the time you become disabled.
K.	If You Die During Retirement
If you elected at the time of retirement to provide a continuing payment to your spouse or beneficiary in the event of your death and the conditions of that payment are still applicable, payment will be made to them as you directed. If you retired prior to age sixty-five (65) and were receiving a bridge benefit at the time of your death this payment would not continue to your spouse or beneficiary.

Section 15:14
Stock Purchase Plan
A.	Features of The Plan
1. Kellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder of Kellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 U.S. per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the
255
15:14
payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars, which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan. Shares will be purchased by Wells Fargo for employees on the open market. Dividends are reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
2.	Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for:
i)	Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.)
ii)	However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and payment to the Wells Fargo will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Wells Fargo a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
iii)	Wells Fargo will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the Plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Wells Fargo protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
256
15:14
B.	How The Plan Works
1. You may sign up to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the Payroll Deduction Form (see your Human Resources office). The following guidelines apply:
i)	Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this Stock Purchase Plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes significantly in foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this minimum amount may have to be changed.
ii)	Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S. (in total) per year.
iii)	A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
iv)	The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
257
15:14
v)	Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
vi)	You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Wells Fargo will be refunded to you.
2.	Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at the time of each dividend payment. Since dividends are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three (3) decimal places.
3.	Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
4.	At year-end, Wells Fargo will provide you with information on the payment of brokerage charges and bank service charges. Payment of these charges on your behalf must be reported as income for tax purposes.
258
15:14
C.	Purchase of Shares Through Cash Payment
1.	Cash payments of $25 U.S. (minimum) to $25,000
U.S. (in total) during any calendar year for purchase of shares can be made by sending cheques directly to Wells Fargo at any time. Kellogg Company or Kellogg Canada Inc. will not handle voluntary cash purchases.
2.	Wells Fargo will purchase shares on or about the 15 th of each month. Cheques received on or after the purchase date will be held until the next month.
3.	If shares are not purchased by the 15 th of the month preceding a dividend payment, no dividend will be paid on the newly purchased shares until the next quarter.
D.	Safekeeping of Shares
1.	For your convenience, Wells Fargo will hold the shares it has purchased for you. Whole and fractional shares will be held in a dividend reinvestment account. You may also deliver for safekeeping any Kellogg Company stock you already hold. Upon written request, Wells Fargo will issue you certificates for any or all of the full shares credited to your account, and you may continue to reinvest dividends on those shares.
2.	Any employee who withdraws his or her shares from the custody of Wells Fargo may subsequently sell these shares only through a broker registered under the securities act of the province in which he or she resides. The employee is responsible for the brokerage fees.

6.	Single day vacations can only be taken during regularly scheduled workdays, except for Weekend Workers. Weekend Workers can only take one (1) Saturday and one Sunday; a Saturday will count as two (2) days of vacation used, and a Sunday will count as three (3) days of vacation used.
7.	No more than two (2) single day vacations may be taken on Mondays and no more than two (2) single day vacations may be taken on Fridays (per employee).
8.	Employees granted a single day vacation will not be eligible for daily overtime during the twenty-four (24) hour period starting when the employee’s regular shift would have begun. Weekend Workers will not be eligible for overtime Thursday or Friday if taking Saturday vacation, or will not be eligible for overtime on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday if taking Sunday vacation.
9.	Any single day vacations not taken by Dec. 15 of each year will be paid out.

Agreed Negotiations: April 13, 2003

Letter of Understanding Outside Contractors
The Company recognizes its regular employees as the primary resource for work that is covered under the contract. The decision to contract work out would be based on the following factors: production capacity, capital investment, timeliness, cost effectiveness and reliable availability of the required labour.
No regular employee would be laid off as a result of the contract(s) being “let” for work they are qualified or capable to perform.
The Company will meet on a monthly basis with the Union Negotiating Committee to review outside contract experience and future plans. The purpose of this meeting will be to explore ways to perform this work rather than contracting it out.
As further indications of our intention to utilize our human and capital assets to the fullest, the Vice President of Cereal Manufacturing and the International Vice President of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers will meet when requested with the appropriate Local Plant and Union Officials to address and resolve obstacles to the use of Bargaining Unit Employees in performing this work.
Agreed Negotiations: April 15, 2000
Renewed Negotiations: April 13, 2003
Letter of Understanding Long Term Disability
The parties agree to find mutual solutions to the Long Term Disability issues. We will work together to get
269
employees back to productive, meaningful work in the Kellogg London Plant.
The parties agree that employees who are on Long Term Disability longer than the twenty-four (24) month period will be subject to the following conditions:
After an employee’s disability benefits have been paid for twenty-four (24) months the individual may be reevaluated to determine if they are able to perform all of the material duties of any gainful occupation for which he/she is reasonably fitted by training education or experience to perform work, within the Kellogg (London) organization.
If said employee is unable to maintain regular employment within the Kellogg Company he/she will be considered for totally disabled under the application of the Plan and will be immediately reinstated at the prescribed benefit level.
Employees that are eligible for full retirement (age plus years of service) will be counselled as to the various retirement options available to them versus continuing on the Long Term Disability.
If any such employee is transferred into a non-bargaining unit, Kellogg position due to the application of this agreement, they will be returned to the bargaining unit if they are no longer found to be totally disabled.
Agreed Negotiations: April 15, 2000 Renewed Negotiations: April 13 2003

Letter of Understanding
Benefit Administration
The parties agree to form a sub-committee consisting of three (3) members of the Union Negotiation Committee and three (3) members of the Management Negotiations Committee to resolve the issues in dispute as a result of differences between the Manulife Financial Benefit Policy documents dated August 17, 1999 and June 20, 2002. The sub-committee will reach agreement on the issues in dispute by December 31, 2003.
The parties recognize that the August 17, 1999 Manulife Financial Benefit Policy is the governing document (along with changes agreed to in the 2000 and 2003 negotiations) and will be the starting point for the benefits subcommittee discussions.
Agreed Negotiations: April 13 2003
Letter of Understanding Benefits
The parties agree that issues arising out of the administration of employee benefit plans may be referred to the Senior Director of Human Resources for Kellogg Canada Inc. and the International Vice President of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers for their review if the issue remains unresolved after Step 4 of the grievance procedure.
