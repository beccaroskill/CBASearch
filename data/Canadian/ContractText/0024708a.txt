ATTENTION:	MR GORD ADAMS. HUMAN RESOURCES
You will have, by now, Ms- VanNostrand’s latter of March 9,2000 acknowledging that Mr. Kingyon’a latter of March 1,2000 had bean written by mistake. You should also know that, In our view. Mr. Kingyen’s letter cannot possibly reopen the contract Pstreon Local 3264 and the company. The National Union is not a parly and is not authorized under our constitutional document or any provision of the Ontario Labour Relations Act to interfere with the contractual rights of the local.
Under our constitutional document which is binding on both the national Union and local 3264. the Local is established as a separate entity capable of acquiring its own bargaining rights. Under the Labour Relations Act bargaining rights cannot be shared between two unions and, as I say, there is nothing in our constitution which preports to give the National any right to interfere with our existing Collective Agreement.
Any step by the company to negotiate with the National, or to act upon its letter dt March 1,2000, would eonsitute an unfair labour practice. In addition any agreement reached would or course, be a nullity. In tha drcumstancas we would appreciate receiving the company's assurance that no bargaining with any non-partyto our Collective Agreement win be entertained and that the latter to you of Mach 1,2000 will be ignored.

Dear Ms. Nostrand:
Reference: Your Letter Dated March 9, 2000
Under Article 24.1 cf our current Collective Agreement with Local 3264, there is an automatic extension of the CollectiveAgreement as neither party furnished written notice to the other of termination or of any proposed amendments, additions or deletions within the required timeframe.
This has caused no confusion for Beachville Lime Limited but I thank you for your clarification.

Re; Opening Letter Dated March 1, 2P00
Dear Mr. Adams:
I am writing in regard to the above captioned letter, sent to you on March 1,2000 from National Representative Peter Kingyens. This letter was sent at my request.
Regrettably, I failed to contact the Local to confirm the position of the members with respect to negotiations, renders the opening letter void.
In tight of current circumstances, the Local wishes to extend the collective agreement until March 31st, 2001, which is its’ right under the collective agreement.
The Union expects that the parties wilt then commence negotiations within the timeframes indicated in the agreement.
I regret any confusion this may have caused to the Company.
If you wish to discuss this further, feel free to contact me at 416.622.2740 ext.250
Sincerely
Dawn van Nostrand	'
