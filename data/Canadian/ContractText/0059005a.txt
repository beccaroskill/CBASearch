APPENDIX B
JOB EVALUATION SYSTEM
This letter refers to the Job Evaluation system for jobs in the Bargaining Unit at Bramalea, put into effect in October 1970.
51
Both the plan and its administration are modelled after, but not exactly the same as, that used by Lever Detergents Ltd. The following guidelines are adopted.
1.	The classification of jobs and the wage scale to which such classification is related is set out in Schedule A hereto.
2.	Subject to Clause (4) below there shall be no change during the life of this Agreement in the job rates as set forth in Appendix “A”, except to add to those rates established to cover any new jobs established. If subsequently, as the result of the Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, the resulting rate is higher, it shall be retroactive to the date the job commenced. However, if the resulting rate is lower than the tentative rate, the rate adjustment shall be made currently.
3.	(a) New jobs established shall be evaluated as promptly
as is reasonable by the Management Evaluation Committee on the basis of the Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, with the result being submitted to the Union for review.
(b)	If the Union is not in agreement with the evaluation made by the Management Evaluation Committee, they shall, within ten regular working days of the date on which the evaluation was submitted for their review, file in writing a protest with the Human Resources Manager.
(c)	If such a protest is filed, a meeting shall be arranged within ten regular working days between the Management Evaluation Committee and the Union Review Committee to discuss such differences as may exist
52
(d)	Within five regular working days of such meeting, the Human Resources Manager shall communicate to the Union thedecision of the Management Evaluation Committee.
(e)	The evaluated rate shall then be made effective as of the commencement date of the new job, subject to Clause (2) above.
(f)	If the decision of the Management Evaluation Committee is not satisfactory to the Union, they shall within ten regular working days, request that the matter be submitted to the Umpire.
(g)	The Umpire shall then judge the issue as presented solely on the basis of the Lipton Job Evaluation Plan, and his decision shall be final and binding on both parties.
(h)	Each party shall bear one-half the expense of the Umpire.
(i)	In respect to all new jobs and jobs involving re-evaluation, the Company agrees to adhere to a 30 calendar days time limit, in regards to a final decision on the above said new job or re-evaluation.
(j)	Time limits provided above may be extended by mutual consent of the parties.
4.	Jobs shall be re-evaluated as promptly as is reasonable by the Management Evaluation Committee on written request by either employee, the Union or the Company, providing there is sufficient evidence submitted to show that there has been sufficient change in job content that a change of at least one degree in one or more factors can be reason-
53
ably anticipated. The re-evaluation shall concern itself solely with the change. The same process shall be followed to resolve differences as provided for new jobs, except that the re-evaluation Tate shall become effective on the date the request for re-evaluation was received by the Human Resources Manager. A question of whether or not there has been sufficient change in job content may also be submitted to the Umpire.
5.	Any rate for a new job or a re-evaluation job shall do impiememea on Yne ~seccrnb‘iftonfray following uie ofafe Management's rating is officially provided by the Union.
6.	During the life of the Agreement, the Umpire in respect to job evaluation will be a person as may be mutually agreed by the parties. Failing mutual agreement, either party may request the Minister of Labour for Ontario to appoint a person who is conversant with Job Evaluation as an Umpire.
7.	An employee holding a Red Circle Rate will receive no increase as long as he/she holds the job and until the rate for the job equates with his/her Red Circle Rate. At that point he/she will cease to be Red Circled.
To facilitate the prompt disposition of jobs being evaluated, it is the intent of the parties to schedule meetings no less than once per month until such time as all jobs are current.
APPENDIX C Salary Plan
On December 1,1970 the hourly-rate system was replaced
with a salary plan system. It is designed to protect one's
income when prevented form attending work for occasional illness or reasons judged by the Company to be bona fide. The plan provides continuity of your salary system during
54
the so-called “waiting period” in cases of lengthy illness and then the Weekly Indemnity Plan will go into effect.
Calculation of the Salary Plan
Your weekly salary will be forty times your current hourly rate as established by the collective agreement.
The arrangement will not affect your unemployment insurance coverage. You and the Company will continue to make the usual contribution and you will be eligible for the same benefits tfiaf you'are now.
The Salary Plan, as outlined above will be paid on a weekly basis.
Administration of the Salary Plan
The essential rule is that you keep your Supervisor fully advised of any absence and the reasons for them. There will also be some circumstances when he/she will request a statement from a doctor regarding the state of your health during or after an illness.
The plan is a means of income continuance, not an approval for truancy. Therefore, if an employee is frequently absent — regardless of the reasons for the absence - his/her case will come under review just as it does now. It is costly and unfair to continue to extend privileges to any who abuse them and it is the Company’s responsibility to discontinue their services if thev^QrnvAthaVjaJK-ijrJMiJlion tp^ucrassfully, maintain satisfactory levels of attendance.
It is important that we remember, continued excessive plant absenteeism may jeopardize the continued existence of Salary Plan benefits as they exist at present.
55
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - Inclement Weather
re: Article 20,20.04
Should the Company decide to close the plant due to extremely bad weather conditions, (i.e. severe snow storm) every reasonable effort will be made to
a)	Contact employees of the affected shift prior to the start of the shift.
b)	Request the local radio station, 790 CIAO AM, to announce closure of the plant.
Employees should, in such circumstances, attempt to contact the Company to determine whether it will be operating or not.
As such a plant closure is beyond the control of the Company, affected employees will not be paid reporting pay whether they manage to report or not.
If, during a period of bad weather conditions, the Company decides to continue its operations, employees reporting for work will be provided with a minimum of 4 hours work. Employees who do not report for work as scheduled when the plant continues operations will not be paid. The exceptions to the above will be when an employee is on Company sick leave, is hospitalized, received emergency treatment or is treated by a physician, for reasons which would have prevented him or her from working on the day(s) of inclement weather. The above exceptions must be certified in writing by a medical practitioner.
The Salary Plan does not supersede the provisions of Article 20, 20.04 of the Collective Agreement which addresses itself

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Inventories
The taking of inventories is not considered to be bargaining unit work; however, when extra personnel are required in addition to the management and clerical staff, such employees will be selected in the following manner.
1)	Senior qualified employees working in the Department.
2)	Senior qualified employees working outside the Department.
All interested employees must sign a posted list in order to be considered for work on an inventory.
Dated this 17th day of August, 198?.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Skilled Trades Premium
The Company and Union agree to the institution of a Skilled Trades Premium by the Company of $1.43 per hour to all Maintenance Personnel in addition to the previously negotiated rates of pay. This premium is to be a one-time adjustment and will remain separate from the negotiated rates of pay. For example, Job Grade 10 (Pkg., Gen. Maint. Mechs., Elects. & Machinist) will receive $14.82 + $1.43 = $16.25 per hour effective December 1/87 and on February 16/88 they will receive $15.43 + $1.43 = $16.86 p/h and on February 16/89 they will receive $16.20 + $1.43 = $17.63 p/h. The same formula would apply to all other skilled job classifications in the Maintenance Department. Overtime rates will be calculated on the total of the negotiated rate and the Skilled Trades Premium combined.
Subject to the terms and conditions above, it is further agreed that effective upon implementation of the agreed to Apprenticeship Program, the Company agrees that based on the criteria described in the program, the Company will post for two apprentices in the required trades.
Agreed to this date November 26th, 1987 at Brampton, Ontario.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Guidelines to Overtime Distribution
1.	When overtime is required, the supervisor will ask the person with the lowest overtime as per 12.06 (a) (1st). The critical issue here being “posted” to the job and low overtime. If “posted” employee, for whatever reason, has been temporarily assigned somewhere else, he/she is still entitled to be asked to work overtime.
2.	After exhausting all the steps of 12.06(a) and no one was found to work the overtime, “permanent posted” person with the lowest overtime charged will be required to work.
3.	12.06 (a) Step 5: Qualified employees working outside the department.
A procedure, for distributing overtime equally outside the department are not available, therefore, the clause is not applicable.
A master list of employees “qualified” for all jobs will be kept and updated by Human Resources. This will provide guidance for selectioneffbtep 5.
4.	Qualified has two definitions.
(a)	permanently posted for six (6) weeks or more
(b)	someone who has served ten (10) days in the position
It is understood that these ten (10) days of training are representative of the normal job content.
60
Therefore, in steps 3 and 5, overtime will be distributed first to people qualified under definition (a) and then under definition (b) before moving to the next step.
5.	If two (2) people have equal overtime charged, the senior person will be asked first.
6.	If person refused overtime, providing the 2 hour limit of 12.05 (a) or the 40 hour limit of 12.04 have been met, the person will be charged regardless of the reason with these exceptions:
If a member of the union executive, steward or committee member is required to attend and attends a union activity, then no charging will take place on refusal.
A two-tier charging method will be established. One list is just for work in their classification. The second list is all overtime worked in or outside classification and department. This way working outside one’s class does not limit one’s availability for work inside their classification.
7.	If the conditions of 12.05 (a) and 12.04 are not met, but the person works the overtime, the person will be charged. If a person refused, no charging will take place.
8.	Employees eligible to be asked to work overtime, but not available for overtime, will be charged the actual number of hours if entitled under equal distribution, in their job classification during the period. The only exception would be when an employee is on vacation entitlement or union business.
61
9.	If the Company has a duty to call a person at home, then a refusal will be charged. If no contact is made with the person, no charging will take place.
10.	If a person is late, and works overtime at the end of the regular core shift hours, the person will be charged overtime hours worked after the end of the core shift hours.
11.	All overtime will be charged at straight hours and regardless of rate paid.
12.	On a (2) shift operation, if overtime was required:
(i)	provision of 12.04 must be met.
(ii)	The "posted” person with the lowest overtime would be asked first (12.06)(a), then the “posted” person with the next lowest overtime would be asked and so on (until the requirement is met) regardless of what shift they worked on Friday, filling the B shift first and then the C shift if required
All hours scheduled to be worked on Saturday are added to overtime hours before Sunday selections. Sunday shift would follow the same procedure as Saturday.
(iii)	In all these cases, if scheduling is required, the person with the lowest O.T. would be required to work.
13.	Shiftmate - Is the person who has the lowest overtime hours in the particular classification on shift.
62
14.	If two (2) or more people are posted in a temporary job:
(a)	the temporary with the lowest overtime would be asked first as in 12 above.
(b)	the temporary posted employee would enter the job with the average of the “high" and “low” overtime hours of the other temporaries.
15.	Overtime will be scheduled as per the Employment Standards Act.
16.	On a three (3) shift operation, if overtime was required overtime will be scheduled like in Section 12 in order of shifts A, B, and C.
