(2)	when a job is changed such that some of the work is allocated to other shift(s), the work remaining on the shift will be treated as a job combination on that shift. The work transferred to another shift(s) is considered a job elimination on the originating shift. In such cases there are no bumping rights across shift(s) for the displaced employee(s) on the originating shift(s).
The bumped employee(s) will proceed through the bumping procedure under job elimination.
BUMPING PROCEDURE.:

If he is unable to perform the most junior job, the employee will move up the seniority list as described in 1 B.

44
senior of the displaced employees can choose the job he wants. In the event that two or more of the same job classification are identified within his group of least senior jobs, the junior employee in the job classification will be first to be displaced. This process will continue in order of seniority until all employees are assigned job ownership. If one of the displaced employees is unable to perform the job to which his seniority entitles him, he may move up the seniority list until he reaches a job he can perform consistent with his seniority rights.

This committee will have the following responsibilities:
-	determine, in conjunction with the Health Centre, the physician, and W.C.B., the capabilities of the injured employee;
determine if the employee can return to regular job;
-	determine if the job can be modified to accommodate the injured employee;
-	determine if part time positions are available for those unable to manage a full shift;
-	determine if available alternate work is suitable;
-	develop an individual program for the worker and keep him actively involved in the plan by setting goals and maintaining continuous contact;
-	notify the W.C.B. of program and progress;
- communicate potential labour management and S.E.A.;
to
77
-	maintain a liaison with Joint Health and Safety
Committee;

This committee will be the central control for assigning injured workers to the appropriate position. The Health Services Coordinator will keep an up-to-date log of the available jobs, the workers requiring jobs and workers filling special rehabilitation or modified jobs.
The list of permanent rehabilitation jobs will be revised every four (4) months following discussion with the Association, and a copy will be provided to the S.E.A.
The worker has the responsibility of cooperating with the committee to minimize the negative effects of an injury on both himself and the Company by:
-	maintaining at least bi-weekly contact with the designated person(s) responsible for his program and taking ah active role in developing the individual program;
-	communicating concerns to effect a prompt resolution;
-	obtaining clearance from the physician for the return to modified work;
-	notifying W.C.B, of the program and progress; taking other scheduled activities such as physical
therapy or doctor’s appointments into consideration in the “back to work” schedule;
-	arriving at the job on time and ready for a punctual start.
Permanent Rehabilitation Jobs
These are jobs identified and determined to be appropriate by the Company for the purposes of assigning permanently disabled employees.
When such permanent rehabilitation jobs have not 78
been permanently assigned to an employee, the Company may temporarily assign other employees to these jobs or terminate the job.
The permanent rehabilitation jobs may be created by the Company as follows:
-	By modifying the job the employee owns providing the employee can do 80% or more of the essential duties. If the list of job duties have been modified to suit a disabled worker and the worker no longer requires the job, it may revert to its former composition as determined by the Company;
-	From new jobs that are introduced into the organization as mutually agreed by the parties;
-	By combining functions of existing jobs where the removal of the specified duties at that time does not result in the elimination of such existing jobs as mutually agreed by the parties.
Permanent rehabilitation jobs are those jobs created or set aside specifically for the rehabilitation program and do not form a part of the job posting procedure. These jobs are to be filled by the committee:
1.	By matching the worker’s restrictions with the job;
2.	Within the process (depai1ment)/operation (if at all
possible);
3.	By ability and seniority;
• *’ In this order of priority.
In the event of a work reduction, workers who are in the rehabilitation program and do not possess the seniority to continue to work, will follow the layoff procedure in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Agreement.
Employees assigned to permanent rehabilitation jobs will have their medical status reviewed not less frequently than yearly by the Modified Work Committoe. The S.E.A. executive and Employees Relations shall
79
participate in this review. If an employee on a permanent rehabilitation job is able to perform regular duties, as determined from the medical information supplied by the employee upon request from the Company, he shall be removed from the permanent rehabilitation job and must obtain regular job ownership in accordance with the Collective Agreement.
This letter will remain in effect until the Company and the SEA have concluded their review of the rehab program and reached agreement on the recommendations put forth.

Dear Mr. Losier
RE: MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT ROTATING SHIFTS
Any new employee hired after January 15, 1986 will be hired under the condition he is required to work either a steady shift or a rotating shift as the situation warrants.
In order to clarify all situations that may arise, the following must be clearly understood.
-	If an opening occurs on the 3-11 or 11-7 shift, those who are on steady day shift will rotate to cover that shift until a replacement is hired and trained (up to a maximum six month training period). The shift covered will be whatever shift becomes vacant due to the layoff, resignation, or transfer.
-	Employee on day shift are expected to cover for vacations, sickness and time off due to accidents for those on 3-11 and 11-7 shifts. This will be covered on a voluntary basis. If there are no volunteers and the absence is for one week or less, the junior employee on day shift will be transferred to the required shift. If the absence is for more than one week and there are no volunteers, the shift will be covered on a rotating bases, one week at a time by reverse seniority.
83
■ If an employee on rotating shift is granted vacation during the week his 3-11 or 11-7 shift fall on, he is expected to arrange to exchange shifts with someone within his trade to cover the shift and advise his foreman of the change. If he has not done so one week before his scheduled rotation, the process (department) foreman will arbitrarily arrange the exchange.
-	If conditions warrant that additional people are required on 3-11 and 11-7 shift, the requirements will be covered on a rotation basis until a suitable person is hired and trained.
-	In certain circumstances, due the amount of training required, it may be advantageous to assign an employee to an area on a resident basis. In these cases, the shift requirements will be clearly stated and the employee who fills the job will be required to work those shift only while he has that job.

SUBJECT: UTILIZING S.E.A. EMPLOYEES TO MINIMIZE LAYOFF
Where management has determined that existing employees possess the necessary skills and are able to efficiently perform painting assignments within the plant the following will apply:
a)	During Plant Layoff Only
The painting job must be in part of the plant where the job can be performed Monday to Friday during regular working hours (no overtime).
The S.E.A. employees will be reassigned using Article 17.2 for the time needed to complete said job.
b)	Painting jobs that because of their location and production demands cannot be done until Saturdays and Sundays will continue to be contracted out.
When there is no plant layoff we will continue to contract out painting.
The plant maintenance foreman and the S.E.A. maintenance steward will communicate each job and decide which section it falls under.
Yours truly,
H.W. Short

Dear Mr. Losier
RE-:: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
I want to confirm the commitment I gave to you relative to the continuous improvement program underway in the organization. Specifically, I stated that full-time employees who have a job elimination/combination which is identified through a V.A.M. project, will be utilized until a permanent opening occurs to which they can obtain job ownership via Article 17.8. Permanent job vacancies will occur as a result of retirements, resignations, discharge, death, etc., and when such vacancies occur employees must apply or will be assigned job ownership according the Collective Agreement. The Company will notify the Association of job elimination/combinations resulting from a V.A.M. project, together with job openings that occur, to ensure that displaced full-time employees are permanently reassigned.
As much as possible, employees will be assigned to their same shift provided this can be done consistent with the Collective Agreement.
Also the Company agrees there will be no Self Directed Work Team during this Agreement.
Yours truly,
J.E. Lauer
