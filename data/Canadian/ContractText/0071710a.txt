ARTICLE I- PURPOSE
1.01	The general purpose of this Agreement is to establish mutually satisfactory relations between the Company and its employees and to provide machinery for the prompt and equitable disposition of grievances, and to establish and maintain satisfactory working conditions, hours and wages for all employees who are subject to the provisions of this Agreement, keeping in mind at all times that the welfare and prosperity of the employees are contingent upon the Company’s ability to successfully compete in the trade and in the sale of its products.
ARTICLE II- RECOGNITION AND SCOPE
2.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the bargaining unit composed of all employees of the Company in its Plant #2, 703 Douro Street, in the City of Stratford, Ontario, save and except supervisors, persons above the rank of supervisors, timekeepers and time clerks, office and sales staff and plant guards.
2.02	Wherever the word employee or the word employees is used throughout this Agreement it shall mean the employee or employees within the respective divisions (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the divisions or division) as provided in Section 2.01.
2.03	As a condition of employment, any employee hired or transferred into a division shall become a member of the Union not later than 30 days following their hire or transfer into that division and shall maintain membership in the Union as a condition of continued employment. During the orientation process, the new employee will be introduced to their Union steward.
2.04	Any employee may take up any personal matter directly with the Company at any time.
2.05	(a) n the event that the Company moves or transfers a portion of
the production and equipment at Plant 2 in Stratford to a new factory owned or leased or operated by it, then in that event, the Company will give the Union notice of such a move or transfer
l
as far in advance as practicable and will meet with the Union for the purpose of working out a transfer or production agreement covering employees laid off as a result of such move or transfer, provided always however, that there is no Collective Agreement to which the Company is a party or is bound by reason of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act or amendments thereto, covering a bargaining unit at the new factory. In the event there is a Collective Agreement covering a bargaining unit at the new factory, employees laid off as a result of the move or transfer shall, subject to said Collective Agreement, be offered the opportunity to transfer with their jobs.
(b) If production should resume at Plant 1 it shall be CAW 4451 work and shall fall under the scope of our Collective Labour Agreement Former Plant 1 employees shall have first right to go back with their full seniority. Plant 2 employees would have January 2000 seniority. In the event production should resume at Plant 1 all references to Plant 1 that were deleted from the Collective Agreement during the 2011 bargaining process shall be reinstituted.
ARTICLE III - UNION DUES CHECK-OFF AND INITIATION FEE
3.01	(a) The parties agree that there shall be set up, as of the date hereof, a check-off of Union dues, compulsory upon all employees who come within the bargaining unit, in which this agreement applies. The check-off shall continue during the life of this agreement. Every employee within the bargaining unit shall become eligible to the check-off upon completion of forty (40) hours worked in the first calendar month of employment within the Company.
The amount to be deducted shall be such sum as may, from time to time, be assessed by the Union on its members, according to its constitution and by-laws, for general Union purposes, as regular weekly Union dues. This check-off of Union dues shall be deducted from a pay cheque for the
2
calendar month in which the first forty (40) hours of employment are completed and remitted to the financial secretary of CAW Local 4451, prior to the fifteenth (15'h) day of the following month.
(b) The Company shall also deduct from the pay of every employee who comes within the bargaining unit and who has completed thirty (30) calendar days of employment with the Company, one (1) Union initiation fee during their employment with the Company provided the employee has not, at an earlier time, paid an initiation fee to the Union, with proof. The amount of the initiation fee shall be the amount fixed by the constitution and by-laws of the Union. The initiation fee shall be deducted from a pay cheque in the calendar month following the month in which the said thirty (30) calendar days of employment have been completed, and remitted to the financial secretary of the Local along with the next remittance of Union dues as aforesaid.
3.02	The Company agrees to deduct Union dues and/or the equivalent of Union dues according to the constitution of the CAW from all employees in the bargaining unit beginning with the first month in which forty (40) hours of employment have been completed. The Company will agree to take dues off weekly and will agree to show annual union dues deducted on the employee’s T4 tax form. Retroactive payments and initiation fees will be deducted once per month. Monthly dues will be equivalent to two hours 20 minutes straight time pay including COLA for all members who work 40 hours or more in a calendar month. Since dues are deducted weekly, this may result in arrears situations when a member works less than a full month. Any arrears will be deducted from subsequent pays. Anyone working less than 40 hours in a calendar month will not be required to pay dues for that month.
The list will contain the employee’s name, badge number, address, postal code and telephone number along with the amount of such deductions and the reason, if any, why no deductions were made from certain employees.
The financial secretary of the Local Union shall notify the Company, in writing, of any corrections to be made in the sums deducted.
3
Any dispute as to the alleged breach of these provisions or to the interpretation of any of the terms of conditions shall be dealt with at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE IV - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
4.01	The Union acknowledges that it is the exclusive function of the Company to:
(A)	Maintain order, discipline and efficiency.
(B)	Hire, discharge, transfer, promote, demote or discipline employees and determine employee’s qualifications and qualifications needed for a job, provided that a claim of unfair supervision, promotion, demotion, transfer, determination of employee’s qualifications, or qualifications needed for a job, or a claim that an employee has been discharged or disciplined without just cause may be the subject of a grievance and dealt with hereinafter provided.
(C)	The Union further acknowledges the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities. Except as may be restricted by this Agreement, the Company retains all rights, functions and prerogatives, including, but not limited, to, the location of the plants, the direction of the working forces, the products to be manufactured, and the material used in manufacturing and their sources, the schedules of production, the methods, processes and means of manufacturing used, the right to decide on the number of employees needed by the Company at any time, the rights to use improved methods, machinery and equipment and jurisdiction over all operations, buildings, machinery, tools and employees in its plants.
(D)	Establish occupational groups and to discontinue, restrict or expand the same, and will have meaningful discussion with the Union prior to implementation.
4.02	It is recognized that good discipline must be maintained. It is agreed, therefore, that the Company shall have the right without hindrance, other than by grievance procedure, to discipline employees
who violate any provisions of this Agreement or any Company rules. The Company will discuss new rules and regulations with the Union prior to implementation.
ARTICLE V - DISCIPLINARY ACTION
5.01	The following procedure will apply when a seniority employee is to be given a written reprimand, suspension or discharge:
(A)	When the Company believes an offense has been committed that warrants a written reprimand, suspension or termination, the employee with a Union representative will be interviewed in an office and advised of the alleged offense within two (2) working days of the Company becoming aware of the infraction. This time limit will not apply in cases of absenteeism.
(B)	Following a full investigation by both parties, to be completed within two (2) days of the employee being advised of the offense, unless a longer period is needed and mutually agreed upon, the employee and the Union will be advised of the penalty to be imposed.
(C)	When the union disagrees with the penalty stated above, a meeting may be requested with the employee, the chairperson or their designate, and the Manager of Human Resources or their designate to be held prior to the employee losing time because of the penalty to be imposed, to attempt to mitigate the discipline. After consideration of the Union’s position, the Company will impose the disciplinary action they believe is appropriate under the circumstances. It is understood that Article (c) may not apply to written reprimands.
(D)	If after Step (c) the Union still feels the issue has not been properly addressed, it shall be dealt with at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
5.02	(A) Article 5.01 shall not apply when the alleged violation may
endanger the safety of the employee themself or other employees, or be of such a nature that it would be inadvisable to retain the employee in the plant, e.g. such violations involving drunkenness or fighting.
5
(B)	In such cases, the Company may immediately remove such employee from the premises.
5.03	(A) The following special procedure shall be applicable to a
grievance alleging improper discharge or suspension of an employee having seniority. They shall have the right to interview their committee person or steward in a suitable place for a reasonable period of time before leaving the plant premises. The discharged or suspended employee shall present the grievance in writing, signed by them, to the Company management at any time within three normal working days next following the day on which the discharge or suspension takes place. The management will review the discharge or suspension with the discharged or suspended employee or with the discharged or suspended employee and committee and render its decision in writing within three (3) normal working days after said review. The consideration of their grievance may include not only the merits of the case, but also what, if any compensation shall be paid for the time lost in the event their reinstatement is agreed upon. The word “committee” as used in this paragraph shall mean the committee mentioned in Section 6.07 or a quorum thereof.
5.04	(A) A copy of all disciplinary notations will be given to the
employee (including probationary employees) and the Union and such notice will become part of the employee’s personnel record. If an employee has had a disciplinary notation placed on their record and has since the date of that placement, been employed for a period of twelve (12 ) active months, (eighteen (18) months for attendance disciplines), without having further discipline notation placed on their record, it is understood that said discipline or any prior discipline shall not be used against them.

The appointment shall forthwith be rescinded at any time when there is a committee person employed in the same production area on the same shift as the steward.
6.04	In the event that two or more committee people are employed in one production area on the same shift, the committee shall forthwith designate to the Company one committee person in that production area who shall alone be entitled to handle grievances arising in such production area pursuant to the procedure hereinafter provided.
6.05	A steward during their term of office shall be deemed to be a committee member within the meaning of Section 7.01 to 7.03 inclusive in the absence of a committee person.
6.06	(A) The Chairperson or designate, being employed in the division

(B) In the event that the chairperson/co-chairperson of the Union deems it necessary to convene a special or emergency meeting during their working day they shall be given the necessary time off to attend same. It is understood that the chairperson/co-chairperson shall give the Company as much notice of such meeting as is practical.
7

ARTICLE VII - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.01	It is the mutual desire of the parties hereto that complaints of employees be adjusted as quickly as possible and it is understood that an employee has no grievance until they or their area grievance committee person or their steward or co-chairperson have given their supervisor an opportunity to adjust their complaint.
STEP 1:
The employee or their area steward or local co-chairperson shall discuss the complaint with the area supervisor within three (3) working days of the complaint and the supervisor shall have three (3) working days from the date of being so informed to attempt to resolve the matter. If the complaint is not settled at this step, then the grievance may be processed under the provisions of Step 2.
STEP 2:
Within three (3) working days the co-chairperson or their authorized Union designate, may present this grievance in writing to the plant manager, or their designate, who will give a written decision within three (3) working days of receipt of grievance.
STEP 3:
Within three working days of receiving a decision under Step 2, the
8
Union shall request in writing, a meeting between the Company and Grievance Committee, as provided for in Section 6.07. Such meeting shall take place within nine (9) working days of such notification or such time as may be mutually agreed upon. If the grievance is not settled at such time, the grievance may be referred to arbitration by the Union or the Company.
7.02	It shall be optional with the Company to decline to consider any grievance, the alleged circumstances of which originated or occurred more than five (5) working days prior to its presentation, provided however, that in the case where an employee could not have become aware of the alleged circumstances within the said five (5) working days, the said period will commence to run from the time when they did become aware of them.
7.03	It is understood that the Company may bring forward at any meeting held or convened with the grievance committee, any complaint with the respect to the conduct of the Union or its members, including a claim for damages if the alleged circumstances of such complaint originated or occurred within two weeks of the holding or calling of the meeting. It is also understood that if such complaint is not settled, it may be treated as a grievance and referred to arbitration in the same way as the grievance of an employee.
7.04	A grievance by the Union may be initiated in writing at the second stage of the grievance procedure, provided the subject matter of the grievance is not such that it could be disposed of at the first stage of the grievance procedure on the grievance of an employee.
ARTICLE VIII - ARBITRATION
8.01	(A) When either party to this agreement requests that a grievance be submitted to arbitration, such request shall be made in writing addressed to the other party to this agreement.
(B)	The party to whom such request is directed shall immediately write to the arbitrator whose name is next in the sequence of rotation seeking a date for arbitration. The arbitrators and the sequence of their rotation are as follows:
1)	Professor W. A. Rayner
2)	Louisa Davie
9
(C)	Should any of the arbitrators constituting the panel of arbitrators withdraw or resign from the panel, then the party who nominated the arbitrator who has withdrawn or resigned shall forthwith submit to the other party to this agreement a list of four (4) nominees from which shall be selected one (1) nominee to replace the arbitrator who has withdrawn or resigned.
(D)	The arbitrator shall act in rotation with respect to each successive grievance that is referred to arbitration. Should the arbitrator to whom the reference is made be unable to hear the grievance within ninety (90) calendar days after the grievance has been referred to them, then they shall be passed over to the next arbitrator on the list.
(E)	The expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally between the parties.
(F)	The arbitrator shall not have the right to alter, amend, add to, subtract from, or eliminate any of the terms and provisions of this agreement except as otherwise provided herein. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The Arbitrator may substitute a lesser penalty for discipline.
(G)	At the request of either party or the arbitrator, all reasonable arrangements shall be made to permit the arbitrator to take a view of the premises in question or the site at which the dispute took place together with the representatives of both parties and material witnesses who may be involved.
(H)	Only matters which have been dealt with under the grievance procedure may be submitted to arbitration.
8.02	As an alternative to the regular arbitration procedure the parties shall have the option of mutually agreeing to refer a post third step grievance to a grievance commissioner in the following procedure:
(A)	The Company and the Union may agree in writing to the appointment of a person or persons as a single arbitrator to be known as a grievance commissioner (where more than one, acting in rotation) will set aside such time as may be requested by the Company and the Union to consider and determine
10
grievances referred to them hereunder for final and binding arbitration. The grievance commissioner shall have the same powers and be subject to the same limitations as an arbitrator under clause 8.02.
(B)	Through the grievance commissioner, the parties desire the expeditious means for the effective disposition of grievances which the parties have agreed may be handled in a summary manner. The rules governing the summary proceedings of the grievance commissioner are set out in this article.
(C)	The decision of the grievance commissioner shall only be applicable in the case in question and shall not constitute a precedent nor be used by either party as precedent in future cases. Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement, the decision of the grievance commissioner shall:
(i)	be consistent with the provisions of this agreement;
(ii)	be confined to the grievance referred to them.

working days to acquire occupational group seniority. It is agreed that when an employee has completed eight (8) hours of their regular scheduled shift, they will be credited with one (1) day towards their occupational seniority. An employee who has only worked four
(4)	hours of their shift due to permitted management leave or if moved to another area for half of their shift, will still be credited one (1) day towards their occupational seniority. Less than four (4) hours worked in all other circumstances will not be considered a credited day. When their trial period is completed their name will be placed on the appropriate occupational group seniority list.
(2)	The trial or probationary period for all Skilled Trades, Quality Control, Mold Set-up, Ransburg and Finishing Leadhand, and Extrusion Facilitator shall be sixty (60) working days and an employee must work in these groups for a trial period of up to sixty (60 working days) to acquire occupational group seniority.

11.01	In the event of a lay-off of an employee after one half of their regular scheduled shift, seniority for the balance of the shift shall be exercised by them in the following manner:
16
(A)	First they shall have the option of bumping junior employees in their group;
(B)	Wherever the Company deems jobs are available;
(C)	They shall have the option of bumping probationary employees if able to do the work required;
(D)	They will have the option of bumping employees in the following jobs: Plant #2 - stand alone end sealing, box making, general clean-up, and any other jobs mutually agreed upon between the Company and the Union.
11.02	Seniority rights of employees shall be exercised upon lay-off as follows:
(A)	An employee working in an occupational group shall be entitled to seniority over an employee in that group having less seniority.
(B)	The parties agree on the intent to move toward master seniority within each facility in the following manner:
Lay-offs of more than one (1) consecutive day will be done by master seniority except in the occupational groups listed below. The parties agree in the application of this agreement, the one (1) consecutive day may be increased to three (3) consecutive days in the event that an employee is sent home due to a lire, flood, labour dispute, failure of power or major mechanical breakdown.
Plant #2
Skilled Trades QA Classifications #46 Facilitators
To ensure that senior employees will be retained, employees upon layoff from their own classification may be moved to occupational groups other than the occupational group they would be entitled to. In such cases, the affected employee who has been moved to another classification, at the discretion of the Company, will be paid at the base rate of their previous occupational group job or the base rate of the job transferred to, whichever is greater.
17
The Company reserves the right to periodically revalidate training that has been completed. This would include employees who hold occupational group seniority but have not performed duties within the job for quite some time.
If a situation should arise in the future that causes undue hardship to the Company due to unforeseen contingencies, the parties shall meet and discuss what measures can be taken to protect senior employees while ensuring quality productivity is maintained. Examples would include, but not limited to, new program assignments where movement of employees could jeopardize customer requirements, or high percentages of workers in a job that would need to be displaced simultaneously. In these cases, the Company would displace 20% of the employees working in that occupational group or area. When these employees have obtained an efficiency rate that is acceptable to the Company (no more than two weeks), the next senior employee will displace the next junior employee in the same manner aforesaid. Should it be determined that an employee cannot perform the job they will be unable to continue to utilize their seniority under this provision. (E.g. A layoff occurs in Plant 2. 20 people would be affected by layoff in group 49 in U251. The 20 people from Extrusion that would bump to group 49 have no moulding experience. The 4 senior people would be moved from Extrusion to group 49 to begin training - not to exceed 2 weeks. The remaining 16 people from Extrusion would be laid off to the street. Once the first 4 people are trained, or after 2 weeks, then the next 4 people would be recalled from lay-off to group 49 to begin the process again.)
(C)	An employee laid off while working on one (1) shift shall not be entitled to exercise their seniority rights upon another shift until after the lapse of one (1) working day (at least 24 hours from the beginning of their shift). For example, an employee laid off from their afternoon shift on Tuesday would not be entitled to exercise seniority until the beginning of Wednesday’s afternoon shift.
(D)	In the event of the breakage of tools or the happening of unforeseen contingencies, the Company may temporarily
transfer an employee for the remainder of the shift to work other than their usual work and in such event seniority rights shall not be exercised by an employee.
(E)	An employee when transferred to an occupational group (Not pool) shall be deemed to be serving a trial period within such group for such number of days as may appear appropriate or necessary, provided however, that such employees shall not be considered to be serving a trial period after completing 40 working days (Skilled Trades or Quality Control occupational groups, 60 working days) within such group. They shall for such trial period retain their seniority, if any, within the group from which they were transferred.
(F)	If an employee gets laid off from a Group and subsequently accepts a job posting for another Group, their rights to the original job will be waived, except for lay off. The employee will however, be allowed to sign a job posting to get back to their old job if openings arise, and the four (4) month waiting period will be waived.
(G)	Employees having the same seniority date shall be laid off and recalled by clock number order, or by occupational group where applicable.
(H)	Where it is practical to do so, employees laid off from their group will be returned to the last (permanent job posting) group they hold, provided that they have the seniority to do so and it conforms to Master Seniority.
(I)	Employees laid off from the only group/shift they hold shall replace the junior wherever the opening is and that will become their home group/shiff until they are recalled to the group/shiff they were laid off from.
(f) When someone is being moved within the group to a different line or cell from where they're crewed, it will be done by seniority, where possible.
(K) The first occupational group/shift that a new employee acquires shall be considered their posted group/shiff.
19

(H)	Employees who are absent from work may have a member of the Union executive and/or bargaining committee or stewards sign a posting on their behalf, provided they will be available to work when required. In the case of Maternity/Parental leave, as per the E.S.A., employees will be eligible to sign one job posting only, for a position in the Company under this article.
21

If the employee has not been moved within this 20 working day period, they until such movement, will be eligible to sign another job posting with the four/six month eligibility clause (as per Article 12.01 (e)) being waived. Once the employee is moved into the new classification, the four/six month eligibility period would revert back to the original date of selection. If the employee has not been moved within the 20 day period, the employee will start accruing seniority in the new group and will be paid the rate of pay of their current group or the new group, whichever is greater.
0) Following lay-off, employees shall be recalled in accordance with their seniority rights as provided in this collective agreement.
(K) When an employee declines a job posting within the 10 day period, the person who replaced them will return to their former group.

It is understood that for all jobs other than those mentioned
22
above, a one (1) step job posting procedure will apply.
(B)	Successful applicants to temporary openings will in no regard be able to maintain the position when the incumbent returns to work, unless successful on a subsequent permanent job posting.

this event, the Company will provide alternate working arrangements to allow apprentices to attend day release or block programs while maintaining the opportunity of working regular hours or the Company will provide payment for such period, up to 80% of their regular earnings.
This bonus will only be paid to those individuals who return to full time work with the Company and remain in the apprenticeship training program.
The Company will reimburse apprentices for tuition and required books of the apprenticeship program upon successful completion of the module.
When the apprentice has signed their contract for apprenticeship they will receive a one time allowance of $250 for the purchase of trade related items. This will not affect their normal tool allowance.
7)	COMPLETION OF APPRENTICESHIP
An apprentice, upon successful completion of their apprenticeship, shall receive the journey person’s classification retroactive to the date of certification (Certification of Qualifications - C of Q) at the applicable top rate of pay. No certificates will be issued by the Apprenticeship Branch, Ontario Department of labour, unless approved by the joint Apprenticeship Committee.
8)	SENIORITY
The apprentices will exercise their seniority in their own classification. (For example, if there are four (4) apprentices in the electrical trade and a reduction in this number is required due to lack of work, the first hired shall be the last laid off and the last laid off shall be the first to be reinstated.)
Upon satisfactory completion of the Apprenticeship Program, the apprentice will obtain skilled trades seniority as of the starting date of the apprenticeship, minus any time spent on layoff or in production due to exercising bumping rights due to layoff. Accumulation of production seniority is frozen and
49
excludes time served in apprenticeship.
Employees who enter the Apprenticeship Training Program shall retain their relative plant seniority until such time as they complete their apprenticeship when the regular apprenticeship seniority rule shall apply. (The apprentice will exercise their relative plant seniority at a time of layoff from the apprenticeship.)
9)	RATIO
The ratio shall not be more than one (1) apprentice to three (3) joumeypersons per plant.
The above mentioned ratio may be modified as the need arises upon approval of the joint Apprenticeship committee.

Notice of apprenticeship openings will be posted on the Company bulletin board as per the job posting procedure.
Applications for apprenticeship will be accepted by the Human Resources Department from seniority employees (employees within the bargaining unit) who consider themselves eligible under this program of training.
Applicants meeting the minimum requirements as per Number five (5) will be turned over to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee for approval or disapproval.
11)	CREDIT FOR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
The committee and the representative from the Ontario Training Adjustment Board will review previous experience and determine if credit for such service will be granted to the apprentice.
12)	DISCIPLINE
The committee shall have the authority to discipline an apprentice and to cancel the apprenticeship agreement of the apprentice at any time for cause pertaining to their apprenticeship such as:
inability to learn;
unsatisfactory work;
Employee’s lack of interest in their work or education.
This shall not limit the right of the Company to discipline an apprentice for cause for matters not related to their training as an apprentice. Such discipline by the Company shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
13)	APPRENTICES
Apprentices in each of the trades covered shall be paid a progressively increasing schedule of wages as follows;

No seniority in skilled trades would be accrued. The rate of pay would be ten (10) cents per hour less than the first year apprentice base rate. This employee would only help with jobs that have limited responsibility such as snow removal, lubrication, or helping a certified millwright with their normal duties. The successful employee would be utilized for future openings.
This clause in no event would allow an apprentice or a millwright to be on layoff status at the same time.
51
Maintenance helpers that are in the group for six (6) months in any consecutive twelve (12) month period will be offered the position as skilled-trades apprentice. The selection for maintenance helper will be as per selection of apprentices;

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING SKILLED TRADES VACATION PERIOD
Given the nature and scope of the work within the Skilled Trades Department, given proper justification, the employees in this area will have until April 30 of each year to use their previous years’ vacation entitlement. This is intended to allow the Skilled Trades employees an opportunity to use their vacation entitlement at a more desirable time, not for accumulation of vacation entitlement.
Letter of Understanding Re: Skilled Trades
During negotiations the parties had considerable discussions pertaining to Job Security and Outside Contracting language currently contained in Article 19.04 of the Collective Agreement. These discussions included but were not limited to planning, advance notice of outside contracting activities, scope of the work to be contracted, full utilization of skilled trades employees in their respective trades and the installation of new or existing equipment.
While the parties agree that the language in the Collective Agreement currently provides for a mechanism to ensure that there is full input and communications between the parties relating to the issues noted above, it was recognized that there may be times where due to the excessive workloads that they may have been lax in exercising their responsibilities to ensure the most effective use of the article.
The Company and the Union therefore agree upon ratification of this agreement to work more closely together to open up the lines of communications through meaningful dialogue to ensure language in Article 19 is being fully taken advantage of in the most efficient manner for the benefit of each side.
It is the parties expectations that if the current language is made use of in an proficient manner that many of the current difficulties relating to this article can and will be avoided.
The senior tradesperson on each shift for each trade shall be paid the Lead Hand Rate

Any employee unable to work their scheduled shift for the weekend will be responsible to find someone on the full shift to switch with them. This will not be a Company responsibility. Where there is failure to find someone, the employee is required to work their scheduled shift. It is the intent of this clause, that if more than one person wants to switch on to this shift then the senior person will have the opportunity to work.
9.	The employee will give the Company thirty (30) days written notice of their wish to transfer from the weekend shift.

NON-DISCRIMINATION/ HARASSMENT INTRODUCTION
Both the Company and the Union are committed to providing a workplace free of discrimination and harassment. Providing fair and equitable treatment for all employees is best achieved in an environment where all individuals interact with mutual respect for each other’s rights. All employees are expected to treat all persons with courtesy and consideration and must not engage in discrimination or harassment because of a prohibited ground contrary to the Ontario human rights Code (the “Code”). Prohibited grounds are race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, record of offenses, marital status, family status or handicap, as defined in the Code. This joint policy shall be interpreted in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Code.
COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE
If an employee believes that they have been harassed and/or discriminated against on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination the employee may:
A)	Advise the person involved, as soon as possible, how you feel and request that they stop the conduct you find offensive.
B)	If you feel uncomfortable approaching the person, or if the
harassment continues, bring the incident forming the basis of
the complaint to the attention of the supervisor and/or Union
representative.
92	v
In minor cases, not involving repeat incidents, the Company and Union agree that the Union may try to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint between bargaining unit employees informally using the CAW Internal Procedure without a full investigation when so requested by the bargaining unit complainant. The outcome of this attempted resolution will be communicated to the Company.
C)	If the supervisor and/or Union representative cannot, to the satisfaction of the employee, deal with the complaint, it will then be submitted in writing to the joint committee.
The joint committee will be comprised of two (2) representatives selected by the Company and Two (2) representatives selected by the Union. Where the complainant is a woman and the complaint involves sexual harassment or gender discrimination, the joint investigation committee will include at least one (1) woman. These representatives must be appropriately trained regarding harassment and discrimination issues.
The joint committee will conduct an investigation of the complaint. The joint investigation will include interviews of the complainant, any employee accused in the complaint, witnesses and other persons named in the complaint. Any Union members interviewed by the joint committee may, if they so wish, have Union representation present during the interview.
It is the intention of the Union and the Company that, where practical, the joint investigation will begin within five (5) working days of the lodging of the written complaint and shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days after the lodging of the written complaint.
In conducting the joint investigation, both the Union and the Company shall, to the extent practicable, maintain confidentiality. Records of the investigation, including interviews, evidence any recommendations made by the joint committee will be securely maintained in the offices of the
93
Company and the Union.
Upon the completion of the joint investigation, the joint committee will complete a written report of its findings and recommendations and submit a copy of the completed report to the human resource person and the plant chairperson. If the members of the joint committee do not agree, the report may reflect differences in the findings.
If a harassment complaint is proven valid, appropriate corrective action will be taken against the offending employees.
If, after completion of a thorough investigation, a harassment complaint can neither be proved nor disproved in the view of the investigators, the local human resource person, on consultation with the local plant chairperson, will attempt to resolve the conflict in a manner that is agreeable to all parties.
If there is no agreement, the Company reserves the right to take such action as it deems appropriate, subject to the Collective Labour Agreement.
In the event the complaint remains unresolved and a violation of the Collective Labour Agreement is alleged, the matter may be considered as a grievance beginning at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Nothing in this letter of understanding prevents an individual employee complaining of harassment or discrimination from filing a complaint under the Code.
Two (2) hours of Anti-harassment / anti-violence training will be provided for all members during the first year of the contract. This training will be provided by the CAW.
LETTER NO. 10 LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
The Chairperson of the Local and the co-chairperson from each plant and one skilled trades representative will be retained on the day shift where it is practical to do so, or if arrangements can be mutually agreed upon. It 94
shall not be considered practical if this arrangement causes an employee to work more weeks of afternoons or midnights in comparison to days, against their wishes.
LETTER NO. 11
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - SHORTAGE OF WORK
When the Company or the Union become aware of a trend towards an ongoing shortage of work, they shall meet, discuss and review what measures may be taken to protect senior employees from four hour layoffs.
LETTER NO. 12
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - STRAIGHT SHIFT POSTINGS All job openings will be posted by shift.
It is the Company’s intent to treat Straight Shift Postings as per the procedure outlined in Article XII - Job Posting.
As further clarification, the following must be noted:
•	The 4-6 month eligibility period as per the Job Posting procedure shall apply for Shift postings. It must be noted that the week-end shift and the 12-hour shifts are excluded from this because they are asked by seniority working in the group, not posted.
•	Straight shift postings will not be posted by line. If an individual has been successful on a posting for a particular shift, they will not be entitled to sign another posting for the same shift within the same group.
•	If additional employees are required within the group where the straight shift occurs, the posting will be open to all eligible employees to sign.
•	If additional employees are not required within the group where the straight shift occurs, the posting will only be open to individuals currently working within that group.
•	When it is necessary to reduce a shift in a straight shift area, the employees affected will exercise their seniority in that group on
95
their straight shift. If the employee does not have enough seniority to maintain their straight shift they will bump the junior in that group on the shift of their choice provided that they have the seniority to do so.
•	Should an employee leave their straight shift posting for a temporary 12 hour shift or a temporary weekend shift they will not lose their right to a straight shift in the event they are no longer required on these temporary shifts.
•	When new lines or cells come into a group the senior employees in that group/shift shall have first opportunity to work in those areas.
Should any additional unforeseen issues arise, the Company agrees to meet with the Union and discuss the concerns.
LETTER NO. 13
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - OVERTIME PLANT 8

96
shortage of at least eight (8) hours pay in a work week, through no fault of their own, it will be rectified within a twenty-four hour period, if requested by the employee.
LETTER NO. 17
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - PLANT CLOSURE
In the event that the company should close either of its plants:
(A)	1. The company will notify the local and National Union where possible, 6 months, but at least 2 months prior to cessation of operation.
2.	The parties will meet to discuss ways of attempting to avert the closure.
3.	If attempts to avert the plant closure are not successful, the Company and the Union Representatives will meet to discuss the manner in which the closure is carried out.
4.	The discussions between the parties will include but will not be limited to severance entitlements, benefit coverage and an adjustment process.
5.	The company agrees to negotiate with the Union in an attempt to provide a severance package that will be an improvement over what is provided in the Employment Standards Act of Ontario.
6.	The Company further agrees that any extension in benefit coverage will be over and above that which is currently contained within the Collective agreement between the parties.
7.	Employees will be allowed vacation pay in lieu of time off for vacation.
8.	The company will provide job search and social counseling to affected employees under the auspices of a Provincial and/or Federal Industrial Adjustment Committee.
9.	The Company will be committed to working closely with the Union to implement this committee. The chairperson
97
will be, subject to the approval of the Industrial Adjustment Service, selected by the committee. The committee shall consist of up to 3 representatives from the company and a minimum of 3 representatives from the Union, to be chosen by each respectively.
10.	The terms agreed to in this letter of understanding concerning the plant closure are in addition to any benefits or rights which may flow from the existing collective agreement between the parties or from any applicable Provincial Legislation. The signing of this letter of understanding in no way effects the interpretation by either of the applicable legislation as it pertains to plant closure.
11.	After the announcement of a plant closure, employees hired on or before January 1, 2000 will be given a seniority date of January 1, 2000 in the other facility. If a situation should arise that causes undue hardship to the Company due to unforeseen contingencies, the parties shall meet and discuss what measures can be taken to protect senior employees while ensuring quality productivity is maintained. Examples would include, but not limited to, new program assignments where movement of employees could jeopardize customer requirements, or high percentages of workers in a job that would need to be displaced simultaneously. In these cases, the Company would displace 20% of the employees working in that occupational group or area. When these employees have obtained an efficiency rate that is acceptable to the Company, the next senior employee will displace the next junior employee in the same manner aforesaid. Should it be determined that an employee cannot perform the job they will be unable to continue to utilize their seniority under this provision.
(B)	Following numerous discussions between the parties regarding potential closure of Erie Street and/or the consolidation of work and equipment into Douro Street or vice versa, the following understanding was agreed to by the Company and the
98
Union to run in conjunction with Letter 17 A) above.
As positions are transferred from Erie Street, the employees will come with their jobs provided that their occupational group does not already exist in the Douro facility. In the event that work is absorbed into existing equipment at Douro Street, positions would not be transferred from Erie Street.
Those Erie Street employees who transfer with these jobs will not be affected by lay-offs in the rest of the Douro facility provided that they remain in these jobs. Upon lay-off from these jobs, employees in this area may bump into the Erie Street facility if they have the seniority to do so. Upon lay-off from Erie Street jobs, senior employees will have the opportunity of bumping into remaining Erie Street jobs with their choice of shift.
Any new work coming into the plant will not fall under this clause. Once the existing Plant 1 programs end, these employees will follow the current collective agreement.
Note: Erie Street employees will only be granted a January 1, 2000 seniority date after the announcement of a plant closure. Erie Street employees who have posted to Douro Street through the normal posting procedure prior to these discussions, will be granted a Douro Street seniority date of January 1, 2000 in the event of a plant closure. Their positions on the seniority list will be determined based upon their Erie Street seniority date.
It is agreed that Letter 17 will be invoked for the purposes of seniority only when any program is moved or ends from Erie Street excluding the KA/KK business.

Clarification on Weekend Overtime re:
Long Weekends for Weekend Shift Workers
Article 14.04 (D)
Sign-up sheets for week-end overtime will be posted each week on Sunday night and will remain posted until Wednesday at Noon. Employees wishing to be considered for week-end overtime must sign the sheet during this period. The Union will immediately be given a copy of the sign-up sheets as they are taken down and prior to the overtime being allocated. Employees will be asked to work additional hours on Saturday and Sunday in the following manner until the required number has been attained:
(A)	By seniority within the group required normally doing the job on shift, (excluding 3-12’s)
(B)	By seniority within the group normally doing the job - shift 2 and 3 and weekend shift (by master seniority over all three shifts)
(C)	(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) - As per article 14.04 D same as in collective agreement.
This section will only apply when there is a weekend shift working in the plant on long weekends.
E.g. Weekend shift works Friday night shift 10:55 p.m. - 10:55 a.m. and then again Monday from 10:55 a.m. - 10:55 p.m., this would give them the opportunity to work an 8 hour overtime shift on the Sunday after people normally doing the job on shift.
