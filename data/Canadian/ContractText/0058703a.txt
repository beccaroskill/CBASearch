Since you are not only a worker in a food plant, but also a consumer yourself, you should be more than willing to do your best to help produce a quality product if you want to demand that other manufacturers produce food to your liking. Therefore, with the signing of an Agreement between the Company and Union, you along with Management pledge to do your best to uphold the safety, quality and purity of the food you help produce.
