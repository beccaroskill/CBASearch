The parties recognize that job opportunity and security shall increase in proportion to length of service in a particular line of progression. It is therefore agreed that senior employees shall be
36
entitled to preference in all cases of job posting, vacation, transfer, lay-off, and rehiring after lay-off in a particular line of progression.
In the event that the Company requires more employees in either line of progression, employees may move between either lines of progression commensurate with the seniority the employee holds in that line of progression moving into.
The line of progression shall be set forth in this agreement, subject to any changes agreed upon between the company and the union. Such changes will be in writing and signed by both parties. Any new job established in the line of progression shall become part of the line of progression.
Seniority shall be the main reason for advancement in the line of progression.

In such instances, it is agreed that when an employee holding seniority in the line is not progressed, he shall receive the higher job class and be trained as soon as possible.
If an employee next in the line of progression does not desire to progress to the next position, he may decline to do so (for permanent vacant positions only but will progress for all other reasons. Ex vacations, sickness, etc.
37
A junior employee may progress to a higher job class than a senior employee who has declined to progress. In a reduction in the workforce the senior employee who declines to progress in the line of progression will exit the line of progression before the said junior employee who is now ahead in that line of progression.
Entry to the line of progression will be by job posting. In the event of a reduction in the workforce, an employee shall be deemed to have the right to a position that is lower in the line of progression and will bump down the line to a position he can hold, according to job progression seniority. You shall regress as you progress and progress as you regress.
An employee who is displaced from the line of progression by a reduction in the workforce shall have the right to bump a junior employee in the entry level job of progression or a posted job outside the line of progression.
An employee may exit the line of progression by:
a)	Reduction in the workforce due to
	shortage of work;
b)	Bumping by a senior employee;
c)	Successful application to a job
	posting
d)	Legitimate medical reasons.
An employee may regress in the line of progression by legitimate medical reasons and/or by mutual agreement by the Company and the Union.

As changes occur to the relative position of employees on the list, new lists will be posted. The Union may request and receive a current copy of the list.
Each job in a line of progression shall have a job progression list.
Job seniority for each job in a line of progression will reflect the order in which an employee has progressed to that job. i.e. an employee who has first progressed to that job would be first on the job seniority list for that job and an employee who has last progressed to that job will be last on the job seniority list for that job.
An employee shall be on the job seniority list of jobs in one line of progression only.
