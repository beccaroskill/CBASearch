LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1
RE: Overtime
For greater clarity, the Company and the Union agree that overtime will be assigned to Associates who have the ability to perform the work as follows:
a.	If there is more than 24 hours' notice that a full shift of overtime will be required the Company shall post a signup sheet. The overtime will be assigned to Associates who signed the sheet by seniority.
b.	If there is less than 24 hours' notice that overtime will be required:
(i)	If there is more than 2 hours overtime, it will be offered by seniority.
(ii)	If there is up to and including 2 hours overtime for an individual position, it will offered by seniority to Associates at work.
(iii)	However, if the entire line is required for up to and including two hours, the overtime will be performed by the Associates performing the jobs. Only 2 hours of overtime may be scheduled on an associates last scheduled shift of the week.
c.	If an "emergency" as defined in article 8.05, then the Associate performing the job will be required to perform the overtime.
For additional clarity, when calling in Associates by seniority for an overtime shift, the following guidelines will be followed:
1.	First choice is to find someone at regular time.
2.	If overtime is necessary, then offered by seniority if able to do the work and available.
3.	We will make every effort to schedule a full shift before considering splitting the shift. We will first attempt to find someone with at least 12 hours between shifts, then if necessary at least 11 hours between shifts, then if necessary, at least 10 hours between shifts.
4.	If unable to schedule the full shift as described in (3) above, then split the shift into two 4-hour segments.
5.	When scheduling a full or split overtime shift, "time alignment" will bear consideration.
6.	We will only consider someone who is on vacation or stat holiday once all other options have been exhausted.
