14:05 LOCK-OUT PROCEDURES
What is a Lock-out Requirement?
The lockout requirement is a requirement of all employees to isolate and secure the energy source to pieces of equipment that could move or be caused to move while you are working in hazardous areas around the equipment.
Lockout requirements apply to all personnel from clean up crews, to operators, to maintenance and contractors.
The main purpose for having lockout procedures in place is to protect you and others from injury caused by moving equipment.
			■ •>

!' ... SiPiPP		III	\ ,Av.
2,5
The “lock-out” in lockout procedures occurs when you secure, with your lock, the switch or valve of the energy source for the specific piece of equipment you will be working on. Your lock prevents anyone from reenergizing the piece of equipment.
LOCK-OUT GUIDELINES
1.	This Lock-Out guideline is instituted to prevent accidental operation of equipment, which could cause bodily injury to anyone. Written Lock-Out Procedures will be reviewed with you in your “Job Safety Analysis” (JSA’s) for your particularjob.
2.	It is the duty of every person working on equipment to “Lock-Out' the equipment in a manner described in the Lock-Out Procedures.
3.	When any worker is required to work on or around any machine where starting of that machine could constitute a hazard, the machine shall be stopped at the control button and then “Locked-Out” at the main switch or valve controlling the flow of power, electrical, air, water, hydraulic, compressed gas, steam or gravity.
4.	After “Locking-Out" the worker must check the equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pressing the “Start” button. The worker at this point must again press the “Stop” button. All pressurized systems must be bled down to de-energize them where applicable. Install all safety pins and blocking that may be required to ensure your safety.
5.	Each worker must “Lock-Out” equipment personally. If there is more than one lock to be put on a power source and a second worker places their lock on the power source, the second worker must ask the first worker to step back while the second worker tests the start button and so on for each additional lock placed on the power source.
6.	All locks must bear the name or number of the user. Inspection of locks will be made periodically to ensure the name or numbers are legible.
7.	Scissor clamps and cable/chains are supplied to facilitate the use of more than one lock on a “Lock-Out” position.
8.	If in doubt about the location of the switch or the method of pulling it, call your Supervisor. When pulling the switch use your left hand and stand to the right of the switch.
guards are replaced, safety pins and blocking are removed and all other workers are clear of the machine. Only then can the locks be removed and the power turned on.
2.	Locks can only be removed by the person who applied the locks, no other person can remove your locks nor can you remove theirs. The only method for lock removal other than by the worker whom applied the lock is by following the lock removal guidelines (attached).
3.	The last worker to remove his/her lock from the switch has the responsibility to make sure no other worker has inadvertently entered the machine and could be injured if the machine was turned on.
4.	Remove all your locks from the switches or valves and throw them to the “ON’ position taking the same precautions you did when throwing the switches “OFF”.
5.	If a machine is required to be test run after cleaning, repairing or adjusting, get the operator to start up or return to the start buttons and try the machine yourself.
6.	If the above procedure (#5) is not required, inform the Operator or the Supervisor that you have finished and the machine is safe and can be returned to production.
LOCK OUT DURING SHIFT CHANGE:
1.	Workers coming on shift shall place their own locks on all control devices before the individuals going off shift remove their locks, or the Supervisor may Lock-Out the control devices during shift changes to allow workers going off shift to remove their locks.
2.	Workers coming on shift must check equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pushing the start button then the stop button.
3.	Failure to comply with these rules is cause for disciplinary action by the Company. The disciplinary action for a LockOut Violation is an automatic suspension.
YOU ARE LOCKING OUT TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND
YOUR FAMILY
PROCEDURE FOR LOCK REMOVAL Purpose:
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure a safe, acceptable manner by which personal locks may be removed when the owner of the locks is
unavailable.

LOCK-OUT PROCEDURES FOR MOBILE EQUIPMENT:
To reduce the possibility of injury to you and/or to prevent property damage, a lockout tag (“Danger- Do Not Start”) will be used when repairing, servicing, inspecting or cleaning equipment.
a)	Operators, mechanics and welders who repair, service, inspect or clean, operate equipment shall use a lockout tag which they shall carry on them or be sure they have on the machine.
