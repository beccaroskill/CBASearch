The Shift Engineer must enter in the "callback" book, the name of the man called back, the time and the reason for the callback.
4)	The Maintenance employee on standby will be one who is capable of completing any emergency work on all of the Company's production equipment.
5)	The Maintenance man called back must make a brief note in the space provided in the call-back book, describing what was wrong and what he did to correct the situation. Any additional personnel called in (after consulting with the Shift Engineer) must also be recorded in the call-back book.

16)	Standby premium is now $82.50/week for a two shift operation and $131.79/week for a single shift operation, February 1, 1997.

LETTER OF INTENT Re: Overtime Banking
Further to Article 8(1) of the Collective Agreement the following conditions and procedures shall govern the "banking" of overtime.
1)	That the employee advises their Supervisor that they wish to "bank" their overtime at the time of overtime assignment and that such election is irrevocable. The time eligible for banking shall be the work hours in excess of forty (40) hours in a week. The employee must bank all (both straight and premium payment portions) overtime earned on a particular shift with the additional condition that overtime on a given shift must exceed one (1) hour to be eligible for banking.
2)	That time-off in lieu of overtime may only be taken in full-work periods unless replacement is not required in the opinion of the Company.
3)	That one (1) week notice be given in advance of taking time-off in lieu of overtime payment and that the scheduling of time-off be approved by the Company. The Company may at its discretion waive the one (1) week notice requirement if no replacement is required for the employee.
4)	That banked overtime may not be
56
substituted for vacations except that a seniority employee may request to take banked overtime priorto using vacation time if the prior approval cf the Supervisor has been obtained (i.e., if an employee wishes to take a day off and the Supervisor can operate the Department without him for that day, not requiring an additional man to be called in, banked overtime may be used). If an employee is scheduled for lay-off he has the option of using his vacation or banked overtime owing during this lay-off period. However, if an employee calls in sick on a Friday or Monday, and wants to be paid for these days, vacation time must be used instead of banked overtime.
5)	That time-off in lieu of overtime is not considered work time for purposes of Statutory Holiday entitlement, seniority retention, benefit extension, and other such provisions of the Collective Agreement.
6)	Unused "banked" overtime will be paid to the employee at the end of the calendar year.
7)	Pay for "banked" overtime will be at the rate in effect at the time the overtime was banked.

Re: Advance Against Weekly Indemnity or Workers' Compensation Claims
In the event of a delay of over two (2) weeks in the payment of a Weekly Indemnity or Worker's Compensation claim an employee may be provided with pay advances of three hundred dollars ($300) per week or the weekly amount of the claim, whichever is less.

Re: Vacation Banking
The following procedure will apply to the Vacation Banking option referred to in Article 13 of the parties' Collective Agreement:
1)	Elections to bank vacation should be submitted prior to the deadline for vacation scheduling requests. No additional banking of vacation will then be allowed without mutual consent.
2)	Where the Collective Agreement provides that vacation pay will be based on a percentage of the prior years earnings this amount will be converted to eight (8) hour days of pay at the employee's regular rate. The result of the conversion will be the number of days to be banked.
Example:
An employee eligible for 10% vacation pay has earnings of $15,000 in the previous year. He elects to bank his "5th week" entitlement. His current rate is $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount would be 2% of $15,000 divided by $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount equal to 25 (twenty five) hours or 3.125 days.
3)	Employees will be advised at year's
60
end of the amount of vacation which has been banked on their behalf. Once vacation is banked it is "locked in" until retirement, resignation or other form of termination.
4)	Payment for the banked days will be based upon the rate in effect at time of termination. The Company will co-operate to the extent practical and proper to make the payment in the manner the employee feels to be most tax effective.
5)	Where banked vacation becomes payable as a result of death the payment will be made to the deceased employee's beneficiary as indicated by their life insurance beneficiary designation and in the absence of such beneficiary to their estate.

Re: Continental Work Week Article 8 BV
The continental work week will not be introduced into coffee manufacturing unless and until additional volumes are introduced into the factory.
The continental work week is not designed to eliminate overtime. Overtime will continue to be required based on production requirements and employees will continue to receive time and a half for working on their sixth day and double time for working on their seventh day. The only change is that there will be no premium payments for working on Saturday or Sunday where Saturday or Sunday are not the sixth or seventh day that an employee works in the week.
The Company believes that the support functions impacted by the continental work week will be limited to the following:
General Labour	10

Re: Bonus Tied to Factory Targets
The parties agree on the importance of recognizing employees for success at the factory, in saying that, a Bonus Tied to Factory Target, to replace the Nestl6 Company Bonus pian outlined in the Letter of intent Re: Company Bonus; in 1997 and each year thereafter, will be developed and will include the following measurement tools:
1.	Percent of standards produced
2.	First pass quality
3.	Safety
4.	costs
and any other relevant measurement tool(s)
The Bonus Tied to Factory Target program will payout up to 3% of yearly earnings (maximum 2080 hours) if the measurement criteria, as described above, are exceeded. That is, the Program must make money before it can pay out.
A Joint committee will be formed to develop the Program, with the above criteria as the basic measurementtools.

The committee will meet as soon as possible after ratification to endeavour to fully develop the plan in a short period of time. The Pian that is developed will be sent to the Sr, V.P. Human Resources, Sr. V.P, Operations and President, Foods for final approval.
This process must be completed by July 1, 1997. Ifthe local parties are unable to agree on criteria or the targets are not approved by Corporate, the bonus will be based upon the overall company Profit as outlined in the current Letter of Intent, Re: Company Bonus.
