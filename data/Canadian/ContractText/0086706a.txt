In cases involving employees whose continued illness or injury is severe enough to keep them away from work beyond the twenty-six (26) weeks and who after qualifying for long-term disability benefits, recovers sufficiently to perform work, their case shall be reviewed on an individual basis with consideration for medical restrictions opposite viable work arrangements. In such cases there shall be no loss of wages greater than one classification below the employee's former classification.

10.04	Seniority shall be lost upon termination of employment for any reason, as well as upon transfer to a position outside the bargaining unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
seniority lost upon a lay-off lasting less than twenty-four (24) months shall be restored upon re-employment together with credit, for seniority purposes, for the period of such lay-off; and
an employee who transfers to a position outside the Bargaining Unit for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months shall, if he/she returns to the Bargaining Unit, either pay Union dues or lose seniority for that period of time.

The remaining 50% of the vacation weeks of that crew will be allocated in the prime time from the 2nd week in May to the 4th Saturday after Labour Day. If, in the first instance, there are not enough vacation weeks in a crew by area to consecutively block out 52 weeks across the bottom the remaining open squares will be considered available for vacation selection and therefore blocked out.
(d)	If a shutdown is scheduled, each employee affected will schedule enough of their vacation up to three (3) weeks to cover the duration of the shutdown. The Company will endeavour to schedule a shutdown of not more than three (3) weeks duration in any one department. For the remainder of their vacation, or all of it in a year in which a shutdown is not scheduled, each employee, in order of seniority, shall make their initial choice and indicate this selection in the week or consecutive weeks affected on the list. The selection must be made promptly. In making their selection the employee chooses those numbered squares representing vacation weeks from the blocked area referred to above. These choices are then marked down on the form provided by Human Resources Department.
Employees shall have the option of selecting Christmas week on their first choice or subsequent choices.
In the event that production requirements permit, the Company shall have the option of expanding the number of people allowed off during Christmas week.

(e)	In the event the employee chooses to split their vacation then the employee shall indicate their subsequent vacation choice by choosing a numbered square that is available after all other employees on the crew have indicated their initial choice. This procedure will continue until all employees' vacations are committed.
(f)	In small departments, including relief crew and flex crew, the number of vacation weeks in the first 50% may not complete a 52 week block.

An employee who is transferred from crew to crew in the same department will be allowed to maintain one vacation selection of their remaining vacation so long as this vacation selection is the only vacation selection in addition to that allowed under paragraph (b) (i) of this Schedule for that same period.
(i)	In the event an employee's two (2) consecutive "numbered days off' fall during a departmental shutdown, the employee shall have the option of taking the time as scheduled days off or as vacation.
(j)	Whether there is a shutdown or not a minimum of 50% of vacation weeks shall be allowed during the prime time of the 2nd week in May to the 4th Saturday after Labour Day.

EMERGENCY ABSENCE COVERAGE
The Company and the Union recognize the need for continuous and efficient operation of the Plant in order to obtain unrestricted production and high quality products and it is their intention to co-operate and continue to be committed to the successful operation of the provisions of the Emergency Absence Coverage System. The parties will continue to meet from time to time to re-affirm their respective commitments.
Scheduled and unscheduled absences shall be filled in accordance with the provisions hereinafter described:
(a)	Area Shift Forepersons who experience a scheduled and unscheduled absence may request employees to cover such absence from the Foreperson responsible for the Flex Crew arrangement.
(b)	If such requests as outlined in (a) above exceed the number of employees available in the Flex Crew arrangement additional employees may be obtained as follows:
(i) The area Foreperson will determine the area(s) and job(s) where absences exist. The Supervisor will then refer to the volunteer list taken from the cover crew for the area(s) affected in order of seniority. On each successive occasion that coverage is required, the opportunity for overtime will be rotated. Records will be maintained by the area Foreperson. Employees who wish to volunteer for overtime coverage will be required to place their names on a volunteer list supplied by area supervision, which will be posted h	at six (6,)month intervals. This list will be posted for a period of fourteen (14)
days and any employee who is on vacation, sick or an approved leave of absence will have five (5) days after their return to work to include their name for consideration. An employee will be allowed a total of six (6) refusals before their name will be stricken from the list and they will not be allowed to volunteer again until the beginning of the next six (6) month period. If an employee transfers or is transferred from one area/crew to another, they will be allowed, if they desire, to place their name at the bottom of the volunteer overtime list for their new crew.
The top four (4) positions in Staple Spinning (Board, Assistant Board, Process and 1st Operator) and the top two (2) positions in Staple Processing (Senior Staple Process Operator and Staple Drawing Operator) would maintain a separate list for overtime. Overtime occasions for these jobs would be selected from their own pool.
If the area Foreperson is unable to obtain a volunteer from the cover crew list, the Foreperson will call those employees from that crew on lieu days in order of seniority.
When an employee volunteers and reports to work because of an absence of another employee they may be permitted to work even though the incoming Foreperson might find that the workload is light. In such case, the volunteer could be permitted to leave at their request.

(iv) An employee at work whose relief fails to report will be expected to work up to four (4) hours overtime until a relief employee reports. The employee may leave at whichever time occurs first and if they have no transportation, the Company will provide it.
(c)	If no volunteer is available, the Relief Crew and the remaining non-working crews will then be canvassed in that order.
(d)	If such requests as outlined in paragraph (a) cannot be filled by the procedures in (b), the area Shift Foreperson will then require employee(s) on the basis of reverse seniority from the area cover crew to report to work. The Company may request a particular classification if the situation is such that no trained personnel are available to fill the absence.
(e)	The appropriate number of meal tickets will be provided to those employees who are unable because of the nature of the overtime to make adequate preparations.
(f)	Where excessive difficulties are experienced with the Emergency Absence Coverage System and the parties are unable to resolve these difficulties former Schedule "G" shall be temporarily reinstated while the parties examine alternatives.

Dear Mr. Littlefield:
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE: FLEX CREW ARRANGEMEN
it is the intent of the Company to maintain the manning in each area at that level required to support normal, efficient production requirements. It is recognized, however, that on occasion employees may be unable to report for work because of illness. It is also recognized that employees may from time to time need to be absent from work for prearranged bona-fide reasons and that area vacation requirements may from time to time result in manning levels below that required for normal operations. For these reasons, the Flex Crew arrangement, utilizing scheduled shift workers, was organized. The following reiterates the Company's intent with regard to Flex Crew organization, assignments and priorities.
a)	The Flex (Core) Crew's initial responsibility is to cover for unscheduled absences.
b)	The Flex (Core) Crew is a specially-posted job with qualifications requiring those posting to be able to do all of the jobs normally covered. The Flex Crew will normally fill in at the bottom of a line of progression.
c)	The Regular Flex (Pool) Crew may be enlarged or decreased from time to time to handle vacation relief requirements and to accommodate short-term area manning requirements.
Notwithstanding the above, it is recognized that under 'certain non-routine conditions (such as major disruption in an area) Flex Crew assignments and priorities may be temporarily altered.
Sincerely,

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
In order to clarify the Company's position with regard to Clause 10.02 and the five-day lay-off provision contained therein, the Company shall limit five-day outages due to market conditions to once (1) per area per calendar year, and such outages for market conditions will not be used in conjunction with a summer maintenance shutdown. The five-day lay-off provisions may continue to be invoked at the time there are mechanical breakdowns, or conditions due to external forces* beyond the control of the Company. In each instance where feasible, the Company will make every effort to effectively utilize those employees who may be affected by such a shutdown.
This proposal is contingent upon Union acceptance and agreement to amend Schedule "E", item (d) to read:	"If a shutdown is scheduled each employee
affected will schedule enough of his/her vacation up to three (3) weeks to cover the duration of the shutdown. The Company will endeavour to schedule a shutdown cf not more than three (3) weeks duration in any one department."
Other than the condition above external forces preclude market conditions.
