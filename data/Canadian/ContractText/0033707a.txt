STEP 2 Within three (3) scheduled shifts of response for Step I a meeting will be held between the Departmental Steward, or in his absence his designate, and the Day Supervisor of the Department concerned or his designate. If the decision of the Day Supervisor or his designate is unsatisfactory the grievance may be referred to Step 3.

If the grievance is not settled to the satisfaction of the Union, it may refer the matter to Arbitration.
7
Such action must be within thirty (30) days of the completion of Step 4. Any time limits in this step may be extended by mutual agreement of both the Company and the Union representatives. If the Union Grievance Committee agrees that management officials of the Company have not acted within the terms of this agreement and such actions have had a direct effect on the members of the Bargaining Unit they may file a grievance in Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.

The following provisions will clarify the requirement to progress as it applies to each of the following categories of employee:
"New Employee" -- A person hired as a new employee directly into the line of progression; "Assignee" -- An employee assigned from another position to a line of progression as a result of a posting; and
"Existing Utility" -- An employee classified as of the date of ratification of this collective agreement as a Relief Operator Utility.
"Existing Processing Operator" -- An employee classified as of the date of ratification of this collective agreement as a Process Operator
"Existing Packaging Operator" -- An employee classified as of the date of ratification of this collective agreement as a Packaging Operator.
New Employees
Should it be necessary to hire people directly into the line of progression, such New Employees will acknowledge in writing at time of hire that progressing to the Technician level and successful acquisition of all skill areas in the line of progression is a condition of employment.
16
Should a New Employee be unable to progress after reasonable remedial training efforts, he will be removed from all jobs in the line of progression. At the Company's sole discretion, this may result in termination of employment. The Company may, at its discretion, assign such New Employee to a vacant position to which it would normally hire a new employee. Removal from a line of progression for inability to progress will not trigger bumping under Article 13.01, as the New Employee's job in the line of progression still exists.
Refusal by a New Employee to train or progress as required by the line of progression will result in termination of employment.
Assignees
An employee assigned from another position to a line of progression as a result of a posting will acknowledge in writing at time of hire that progressing to the Technician level and successful acquisition of all skill areas in the line of progression is a condition of remaining in the line of progression.
Should an Assignee be unable to progress after reasonable remedial training efforts, he will be returned to the previous job without loss of seniority in that previous job. Removal from a line of progression for inability to progress will not trigger bumping under Article 13.01, as the Assignee's job in the line of progression still exists.
Refusal by an Assignee to train or progress as required by the line of progression will result in removal from the line of progression. Removal from a line of progression for inability to progress will not trigger bumping under Article 13.01, as the New Employee's job in the line of progression still exists. The Company may, at its discretion, assign such Assignee to a vacant position to which it would normally hire a new employee, but the Assignee is not guaranteed employment and may be terminated as a result of his refusal to progress.
Existing Utility, Existing Processing Operator, Existing Packaging Operator
An Existing Utility employee will be recognized and paid as Utility under the lines of progression.
Existing Processing Operators and Existing Packaging Operators are expected to confirm their skills to the minimum standard [e.g. one skill] of their current position by 1 January 2004.
An Existing Processing Operator or Existing Packaging Operator will be expected to progress to the Technician level and to acquire all skill areas in the line of progression as a condition of remaining in the line of progression.
17
Should an Existing Processing Operator or Existing Packaging Operator be unable to progress after reasonable remedial training efforts, he will be entitled to remain as a Processing or Packaging Operator subject to normal standards of satisfactory and safe performance, but will not be considered for future training opportunities except as required by safety or change to processes.
Should an Existing Processing Operator or Existing Packaging Operator who became a processing operator or packaging operator before 1 January 1999 refuse to train or progress as required by the line of progression, he will be entitled to remain as a Processing or Packaging Operator subject to normal standards of satisfactory and safe performance, but will not be considered for future training opportunities except as required by safety or change to processes.
Should an Existing Processing Operator or Existing Packaging Operator who became a processing operator or packaging operator on or after 1 January 1999 refuse to train or progress as required by the line of progression, he will be removed from all jobs in the line of progression. Removal from a line of progression for inability to progress will not trigger bumping under Article 13.01, as the New Employee's job in the line of progression still exists. There can be no guarantee of employment in such a case, although the Company may at its discretion consider the person for employment in another position, subject to the posting provisions of the collective agreement.
Posting to line of progression positions
When a vacancy arises in a line of progression, the position of Processing or Packaging Technician will be posted. It is understood that a New Employee or Assignee appointed to such position will be initially assigned to learn the skills associated with Utility, but that the selection criteria for the appointment will include an assessment of the candidate's ability to progress to a fully-qualified and competent Processing / Packaging Technician.
Training within lines of progression
Employees in a line of progression will be trained within that line of progression as follows:
The Company will develop a training plan for the training year in each line of progression based upon the skills areas in which training is needed by crew and plant, the inventory of skills already held by employees in the line of progression, and the number of people who can be trained at a given time.
The Company will set the sequence of training: i.e. when training will be provided for each skill area. For example, the Company may decide that in a given year on Crew A in Plant One, it will train two people on flume / peeler, one on the fryer [French fries], and two on the fryer [formed products], and will schedule when each training opportunity is expected to begin.
The Company will then assign the employee senior in departmental seniority on each crew in a line of progression to a training opportunity which he requires on that crew's shift. Where there is more than one training opportunity on the crew's shift available to such employee, the
18
Company's first priority will be to assign the employee to the training opportunity that will result in advancement to the next higher classification in the line of progression subject to the availability of the required training opportunity. Once the employee senior in departmental seniority on the crew in the line of progression has been assigned to a training opportunity, the next senior employee will be assigned, and so forth. All employees on the crew in the line of progression who require training will be assigned one training opportunity before the most senior such employee will be assigned a second training opportunity.
Training for Utility
The following will describe the training required by persons appointed to Utility in a line of progression.
Training regarding the use of chemicals will be provided in a classroom environment with follow-up practical familiarization.
There will be a review and assessment of food safety principles and Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP].
Utility employees will be shown the proper use of the Material Safety Data Sheet [MSDS] information and trained in the proper use and maintenance of personal protective equipment [PPE].
To get the rate of Utility , the person must pass a chemical knowledge test pass a quiz on GMP / food safety demonstrate knowledge of MSDS and PPE use satisfactorily complete one operational cleanup.
Successful completion of the requirements will require the consensus of the supervisor, the Area Training Coordinator, and the Plant Services Manager.

scheduled hours due to the changeover.
15.07B	Employees may make friendly agreements to exchange shifts one with the other
subject to the approval from supervisors in charge of the shifts. The request must be presented in writing. In no instance will an employee be permitted to work more than (16) sixteen consecutive hours under this agreement nor will such arrangement result in the payment of overtime. Those employees trading shifts shall not be entitled to overtime on either of these days. Exchanged shifts become scheduled shifts upon supervisor approval of such change.
15.08	An hours of work schedule, be it departmental or individual, shall be maintained and posted on a bulletin board.

15.12	The Pay week shall be deemed to start with the commencement of the first shift on Sunday and shall end with the conclusion of the Saturday night shift.
15.13	Except as provided overtime will be distributed among willing employees who have expressed in writing in accordance with the established procedure, within the department who normally perform the work on the basis of Departmental seniority.
15.14	Operational clean up is clean up that is planned in advance for the expressed purpose of cleaning and will involve shutting down one or more lines for a minimum one shift duration.
Incidental clean up is clean up that occurs as the result of an unplanned interruption of production, where employees are utilized to perform clean up during the time required to get the line back into production.
Those qualified employees assigned to do operational clean up shall be paid a rate of $1.25 per hour above their regular classified rate. This additional pay shall not be included for the purpose of arriving at an overtime rate when brought in outside of a regular scheduled shift or on a holiday. Employees will receive the above $1.25 per hour or $145.56 per clean up, whichever is greater to the employee.
Operational clean up occurs when one or more lines are shut down for the express purpose of scheduled post-production cleaning of all the equipment on that line. Operational clean up includes post-production clean up of production operations from the peeler up to and including the freeze tunnels, and in the grader room when scheduled for wet clean up. Incidental clean up or housekeeping is not operational clean up, nor is an unplanned opportunity for incidental clean up associated with a defrost, cutter change, refresh, power outage, or similar circumstance. Operational clean ups are normally scheduled for two consecutive 12 hour operational cleanup shifts. In exceptional circumstances, such as when a power failure or storm interrupts the clean up, the two shifts may not be consecutive.
It is understood that when the dumper room would normally undergo post-production clean up, but due to the need for repack, it is not scheduled to be cleaned until after the normal scheduled operational clean up shifts, the later shift during which the dumper room is scheduled to be cleaned up will be considered an operational clean up shift for qualified employees assigned to clean up that area. All other cleaning of this area, such as cleaning due to product change, is not operational clean up.
29
Operational clean up rates are paid only for operational clean up shifts. To be eligible for operational clean up rates on an operational clean up shift, an employee must be qualified to perform clean up [in accordance with current established standards], must be assigned by supervision to perform the operational clean up work on that shift, and must actually perform the operational clean up on that shift. All employees scheduled for that shift shall be utilized and not be sent home. This would include all shifts while doing clean up.
Because the intent of the operational clean up rates is to provide an incentive for rapid resumption of production, or rapid completion of scheduled post-production clean up prior to maintenance or other work during a major shutdown, such rates are paid for the initial scheduled post-production clean up period only. If the company assigns additional cleaning tasks later in a major shutdown, such tasks are considered incidental clean up and not operational clean up.
15.15	An employee may deposit the premium portion of overtime into an overtime bank. No more than 126 hours pay may be deposited in any twelve (12) month period commencing 1 December of any year. The banked money will be paid out on two weeks' notice. All unclaimed banked money will be paid out in the first pay period following 30 November of each year. There will be a form which the employee must sign to authorize the banking of any overtime. It is the employee's responsibility to request and authorize the banking before or on the day on which the overtime is earned.
15.16	Where due to inclement weather, an employee in the Boiler and Refrigeration Department must remain on duty for more than 24 hours consecutively; all hours worked beyond 24 consecutive hours will be at double time unless the employee has been able to leave the plant for a minimum of 8 hours.
15.17	Pursuant to Article 15.02 the Union and the Company recognize the need for essential services in the Boiler and Refrigeration Department to ensure the continuous operation of this equipment. In the event the operator scheduled to report for shift is not able to do so the Company shall require the junior employee, not scheduled to work that next scheduled shift after the shift of absence, to report for work.
ARTICLE XVI Leave of Absence
16.01	The Company shall grant leave of absence with pay for the purpose of arranging and attending funerals in the case of bereavement as follows: three days of absence with pay in the case of the death of a father, mother, brother, sister, wife, husband, children, step children, mother in law/father in law (includes common law spouse as defined by the laws of the province of P.E.I.), grandparents, step-parents and grandchildren of an employee.
