Such grievance may be filed directly at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.

An attempt will be made between the shop steward and the employee, with the department supervisor to settle the matter verbally.
6.3	Second Step:
If this attempt is unsuccessful, a grievance shall be submitted in writing to the department supervisor within ten (10) working days of the day the matter of the grievance occurred.

- 4 -
6.4	Third Step:
Failing an answer or satisfactory settlement at step two, the Union shall within five (5) working days, submit the grievance to the manager or his representative who shall then meet with the grievance committee and render a decision within five (5) working days. The grievance committee may have the assistance of the National Representative of the Union at this stage.
6.5	Fourth Step:
Failing an answer or satisfactory settlement, the grievance may within ten (10) days then be referred to an arbitrator in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement.
6.6	Any grievance not submitted within the time limits provided for in steps one, two or three shall automatically expire; however, the time limits may be extended by mutual agreeme nt of both parties.

If the need is primarily in a single work area (department) a regular job will be created. If the need is in two or more areas a “spare” position will be created. A Spare employee differs from a regular employee in that her primary function is to replace absent employees and as such will be required to undergo shift changes on short notice. Article
14.6	does not apply to spares. In cases of layoff the spare jobs must be eliminated before any other jobs and cannot exist if there are employees on layoff.
6.7.2	The Committee may, if there is agreement, determine that the pattern of employment of casuals indicates that the over all number of unclassifieds (currently seven) will be increased.
6.7.3	The Committee will also on an ongoing basis review all the Collective Agreement provisions regarding assignment of company work and make suggestions to the parties for improvement.
ARTICLE 7 - ARBITRATION
7.1.	No matter may be submitted to an Arbitrator unless settlement thereof has been attempted
through the Grievance Procedure set forth in Article 6.
7.2	The Employer and Union shall agree on an Arbitrator within four (4) days following the notice of Arbitration given by one or the other party.
7.3	Should either party refuse to agree on an Arbitrator, such appointment may be made by final and binding decision of the Nova Scotia Minister of Labour.
7.4	The decision of the Arbitrator shall be given within fourteen (14) days following the hearing and shall be final and binding on both parties. It is understood, however, that the Arbitrator shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with the stipulations of this Agreement, nor to delete, alter, or modify any part thereof, provided however, the Arbitrator may alter any discipline imposed by the Company, including altering a discharge to a suspension if the Arbitrator deems it just.

Employees wishing to apply for a job vacancy must apply in writing to Human Resources. An applicant may request a signed receipt for his/her job bid.
(a)	If the posted job is indriving, the trades, or the quality control lab (not the processing lab), the Company will include the required qualifications on the posting, and an applicant will not be considered qualified unless he/she possesses the specified qualifications. (For driver qualifications, see Appendix “J”. For trades qualifications, see Appendices “D”, “E” and “K”. Quality control qualification is a two -year food technology or lab technology diploma or equivalent training or experience.)
(b)	For all other jobs, theskills and training requirements may be set out on the posting. An applicant will be considered qualified unless the Company reasonably determines that he/she will not be able to demonstrate the ability to successfully perform the job within the twenty -five (25) working day period referred to in Article 9.3 below.
- 8 -
9.2.4	Observation Period
(a)	If the successful candidate has previously performed or otherwise become familiar with the job he will be awarded the job
(b)	If the successful candidate has not previously performed or otherwise become familiar with the job applied for, he will be allowed two (2) full shifts to observe the job being performed and determine his desire for the job.

(d)	If the most successful candidate either does not want or is not confirmed in the job, the next successful applicant will be granted the same opportunity to observe the job being performed.
All job openings will be awarded within five (5) working days of the completion of the observation period(s) referred to above, and the successful bidder will be placed on the awarded job within a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks from the date of the award.
An employee to whom a job has been awarded will have a period of within twenty -five (25) working days from the date of being placed on the job to receive training and to successfully perform the job. In most cases, the Company will confirm an employee in the job at or prior to the end of the twenty-five (25) working day period. This twenty-five (25) working day period may be extended by the Company in the case of jobs that require more than twenty -five (25) working days to learn. If, during the twenty -five (25) working day period (or such extended period as may have been determined by the Company) the employee is unable to successfully perform the job, he/she will be returned to his/her former job.
9.3.1 During any such period of training, the employee will be paid 90% of the full rate for the awarded job.
9.4	Each original job vacancy will result in a maximum of two postings (one to fill the original vacancy and the second to fill the vacancy created by the filling of the original vacancy) unless for either (or both) of these two postings there is a combination of observation and training periods not exceeding five (5) days, in which case there will be a third posting, to fill the vacancy created by the posting of the second vacancy. The second and, if applicable, the third postings resulting from the posting of the original opening shall be marked as such. The vacant position which is available following the completion of the posting/bidding process will be awarded to the most senior employee from that department who is interested in taking on the position. In the event there is no such senior employee , the remaining applicants for the previous two (or three, as the case may be) postings will be canvassed in order of seniority for interest in filling the vacancy. Finally, if the vacancy remains unfilled, the unc lassified employee who is senior on the seniority list for the “side” where the vacancy exists will be assigned the job. In all of the foregoing circumstances (the senior employee, the remaining applicants and the senior unclassified employee), the provis ions of Articles 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.2.5, 9.3 and 9.3.1 will apply so that the employee in question will be treated as though he/she had applied for the position in the first place (except that 9.2.4 and 9.3.1 will not apply to the senior unclassified employee, who will hold his/her unclassified rate during any training period).

An employee who is new in a job as a result of a bid shall not bid on any posting for a period equal to 6 (six) times the amount of training required before the individual was deemed to be qualified up to a maximum of 24 months (these times may be reduced by management).
For the purpose of this article the training period will be expressed in weeks (part weeks will be rounded) and is deemed to be the time in which two people are assigned to the job.
Employees bidding into a Floater or Spare driver position shall be required to stay in the position for a period of 6 months.
A job shall not be considered vacant if an employee is absent through sickness or injury or authorized leave. If it is known that an employee will be absent for more than 25 days but less than 26 weeks, the staff within the department will be canvassed, with the most senior employee applying being assigned to the work provided retraining is not necessary for that person or his/her replacement. Upon completion of the temporary assignment, the employee shall be returned to his/her former job.
If it is determined an employee will be absent for more than 26 weeks the Company may elect to post the position. The posting will indicate that the vacancy is as the result of an employee’s absence. Candidates applying for the position will be aware that should the employee return to work he/she may be bumped from the position. The employee who has been bumped may exercise his/her seniority rights as per Article 9.10 of the Collective Agreement.
If not previously posted the position will be posted after the employee has been absent for two years.
Where a senior applicant does not receive the position applied for, he/she shall be able to request of the appropriate manager the reason why his/her application was refused.
Absent employees may contact the Human Resource Department for information on current job openings.
If the Company does not intend to fill a vacancy, it will notify the Union accordingly within two (2) weeks of the position being vacated.
Layoff and Bumping:
For the purposes of Article 9.10, a job will be defined as a specific work assignment in a departme nt, and will include the classification and shift (hours and days).
For the purpose of this article a shift change will be defined as being longer than a week in duration and is expected at the time of the change to last more than 4 weeks.
An employee will be deemed “displaced” from their job as a result of any of the following circumstances:
(a) The employee receives a notice from the Company that his position will be
eliminated. A reduction in work of one week or less is not job elimination but will be considered a transfer as per Article 14.18.
- 10 -
(b)	If the employee’s job has a shift change or a series of shift changes over time that results in a shift that is more than 3 hours different from the posted job he was awarded and such change is not ac ceptable to the employee. If an employee accepts a shift change or over time, a series of shift changes that causes his new shift to be more than 3 hours from the posted job, this new shift will be deemed to be his posted job.
(c)	If the number of days an employee works in a week changes and such change is not acceptable to the employee. If an employee accepts the change in the number of days worked in a week, this new shift will be deemed to be his posted job
It is the employee’s responsibility to notify management that a shift change or a series of shift changes exceeds the 3 hours or a change in the number of days worked is not suitable at the time of the change or he is considered to have accepted the new hours, or the new number of days they will work in a week.

9.11.2
(c)	Where there are jobs in a classification in more than one geographic location (i.e., Bedford plant, Middleton spreads plant, distribution centres) within the bargaining unit, the job(s) in that classification will be considered a separate classification in each geographic location so that an employee will not be required to move from one city or town to another in order to avail himself/herself of his/her right to bump a junior employee.
A weekend shift job will be defined as a separate classification distinct from the classification that includes the same weekday shift jobs.
(d)	An employee will be paid the rate for that job he/she bumps into as of the date of the bump, except that if an employee’s weekly earnings in his/her old job are lower than the weekly earnings of the position he/she is bumping into, the employee will continue to receive the weekly earnings of his/her old job for the period of time referred to in Article 9.10.6 (b) above.
(e)	If an employee proves unable to do the job he/she has bumped into within a reasonable period of time (at least the period of time that would be required by an average employee), he/she will then bump into the job held by the most junior employee in his/her geographic location he/she is qualified to do. If there is no job he/she is qualified to do held by an employee junior to the one he/she first bumped into, he/she will be laid off.
The foregoing provisions Article 9.10.5 will also apply to any employee displaced by a bump.
Seven (7) calendar days notice will be given to an employee who will be laid off from active employment.

In this case the employee may take a layoff from active employment and work as per Article 9.11.2 or request to be considered for a severance allowance as per Article 26, they will not be granted bumping options. In either case the request will be subject to management approval.
Notwithstanding Article 8.1.1 to 8.1.4, there will, for the purposes of this Article, be one seniority list for the whole bargaining unit with the exception of part-time merchandisers, who will have a separate seniority list.
In the case of a full-time employee who moves into a part -time merchandiser position he/she shall be entitled to only the provisions of the Collective Agreement which pertain to part -time merchandisers while working in the part-time merchandiser position.
Rights of Laid Off Employees
An employee who is laid off shall retain his/her seniority for a period of twelve (12) months from the last day on which he/she worked.
Where the Employer has forty (40) or more hours of work available within a Company work week (Monday to Sunday inclusive), it will recall the employee on layoff with the most seniority who is able to do the work in question. An employee on layoff must accept any recall offered to him/her unless he/she has a reasonable excuse (which includes approved training). If personal circumstances necessitate (for example, arranging for child care), an employee can delay being recalled for up to twenty -four (24) hours after the time he/she is to report for work. However, the employee must advise the Employer at the time of the recall of his/her need to delay reporting before the delay in reporting will be excused.
- 12 -
9.11.3	Where the Employer has less than forty (40) hours of work available within a Company work week (Monday to Sunday inclusive), it will get that work done by first offering it to the senior person with recall rights able to do the work in question who has indicated his/her desire and ability to respond to a short-notice shift, in accordance with the following procedure:
(a)	A laid-off employee who wishes to be recalled for work for less than forty hours at a time must telephone the Employer by 10 a.m. each Friday morning to put his/her name on the list for the following week. For each week, this list of names of laid -off employees will constitute the “Short Notice Work List”.
(b)	During each week, work will be offered to the laid-off employees on the Short Notice Work List for the week in order of seniority provided the employee is able to do the work in question. The laid-off employees on the Short Notice Work List must remain available by their telephones between 8:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. each day during the week to receive offers of work.
(c)	A laid-off employee on the Short Notice Work List must call the Employer and take him/herself off the Short Notice Work List if his/her circumstances change during the week and he/she is no longer able to respond to an offer of work during that week.
(d)	If, on any given day, no laid -off employee on the Short Notice Work List accepts an offer of work, the Employer will require these laid-off employees to work in reverse order of seniority.
(e)	A laid -off employee on the Short Notice Work List who turns down an offer of work more than three (3) times in a thirty (30) day period will not be permitted to put his/her name on the Short Notice Work List for a further thirty (30) day period.
9.11.4	An employee on layoff will not be required to respond to a recall to work until after the expiry of seven (7) calendar days from the date of layoff.
9.11.5	If, within six (6) months (9 months for ice cream drivers), the former job of an employee who was displaced by the elimination of work or the bump of another employee reappears (as distinct from a vacancy caused by an employee leaving the department), he/she is entitled to return to that former job before it is filled by any other means. If more than one employee was displaced from the classification in which the work reappears, entitlement to return will be on the basis of seniority. Any other employee who had been displaced by a bumping employee now returning to his/her former job will also have the right to return to his/her former job.
9.11.6	Any employee bumping into a position shall not be allowed to bid on any postings for a period equal to six (6) times the amount of the training period required before the individual was deemed to be qualified up to a maximum of 24 months (unless agreed to by management).
(a)	For the purpose of this article the training period will be expressed in weeks and is deemed to be the time in which two people are assigned to the job.
(b)	Employees bumping into a Floater or Spare driver position shall be required to stay in the position for a period of 6 months.
- 13 -
9.12. When a vacancy that exceeds or is expected to exceed nine (9) months in duration (or twenty-four (24) months in the case of a requirement to fill in for an absent employee) arises in a department, it must be posted and made available to be filled in accordance with the regular job posting procedures before an employee on layoff can be permanently recalled into it.
9.13	A laid off employee will be entitled to continued group insurance benefits (with the exception of short-term and long-term disability insurance benefits) if he/she continues to pay his/her share of the premiums during the twelve (12) month period referred to Article 9.11.1. During this twelve (12) month period, a laid off employee can also continue to participate in the Company pension plan, and have the time on layoff credited as pensionable service, by continuing to pay his/her pension contribution during the period of layoff. When a laid off employee is recalled, his/her vacation, sick days and Christmas bonus will be reduced by one fifty-second (1/52) for every week he/she is on layoff for the entire week.
9.14	Casuals or students will not be utilized if they prevent the recall of a laid-off employee.
9.15	Hybrid Positions
9.15.1	If the Company eliminates a position because of a reduction of hours of a classified position (more than one full shift) and provides the incumbent notice as per Article 9.10.8, the company will, if possible, create a full time position (40 hours) by combining work between two (2) departments. This position will be referred to as a Hybrid position. This hybrid position will first be offered to the incumbent who has been displaced. If the incumbent does not wish to accept the position, it will be posted and the incumbent will be displaced as per Article 9.10. It is agreed that hybrid positions will be inside jobs only and the two departments where the employee will be working will be on the same side (i.e. production or shipping) but not both
9.15.2	When the hybrid position is created, a specific department will be designated and identified on the job posting as the primary department. Employees will not be required to work in different departments on the same day; each daily shift will be scheduled within a single department. If the hybrid position’s work falls into two different wage classifications, the hybrid position will, for all purposes, pay the wage of the higher classification.
9.15.3	When there is a regular and reoccurring increase in the s cheduled number of hours to be worked in the primary department, that work will be assigned to the hybrid employee and his scheduled work in the secondary department will be assigned as extra work as per Article 14.6.1.
9.15.4	When there is a reduction in the number of people within the primary or secondary department, the hybrid position will be the first position to be eliminated.
9.15.5	Where operationally possible, the Company will not use hybrid positions but will create jobs within a single department. An employee will not be considered transferred as per Article 14.18 if he/she has been awarded a hybrid position and is regularly scheduled to work between two departments.

(a)	as provided for in Article 24.2, by transferring available regular employees who are at work,
(b)	in accordance with Article 9.12, by recalling any employees who are on lay off,
(c)	if there is still work the Company requires performed, it may, subject to the conditions set forth below, employ an unclassified employee,
(d)	if there is still work that the Company requires performed, it must offer that work to regular employees on an overtime basis in accordance with this Article 14.
- 21 -
14.6.3	Only if it is not possible to get the work performed using one of the above means may the Company employ ca suals. Before employing casuals the Company must first offer the work as casual employment to available qualified unclassified employees.
14.6.4	When assigning extra work the Company may skip the discretionary steps (a) and (c) and, for less than a full shift, step (b) in Article 14.6.2. In cases of replacing a regular employee who is off work for at least a full shift because of sickness, vacation or other absence the Company may skip 14.6.2 Step (d).
14.6.5	If a casual or unclassified works because no regular employee is available for the extra work, she will be allowed to work to a maximum of four hours. If work is still required after the four hours and regular employees become available because their shifts have ended during the four hours of the casual or unclassifieds assignment, it will be offered to these regular employees as overtime.
14.6.6	Replacing employees:
If an employee who has started a shift leaves prior to its scheduled finish and an unclassified or casual is properly assigned to complete the work of the absent employee, the unclassified or casual is allowed to work to a maximum of the total hours of the scheduled shift less any hours worked by the employee prior to leaving. The commencement of the unclassified’s assignment need not necessarily be contiguous to the departure of the regular employee. In all cases of absence the unclassified can only do the work of the regular employee she is replacing or the work of the regular employee who is replacing the absent employee (one bump maximum).
14.6.7	Terms and Conditions for Unclassified Workers:
(a)	Unclassified employees shall only be utilized:
(i)	to replace regular employees who are off work for a full day because of sickness, vacation or other absence,
(ii)	when workers are required to replace broken machinery, but not to increase production, or when there is a requirement for regular and recurring extra work (including co -pack) that is scheduled at least seven days in advance of the assignment.
Due to the requirements of the unclassified position, he/she must be trained to perform the duties of as many positions as possible, and can therefore be scheduled for training on an as -needed basis. Their assignment to training is not considered “extra work” for the purposes of this Article.
(b)	Unclassified workers are members of the bargaining unit and covered by the collective agreement.
(c)	Apart from this Article 14.6.7, the provisions of Article 14 do not apply to unclassified workers.
(d)	Unclassified employees will be paid overtime after 40 regular hours in a week.
(e)	Their rate of pay is the plant labour rate and they have all the benefits of regular employees. Benefits will be prorated based on the hours they work (twenty week average). Uniforms will be issued as required.
(f)	Their seniority is calculated on the basis that 40 hours of work equals one week’s seniority.
(g)	There shall be no more than seven unclassified employees without the written agreement of the Grievance Committee.
- 22 -
(h)	Work will be assigned to unclassifieds in theorder of their seniority. There shall be three distinct seniority lists (“sides”), one for each of production, distribution, and drivers. If they are qualified, unclassifieds may on a per day basis work on any side, although each unclassified will have a “home” location of one of the three lists. They will have separate seniority for each side and only the work performed on a side will earn credit on that side’s seniority list. If hired to a regular position the employee will be credited with the total seniority of all three lists.
(i)	When a vacancy exists and no regular employee or unclassified employee successfully bids for the job, the senior qualified unclassified in whose “home” location the vacancy exists will be forced to take the position.
(j)	An unclassified worker cannot be used if a regular employee who is able to perform the work is on layoff or scheduled to work less than 40 hours in that week.
14.6.8	All of the foregoing is subject to the understanding that when an unclassified employee, a casual or a student comes in to work, it is to meet a particular need or for a specific purpose, in accordance with this Agreement. Therefore, once at work, he/she can only perform the job he/she was brought in to do.
14.7	All classified persons will be given seven (7) calendar days notice of a change of days off, unless mutually agreed between the employee and the Employer, the day the person is notified shall be considered the first of the seven days.
14.7.1	If a classified person is required to change their days off without the seven (7) calendar days notice, then he or she will be paid the premium rate of time and one half (1 1/2) or the applicable rate for off days worked without the appropriate notice, unless mutually agreed upon between the employee and Employer. The day the person is notified will be considered the first of the seven notice days.
14.7.2	The scheduled days off will not be changed in any week containing a Statutory Holiday.
14.7.3	All classified persons will be given seven (7) calendardays notice of a shift change of more than three (3) hours. The day the person is notified will be considered the first of the seven notice days.
14.7.4	If a classified person is required to change their shift without the required seven (7) days notice, then he or she will be paid the premium rate of time and one half (1 1/2) for all hours worked outside their regular shift for the days for which notice was not given, unless mutually agreed upon between the employee and the Employer.
14.7.5	All classified persons will be given twelve (12) hours notice of a shift change of three (3) hours or less.
14.7.6. If a classified person is required to change their shift without the required twelve (12) hours notice, then he or she will be paid the premium rate of time and one half (1 1/2) for all hours worked outside their regular shift hours for the day for which notice was not given, unless mutually agreed upon between the employee and the Employer.
14.7.7	At the same time an employee is notified of a shift change as provided in this article, he will also be explicitly advised that it is a “shift change” and will be provided with both a new starting time and new finishing time. Failure by the Company to provide this information will result in full payment for the regular scheduled shift and overtime pay for any hours worked or credited outside the regular scheduled shift.
14.8	Employees will not work more than 13 continuous hours. If the employee and her supervisor
agree an employee may exceed the 13 hour maximum, however in no circumstance will an Employee work more than 16 hours (including callback) in any 24 hour period.
- 23 -
14.9
When an employee works and/or is credited with more hours than his Regular Workday, as defined in Article 14.1.1, it will be one of the three types of overtime;
a)	An EARLY START occurs when an employee starts work earlier than his regular workday. An EARLY START must extend into the start of his regular workday. It will be less than 4 hours in duration.	
b)	An EXTENSION OF SHIFT occurs when an employee works past the end of his regular work day without any period of unpaid time, except for a meal as	
	provided	in Article 24.8.
c)	A CALLBACK occurs when	
	1.	an employee has finished his regular workday and, after any period of unpaid time, returns to work.
	2.	an employee is called in four (4) hours or more before the start of his regular shift, or
	3.	The reason for the assignment is to cover an employee’s absence of four (4) or more hours.
14.9.1	The Company will post a sign -up sheet in each department for employees to indicate their willingness to work additional hours. A sheet will be dated and posted for every day of the week and will be available at least seven days in advance. Employees will be able to add their name to the sheet from the time it is posted up to 2pm of the last weekday (not Saturday, Sunday or Statutory Holiday) prior to the date on the sheet. The form of the signup sheet will be as agreed between the parties. Employees who consistently put th eir name on the sign-up sheet and without valid excuse refuse to work the additional hours when called will not be allowed to put their name on a sign-up sheet for a period of two weeks.
14.10	Overtime will be assigned as follows:
14.10.1	EARLY START
Step 1 If the work that is to be assigned is less than 4 hours in duration and will
continue without a break into the start of an employee’s regular workday it will be first offered to the employee who is expected to perform the work at the start of his regular workday. If there is more than one employee who would be performing the work at the start of their regular workday the EARLY START will be offered to those employees in order of seniority.
Step 2 If the employee(s) who is expected to perform the work at the start of his or her regular workday is not willing to work the overtime or there is no employee who would have been performing the work at the start of their regular workday, or the work assignment is 4 hours or more, the work will be assigned as a CALLBACK.
14.10.2	EXTENSION OF SHIFT
Step 1 If the work that is to be assigned is a continuation of work that is being performed at the end of an employee’s regular workday it will be first offered to the employee who is performing the work at the end of his regular workday. If more than one employee is performing the work that will continue at the end of the regular workday it will be offered to those employees in order of seniority.

14.10.3
14.10.4
14.10.5
14.10.6
14.10.7
Step 2 If the employee(s) who is performing the work is not willing to work the overtime or no employee is performing the work at the end of his regular workday, the Company, in order of seniority, will canvass the department for qualified volunteers who are on the premises.
Step 3 If the above steps do not result in t he work being assigned, the Company may, on a rotating basis starting with the least senior, force a qualified unclassified who is working in the Department to work if he is eligible. If that is not possible the Company may, on a rotating basis starting with the least senior, force a qualified classified employee who is working in the department to work if he is eligible.
Employees can only be forced to work either:
a)	a maximum of one hour on an extension of shift, no more than twice in any scheduled workweek, or
b)	once a week, a maximum of two hours on an extension of shift.
At the time an employee is forced, he will be advised whether it is a one or two hour force.
If there is still a requirement for work to be assigned after the above steps (14.10.1 and 14.10.2) the work will be assigned as a CALLBACK.
For EARLY START overtime, employees who are expected to perform the work, or for EXTENSION OF SHIFT overtime, employees who are performing the work, will not be reassigned to perform other work that results in their not being offered the overtime assignment unless it is for valid operational needs.
When an unclassified employee is replacing a classified employee, as per Article 14.6.7(a)(i), in cases of EARLY START or EXTENSION OF SHIFT, the Company can choose to assign the extra work to the unclassified who is replacing the classified employee or they can offer the work to a classified employee in accordance with this article. If the work is not offered to a classified employee and it is assigned to the unclassified who is replacing the classified employee for the shift that starts early or is extended, that unclassified, notwithstanding Article 14.6.7(d), will be paid 1 % their basic rate. This provision does not apply to CALLBACKS.
When a “crew” works an EXTENSION OF SHIFT and there are students or casuals who were members of that crew during the regular workday and there is a requirement for the work that the students or casuals performed to be continued into the EXTENSION OF SHIFT, such work will be offered, first to any available, senior, qualified employee in the department who is at work, then to any senior, available, qualified employee whose name is on the sign-up sheet who is in the plant. Only after these steps may the work be assigned to the students or casuals who were members of that crew during the regular workday.
CALLBACK
Step 1 The work that is to be assigned will be first offered in order of seniority to qualified, classified, department employees who have placed their names on the sign-upsheet. Step 2 If there is still a requirement for employees to work, the work will be offered in order of seniority to qualified, classified, employees from outside the department who have placed their names on the sign-up sheet.
Step 3 If there is still a requirement for employees to work, the work will be offered in order of seniority to qualified, unclassified, employees who have placed their names on the sign-up sheet.

Banking Overtime Pay
(It is agreed that the following provisions are a trial only. Either the Company or the Union may, with 30 days written notice, advise the other of its intention to exercise its right to void this article. If this article is voided, all banked pay will be paid out in the next pay period and employees will no longer be able to bank overtime pay or take time off in lieu.)
Subject to making her intentions known on her timecard, an employee may elect to defer overtime pay and/or pay for work on a day off and take time off with pay at a later time. Such deferred pay shall accumulate as a cash value and be known as lieu time. The Maximum cash value an employee is allowed to accumulate is $2000.00
Lieu time will be credited at the rate the overtime was earned (e.g. a two hour extended shift would equal three times the basic hourly rate in effect at the time).
At any time, an employee can request that Lieu Time be take n as time off with pay. It can be taken in part (one hour minimum) or in whole.
Employees will make any request for Lieu Time to their supervisor. Such requests will be subject to operational needs and staff availability and the granting of Lieu Time shall be at the Company’s discretion. An employee may also request to take Lieu Time in conjunction with their vacation. However, the scheduling of any Lieu Time will not interfere with the vacation choice of another employee.
The Company will respond to requests for Lieu Time in a timely manner.
The Company can request that an employee take Lieu Time in part or whole. However, the employee must explicitly agree to the request before she is scheduled off.
Scheduled Lieu Time will not be cancelled unless the employee is given notice during or prior to his last shift of work before the scheduled Lieu Time. His last shift of work includes any overtime worked on that day.
An employee can at any time, receive part or all of the cash value of her Lieu Time as pay, provided she notifies the Company at least one (1) month in advance of the pay period in which she wishes to receive it.
Lieu Time cannot carry over to the next calendar year. All accumulated Lieu Time, not scheduled, will be paid out on the final pay for the year. Employees cannot bank overtime pay from December 15 to December 31 in any year.
Inside employees may be required to be temporarily reassigned i.e. transferred from their own job to respond t o temporary increases or decreases in work within a department or to adjust to changing work priorities.
These transfers will be for one of two reasons:
1. A “push” will occur when an employee is temporarily transferred from his regular job bec ause there is no work currently available in his/her regular position. The employee may be temporarily moved to another position within his/her own department or outside his/her department. “Push” transfers will be on a daily basis for a period not to exceed one week; employees who are prepared to accept a “push” will be provided 40 hours of work for this week.
- 27 -
2. A “pull” will occur when the employee has work available in his/her own position but because of a change of work priorities or the need els ewhere for his particular skills, the employee may be temporarily moved to another position within his/her own department or outside his/her department.
A “push” and a “pull” cannot occur at the same time. The employee is either transferred because he has no work or because there is a need elsewhere.
14.18.2	Before an employee is transferred the supervisor will provide a clear explanation of the reason for the transfer, state whether it is a push or a pull and give the expected duration of the assignment
14.18.3	A qualified employee who has “free time” (push) will be transferred before an employee is “pulled” to a work assignment.
14.18.4	Employees will not be transferred between production and shipping.
14.18.5	If more than one employee is available and qualified to perform the work, the available push or pull work will be offered in order of seniority and in a pull situation, if a force is necessary, in reverse order of seniority.
14.18.6	In the case of a push, employees have the option to punch out and not be paid or use paid time in accordance with Article 13 rather than accepting another work assignment in another department. If an employee chooses to go home they will not be eligible for overtime until their regular shift has expired. If they re turn to work they will be paid straight time until the scheduled end of their regular shift.
14.18.7	In the case of a “pull” the employee will be entitled to a premium of one-quarter (1/4) his basic rate for all hours worked outside his regular department.
14.18.8	The Company will not use the provisions of this article if it allows it to avoid posting what would otherwise be a full time vacancy.
14.18.9	Employees who are transferred outside their department from their own job will, for overtime purposes, be considered as being in their regular department and will retain their overtime extension of shift rights on their regular job. They will not have additional overtime rights in the job to which they have been pulled. Overtime that would normally be an extension of shift will be assigned starting at Article 14.10.2 Step 2 with the assumption that there is no employee performing the work at the end of the regular workday.
14.19 Any classified employee who is temporarily transferred from his/her re gular job to another job with a higher rate shall be paid the higher rate for the day worked on the higher rated job, provided the time worked is four hours or more per shift on the higher rated job. However, an employee who is temporarily transferred from his/her regular job to another job with a lower rate shall continue to receive his/her regular rate for all the time worked on such other job.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - SHIFTS
This will confirm our understanding reached at negotiations regarding employees who work shifts which cross over two days, one of which is part of a weekend. It is agreed that employees who have requested and are permitted to work this type of shift due to their own convenience will be allowed to continue this practice. It is understood that these employees are not entitled to any premium pay to which they would have otherwise been entitled due to the nature of their shift.

By signing off they are not agreeing to waive any premium to which they are entitled due to working hours outside their normal shift (ie. If they are required to come in earlier or stay later than their normal shift or for a call in). Either the company or the employee with seven (7) days written notice copied to the union can terminate these agreements.
If any of these positions are vacated or changed they will not be posted as weekend work shifts.
If any other employee wishes to enter into an agreement to work hours that fall into this category they must make a request to their supervisor who will examine the request against operational requirements.
If the request is granted the employee will be required to sign an agreement as established above and the union will be provided with a copy.
Employees who are currently in shifts which cross over two days for their own convenience have signed letters in their employee files. On request from the union the company will provide a complete list of employees who have entered into this agreement

LETTER OF AGREEMENT - WEEKEND WORK
On March 29, 1996, Bruce Outhouse issued an Arbitration Decision concerning the assignment of weekend work. The decision clearly addressed the matters raised in the grievance but left a number of issues still unresolved. Rather than re turn to the Arbitrator at this time, the parties have agreed to the following;
A)	This Agreement applies to inside workers only.
B)	There are only four possible ways an employee can be assigned to work Saturday or Sunday as regular work days;
1)	Reschedule employees who currently work Monday to Friday to work Saturday or Sunday.
2)	Create, post and fill new positions that have Saturday, Sunday or both as regular workdays such that the total number of employees in the department increases. The company will notify the union when a new weekend shift job is added under this provision.
3)	Take existing Monday to Friday work andtransfer it to a new job that has Saturday, Sunday or both as regular work days, post and fill the position, then through layoff eliminate a Monday to Friday position. The total number of employees in the department will remain the same.
4)	Post and fill an existing, previously occupied, weekend position that has become vacant.
C)	The Company will not reschedule employees who currently work Monday to Friday to work Saturday or Sunday as a regular workday. (# 1 above)
D)	The Union will not object to the Company creating new positions that have Saturday, Sunday or both as regular work days provided that these new positions will not cause o r result in the lay-off of any Monday to Friday workers and that the total number of employees in the department will increase. (# 2 above)
- 64 -
E)	If the Company intends to take existing Monday to Friday work and transfer it to a new job that has Saturday, Sunday or both as regular work days (# 3 above), it will;
1)	In advance, notify the Union in writing of the nature of the job and why weekend work
is necessary
2)	Convene a meeting with the Union Grievance Committee to fully discuss the matter
and explore other possible solutions that minimize weekend assignments.
3)	Only if the Union Grievance Committee agrees that weekend work is acceptable for
the new job the Company will;
a)	In order of seniority, canvass the department for volunteers for the new job.
b)	If there are no volunteers for the new job, post the position as contemplated in Article 9.
c)	As the filling of the new job will result in increasing the number of employees in the department, the Company may reduce the number of employees in the department back to the level that existed prior to the new job being filled. Reduction will be through a normal layoff in accordance with Article 9 except that prior to awarding the posted position to the successful candidate, the Company will indicate to the junior department employee that is to be laid off the name, department and seniority of the successful candidate. If the junior department employee is senior to the successful employee and chooses to bump into the new job he will be given the job and the successful candidate who bid on the new position will stay in his old position. The junior department employee who bumps into the new job will not be able to bid on another position for six months.
F)	The Union will not object to nor is Union Agreement necessary for the Company to post and fill an existing, previously occupied, vacant weekend position (# 4 above). However the Union may request that the Company comply with steps E 1 and 2 above.
The Parties agree that e ither of them, for any reason, with written notice to the other can cancel and void this Letter of Agreement. If this Letter is cancelled and voided, neither weekend work assignments that occurred after January 1, 2000 nor this Letter of Agreement will be used as evidence in any grievance or arbitration proceeding concerning weekend work. Further, this Letter or any understanding of the operation of the Collective Agreement regarding weekend work expressed in this Letter is without prejudice to any position either party may take in the future regarding weekend work.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - PAYMENT FOR TRAINING AND MEETINGS
This will confirm our understanding with regard to how employees are to be paid for attending training or meetings that are required by management.
Training and meetings will be paid at the applicable rate required by the collective agreement. Payment will be made for time actually spent in the training session.
Management will attempt to schedule this training on employees’ regular shifts. An employee may be required to report to their job before or after the training in order to make a full day of work or if the supervisor decides this is not feasible they will be paid for a full day. Employees will be advised of their schedule prior to the day of training.
These provisions do not apply to meetings when employees attend on union business, off site training which is away from home (ie. maintenance training), training initiated by the employee for their own upgrading, company tra ining which is not required, but which the employee has expressed a desire to attend, community college or university training, and employee meetings which are optional.
It is up to supervisors to make clear when training or meetings are scheduled if it is voluntary and that it will be paid at straight time.
When employees are required to travel on Saturday and/or Sunday to attend training they will be paid a non-taxable lump sum payment for the inconvenience of traveling during the weekend.
