Vacation Pay for Enrolled Apprentices
This Letter of Understanding will be used to clarify how employees are paid vacation earnings when enrolled and actively participating in the Apprenticeship Program.
Article 18.07 of the current Collective Agreement states:
Vacation pay will be calculated based on total compensation, which includes base pay, overtime pay, statutory holiday pay, shift differential, vacation pay, special time off with pay, short-term disability, blasting premiums, temporary supervisor premiums, lead hand premiums andCMA premiums. Total compensation does not include LTD benefits, Company's ISAP contributions or WCB benefits.
To ensure employees participating in the Apprenticeship Program suffer no loss in regular wages and are treated as though they had attended regular work, their vacation earnings will be adjusted and calculated to include the payments received from the Government while in attendance in the Program. These payments will be added to their regular gross earnings when determining total compensation for vacation pay in the same calendar year that each employee attends school. Apprentices are responsible for ensuring that copies of their Government earnings are forwarded to Payroll for tabulating as soon as they are received by the apprentice. Earnings from Government not verified with pay stubs will not be considered.
Only employees who are enrolled in the Apprenticeship Program through the normal job posting procedure will be affected by this Letter of Understanding and only earnings received from the Government for attendance in the Apprenticeship Program will be used for the calculation of vacation earnings.
This Letter will remain in effect for the balance of the term of the current Collective Agreement.

RE: MOSAIC/LONG-TERM CONTF5ACTOR WORK IN THE INFLOW CONTROL AREA
The purpose of this Letter of Understanding is to outline the agreement between the Parties regarding how the work in the Inflow Control area will be distributed between Mosaic and long-term contractor personnel.
The Parties agree that:
Managing and controlling the Inflow areas are critical to the ongoing success of the mine. The Inflow areas can change quickly and without notice so quick response time by Mosaic employees and long-term contractor personnel is very important. To ensure employees can respond quickly, work tasks in the Inflow Control areas will be distributed in accordance with the scope of the work required.
Mosaic Employee Responsibility
1.	Beach pumping operation, maintenance, and installation including pump boxes to final destination.
2.	High pressure pumping operation and maintenance.
3.	Rehabilitationof main entries.
4.	Ground control of main entries.
5.	Maintenanceof Mosaic mobile equipment.
6.	Mechanical maintenance and installation of pumping, compressors and piping.
7.	Electrical maintenance including power distribution to 5KV sleds in inflow area. Installation of messenger cable.
8.	Muck generated by Mosaic will be hauled by Mosaic.
9.	Installation of inhibitor pumps and tanks.

If the scope of the work for Mosaic employees and/or long-term contractor employees changes, the Company and Union Executive will meet to determine the appropriate and fair course of action at the request of either party.

This Letter will remain in effect for the balance of the term of the current Collective Agreement and is renewable unless agreed otherwise by the Parties.
