15:05 - LOCK-OUT PROCEDURES
What is a Lock-out Requirement?
The lockout requirement is a requirement of all employees to isolate and secure the energy source to pieces of equipment that could move or be caused to move while you are working in hazardous areas around the equipment.
Lockout requirements apply to all personnel from clean up crews, to operators, to maintenance and contractors.
The main purpose for having lockout procedures in place is to protect you and others from injury caused by moving equipment._________________________________
The “lock-out” in lockout procedures occurs when you secure, with your lock, the switch or valve of the energy source for the specific piece of equipment you will be working on. Your lock prevents anyone from re- energizing the piece of equipment.
LOCK-OUT GUIDELINES
1.	This Lockout guideline is instituted to prevent accidental operation of equipment, which could cause bodily injury to anyone. Written Lockout Procedures will be reviewed with you in your “Job Safety Analysis” (JSA’s) for your particular
30
job.
2.	It is the duty of every person working on equipment to “Lock-Out” the equipment in a manner described in the Lockout Procedures.
3.	When any worker is required to work on or around any machine where starting of that machine could constitute a hazard, the machine shall be stopped at the control button and then “Locked-Out” at the main switch or valve controlling the flow of power, electrical, air, water, hydraulic, compressed gas, steam or gravity.
4.	After “Locking-Out” the worker must check the equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pressing the “Start” button. The worker at this point must again press the “Stop” button. All pressurized systems must be bled down to deenergize them where applicable. Install all safety pins and blocking that may be required to ensure your safety.
5.	Each worker must “Lock-Out” equipment personally. If there is more than one lock to be put on a power source and a second worker places their lock on the power source, the second worker must ask the first worker to step back while the second worker tests the start button and so on for each additional lock placed on the power source.
6.	All locks must bear the name or number of the user. Inspection of locks will be made periodically to ensure the name or numbers are legible.
7.	Scissor clamps and cable/chains are supplied to facilitate the use of more than one lock on a “Lock-Out’ position.
8.	If in doubt about the location of the switch or the method of pulling it, call your Supervisor. When pulling the switch use your left hand and stand to the right of the switch.
WHEN TASKS ARE COMPLETED:
1.	Make sure all tools and loose parts are cleared out, doors are closed, guards are replaced, safety pins and blocking are removed and all other workers are clear of the machine.
31
Only then can the locks be removed and the power turned on.
2.	Locks can only be removed by the person who applied the locks, no other person can remove your locks nor can you remove theirs. The only method for lock removal other than by the worker whom applied the lock is by following the lock removal guidelines (attached).
3.	The last worker to remove his/her lock from the switch has the responsibility to make sure no other worker has inadvertently entered the machine and could be injured if the machine was turned on.
4.	Remove all your locks from the switches or valves and throw them to the “ON” position taking the same precautions you did when throwing the switches “OFF’.
5.	If a machine is required to be test run after cleaning, repairing or adjusting, get the operator to start up or return to the start buttons and try the machine yourself.
6.	If the above procedure (#5) is not required, inform the Operator or the Supervisor that you have finished and the machine is safe and can be returned to production.
LOCK OUT DURING SHIFT CHANGE:
1.	Workers coming on shift shall place their own locks on all control devices before the individuals going off shift remove their locks, or the Supervisor may Lock-Out the control devices during shift changes to allow workers going off shift to remove their locks.
2.	Workers coming on shift must check equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pushing the start button then the stop button.
3.	Failure to comply with these rules is cause for disciplinary action by the Company. The disciplinary action for a LockOut Violation is an automatic suspension.
32
YOU ARE LOCKING OUT TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY
PROCEDURE FOR LOCK REMOVAL PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure a safe, acceptable manner by which personal locks may be removed when the owner of the locks is unavailable.
PROCEDURE:
1.	Supervisor to be called when owner of the locks cannot be located.
2.	Supervisor and Safety Committee member jointly check the lock for worker’s name or number.

33
5.	Fill out Lock Removal Form 11 and send to the administrative assistant.
6.	Supervisor must review "Lock-Out Guidelines” with worker before he/she commences their next shift.
7.	Administrative Assistant will ensure Manager and Safety Supervisor are aware of the situation.

This form is to be completed in full on each occurrence of lock removal.
LOCK-OUT PROCEDURES FOR MOBILE EQUIPMENT: To reduce the possibility of injury to you and/or to prevent property damage, a lockout tag (“Danger- Do Not Start”) will be used when repairing, servicing, inspecting or cleaning equipment.
a)	Operators, mechanics and welders who repair, service, inspect or clean, operate equipment shall use a lockout tag which they shall carry on them or be sure they have on the machine.
b)	Before a job is started, the equipment is to be tagged on the ignition switch, steering wheel, master switch or cab doors.
c)	All persons working on equipment attach a tag, and when the job is completed, the tag is to be removed by the person who put the tag on, unless off shift.
d)	In cases where a lock-out tag cannot be removed by the person who put on the tag or the person cannot be found, the supervisor/owner may remove the tag after checking with the person that will be working on that piece of equipment to ensure that the work is completed. Both will sign off on the tag.

The Financial Stabilization Plan has a three (3) year term, the contributions to the Pool will continue for four(4) years. Contributions to the Pool in year 4 will be based on fifty percent (50%) of net earnings above a threshold of ten percent (10%) ROCE. Duty deposits made on behald of the Manitoba operations during the period of January 20th, 2006 to the end of the agreement that were refunded would be included as income for ROCE purposes. Duty deposits prior to January 20th, 2006 would be excluded.

Cash in the Pool in excess of the make whole payment requirements will carry forward and be used to offset future cash losses. At the end of year 4 any cash remaining in the Pool will be utilized to pay any outstanding wage rollbacks to a maximum of one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cumulative value.

adequately and accurately documented before being passed to the Job Evaluation Committee for further action. The documents required will include a "Request for Job Evaluation" form submitted either by an individual employee or by local Management, and a fully completed job description, which provides sufficient information for the subsequent work of the Job Evaluation Committee. The form of the documents, the procedures for submitting and handling them may be amended as required by the Job Evaluation Committee under the authority given them by Article 3 of this schedule.
b)	Decisions of the Review Committee respecting the appropriateness of a request for evaluation or re-evaluation, or respecting the adequacy and accuracy of documents, shall be by unanimous agreement. Failing such agreement, the Review Committee shall at the request of any one of its members, immediately forward the Request for Job Evaluation, together with any other documents on which there is unanimous agreement to the Job Evaluation Committee and shall then have no further responsibility for documenting that request.
c)	When the Job Evaluation Committee has made a decision respecting the evaluation of a job it shall communicate that decision to the Review Committee who will be responsible for informing Management and the employees concerned, giving reasons for the outcome where these are available.

8.	Re-evaluation
a)	When a job has moved to a higher group as a result of re-evaluation, the resulting rate shall be retroactive from the date that management or the employee has applied to the Review Committee for re-evaluation.
b)	When a job is moved to a lower grade as a result of reevaluation, the incumbent shall maintain his job rate as a red circle rate subject to the provisions of paragraph 10 herein.

80
temporary rate, the resulting rate shall be retroactive from the date that the job was installed. b) When the evaluated rate for a new job is lower than the temporary rate, the incumbent(s) shall continue at the temporary rate, however, the temporary rate will be considered a red circle rate subject to the provision of paragraph 10 and 11 below.
10.	Red Circled Jobs
a)	The Company shall supply the Union with a list of employees holding red circled jobs, the said list to include the name of the employee, name of the job category filled, the evaluated rate for the job, and the actual rate paid.

d)	When the Company terminates a job, or a job is not occupied during a period of one year, a record as to the cancellation of the applicable job description and classification shall be established.
e)	If an employee is temporarily transferred at the request of the Company he shall retain his existing rate or receive the rate for the new job, whichever is higher. On return to his regularjob the said employee shall regain his red circle rate.
11.	Red Circled Rates
a) The amount of a job rate that is in excess of the evaluated worth will be red circled at the time of evaluation.
81
b)	It is intended that the red circled amount never increase. Therefore, it must be subtracted from a rate prior to the application of a percentage wage increase and then added back.
c)	A red circle amount will be reduced as the evaluated worth of the increases.
12.	Seniority

In an effort to provide relief for progression lines with minimal disruption to other areas and reduced training and related costs, the Company and the Union agree to the following:
1. Future bids for progression line vacancies be posted as "relief" bids.
2. Employees in "key" positions will be eligible to bid. Employees in other progression lines will not be eligible to bid.
3.	Those employees who have accepted another bid within the last four (4) months will be ineligible to bid, per Article 13:01(c).
4.	The incumbent to a "relief" position will automatically assume the next permanent position should a permanent vacancy occur within this progression line. In the event two
84
vacancies should occur simultaneously within a progression line, the "relief" promotes to permanent, and another permanent bid and "relief" bid would be posted.
5.	Employees will not be allowed to hold more than one "relief" position at any one time.
6.	This letter will supersede Schedule "L-2" Sawmill Training Program, of the Collective Agreement.
7.	It is understood that it is not practical for tradesmen to hold relief bids. In the event that a tradesman accepts a relief they will be transferred to production.

BETWEEN
Tolko Industries Ltd., Manitoba Solid Wood Division
and
USW - Canada, Local 324
Sawmill Training Program
The purpose of this program is to provide on the job training in order that employees can move into permanent vacancies as they occur, to improve the knowledge and skill of the employees employed in the operation and to provide suitable trained employees for skilled jobs within the operation.
1.0	Backup Bids
1.1	This program will utilize “backup bids” for all jobs with the exception of the following:
a)	Tradespeople
b)	Progression Lines (Filing Room, Planer)
All employees will be eligible to bid on “Backup Bids” subject to the following:
1.2	All employees accepting back-up bids will be frozen in that bid for a period of eight (8) months.
1.3	If an employee accepts a different back-up bid, or a posted position, after eight (8) months and before twelve (12) months, that employee will be frozen in that bid or posting for one (1) year.
86
1.4	If an employee accepts a different back-up bid or a posted position after twelve (12) months, that employee will be frozen in that bid or posting for a period of eight (8) months.
1.5	Employees may only hold one “Backup Bid” at a time. Should an employee bid on and win another “Backup Bid” they would lose their “Backup” status on their former bid.
1.6	If no one bids on a “Backup Bid” then the senior labourer will be asked to relieve this position. If a permanent vacancy exists in these positions then a “full time” bid will be posted along with another “backup bid”.
1.7	Employees will have two (2) days to decide if they will accept a back up or posted position.
2.0	Filling Vacancies
2.1	If a vacancy is expected to last in excess of one (1) week, the employee who holds the “backup bid” on the shift in which the vacancy occurs shall fill in for any partial weeks and the senior employee who holds the “backup bid” shall fill the vacancy for the remainder of the time.
2.2	The senior employee who has held the backup bid the longest shall automatically assume the next permanent full time vacancy that comes open.
2.3	Employees holding back up bids who refuse for other than proper cause to accept vacancies for which they are trained, shall lose their “back up” status on the second refusal.
2.4	The “utility man” will be a posted job and everything being equal, the senior man will be awarded the job. He will
87
be used to fill the gap between trainees, spares, and regular operators, but the “utility man” will never permanently fill one particular job. This clause is not intended to restrict in any fashion the provisions of this program.
3.0	Training
3.1	For employees training on “New Equipment” (equipment not used before) the training period will be extended up to thirty (30) days. The Supervisor, along with the input from the Trainer, can qualify or disqualify the Trainee at any time. This does not change an employee’s right to grieve the decision of a Supervisor.
3.2	Employees who are training on their “backup bid” job shall receive their regular job rate. They shall however not receive more than the established rate for the job they are training for. However if the employee performs the job more than one (1) hour in a day without close supervision (close supervision is defined as a supervisor or qualified operator in the immediate vicinity of the employee, thereby enabling such supervisor or qualified operator to instruct or oversee job performance) the employee shall be paid the job rate for actual hours worked. Once the employee is trained they shall be paid the rate of the job they perform.
3.3	While an employee is training on their “backup bid” they shall be notified in writing of their progress at intervals during the training period.
3.4	The Company shall notify the employee, the local Union and the Plant Committee in writing of their progress at intervals during the training period.
88
3.5	Training for Tour (twelve hour) Jobs will be in twelve (12) hour increments, unless not feasible due to absences, i.e. illness etc.
3.6	All labourers will be trained on the positions of “drop sort” and “8 foot edger” to allow for short-term relief. Other positions may be considered upon discussion with the Plant Committee.
4.0	Progression Lines
4.1	The established Progression Lines (Filing Room and Planer) shall remain as they currently are and are not effected by the implementation of this program.
