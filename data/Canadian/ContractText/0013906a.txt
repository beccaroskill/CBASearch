ISSUE#8-“B” TEAM
The Company agrees to meet with the Union prior to the start of an overhaul with a view to using unemployed bargaining unit employees residing in the Labrador City area. The aim of this meeting is to alleviate local unemployment through the provision of short term work that may arise on overhauls requiring contractors and to accomplish this in a manner which will not disrupt active employees or the Company’s operation. Because of these considerations the following special measures apply:
a)	Selection of personnel for the occupations required for such overhaul work shall be based on seniority among those locally resident employees who leave their name for overhaul work with the Personnel Office.
b)	Active employees cannot exercise seniority in order to avail themselves of this overhaul work.
c)	Seniority provisions including but not limited to layoff and recall notices do not apply to this overhaul work.
d)	Employment in such overhaul work does not add to or detract from layoff time stipulated in Paragraph 6.09 e) of the Collective Agreement and the contractual benefits that apply during layoff.
e)	Except as provided by Law, no benefits arise from vacation, bonuses, transportation or air transportation subsidy, provisions of the Collective Agreement.

Employees who accept the work may be called upon to perform functions as agreed at the meeting referred to above. Acceptance or rejection of such short term overhaul work by employees who are listed with the Personnel Office, does not affect recall rights that apply by virtue of the force reduction that originally placed the employee on layoff.
ISSUE#9 -VACATION ROTATION
The following shall, subject to Article XV of the Agreement, outline the general procedures to establish and schedule rotating summer vacations. Any error, omission or disagreement arising out of the interpretation of the following shall be referred to the Vacation Scheduling Committee. If not resolved by the Committee, the matter may be taken up in accordance with Article 7.07 b).
a)	The purpose of the vacation rotation system is to provide 50% of the employees in a department (Group A) the opportunity to schedule a summer vacation during odd numbered years and the remaining 50% (Group B) the opportunity to schedule summer vacation during even numbered years.
b)	The summer vacation period is defined as the thirteen week period commencingwith the first Monday following June 15^
of the vacation year. Block 1 shall include weeks one through five, Block 2 shall include weeks five through nine and Block 3 shall include weeks nine through thirteen, all periods being inclusive. The Company must allow a minimum of 17% of each classification within a department to schedule their vacation within each of the blocks outlined above.
fC
c)	Employees in the group entitled to scheduling priority that vacation year shall, on a seniority basis, select their annual vacation. An employee may elect to split their vacation into a maximum of three periods, none of which shall be less than one week in duration. Only one of these may be scheduled during the summer vacation period and must fall entirely within a block as defined in b) above. If splitting, the employee will only select the second portion after all other employees in his/her group have made a first choice, and select the third portion after all other employees in his/her group have made a second choice. Once this process has been completed the alternate groups will select their annual vacation in the same fashion.
d)	It is recognized that due to workforce adjustments, classifications within departments may, from time to time, not
be composed of equal numbers of Group A and Group B employees. In these situations the vacation scheduling shall be conducted in accordance with c) above.
If during scheduling, there are available summer vacation slots not filled by the priority group, they will be offered to the senior employees from the non-priority group who, during their previous priority year, did not have an opportunity to schedule a summer vacation due to group imbalance.
However, in situations where group imbalance is causing a significant problem, the Union may meet yearly with Employee Relations and agree upon a method of balancing that group.
e)	In a classification where vacations have exceeded 50% in the summer period, the Company will, where possible, maintain that level.
f)	Should production requirements necessitate a temporary shutdown of the Carol Project, vacations will be scheduled during the temporary shutdown.
g)	Employees scheduling three separate vacation periods will not be awarded leaves of absence or changes to their regularly scheduled shifts during the weeks immediately preceding or following a vacation period of 7 days in duration.
ISSUE#10 -VACATION REPLACEMENT
a)	Should it become necessary to recall less than sixty (60) employees for summer vacation relief, the normal recall procedure will be followed. The normaljob vacancy rules will be suspended and such relief will be achieved in the order outlined below should it become necessary to recall sixty or more employeesfor summervacation relief.
I.	Assignment of qualified employees within the occupation.
II.	As determined by the Company, offer the position to the qualified employees from within other occupations by seniority. Should no employee accept the position, the junior employee will be assigned. An employee so assigned shall receive the rate of pay of his/her regular
job or the rate of pay of the job to which he/she is assigned, whichever is greater.
III.	The recalling of senior qualified employees laid off from active service with the Company.
IV.	The recall of active qualified employees reduced or displaced from the classifications. The vacancy created
by such a recall will be filled as iniii) above.

subject to Articles V and VI of the Collective Agreement where temporary status will end at the expiration of the summer vacation period.
VI.	The hiring of summer students as per the Collective Agreement. Summer students may also be hired as the temporary vacation relief mentioned in v) above provided
they have the necessary qualifications and the work period does not conflict with their college or university return date.
VII.	In the case of a job vacancy arising during the term of the summer vacation period, employees working as vacation reliefwill be subject to normal recall procedures.
b)	The summer vacation relief period shall be defined as the fifteen (15) week period commencing two weeks before the summer vacation period as outlined in b) of letter Item #9 above, in order to facilitate training and familiarization.

ISSUE#11 -SPECIAL ISSUES
This is to confirm the agreement reached during negotiations <£ "special issues" pursuant to Article XX.
The Company understands that the Union has a legitimate concern about contracting oui because of its effects upon such matters as job security and job opportunity and will therefore use its best efforts to minimize the amount of production or maintenancework to be contracted out.
The Company will commit to maintaining work for its employees and the community in line with the Company's mission statement while working to become the lowest cost producer of value added iron ore productsinthe world.
After reviewing the issues associated with Article XX the
(_..npany agrees with the Union that much of the conflict that
arises out of this article result because of a lack of understanding.
To this effect we are proposing the following procedure to monitor
these activities:
a)	The Contracting Out Committee will review work currently contracted out and any planned contracting out of work in
the future, with the aim of investigatingwhetherthe work can be performed by bargaining unit employees with cost effectiveness being the most important but not the only determining factor.
b)	That each area (Mine, Mill, Pellet Plant, Common Services) would have a management and union representative charged with the responsibility <f monitoring Contracting Out issues. The management representative will have the responsibility to review with their counterpart all issues associated with the requirement to bring contractors on site, and the work that is sent outside for repair.
c)	Where further discussion is required, the area manager will meet with the Contracting Out Committee and the area representatives. Normal application of the Collective Agreement will apply if agreement is not reached at this level.
d)	On an annual basis (January) the Company will sit down
with the Contracting	Cat Committee and area
representatives and document the work planned for that year that involves Contracting Out. Any additional Contracting Out will be kept at a minimum and will be reviewed in the proposed manner.
e)	Training of new area representatives on the intent of Points
a), b) and c) will be done within 30 days of the appointment.
SNOW CLEARING
The Company will, for the life of this contract, strive to carry out heavy equipment work around the Concentrator and Pellet Plant facilities that is normally contracted out. The extent of this commitment is to the limit of available equipment associated with the operation of the blending and flux yard that can be kept on a cost effective basis to effect work during the winter months. At 1994 production levels this equates to 12 operators. The Company will, under the same conditions, continue the current practice of snow clearing and sanding at the Carol Project.
WARRANTY WORK
On warranty work pertaining to mobile equipment we will maintain our current practice of having one of our maintenance employees assist the service representative. It is not our intention to lease mobile equipment with a maintenance service agreement.
On other warranty issues, the Company maintains the rightto hold the supplier/contractor fully responsible for the quality of work/materials supplied. However, the Company recognizes the Union’s concern that repair work could be ongoing in certain situations and will limit warranty work performed by contractors to a 60 day warranty period. After 60 days IOCC, if qualified, will do the required repairand charge the contractoraccordingly.
FABRICATION WORK
The Company intends to continue with its commitment established at the 1987 negotiations which was the inclusion of six thousand welder personhours in our annual operating plan to be assigned to previously contracted out fabrication work. Kick platesforthe ATO will be fabricated by bargaining unit personnel subject to economic competitiveness.
JLAGE TRUCK BOXES
All repairs to haulage truck boxes will be done by bargaining unit members; however, the Company maintains the right to purchase new boxes when required.
DOLOMITE QUARRIES
The Company agrees to continue the current practice of utilizing Local 5795 members in the procurement of Dolomite at the Albert Lake and Leila Wynn Dolomite Quarries, including routine road maintenance.
These arrangements do not prejudice the Company’s rights as defined in Article XX of the Collective Agreement.
988 LOADER
The Company agrees to review its current practice of seasonal use of a 988 loader in the dolomite quarries, and meet with the Union Contracting Ctifc Committee to discuss the economic viability of alternative uses for the balance of the year.
GENERAL
The Company agrees to continue its current practice with respect to mobile equipment maintenance, air conditioning repair and fibre-optic repairs for the term of this Collective Agreement.
