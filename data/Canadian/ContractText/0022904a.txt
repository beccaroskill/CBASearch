10.21	A successful bidder on a job in another department who voluntarily disqualifies himself or is disqualified by the Company, as permitted in Articles 10.23 and 10.24, will revive his former Department Seniority and will be permitted to bid on any job vacancies within his department but will not be permitted to bid on any job vacancies other than maintenance progression or apprenticeship vacancies outside his department for a period of six months following his return to his department.
10.22	An employee who occupies a permanent day shift vacancy who subsequently loses the job due to a reassignment to shift work will be returned to the day shift job when it next becomes vacant on the basis of General Seniority.

10.23	If within thirty working days an employee in a new job classification or assignment voluntarily disqualifies himself he shall return to his last classification and assignment if the job assignment still exists.
10.24	If an employee fails to satisfactorily perform the duties in a job classification or assignment, he shall be returned to his last classification and assignment if the job assignment still exists, and he will not be considered for the job assignment he was disqualified from for a period of up to six months.

In the event the transfer is for more than six months, the employee shall lose all retained seniority.
ARTICLE 11 - LAYOFF AND REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF THE WORKFORCE
NOTICE OF LAYOFF
11.01	Subject to the Labour Standards Act, in any reduction of the workforce for a period in excess of six consecutive days, the Company will give employees so affected at least seven days’ notice prior to their layoff. In lieu of the notice, the Company may elect to pay equivalent wages exclusive of overtime to the employee laid off.
42
11.02	In any reduction of work forces expected to last for a period not longer than seven days, the Company will attempt to give employees thus affected twenty-four hours notice.
REDUCTION OF WORKFORCE
11.03	Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen days will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than:
-	one week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is less than three years:
-	three weeks’ notice if the employee’s period of employment is three years or more but less than five years;
-	five weeks’ notice if the employee’s period of employment is five or more years.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six days or less, or if an employee is recalled for a specified, limited period of work.
The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
11.04	When the Company deems it necessary to reduce the working force for a layoff expected to last in excess of six days, the following procedure shall be followed:
a)	Employees who have not yet established General Seniority shall first be laid off, then employees with the least General Seniority shall be laid off until the necessary reduction is effected.
b)	The Company will not be required to retain an employee because of his General Seniority unless such an employee possesses the necessary
43
qualifications to perform and is willing to perform the work of the employee who would otherwise be laid off in accordance with this provision.
c)	Within each department affected by the reduction, employees in the job classifications abolished or reduced shall be reclassified within the department on the basis of qualifications and General Seniority.
d)	When there are vacancies existing in departments due to layoff of employees by General Seniority, employees who have been unable to remain in their respective departments shall be assigned to fill the existing vacancies on the basis of qualifications and General Seniority.
e)	Any employee who accepts layoff in lieu of a transfer to another department or is laid off on the basis of General Seniority shall continue to accumulate General Seniority and shall be eligible for recall to work for a period not exceeding twelve months after which the layoff shall be deemed to be permanent and his employment terminated as of the date of the layoff except if during the twelfth month following such layoff the laid off employee notifies the Company by letter with return address attached that he desires to be restored to employment he shall continue to accumulate General Seniority and shall be eligible for recall to work for a total period of twenty-four months from the date of such layoff.
f)	The laid off employee shall leave his address with the Company and shall notify the Company of any change of address.
g)	The reasonable trial or training period as re-
44
ferred to in Article 9.02, does not apply in the, case of layoff and recall and restoration of the workforce. However, a senior employee will be entitled to a 3-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. It is understood the Company may refuse to grant the 3-day familiarization period if it can demonstrate that the employee could not meet the requirements of the job even if a 3-day familiarization period were granted. An employee who fails to meet the requirements of the job during the 3-. day familiarization period in a job at bid level or above will be eligible to displace a junior employee in a position below bid level who filled the vacancy as per 11.03(d) on the basis of General Seniority.
RECALL OF THE WORKFORCE
11.05	A laid off employee who fails to report for work to the Company’s office within ten days after receiving notification of recall by registered mail or telegram unless he requests and receives an additional ten days extension during the ten days shall forfeit his seniority and right to recall. This period will be extended if disability prevents immediate return if the employee notifies the Company of the personal disability within the ten day period.
11.06	If at the time of the layoff the Company gives an employee a definite date upon which he is to return to work, notification will not be necessary and failure to return upon the designated date shall constitute a voluntary termination of employment as of the date of layoff.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
11.07	When an employee is laid off the Company may require that he be examined by the Company
45
physician to determine his physical condition and upon recall shall be re-examined by the physician. If the layoff has continued for thirty days or more or if he has been involved in an accident during the layoff, he shall be eligible to return to work if he is physically capable of performing the work for which he is recalled. The physician’s fee will be paid by the Company.
11.08	A copy of the physician’s report of each examination shall be furnished to the Company, the Union and the employee involved.
LAYOFF DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
11.09	An employee with five or more years of General Seniority who is laid off as a result of technological change, as defined by the Trade Union Act, 1972, or permanent property closure, shall receive a severance payment of one week’s pay at the employee’s base wage at the time of layoff, for each complete year of accumulated service prior to this layoff, up to a maximum of thirteen weeks’ pay. In the event an employee who received a severance payment as provided above, is recalled within the period covered by the payment (maximum of thirteen weeks), he shall repay a prorata amount of the severance payment based upon the date of recall.

11.12	Whenever possible the Union will be advised in advance of the shutdown.
BASIS OF RECALL
11.13(a) Employees will be recalled from layoff on the basis of their General Seniority and ability to perform the work for which they are being recalled.

he has since been awarded a posted job, or has been displaced for more than 24 months; however, when a vacancy occurs in a Department, preference to fill the vacancy will be given to a qualified employee with ' more General Seniority who was displaced from his job for 24 months or less due to a layoff or reduction of the , workforce, until there is a vacancy in his former job assignment.
(c)	The Company will not be required to post such vacancies until all eligible employees have been returned to their former job assignments.
MAINTENANCE OF RATE
