However, it is clearly understood that this Collective Agreement does not expire until June 30,1999 and legal strike or lockout action is not applicable until that date. Therefore, if the parties are unable to reach an agreement on the reopener provisions to take effect in 1997 and 1998 (that is, wage in-es, benefit improvements, past and future pension service benefit improvements), the matter(s) in dispute will be referred to binding interest arbitration with retroactivity of any award to July 1,1997.
If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator for this purpose, the Associate chair (Mediation) Labour Relations Board will name the arbitrator.
The presumption before the arbitrator will be that wage and benefit improvements will be based on the IWA negotiated package prevailing at that time. Furthermore, a pension plan benefit improvement is also presumed.
Labour Agreement effective July 1,1994 to June 30,1999
