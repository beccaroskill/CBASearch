7.04	All time limits referred to in the grievance procedure herein contained shall be deemed to mean "workdays".
7.05	No employee shall have a grievance until he has discussed his complaint with his foremen. The employee shall bring the circumstances of his complaint to the attention of the Foremen within four (4) days from the time the circumstances upon which the complaint is based were known or should have been known. The foreman will meet with the grievor and Steward as soon as possible to try to resolve the complaint. If the foreman does not promptly settle the matter to the employee's satisfaction, the employee's proper grievance shall be processed as follows:
In case of drivers, such time limits shall be extended to ten (10) days.
STEP NO. 1
If an employee has a grievance, the grievance shall within four (4) days referred to in Article 7.03 hereof, be reduced to writing and presented to the department manager. The department manager shall give the grievor a written reply as soon as possible, but not later than four (4) days after such decision. If such reply is not satisfactory to the grievor, the next step must be taken within four (4) days of the department manager's answer, but not thereafter.
The grievance referred to above shall identify:
(a)	the facts giving rise to the grievance;
(b)	the section or sections of the Agreement claimed violated, if any;
(c)	the relief requested.
and shall be signed by the employee and countersigned by the Steward.
STEP NO. 2
At this step, the written grievance shall be presented to the Industrial Relations Manager or his designate, within the aforesaid four (4) days of receipt of the
9
department manager's reply but not thereafter. A meeting will be held between the grievance Committee together with the grievor involved and the Industrial Relations Manager, together with other Representatives of management within four (4) days of the presentation of the written grievance to the Industrial Relations Manager. A staff Representative of the Union may be present at such a meeting if requested by either party. The Industrial Relations Manager shall give his written reply to the Steward within four (4) days of such meeting.
If the Industrial Relations Manager's reply is not satisfactory to the grievor, the next step must betaken within ten (10) days after the delivery of the Industrial Relations Manager's reply to the Steward but not thereafter.
STEP NO. 3
In the event the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the party having carriage of the grievance shall request arbitration of the grievance by giving notice in writing to the other party within ten (10) days from the delivery of the decision at Step 2 to the Steward but not thereafter.
If the request for arbitration is not so given, within such ten (10) day period, the decision at Step 3 shall be final and binding upon both parties to the Agreement, and upon any employee involved.
The notice to arbitrate shall contain the name and address of the moving party's nominee to the Board and shall also specify all of the outstanding issues of the written grievance to be dealt with by the Board and the remedy sought. The party giving such notice shall be bound by same and shall be restricted to arbitrate the issues presented by the notice.
The recipient of the notice shall within ten (10) days advise the other party, in writing, of the name of the appointee to the arbitration board. The two (2) appointees so selected shall, within five (5) days of the appointment of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be the chairman. If the two (2) appointees fail to agree upon a chairman, within the time limited, the Ministry of Labour for Ontario shall if requested, within the five (5) days from the expiry of the date upon which the two (2) appointees are to appoint a chairman but not thereafter, forthwith appoint a qualified person to be chairman.
7.06	The arbitration board shall hear and determine the matter and shall issue a decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee affected by it. The decision of the majority shall be the decision of the arbitration board, but if there is no majority decision, the decision of the chairman shall govern.
7.07	The arbitration board shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify or amend any part of this
10
Agreement, nor to adjudicate any matter not specifically assigned to him by the notice to arbitrate specified in Step 3 of Article 7.05 hereof.
7.08	Each party hereto shall bear its own costs of and incidental to any arbitration proceedings. The fees and charges of the chairman of the board of arbitration shall be borne equally by the two (2) parties hereto.
7.09	The time limits and other procedural requirements set out in this Article 7 are mandatory and not merely directory, therefore, failure to put a grievance in writing at the proper step in accordance with the requirements hereof shall be deemed a complete waiver and abandonment of the grievance by the grievor. Any grievance not appealed from one step of the grievance procedure to the next within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be abandoned. No matter may be submitted to arbitration which has not properly been carried through all specified previous steps of the grievance procedure within the time specified. The time limits in this Article 7 may be extended if both parties agree.
7.10	A grievance which has been disposed of pursuant to the grievance provisions of this Agreement shall not again be made the subject matter of a grievance. A grievor shall have the right to withdraw the grievance at any stage of the proceedings.
7.11	A decision or settlement reached at any stage of the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto, including the complaining employee, and shall not be subject to reopening by any party except by agreement in writing. If the grievance is settled at any step of the grievance procedure both the Company and the Union Representatives who pass on the same as provided herein shall, after ratification, sign the settlement as endorsed upon the written grievance, so that no question or argument may arise as to what the settlement was.
7.12	When an employee's grievance is settled by the parties or determined by a Board of Arbitration on the basis that the employee is entitled to be reimbursed for wages lost as a result of action on the part of the Company in violation of this Agreement, such reimbursement shall be at the appropriate hourly rate exclusive of any shift premiums for those days he was otherwise available for work and recall at the employer's Plant, but there shall be subtracted therefrom any and all monies the employee received during such period.
7.13	Union Policy Grievance or Company Grievance
A Union policy grievance or Company grievance may be submitted to the Company or the Union, as the case may be, in writing within five (5) days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known or should have been known by the grievor. A meeting between the Company and the Union shall be held within five (5) days of the presentation of the written grievance and shall take place within the framework of Step 2 of Article 7.05 hereof. The Company or the Union,
11
as the case may be, shall give its written decision within five (5) days after such meeting has been held.
If the decision is unsatisfactory to the grieving party the grievance may be submitted to arbitration within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of such written decision and the arbitration section of this Agreement shall be followed.
7.14	Discharge Cases and Suspension Cases
A claim by a seniority employee that he has been discharged or suspended shall be treated as a grievance and shall commence at Step 2 of Article 7.05 provided a written grievance signed by the employee and his Steward is presented to the designated official of the Company within three (3) days after the discharge or suspension.
The Union shall not question the discharge or suspension of any probationary employee nor shall such discharge or suspension be the subject of a grievance. Where an employee has been discharged or suspended, he will be given an opportunity to interview his Steward prior to leaving the Company's premises provided his Steward is available on the Company's premises.
All discharge or suspension grievances shall be discussed by the parties within seventy-two (72) hours of the grievance being filed.

12
provided. If a statutory holiday falls within the five (5) day paid leave period, the paid leave shall be extended for an additional day. If the employee was otherwise on leave at the time of the death, then bereavement leave shall be unpaid.

The employee shall furnish supplementary medical evidence of disability, from time to time, as required by the Company. The Company shall have access to such medical evidence. Failure to furnish such evidence of disability within five (5) working days of the request will result in termination of the employee's employment and seniority.

Upon completion of this period, the employee's seniority shall be dated from the date the employee commenced his probationary period. Where during an employee's probationary period, the Company has given him one (1) or more written warnings, it is understood and agreed that the discharge of such employee during his probationary period shall be deemed to be for just cause.

RE: DOWNSIZING OR ELIMINATING TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT
If, the Company decides to permanently downsize or eliminate its transportation department, drivers will not be required to exercise seniority rights to bump into the Plant unless they wish to do so; instead, they will have the option of accepting a termination of their employment and immediately receiving severance pay following waiver of recall rights. The severance pay entitlement for any driver laid off and waiving recall rights during the term of the Collective Agreement shall be two weeks per year of service, to a maximum of 52 weeks. A driver’s “weekly” rate of pay shall be calculated by dividing the driver’s T4 income for the previously completed calendar year by 52. This payment shall be inclusive of and in satisfaction of statutory notice, pay in lieu of notice and severance pay entitlements.
Drivers who have their employment terminated in accordance with this Letter of Understanding shall continue to be covered by the benefit plans referenced in the Collective Agreement until the earlier of three months after their termination date or the date they secure alternative employment.
