5.05
5.06
5.07
5.08
5.09
- 4 -
to perform as employees. It is acknowledged that grievances should be serviced as soon as possible and that if it is necessary to service a grievance during working hours, employees will not leave their jobs without obtaining their supervisor's permission. Permission will not be unreasonably withheld.
In order that a loss in production will be kept to a minimum, it is understood that grievances will be serviced outside of working hours whenever possible, and on this understanding, the Co-operative agrees that the Chief Steward or Grievance Committee member shall not lose any pay for time lost by servicing grievances.
Should a grievance arise between the Co-operative and Union or employees as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this Agreement, or as to the compliance by either party with any of its obligations under the Agreement, there shall be no strike, slowdown, work stoppage, or suspension thereof by the Union or its members, or lockouts by the Co-operative on account of such grievance.
In the case of any general allegation by the Union that the Co-operative has violated this Agreement in a manner that affects broad principles rather than specific individuals, the Union Grievance Committee shall present such grievance in writing directly to the Mill Operations Manager at Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure.
It is agreed that at the request of the Co-operative, the Union Grievance Committee will meet with Management representatives to discuss any complaints or grievances that Management may have.
The time periods as stated in this Article, are exclusive of weekends and holidays. They may be reasonably extended by mutual agreement between the parties hereto.
A grievance affecting an individual employee to be accepted must be initiated by the employee aggrieved within five (5) working days of the occurrence giving rise to the grievance, and it shall be handled in the following manner:
The employee shall be accompanied by the Chief Steward or in his absence another member of the Grievance Committee unless he requests the Steward not to be present, shall discuss his grievance with his supervisor.
The supervisor shall give his decision orally to the employee or to the Grievance Committee member involved within thirty-six (36) hours after presentation of the grievance.
Any grievance which cannot be resolved at Step 1, above, shall be referred to the Chief Steward, or in his absence, a member of the Grievance Committee and committed to writing for resolution at the next step.
Step 2

If the grievance is not resolved in Step 1, the Chief Steward, or in his absence, another member of the Grievance Committee, shall within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the decision in Step 1, submit to the Mill Operations Manager a signed written "Grievance Report" form.
Upon receipt of the written grievance, the Mill Operations Manager, or his designated representative, shall within forty-eight (48) hours, meet with the Chief Steward or Grievance Committee member involved in an attempt to resolve the grievance. The representative of the Co-operative shall give the Chief Steward or his alternate an answer in writing no later than forty-eight (48) hours after such meeting.
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the grievance shall be submitted in writing to the V.P. Agriculture within five (5) working days of receipt of the decision at Step 2.

a)	submit his decision in writing to the Union; or
b)	arrange a meeting with the Union to attempt to resolve the grievance. Such a meeting would consist of the V.P. Agriculture or his appointee and the Mill Operations Manager and such other representatives of Management named by the Mill Operations Manager, on the one hand; and the aggrieved employee, the Union Steward, and the Business Agent of the Union who may be accompanied by the International Representative of the Union, on the other hand. The Co-operative, shall within five (5) days after such meeting, submit its decision in writing to the Union.
Step 4
If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved at Step 3, either party may submit the grievance to arbitration as outlined in Article VII of this Agreement.
If either party has not initiated the arbitration procedure within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the decision at Step 3, the grievance will be deemed to have been resolved or withdrawn. Any grievance unresolved at the time of signing of this Agreement, shall be subject to the above time limits.
ARTICLE VI - DISCIPLINE
The Co-operative favours "Corrective discipline" over "Punitive discipline". Unless there is just and sufficient cause for immediate dismissal, the Co-operative shall follow a procedure of progressive discipline, gearing the penalty to the seriousness of the violation, imposing appropriate discipline from a verbal warning to a termination of employment.
A written warning, or other discipline, for a similar or related offense shall not be considered in a subsequent disciplinary action if a period of twelve (12) months or more has expired without a violation or infraction being committed that warrants a written warning or stronger disciplinary

6.02
6
action.
6.03	When an employee is to be called into the office for disciplinary action he shall be advised in advance and may request the presence of the Chief Steward or, in his absence, an alternate. When the employee requests the presence of the steward, no discipline meeting will be held until a steward is available.
6.04	A claim by a permanent employee who has attained seniority that he has been unjustly discharged shall be treated as a grievance if a written statement of such grievance is lodged with the Mill Operations Manager within five (5) working days of the discharge.
6.05	There shall be only (1) employee personnel file for disciplinary action, and the employee shall have access to review this file, provided reasonable notice is given, and management is present. This right will not be exercised more often than every three (3) months unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
6.06	If an employee is given a verbal warning and it is noted in his personal file such file reference will state that it was a verbal warning.
6.07	Employees will not be disciplined for tardiness because of conditions beyond their control, however, habitual tardiness will not be tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary action.
ARTICLE VII - ARBITRATION

Both parties shall within five (5) full working days get together to agree on one of the nominees to act as arbitrator. If they are unable to agree on an arbitrator, they shall ask the Minister of Labour for Canada to appoint one.

An employee who would qualify under the above except that he is laid off rather than having his employment terminated, will qualify once his seniority rights expire.
An employee aged fifty-five (55) or older who is laid off may take severance pay at any time prior to or upon expiry of his seniority and in so doing, forfeits further seniority rights. He may, in addition, take early retirement, subject to the terms and conditions of the Co-op Atlantic Employees Pension Plan.

It is agreed that where an employee qualifies for a severance allowance under this Article,such allowance shall be paid in a lump sum to the employee,his beneficiary or estate as the case shall be.
The date of payment shall be as requested by the employee, but in no case shall this be later than twelve (12) months after the employee's last day of employment with the Co-operative.
13.11	Technological Change

ARTICLE XIV - LEAVE OF ABSENCE

14.02	Any leave of absence granted under Clause 1401 shall be in writing, and not exceeding two (2) weeks in any one year, except by mutual agreement, and no such leave will affect any employee's seniority rights.

Any meeting agreed to will be held within five (5) days of giving such reply, excluding weekends and holidays.

b) No employee will work more than two double shifts in a row unless another regular operator of the equipment is not available.

17.09	An employee who has gone home and is especially called back by Management, except when Management cannot be contacted, to work in an emergency outside his regular working hours, shall be paid three (3) hours pay at his straight time rate or his actual overtime hours worked in accordance with the provisions of 1704 and 1705, whichever is more advantageous to him,
