1.02	The Company and the Union shall co-operate fully in the promotion and achievement of the matters set forth in the preamble to this Agreement.
1.03	Following notification and permission (not to be unreasonably withheld) from the Company, Union representative^) will be permitted entry to the Company's property in order to carry out their duties as related to the administration of the Agreement.

during working hours, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon.
1.05
(a)	The Company recognizes that it is not the function of persons of or above the rank of supervisor to perform work which is normally performed by an employee in the bargaining unit, except under emergency conditions or for the purpose of instruction or experimentation. For the purposes of this Article emergency is any sudden or unusual occurrence or condition that could not, by the exercise of reasonable judgement, have been foreseen by the Company.
(b)	In the event a person of, or above the rank of supervisor, performs work in violation of this section, the Company shall pay as a penalty an amount equal to the hourly rate of the employee(s) who would normally perform such work for the period of the violation, or for two (2) hours, whichever is greater, and such payment will be made to the Union.
1.06	Designated Individuals - it is expressly understood and agreed that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the Company shall have the right from time to time to designate to the Union, individuals who agree to be given special experience or training in preparing them or trying out their capabilities for other or broader assignments with the Company or for future service other than to the Company not exceeding at any one time one percent (1%) of the employees; and to promote and demote such individuals and direct their efforts from time to time, free from any limitations provided for in this Agreement, provided however, that the employment of any such individuals shall not affect the seniority nor result in the demotion of any employee, and further that

ARTICLE 2:
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
2.01	The Company shall retain, maintain and exercise all managerial rights, authorities, and prerogatives, subject only to the express terms and provisions of the Agreement.
ARTICLE 3:

3.04	The total earnings per hour of each employee shall be calculated by dividing the total earnings in the

Dues shall be deducted each pay period and remitted to Edgar Ball (or his successor), International Treasurer of the United Steelworkers of America. Until further notice from the Union, all cheques will be forwarded to the United Steelworkers of America, P.O. Box 1400, Postal Station “A” Vancouver, B.C. V6C 2P7 on the employee pay day or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. An itemized statement listing all the employees, including their social insurance numbers and occupations of new employees, indicating the amount of dues deducted from each, will be submitted with the Union dues remittance, and a copy of the itemized statement will be provided to the Financial Secretary of the Local Union.
3.07	In the event an employee does not work at least twenty (20) hours or be paid for at least twenty (20) hours for vacation or unworked statutory holidays in the reference period, then no dues will be deducted. Also, no dues will be deducted if at the time of preparation of the pay cheque there are insufficient funds owing to the
4
employee concerned except to the extent that such funds are owing to the employee.
3.08	The foregoing deduction will commence, in the case of each employee who is in the employment of the Company, with the effective date of this Agreement and, in the case of each employee entering the employment of the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, with the calendar month in which his first pay cheque from the Company is received by him. A new employee commencing work in the first half of the month will pay dues for that month. A new employee commencing work in the second half of the month will not pay dues for that month.
3.09	As early as possible in each calendar year, and no later than February 15, the Company shall provide the Local with an individual statement listing the total of Union dues (or equivalent) deducted from the pay of each employee during the previous calendar year and paid to the Union in accordance with this Article. Appropriate forms will be supplied by the Union no later than September 15th of the preceding year.
3.10	The Union shall indemnify and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Company in complying with the provisions of Article 3.01 through to 3.10.

5
(b)	Thirty (30) days prior to any planned contracting work on Company premises, the Company will notify the Union of the name of the contractor, the number of contractor's employees, the reasons for contracting out the work, and the nature of the work and the estimated time the contractor will be on the property. Within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the contracting work, the Company will submit to the Union the actual number of man hours to complete the job.
3.12	Within thirty (30) days of the execution of the Collective Agreement the Company and the Union will review on a monthly basis contracting out practises.
When reviewing contracting out practices the terms of reference shall be:
(i)	To establish a list of work that has historically been contracted out.
(ii)	To review contracted work, with a view to what other options may have been possible and practicable, with the goal of replacing contractors with bargaining unit employees to make the operation more economically viable.
(iii)	To preview work expected to be contracted out and explore possible alternatives taking into consideration the efficiency of the operation, the urgency of the work to be performed and the availability of the equipment, skills and manpower.
(iv)	To make recommendations to the parties respecting contracting of work as set out in (ii) and (iii) above.
3.13	The Company agrees that where it will contract out work normally performed by the bargaining unit on Company premises and there are employees on lay-off
6
who, in the opinion of the Company, are qualified to perform a portion of that contract, even though the whole contract could not be performed by bargaining unit employees because the Company does not have the skills, equipment and facilities to do so, the Company will recall qualified laid-off employees to perform the portion of the work for which they are qualified where it is practicable to do so.
Prior to this application, the parties agree to meet and discuss all practical areas of concern that may affect the situation of the laid-off employees or the viability to the operation.
3.14	The job steward in the area affected will be notified when contractors are on the property. As well, the Company will maintain up-to-date log books of all contractors and the specific work that is being performed. These log books will be made available to any steward in the work area.

7
employees, shall in any way authorize, encourage or participate in any strike, work stoppage, walk-out, slow-down or any act of similar nature which would in any way interfere with, limit or impede the operations of the Company during the term of this Agreement.

Re: Expansion of the Operation
It is recognized that the continued viability of the Company, as well as the continued employment of members of the Union, may be dependent on future expansion of the operation.
The Company understands the Union’s stated concern for the security of its membership and agrees to meet with the Union to exchange information regarding labour stability, and both development and production costs of expansions. It is understood that in the event the Company and the Union agree that the project or any portion of the work can be performed by Quintette employees as efficiently as an independent contractor, then such work will be performed by members of the bargaining unit.
Quintette agrees that it will require that all bids contain a provision to accommodate any Quintette employee who may be laid off during the term of this agreement in the contractors work force, provided the laid off employee is qualified to perform the work.
Nothing in this letter abrogates the Union’s rights under the Industrial Relations Act of British Columbia.

Dear Steve:
This letter will serve as confirmation of the agreement in principle reached at negotiations with regards to the manning of new departments, or new work areas within a department, and reopening of existing pits.
The parties agree that senior qualified employees will be entitled to preference with regards to the manning as referred to above. Such transfers should be effected with the current operation being considered.
With these factors in mind, the parties agree to meet as far in advance as possible to discuss the orderly transfer of senior employees. Such discussions should include, but not be limited to, the posting of a pre-selection list, possible increase in training numbers, and the requirement of transfers.
In all cases of transfers the senior qualified employee indicating preference will be given an approximate transfer date.
Yours truly

Further to our discussions during negotiations concerning the application of Article 7.03(a), the Company recognizes the Union’s concern that it may be inappropriate for a steward to be the sole employee's representative in all circumstances of suspension
In response to this concern, the Company will ensure that if a General Foreman or more senior Management representative is present at a meeting under this Article, a Union Committee person will also be in attendance in accordance with Article 7.03(e).
