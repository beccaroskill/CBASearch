To ensure that senior employees will be retained, employees upon layoff from their own classification may be moved to occupational groups other than the occupational group they would be entitled to. In such cases, the affected employee who has been moved to another classification, at the discretion of the Company, will be paid at the base rate of their previous occupational group job or the base rate of the job transferred to, whichever is greater.
The Company reserves the right to periodically revalidate training that has been
lpleted. This would include employees who hold occupational group seniority but have not performed duties within the job for quite some time.
If a situation should arise in the future that causes undue hardship to the Company due to unforeseen contingencies, the parties shall meet and discuss what measures can be taken to protect senior employees while ensuring quality productivity is maintained. Examples would include, but not limited to, new program assignments where movement of employees could jeopardize customer requirements, or high percentages of workers in ajob that would need to be displaced simultaneously. In these cases, the Company would displace 20% of the employees working in that occupational group or area.

(D)	In the event of the breakage of tools or the happening of unforeseen contingencies, the Company may temporarily transfer an employee for the remainder of the shift to work other than their usual work and in such event seniority rights shall not be exercised by an employee.
(E)	An employee when transferred to an occupational group
(Not pool) shall be deemed to be serving a trial period within such group for such number of days as may appear appropriate or necessary, provided however, that such employees shall not be considered to be serving a trial period after completing 40 working days (Skilled Trades or Quality Control occupational groups, 60 working days) within such group. They shall for such trial period retain their seniority, if any, within the group from which they were transferred.
(F)	If an employee gets laid off from a Group and subsequently accepts ajob posting for another Group, their rights to the original job will be waived, except for lay off. The employee will however, be allowed to sign ajob posting to get back to their oldjob if openings arise, and the four (4) month waiting period will be waived.
(G)	Employees having the same seniority date shall be laid off and recalled by clock number order, or by occupational group where applicable.
(H)	Where it is practical to do so, employees laid off from their group wih be returned to the last (permanentjob posting) group they hold, provided that they have the seniority to do so and it conforms to Master Seniority.

Letter of Understanding Re: Skilled Trades
During negotiations the parties had considerable discussions pertaining to Job Security and Outside Contracting language currently contained in Article
19.04	of the Collective Agreement. These discussions included but were not limited to planning, advance notice of outside contracting activities, scope of the work to be contracted, full utilization of skilled trades employees in their respective trades and the installation of new or existing equipment.
While the parties agree that the language in the Collective Agreement currently provides for a mechanism to ensure that there is full input and communications between the parties relating to the issues noted above, it was recognized that there may be times where due to the excessive workloads that they may have been lax in exercising their responsibilities to ensure the most effective use of the article.
The Company and the Union therefore agree upon ratification of this agreement to work more closely together to open up the lines of communications through meaningful dialogue to ensure language in Article 19 is being fully taken advantage of in the most efficient manner for the benefit of each side.
It is the parties expectations that if the current language is made use of in an proficient manner that many of the current difficulties relating to this article
can and will be avoided.

(A) First, to provide for:
(1)	The continuation of annuities in the form in effect with
ect to them immediately prior to the plan’s termination for those persons wno are pensioners, beneficiaries and contingent annuitants under the plan at its termination;
(2)	The payment of an immediate annuity, in an amount equal
to the retirement benefit they would have received had they retired on the date of termination to each participant who on the date of termination qualifies for a normal retirement benefit under Section 5.01;
(3)	The payment of a deferred annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65) in an amount equal to their vested deferred retirement benefit to each person who terminated employment and is eligible for such a benefit pursuant to Section 5.04;
(4)	The payment of a deferred annuity equal to the vested deferred retirement pension to which they would have been entitled if the date of the plan’s termination were the date of termination of their employment, to each other participant not in any class above who at the date of the plan’s termination is at least age forty-five (45) and has completed at least ten (10) years of credited service.
There shall be no priority among the above. Any person, whether in Group (1),(2),(3) or (4), stands on the same rung of the ladder with a person in any other group.
(B) Second, if any such assets remain after complete allocation for the purposes of (A) above, they shall be allocated after first establishing classes of participants who are less than age sixty-five (65) on the date of termination and are potentially eligible for a normal retirement benefit by treating each successively younger five (5) year age group as a class using the age sixty-five (65) as a base. An order of allocation priority shall then be established beginning with the oldest class. The assets shall then be allocated to participants in each such class who have an interest herein on account of credited service prior to the date of termination of the plan in an amount equal to the actuarial value of such interest. The allocations of the amounts, if any, in each class for full or reduced retirement benefits for such participants shall be on the basis of annuity values providing for the payment of such benefits (commencing at the age of first eligibility for a normal benefit) in the form, applicable to such participants, which would have prevailed had the plan not been discontinued with application for reduction of retirement benefits, as in (A) above.
Such allocation shall be accomplished through the continuance of the trust fund which shall be maintained without earmark as the severable equitable interests of those having a share allocated as above. The allocation of assets in this Section is merely for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the trust fund to provide reserves for retirement benefits of
a certain monthly amount, and is not intended to give any participant such right, title and interest in the trust fund as to entitle them to a segregation of their aliquot share of the trust fund as a separate account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the trustees, upon finding that it is not practicable or desirable under the circumstances to continue the trust fund with respect to some of all of the groups listed above, the trustees may provide for the disposition of all or a part of the trust fund in a manner other than by the continuance of the trust fund with respect to some or all of the groups listed above, but no change shall be affected thereby in the order of precedence and basis for allocation above established.
Further, if required to dispose of the trust fund other than by its continuance because of a government rule or statute, such trust fund shall be disposed of in accordance with such rule or statute. If any allocation produces a retirement benefit of less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per year for any person, the trustees may pay in lieu of a retirement benefit a lump sum of equivalent actuarial value,
Anything in this plan which might be construed to the contrary notwithstanding however, it shall be impossible at any time for any time for any part of the corpus or income of the trust fund to revert to the Company.
8.04	AMENDMENTS
Amendments to this plan may be made in writing by mutual consent of both parties.
8.05	TERMINATION

They will be transferred as soon as possible. Exceptions may be necessary where productivity demands dictate.
3)	Successful applicants upon transfer will accumulate seniority in their new division only, but will retain their former seniority in their former division.
Such employees will be required to remain in their new division for at least one (1) year from their date of master seniority. On a layoff situation, the one year stipulation will be waived. However, any employee who does not complete their Occupational Group seniority will be returned to their original position

(b)	They will have priority recall as per their seniority rights to the original plant, ie. A plant #1 employee who is transferred to Plant #2 and laid off, will have first recall to Plant #1 by seniority before Plant #2 people with no seniority.
7)	When an employee transfers from one plant to another through the transfer agreement, and subsequently returns to the original plant, the days worked in said facility will be recorded and placed in their file. Copies will be given to the employee and the Union for future reference.
This section would not apply when the employee requests to return to the original plant on their 30 day trial period as per the job posting procedure stipulated in Article 12. It is understood that if an employee returns in this time frame, there will be no loss of seniority in the original plant.
LAYOFF TRANSFERS

NON-DISCRIMINATION/ HARASSMENT
Introduction
Both the Company and the Union are committed to providing a workplace free of discrimination and harassment. Providing fair and equitable treatment for all employees is best achieved in an environment where all individuals interact with mutual respect for each other’s rights. All employees are expected to treat all persons with courtesy and consideration and must not engage in discrimination or harassment because of a prohibited ground contrary to the Ontario human rights Code (the “Code”). Prohibited grounds are race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, record of offenses, marital status, family status or handicap, as defined in the Code. This joint policy shall be interpreted in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Code.
Complaint and Investigation Procedure If an employee believes that they have been harassed and/or discriminated against on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination the employee may:
a) Advise the person involved, as soon as possible, how you feel and request that they stop the conduct you find offensive.
B) If you feel uncomfortable approaching the person, or if the harassment continues, bring the incident forming the basis of the complaint to the attention of the supervisor and/or Union representative.
In minor cases, not involving repeat incidents, the Company and Union agree that the Union may try to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint between bargaining unit employees informally using the CAW Internal Procedure without a full investigation when so requested by the bargaining unit complainant. The outcome of this attempted resolution will be communicated to the Company. c) If the supervisor and/or Union representative cannot, to the satisfaction of the employee, deal with the complaint, it will then be submitted in writing to the joint committee.
The joint committee will be comprised of two (2) representatives selected by the Company and Two (2) representatives selected by the Union. Where the complainant is a woman and the complaint involves sexual harassment or gender discrimination, the joint investigation committee will include at least one (1) woman. These representatives must be appropriately trained regarding harassment and discrimination issues.
The joint committee will conduct an investigation of the complaint. The joint investigation will include interviews of the complainant, any employee accused in the complaint, witnesses and other persons named in the complaint. Any Union members interviewed by the joint committee may, if they so wish, have Union representation present during the interview.
It is the intention of the Union and the Company that, where practical, the joint investigation will begin within five (5) working days of the lodging of the written complaint and shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days after the lodging of the written complaint.
In conducting the joint investigation, both the Union and the Company shall, to the extent practicable, maintain confidentiality.
Records of the investigation, including interviews, evidence any recommendations made by the joint committee will be securely maintained in the offices of the Company and the Union.
Upon the completion of the joint investigation, the joint committee will complete a written report of its findings and recommendations and submit a copy of the completed report to the human resource person and the plant chairperson. If the members of the joint committee do not agree, the report may reflect differences in the findings.
If a harassment complaint is proven valid, appropriate corrective action will be taken against the offending employees.
If, after completion of a thorough investigation, a harassment complaint can neither be proved nor disproved in the view of the investigators, the local human resource person, on consultation with the local plant chairperson, will attempt to resolve the conflict in a manner that is agreeable to all parties.
If there is no agreement, the Company reserves the right to take such action as it deems appropriate, subject to the Collective Labour Agreement.
In the event the complaint remains unresolved and a violation of the Collective Labour Agreement is alleged, the matter may be considered as a grievance beginning at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Nothing in this letter of understanding prevents an individual employee complaining of harassment or discrimination from filing a complaint under the Code.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
The Chairperson of the Local and the co-chairperson from each plant and one skilled trades representative will be retained on the day shift where it is practical to do so, or if arrangements can be mutually agreed upon.

All newjobs coming into the plant will be posted by shift. It is further understood
that this agreement will be for trial period and either party may terminate the
agreement with a minimum of (2) weeks notice.
It is the Company’s intent to treat Straight Shift Postings as per the procedure
outlined in Article XII - Job Posting.
As further clarification, the following must be noted:
•	The 4-6 month eligibility period as per the Job Posting procedure shall apply for Shift postings. It must be noted that the week-end shift and the 12- hour shifts are excluded from this because they are asked by seniority working in the group, not posted.
•	Straight shift postings will not be posted by line. If an individual has been successful on a posting for a particular shift, they will not be entitled to sign another posting for the same shift within the same group.
•	If additional employees are required within the group where the straight shift occurs, the posting will be open to all eligible employees to sign.
•	If additional employees are not required within the group where the straight shift occurs, the posting will only be open to individuals currently working within that group.
•	When it is necessary to reduce a shift in a straight shift area, the employees affected will exercise their seniority in that group on their straight shift. If the employee does not have enough seniority to maintain their straight shift they will bump the most junior employee in that group on other shifts.
• Should an employee leave their straight shift posting they may lose their right to their straight shift. (for example, acceptance to 12-hour shift or week-end shift)
Should any additional unforeseen issues arise, the Company agrees to meet with the Union and discuss the concerns.

The committee shall consist of up to 3 representatives from the company and a minimum of 3 representatives from the Union, to be chosen by each respectively.
10.	The terms agreed to in this letter of understanding concerning the plant closure are in addition to any benefits or rights which may flow from the existing collective agreement between the parties or from any applicable
Provincial Legislation. The signing of this letter of understanding in no way effects the interpretation by either of the applicable legislation as it pertains to plant closure.
11.	After the announcement of a plant closure, employees hired on or before January 1, 2000 will be given a seniority date of January 1, 2000 in the other facility. If a situation should arise that causes undue hardship to the Company due to unforeseen contingencies, the parties shall meet and discuss what measures can be taken to protect senior employees while ensuring quality productivity is maintained. Examples would include, but not limited to, new program assignments where movement of employees could jeopardize customer requirements, or high percentages of workers in a job that would need to be displaced simultaneously. In these cases, the Company would displace 20% of the employees working in that occupational group or area. When these employees have obtained an efficiency rate that is acceptable to
the Company, the next senior employee will displace the next junior employ*; in the same manner aforesaid. Should it be determined that an employee cannot perform the job they will be unable to continue to utilize their seniority under this provision.
