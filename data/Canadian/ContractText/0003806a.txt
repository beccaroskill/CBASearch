An employee who is on authorized leave of absence on Union business shall retain seniority while on such leave of absence.
An employee who has established seniority and is then employed by the Union shall retain such seniority for a period not exceeding eleven (11) months.
12.02	Employment of any new employee shall be considered as probationary until he has worked thirty (30) days within a six month period. Thereafter Article 12.01 shall apply, and the employee shall be placed on the Seniority List in order of hire.
12.03	(a) Seniority will be applied on a Company wide basis in recalls, promotions, transfers from camp to camp and layoffs.
When layoffs are required due to the completion of seasonal operations, or part thereof, the employee will be permitted to transfer to a job to which his seniority and qualifications entitle him. If no jobs are available he will be permitted to replace an employee with less seniority on a job for which he is qualified provided:
(i)	The jobs will continue in other districts for fourteen (14) days or more, and
(ii)	The employee having received advance notice in accordance with Section 12.04 advises the Company prior to the effective day of the advance notice and in writing on forms to be supplied by the Company of his desire to transfer or to be laid off.
When layoffs are for less than fourteen (14) days seniority will be applied on a district
basis.
Prior to an intended layoff which is to last more than fourteen (14) days, the Company will provide the Camp Foreman with a copy to the Union Grievance Committee, with a list of the employees in other districts having the lowest seniority on jobs which will continue for fourteen (14) days or more and which are similar to those being terminated. The number of employees listed in each job classification shall be the same as the number being laid off in the same classification.
12.03	(b) In transfers from one job classification to another, senior employees shall receive first consideration.

Employees accepting the posted jobs shall be allowed five (5) work days in which to qualify, (or further time as may be mutually agreed, if additional training is required). Failure of an employee to qualify shall entitle him to return to his former job without loss of seniority or benefits.
Successful applicants will be required to fulfill the vacancy for which they have applied.
Employees accepting a job posting shall remain in that job for a minimum of three months from the date the employee filled the job vacancy unless being displaced from that job because of layoff or the bumping procedure.

The unit of application of seniority on temporary vacancies is the camp.
In the event that a vacancy is not filled from the Camp unit, it shall be filled on a Company wide seniority basis.
The employee who had occupied the job upon his return to work shall once again occupy the job that he had filled prior to vacating for any of the reasons set forth above provided however, that the job is still in effect and it is not filled by a senior employee who for reasons of layoff from his former job has exercised his seniority on this particular job.

12.04	In case of layoff which is to exceed two (2) working days, the Company will notify, in writing, the men intended to be laid off, at least two (2) working days in advance, with a copy of such said notice to the Union Grievance Committee.

Supervisory personnel who are generally employed on seasonal operations and who have not acquired seniority, in accordance with this Article, may be placed on jobs listed in the bargaining unit, during the off season, provided that this does not interfere with the application of seniority of any employee. Such personnel shall apply for Union membership prior to being placed on the job and maintain their Union membership in good standing.
12.10	When jobs are discontinued due to the introduction of new methods and equipment or curtailment of operations, affected employees shall be offered alternate employment, in accordance with Section 12.01 of Article XII, to meet the Company's labour requirements and if such employees require training to perform alternate employment effectively they shall be trained by the Company.

RECOGNITION - JURISDICTION
It will be the Company's policy not to change the present source of supply of wood fibre for its mills, if by so doing it would deprive employees with seniority from gainful employment with the Company.
If, however, during the term of this Agreement dated September 1, 1990 to August 31, 1993, circumstances beyond the control of the Company were to arise and force the Company to alter its supply and offset the employment opportunities for its employees, that volume of supply produced on operations not covered by a Collective Agreement with the Union will be reduced on a proportional basis.
In moving back to former levels of operation, the volumes of supply produced on the Company's woods operations will be increased at least proportionately to the volume of increase of supply from other sources.
Employees with seniority as of May 8, 1988 will not be laid off during the term of the Agreement as the result of the purchase of conifer fibre for its mill operation.
Further, the Company agrees that the full amount of allowable poplar cut will be harvested off the Company's limits south of the Ogoki River.

Mr. Wilfred McIntyre Local 2693 - IWA-Canada Lakehead Labour Centre P.O. Box 2384 Thunder Bay, Ontario P7B 5E9
Dear Wilf:
It is apparent from your comments over the last several months that the job security of your members is of paramount importance to you. We, too, are concerned about the livelihood of our employees.
There are, of course, many factors which affect jobs. The seasonal nature of forest products operations, technological change, the needs of our mill operations, and the cost effectiveness (competitiveness) in harvesting and transporting wood from our limit are all factors we must consider.
It is this last factor which we collectively have influence over. What we require to help secure our future is cost competitive wood from our limit for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 (term of this contract) and beyond.
Against this backdrop, I do not foresee a need nor do I intend to employ a third-party contractor on our wood limit to supply the Terrace Bay mill.
I trust that these comments will provide you with the assurance you sought.
Yours truly,
R. C. Taylor
President & General Manager
