BETWEEN:
INCO LIMITED,
MANITOBA DIVISION, (hereinafter called “the Company”)
OF THE FIRST PART
and -
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA,
LOCAL 6166, (hereinafter called “the Union”)
OF THE SECOND PART
WHEREAS by certificate of The Manitoba Labour Board dated the 31st of May, 1962, it was certified that the Union is the properly chosen bargaining agent for all employees of the Company in the Thompson, Manitoba operations except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, foremen, shift bosses and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
AND WHEREAS it is the intent and purpose of the Union and the Company to further harmonious industrial relationships between the Company and those employees:
NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETHthat the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Page 1
ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS
1.01	The expression “basic rate” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean at any time with respect to any employee that straight time rate per hour, (exclusive of all premium pay such as holiday pay, shift premium, Sunday premium and overtime) to which such employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement in respect of the work which he is performing at such time.
1.02	The word “department” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean the departments as set forth in Schedule “A” hereto.
1.03	The word “employee” or “employees” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean all employees of the Company in its Thompson and other operations north of the 53rd parallel of latitude in Manitoba except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foremen and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
1.04	Until an employee has worked on at least forty-two (42) days since the date of his most recent hiring he shall be a “probationary employee” and the words “probationary employee” wherever used in this Agreement shall have that meaning.
1.05(a) The word “seniority” wherever used in this Agreement shall
mean an employee's length of continuous employment with the Company since the date of his most recent hiring, less the periods to be subtracted under Clause 15.20.
1.05(b) The word “seniority ranking” wherever used in this Agreement
shall mean the relative seniority of an employee to others in the department in which he is then eiployed.
Page 2
1.06 Whenever the masculine gender appears in this Agreement it shall also mean the feminine gender, unless the context requires otherwise.
ARTICLE 2 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
2.01	The Union recognizes that it is exclusively the function and right of the Company to direct the working forces and to hire, promote, demote, transfer, suspend or lay off employees, and also the right of the Company to discipline or discharge any emploee for just cause.
2.02	The Union further recognizes the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole and exclusive prerogative of the Company to decide on the location of its plants and mines, the products to be mined and/or processed, the schedules of production, the methods of mining and processing used, the number of employees needed by the Company at any time, operating techniques, methods, machinery and equipment, and to exercise jurisdiction over all operations, buildings, machinery and tools.
2.03	The Company agrees that any exercise of rights and powers under this Article in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
Page 3
ARTICLE 3 - UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes that the Union is the bargaining agent of the employees and has the exclusive authority to bargain collectively on their behalf with respect to rates of pay, hours of work, and terms and conditions of employment of employees as set out in The Labour Relations Act.
3.02	Subject to the requirements of operations, (including necessary instruction of employees and any cases of an emergency nature) Foremen, supervisors, and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement shall not perform work which is normally done by employees, where employees are reasonably available to do such work.
3.03	The Company understands that the Union has a legitimate concern about contracting out because of its effect upon such matters as job security and job opportunity and will therefore use its best efforts to minimize the amount of production or maintenance work to be contracted out.
The Union understands that the Company has a legitimate concern about the efficiency of the operation and that sometimes it is necessary to contract work out.
Accordingly, work may be contracted out if:
(a)	it has been consistently performed by contractors in the past; or
(b)	qualified Company employees are not available in sufficient numbers to perform the work or when special skills, equipment or tools are required to perform the work; or
(c)	it is work of an emergency nature provided, however, that in the case of work of an emergency nature, the Company will, where practicable, give reasonable consideration to the use of employees who have the necessary skills to perform such work.
Some examples of work which will be contracted out are major capital projects, major construction, shaft sinking and related development, and specialized work such as stack inspection and repair.
A joint “Contracting Out Committee” will be established for the purpose of reviewing work currently contracted out and any planned contracting out of work. The Union representatives on the Committee may make recommendations which must be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in its decision making process.
The Committee will consist of the President of the Local Union or his designate, a representative of United Steelworkers of America and three members of the bargaining unit to be chosen by the Union, as well as the Manager of the Mechanical and Electrical Department and the Manager of Employee Relations or their designates and three persons chosen by the Company.
The Committee will meet as often as they deem necessary but not less than once each month.
The Company will inform the Committee as soon as possible that work of an emergency nature is being contracted out. The Company will use its best efforts to keep such work to a minimum.
The Company agrees to provide the Committee with the following
Page 4
information regarding work that is contracted out or work planned to be contracted out: location of the work; type of work to be done; crafts or occupations involved; expected duration; numbers of both contract employees and bargaining unit employees to be used. To facilitate the provision of this information, the Company agrees to provide to the Union a computerized system. This system is subject to definition, by the Committee, of the required data, the role of the data relative to this Clause 3.03, the format of transmission, and the required hardware and software.
If ongoing, sustained need for new skills, not currently available in the Company is identified, the Company will use its best efforts to train sufficient employees in such skills.
The Union and the Company agree that they will jointly examine means, including but not limited to training, to increase mine development efficiencies by Inco employees, with the intent of increasing the potential for reducing the amount of mine development work to be contracted out.
No employee will be demoted or laid off as a direct result of work being contracted out by the Company.
The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to members of the joint Contracting Out Committee.
3.04	Except with the consent of the Union, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, during the last thirty (30) days of the term of this Agreement the Company will not transfer any member of the bargaining unit to office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foreman or any position in which the individual is not an “employee” within the meaning of The Labour Relations Act.
ARTICLE 4 - UNION SECURITY
4.01	The Company shall, during the life of this Agreement, deduct as a condition of each employee's continued employment, Union dues in the amount certified by the Union to the Company to be currently in effect according to the Union Constitution, and remit the same in the week following the pay period in which such deduction is made to the Financial Secretary of the Union. The Company will, at the time of remittance, name the employees from whose pay such payment has been deducted and name the employees whose employment has terminated in the period for which payment is being made.
4.02	The said deductions shall commence, in the case of each employee who is in the employment of the Company at the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of September, 1996 and, in the case of each employee entering the employment of the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of hire if five (5) or more days are worked. In the event five (5) or more days are not worked in the month of hire, the said deductions will commence with the month following the month of hire.
4.03	Commencing March 1, 1997, the Company will on or before March 1st in each year furnish to each employee a statement of the total Union dues which have been deducted from such employee's pay cheques and remitted to the Union during the preceding calendar year.
ARTICLE 5 - NO DISCRIMINATION
5.01	The parties mutually agree that any employee of the Company may become a member of the Union if he wishes to do so, and may refrain from becoming or remaining a member of the Union if he so desires.
Page 5
5.02	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in the Union or by reason of the employee's sex, race, national origin, colour, religion, political belief, age, sexual orientation, family status, marital status, mental disability, physical handicap, or because an employee has or has not engaged in lawful union activity specifically provided for under this Agreement. The parties also agree that no employee should be subjected to sexual harassment.
5.03	The parties mutually agree that employees have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. The Company will take whatever action it deems necessary to maintain such a working environment. The action taken by the Company may include discipline and/or the termination of the employment of any person engaging in the sexual harassment of another person.
An employee may initiate a grievance alleging sexual harassment under the grievance procedure.
Where the alleged harasser is the person who would normally deal with the grievance, the complaint will automatically be advanced to the next stage of the grievance procedure.
Complaints of alleged sexual harassment will be handled with all possible confidentiality.
ARTICLE 6 - HOURS OF WORK
6.01	Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a guaranteeof work or of hours of work per day or per week.
Page 5
6.02	Time worked will be calculated in units of one-half (%) hour.
6.03	For shift work -
(a)	a day will consist of three (3) shifts to be known as the day shift, the afternoon shift and the night (or “graveyard”) shift;
(b)	a work week will commence with the day shift on Monday and end with the night shift on the following Sunday;
(c)	on continuous shift operations each employee shall be allowed thirty (30) minutes per shift to eat any meal which period shall be considered as time worked. Such meal may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.04	For work other than shift work, a work week will commence with the beginning of a day worker's hours on Monday and terminate at the same time on the following Monday.
6.05	Employees who are not regularly employed as shift workers and are working as day workers shall normally begin work at 8 a.m. However, it is recognized that in order to maintain efficient operations, certain day workers must begin work earlier or later than that hour. Day workers will be given a lunch period of one-half (%) hour per day, but such lunch period shall not be considered as time worked. The lunch may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.06	Hoisting and lowering schedules at the Company's mines will be arranged to provide approximately eight (8) hours, from collar to collar for each shift, but variations which do not occur consistently from such schedules, not exceeding ten (10) minutes, shall be disregarded. Delay time in such schedules in excess of the first ten (10) minutes shall be considered time
Page 8
worked, but not for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Agreement.
6.07	When an hourly paid employee, because of failure of the Company to inform him by notice or otherwise that no work will be available, reports for work on schedule, in good faith, and is advised that there is no work available, he shall receive four (4) hours pay at what would have been his basic rate without being required to work the said four (4) hours, but such four (4) hours shall not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of Article 7. The provisions of this Clause shall not apply when an employee has been absent from his regular work period and has failed before reporting for work to inform his Foreman or such other supervisor designated by the Company for this purpose of his intention to return.
6.08	A "call-out” shall mean a request by the Company to an employee to work any time outside such employee's regularly scheduled working hours other than time immediately following or time (not to exceed one (1) hour) immediately preceding a shift worked by such employee unless he shall have received such request at least sixteen (16) hours before such work is to commence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement an employee reporting for work on a “call-out” shall be entitled to be paid for work so performed as follows:
(a)	if the “call-out” occurs on a day other than a general holiday, or occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is within the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater;
(b)	if the “call-out” occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is outside the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at two and one-half (2 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater.
6.09	Transportation to and/or from call-out work will be provided by the Company when public transportation is not reasonably available or when in the opinion of the Company the urgency of the cal-out work so requires it.
6.10	An employee who continues working after completing his regular shift and then works more than two (2) hours overtime, shall be provided by the Company with a lunch. Should such employee work for more than five (5) hours overtime, he shall be provided by the Company with an additional lunch, which lunch or lunches may be eaten in a lunchroom.
The Company will use its best efforts to supply a hot lunch for the first lunch. The additional lunch will consist of a sandwich/beverage combination. Extended Shift Schedules
6.11	Subject to Clause 6.12, the Company and the Union mutually agree that the Company may give effect to shift schedules which alter or exceed the daily and/or weekly hours of work described elsewhere in this agreement. These schedules shall be termed Extended Shift Schedules and are defined as:
Page 9
A schedule of shifts in excess of eight (8) hours each, but not to exceed twelve (12) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period, without the payment of wages at overtime rates provided, however, that the average weekly hours worked over the cycle of the schedule of shifts will not exceed forty (40) and if it does the hours in excess of forty (40) will be paid at overtime rate. The “cycle of the schedule of shifts” means the number of weeks that pass before the schedule repeats itself, which number of weeks shall not exceed eight (8) without prior consultation with the Union.
An hourly-paid employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule pursuant to this Clause 6.11 shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of his Extended Shift Schedule hours at his basic rate in his work day, except where such excess time is worked by him due to his regularly scheduled change of shift and, where applicable shall be entitled to off-shift premium in accordance with Clause 8.04.
6.11A When an Extended Shift Schedule is planned for:
(a)	any group of employees of a Mine Department (as set out in Schedule “A” hereto); or
(b)	any group of employees of the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department working in the corresponding Departmental Working Area for a Mine Department (as set out in Schedule “A” hereto); or
(c)	any group of employees of the Utilities section of the Central Maintenance Departmental Working Area;
the Joint Problem Solving Committee shall establish, for each Department affected, a Shift Schedule Committee that shall consist of a representative of the Joint Problem Solving Committee and two (2) representatives, appointed by the Union, from among the employees affected.
When the Company plans to implement an Extended Shift Schedule, the Manager of the Department or his designate and no more than two (2) other individuals appointed by the Company shall present to the Shift Schedule Committee, and to the employees involved, information pertinent to the planned implementation.
Within one (1) calendar week of such presentation, the Shift Schedule Committee shall advise the Manager or designate of specific concerns relating to the implementation plan. The Company shall give substantial weight and careful consideration to the concerns in its decision making process.
Provisions of Clause 19.04 shall apply to the Union representatives of the Shift Schedule Committee.
6.12	For Departments or areas other than those as outlined in Clause 6.11A, where the Company wishes to give effect to Extended Shift Schedules the Joint Problem Solving Committee shall establish, for each Department affected, a Shift Schedule Committee that shall consist of a representative of the Joint Problem Solving Committee and two (2) representatives, appointed by the Union, from among the employees affected.
The Manager of the Department affected or his designate and no more than two (2) other individuals appointed by the
Page 11
Company shall present to the Shift Schedule Committee, and to the employees involved, information pertinent to the planned implementation.
Within two (2) calendar weeks of such presentation, the Shift Schedule Committee shall conduct a referendum in the workplace being considered for Extended Shift Schedules and advise the Manager or designate of specific concerns relating to the implementation plan.
Where a majority of the employees in the workplace agree and there is mutual agreement to proceed, an Extended Shift Schedule shall be implemented for a trial period of approximately one hundred and eighty (180) days. At the conclusion of such trial period the Shift Schedule Committee shall conduct a final referendum of the affected employees to determine if the Extended Shift Schedule will be continued.
Either the Company or the Union may cancel any Extended Shift Schedule implemented under this Clause 6.12 upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other. Except that with the consent of the Union, which consent shall not be unreasonably be withheld, the Company shall have additional time within which to make alternate arrangements.
Provisions of Clause 19.04 shall apply to the Union representatives of the Shift Schedule Committee.
6.13	Subject to Clause 6.01, the Company will schedule a minimum weekly average of forty (40) hours for employees working on an Extended Shift Schedule.
6.14	The Joint Problem Solving Committee will develop and through a Letter of Agreement give effect to contract language that will modify Articles and Clauses of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that are in variance with the intent of Extended Shift Schedules. For example, Clause 7.01 will be stated to be “subject to Clause 6.11". However, implementation of Extended Shift Schedules may take place in advance of such changes.
6.15	The Company will not schedule an employee to work in excess of sixteen (16) consecutive hours and will use its best efforts to minimize the occurrence of employees working in excess of sixteen (16) consecutive hours.
ARTICLE 7 - OVERTIME
7.01	An hourly-paid employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of eight (8) hours at his basic rate in his work day, except where such excess time is worked by him due to his regularly scheduled change of shift.
7.02	An hourly paid employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of forty (40) hours at his basic rate in his work week, except that:
(a) when a general holiday occurs in an hourly-paid employee's regularly scheduled work week but does not occur on such employee's regular day off such hourly-paid employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of thirty-two (32) hours at his basic rate in
Page 13
that work week, and
(b) when two general holidays occur in an hourly-paid employee's regularly scheduled work week but neither occurs on what is a regular day off for such employee, such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of twenty-four (24) hours at his basic rate in that work week.
Amounts paid to an employee pursuant to Clause 6.08 and/or Clause 7.01 shall be deducted in computing amounts payable pursuant to this Clause 7.02.
7.02A Subject to Clause 7.02 and Clause 7.06, an employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked outside his regularly scheduled work hours in any week provided that any time not worked during his regularly scheduled work hours;
i)	is due to a death in his immediate family as defined in Clause 8.09; or
ii)	is due to his service on a legally constituted jury engaged in the administration of justice; or

vi)	is due to a holiday with pay granted pursuant to Clause 14.03.
7.03	When the Company requires overtime work to be performed, other than work pursuant to a “call-out”, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the requirements and efficiency of operations, distribute such work as evenly as practicable among the employees in the working group which normally performs the work, who are qualified to perform the work, considering the availability and wishes of employees who have the necessary qualifications.
Prior to the offering of overtime the Company will make temporary promotions in accordance with Clause 15.09.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 an overtime opportunity shall be any time, except a “call-out”, outside an employee's regularly scheduled working hours regardless of the rate of pay the employee receives for working or would have received had he worked such time.
Preference in the offering of overtime will be given first to the qualified employee in the working group with the least overtime recorded, if he is readily available, and, if he is not, or if he is not contacted for any reason, preference in the offering of overtime will be given to him at the next opportunity. If any employee refuses to work overtime offered to him, he shall not receive any pay for those overtime hours but they shall be added to his record of accumulated overtime hours for the purpose of overtime distribution.
In the event of overtime work being required in a trade the work will first be offered to employees in that trade in the
Page 15
working group (which is the trade that normally performs the work) and then to employees in the required trade in the Departmental Working Area listed in Schedule “E” before being offered to other qualified employees.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 “working group” is generally defined as that group of employees reporting to a first line supervisor. However, where shift sequences or supervisory coverage requires otherwise, the employees reporting to a first line supervisor may constitute two (2) or more working groups. The Company and the Union will agree on any working groups which do not conform to this definition.
Upon request to his immediate supervisor, an employee, accompanied if he so desires by a Union Steward, may examine the record of his immediate supervisor pertaining to overtime distribution within the employee's working group.
The record pertaining to overtime distribution for each working group will be posted each month in a suitable location.
Once a month during the first year of this Agreement and once a quarter thereafter, at the request of the Union, the Manager of Employee Relations and/or other designated officials of the Company shall meet with two (2) representatives of the Union to review the records of overtime distribution. The Union shall notify the Company at least five (5) working days prior to any such meeting of the particular records to be considered thereat. The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to time lost shall apply to the two (2) representatives of the Union in attendance at such meetings.
If an employee has a complaint with respect to the record of overtime distribution which he has been unable to resolve with his supervisor and where there is mutual agreement, the parties will discuss the matter at the aforementioned meeting prior to such complaint being advanced through the grievance procedure.
7.04	Except as provided in Clause 6.08 or Clause 14.02 under the provisions of which an employee may be entitled to be paid at two and one-half (2 %) times his basic rate, no employee paid on an hourly basis shall be entitled, apart from off-shift premium and Sunday premium, to more than one and one-half (1 %) times his applicable basic rate for any hours worked by him.
7.05	Any change in an employee's regular day off schedule or shift schedule shall be posted, or an employee instructed to that effect, not later than the end of his shift on the Friday prior to the work week in which the change is to take effect.
7.06	Should an employee be instructed by the Company, during his work week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week, to change his day off or days off in that work week to another day or days in that work week, he shall be considered as having worked his normal working hours on the previously scheduled day or days at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and onehalf (1 %) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
Any change or changes to an employee's normal shift schedule at the Company's instruction given during his work
Page 17
week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week will entitle the employee to be considered as having worked an additional eight (8) hours in that work week at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
This Clause 7.06 does not apply to changes of shift schedules made to accommodate employee training.
Banking of Overtime
7.07	Each employee who works overtime has the option of receiving pay for such work at the applicable overtime rate, or banking the time worked at the applicable basic rate and receiving pay for one-half (%) of the time worked at the applicable basic rate.
Such overtime may be banked to a maximum of 24 hours at any one time, subject to Clause 7.08.
Employees who opt to bank overtime hours must take time off equal to their banked credits no later than the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the hours are banked. Unused time will then be paid.
A “quarter” means each of the three month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
Time off for banked overtime must be taken at a time mutually agreed between the employee and his supervisor, subject to Clause 13.07.
If more than one employee requests the same time off, and all such employees cannot be permitted the time requested, preference will be given to the senior employee(s), provided the time was not previously agreed to for the junior employee(s).
Banked overtime may not be used in periods of less than onehalf shift (day).
Subject to Clause 7.02A, such time off will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Article 7.
Where an employee is permitted to take time off for banked overtime the Company will deduct from the pay for such time off, if applicable, an amount equal to the employee's contribution to the Security Fund Plan and the Company shall contribute to the Security Fund Plan an amount in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in such plan.
Any employee may request pay out of overtime hours banked to his credit at any time, subject to Clause 7.08. Where an employee requests such pay out, or is otherwise paid for unused time, no contribution to the Security Fund Plan will be allowed.
7.08	Where an employee does not have sufficient vacation entitlement to cover the vacation shutdown period he (in addition to the maximum permitted under Clause 7.07) may accrue an additional amount of banked overtime to cover the shortfall in vacation days.
Such time will be taken in conjunction with the next vacation
Page 18
shutdown and, if applicable, the Company will deduct from the pay for such time an amount equal to the employee's contribution to the Security Fund Plan and the Company shall contribute to the Security Fund Plan an amount in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in such Plan.

(b)	where the number of work days of vacation so determined includes a fraction it shall be increased to the next whole number.
ARTICLE 13 - SPECIAL VACATIONS

Page 42
pay. The total number of days of Special Vacation with pay to which he is entitled shall then be thirty (30).
13.03	In determining the length of a Special Vacation a week shall mean seven (7) consecutive days including Saturdays and Sundays. Where a general holiday occurs during a Special Vacation, it shall be lengthened by one (1) work day.

When employees are to be transferred out of a department other than pursuant to Clause 15.06 and other than in reverse order of their seniority ranking, the senior employee who is to be transferred will, where practicable, be given the opportunity to acquire through training the qualification necessary to fill the vacancy that would have been created had the employees been transferred in reverse order of their seniority ranking.

The Company will provide the Union with a list of all outstanding transfer applications once a month. Once a month at the request of the Union, the Manager of Employee Relations and/or other designated officials of the Company, shall meet with representatives of the Union to review any outstanding applications for transfer.

15.17	The Company shall not be required to rehire at any time any individuals who shall fail to report for rehiring pursuant to such notice. The Company may fill any jobs available on a temporary basis pending rehiring of those having recall rights as hereinbefore set forth.
15.18	When the individual to whom such a notice has been sent is unable to report for work on the day specified in such notice by reason of sickness, then such individual shall not lose his recall rights by reason only of his failure to report for hiring pursuant to such notice if he shall have notified the Manager, Employee Relations of the Company at Thompson, Manitoba, in writing on or before the day specified in such notice of his sickness together with a satisfactory medical certificate.

Page 66
grievance under this Agreement, if the employee concerned believes that his discharge or disciplinary action is in violation of this Agreement; provided that any such discharge complaint is presented at the Second Stage of the grievance procedure contained herein not later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of such discharge.

18.03	Any Warning, Written Reprimand, Suspension or Notice of Discharge given to any employee shall be given in writing, in duplicate. Where practicable it shall be given within two (2) work days of the time when the incident giving rise to the discipline comes to the attention of the Company.

Page 68
consideration by the Company when it decides upon the disciplinary action which is applicable with respect to subsequent absences without leave by such employee.
Similarly, in any case where a period of one (1) year has elapsed since an employee last received a Written Reprimand (as distinct from a Suspension) for being absent without leave, all previous Written Reprimands (as distinct from Suspensions) for absence without leave shall be removed from the employee's record and shall not be taken into consideration by the Company when it decides upon the disciplinary action which is applicable with respect to subsequent absences without leave by such employee.
18.05	Any Written Reprimand given as a Step II, Step III or Step IV or any Notice of Discharge will, where practicable, be given to an employee in the presence of a Union Steward if the employee so requests.
ARTICLE 19 - GRIEVANCE COMMITTEEMEN AND UNION STEWARDS
19.01	The Grievance Committeemen and Union Stewards shall consist of not more than an aggregate total of one (1) for each thirty-five (35) employees, plus an additional ten (10) Stewards, or sixty (60), whichever is the greater. All Committeemen and Stewards shall be employs.

Page 69

19.05	Where an employee so requests, Union Stewards will, subject to the requirements and efficiency of operations, be allowed such time off as is reasonably required at a time to be arranged by supervision in order to assist the employee in connection with grievance or disciplinary matters which involve the employee.
In the case of underground operations arrangements will be made at each mine to permit Union Stewards to come up early or delay their descent on a pre-arranged schedule so that they may assist employees in connection with grievance or disciplinary matters which involve the employee. Where it is
Page 70
practicable other arrangements may be made by the Company.
19.06	The Parties recognize that it is most desirable that an earnest effort be made to develop and maintain a good relationship between employees and supervision.
If an employee has a complaint which he has been unable to resolve with his supervisor, a steward may attempt to resolve the complaint on behalf of the employee.
It is the further intent of the parties that issues and concerns be resolved prior to using the discipline or grievance procedures.
To accomplish this, the employee, accompanied by a Union Steward if requested by the employee or supervisor, should first attempt to resolve the above matters expediently.
Should any difference remain between the Company and any of the employees as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, an earnest effort shall be made to settle such difference without undue delay in the manner as outlined in Article 20.

Page 71
Management Representative designated by the Company from time to time to handle such matter at this stage. In making such representations, he may, if he desires, be accompanied and represented by a Union Steward who is reasonably familiar with the work on which the employee is engaged. Such meeting will, except in unusual circumstances, occur during the grievor's working hours. Any settlement of the grievance reached between the aggrieved employee and the Company at this stage will be considered applicable to the case in question and not as establishing a precedent for future cases. If within three (3) work days (excluding the regular days off of the grievor and Management Representative) from the time when such representations were presented to such Maiagement Representative a decision satisfactory to the employee is not given, then:

Page 72
as the Company may consider necessary to resolve the grievance shall accompany the Management Representative for Stage Two. The supervisor involved in the matter shall also accompany the Management Representatives if requested to do so by either the Company or the Union. Any such meeting will, except in unusual circumstances, be scheduled during the aggrieved employee's working hours and within fourteen (14) days of the date upon which it was requested. At such meeting, representations in writing shall be presented and the decision of the Management Representative for Stage One shall be considered and the Management Representative for this Stage Two shall give his decision in writing within seven (7) days from the date upon which such representations were presented to him, and if the matter is not satisfactorily disposed of, then:

Prior to setting a date for such meeting, the Company will discuss the matter with an officer of the Union to determine if the matter should be first returned with guidance to the parties involved at an earlier stage for further attempt at resolution. Such meeting will be held within seven (7) days of the date upon which such representations were presented to him. The Grievance Committee shall be represented by not more than three (3) of its members, accompanied, if so desired, by an officer of the Union and/or a representative of the United Steelworkers of America. The grievor shall also
Page 73
accompany the Grievance Committee if requested to do so by either the Company or the Union. The Company shall be represented by a Management Representative from the relevant department and a representative of the Employee Relations Department. At such meeting the written representations presented at Stage Two and the decsion of the Management Representative for Stage Two shall be considered.
Every effort will be made to give the decision in writing on behalf of the Company within seven (7) days from the date upon which such meeting is held except in the case of discharge where every effort will be made to give the decision of the Company in writing within seven (7) days from the date upon which the written notice was received by the Employee Relations Representative for Stage Three.
20.04	Saturdays, Sundays and general holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action is to be taken in each of the foregoing Stages One to Three.
20.05	Any difference arising between the Union and the Company with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, instead of following the procedure hereinbefore set out, may be submitted in writing by either of such parties to the other, with opportunity for oral discussion between the officers of the Union and the President or his designated representatives. Failing settlement, a date will be agreed upon at this meeting for a further meeting between such senior officials of the Company as the Company may designate for this purpose, and the officers of the Union, who may be accompanied by a representative of the United Steelworkers of America. In any event, the parties shall within twenty-one (21) days from the
Page 74
giving of notice as aforesaid, sign a memorandum of settlement, or, if the matter has not been satisfactorily adjusted, the party to whom the matter was submitted shall deliver to the other party a reply in writing to such submission.
20.06	Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union or any employee as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of the Agreement, or should any employee believe that his discharge is a violation of the provisions of this Agreement, and should any party desire to take advantage of the procedure provided for in this Agreement, each step in such procedure (up to and including the appointment of a Board of Arbitration) required to effect a satisfactory disposition of the matter shall be taken by such party within the time limits set forth, or the matter shall be deemed to have been abandoned, unless the time limit applicable has been extended by written agreement between the Company and the Union.
20.07	The Company will post notices for each department indicating from time to time the Management Representative for each department designated to handle matters in such department at Stage One of the grievance procedure, and, if no Management Representative shall have been designated, the matter may proceed to Stage Two.
ARTICLE 21 - ARBITRATION
21.01	Where a violation of this Agreement is alleged, or a difference between the parties to this Agreement relating to the meaning or application of the Agreement (including a difference relating to whether or not a matter upon which arbitration has been sought comes within the scope of the Agreement)
Page 75
arises, either party thereto, within fourteen (14) days from the giving of the decision of the Management Representative at Stage Three (or in the event of a difference between the Union and the Company, within fourteen (14) days from the date when the written reply to the submission was or should have been delivered) may notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the alleged violation or difference to arbitration, whereupon the Company and the Union will forthwith make a joint application to the Minister of Labour for Manitoba to have a grievance mediator appointed to assist them in resolving the alleged violation or difference.
At the end of each month all the cases which have been referred to arbitration during that month will be listed chronologically according to the time when, in the case of a grievance, the second stage meeting was held, or in the case of a Company- Union difference, the first meeting was held to discuss it, that case being listed first in which such meeting was held earliest, and then a single arbitrator shall be allocated to each case in sequence from the following panel of individuals:
Donald G. Baizley The Honorable Patrick D. Ferg Paul S. Tesky Gavin M Wood
commencing with the name following the name of the last arbitrator allocated and commencing again at the beginning of the panel after coming to the end of the panel and for the purpose of such allocation a case which has been withdrawn from arbitration shall be deemed not to have been withdrawn from arbitration. If no second stage meeting is held on a grievance, the time to be used for the chronological listing will
Page 76
be the time when notice requesting further consideration was given under this clause. If no meeting is held on a Company-Union difference, the time to be used for the chronological listing will be the time when it was submitted in writing under this clause. If in any case the arbitrator allocated is unable or unwilling to act, the individual whose name follows his in the panel shall be substituted as arbitrator in that case.
21.02	No matter shall be considered by the arbitrator nor shall he render any decision in connection therewith unless and until he has first decided that such matter constitutes a difference between the Company and the Union or the employee initiating the matter, as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of this Agreement.
21.03	Whenever the arbitrator shall have decided that a difference does come within the scope of this Agreement, or that the matter before the arbitrator constitutes a difference as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of this Agreement, then such decision shall be considered as having been preliminary only and the same arbitrator shall proceed to consider the matter in dispute with the intent and object that a multiplicity of proceedings before arbitrators shall be avoided.
21.04	In any arbitration, the written representations of the aggrieved employee or the Grievance Committee made at Stage Two and the decision of the Company at Stage Three of the grievance procedure shall be presented to the arbitrator, and the award of the arbitrator shall be confined to determining the issues therein set out.
21.05	Each party to an arbitration shall be entitled through counsel, or otherwise, to present evidence, to cross-examine the witnesses of the other party, and to present oral arguments.
Page 77
The parties recognize that in some circumstances it is desirable to have written argument but it will be up to the arbitrator to decide whether to give the parties time to file written argument in any particular case. However, neither party shall be entitled to file written argument in an arbitration where the matter in dispute is the discipline or discharge of an employee.
21.06	The finding of the arbitrator as to the facts and as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned, but in no event shall the	arbitrator alter,	modify	or amend	any	part	of this	Agreement.
21.07	Arbitrations shall be heard at Thompson, Manitoba, or at such other place as	may	be agreed	upon	by the	parties from	time	to time.
21.08	The Union and the Company shall each be responsible for one-half (%) of the expenses of and fees payable to the arbitrator. The Company and the Union agree that the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be such as he may reasonably require.
21.09	Witness fees and allowances shall be paid by the party calling the witness.
21.10	No costs of any arbitration shall be awarded to or against either party.
21.11	The decision of the arbitrator shall be given if possible within a period of fourteen (14) days after the close of arbitration proceedings in the case of a grievance respecting discharge or within a period of twentyeight (28) days after the close of
Page 78

The selection of participants will be according to seniority ranking subject to the requirements and efficiency of operations and
Page 82

Home Study
23.05	Any employee who desires to take a home study course may prior to commencing such course make application to register the course with the Company's Training Supervisor who will advise the applicant whether or not the proposed course is a
Page 85
work related course and is acceptable to the Company for that individual under the provisions of this Article. A training course in computer skills taken through an approved training or educational organization will be considered a work related course.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm our understanding with respect to the Nickel Price Bonus (Manitoba Division).
The Nickel Price Bonus will be based on the average realized price per pound of nickel, in U.S. dollars, including intermediates, published by the Company in its Quarterly Reports for periods ending March 31st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st (hereinafter called the “Average Realized Price”).
If the Average Realized Price for any Quarter in which the Company has net earnings is $2.25 U.S., each employee will receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the number of hours worked by him in that Quarter multiplied by ten cents (100) Canadian. If the Average Realized Price exceeds $2.25 U.S., the multiplier used to calculate the lump sum payment will be increased by one cent (10) Canadian for each one cent (10) U.S. by which the Average Realized Price exceeds $2.25 U.S..
All payments will be made in the second pay period following the publication of a Quarterly Report containing an Average Realized Price of $2.25 U.S. or greater.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement bdween us respecting summer employment of students.
Every effort will be made to give preference to students having a parent who is an employee.
There are instances where the Company is obliged to give special opportunity to some students for other reasons. One example of this might be a student holding a scholarship under the Inco Scholarship Program for Children of Employees. Another example would be compassionate grounds. There may be other special instances.
However, subject to the special cases that arise, Company policy will cotinue to be the giving of preference to students whose parent is an employe.
Notwithstanding the definition “probationary employee” in the Collective Agreement, every student shall be deemed to be a “probationary employee” subject to termination at any time prior to the month of October, without such termination being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.

Worker Safety Representatives will receive training and on the job experience in relation to the Company Safety Programs, the Standard St. John Ambulance certificate, The Workplace Safety and Health Act, the Occupational Exposure Monitoring Program and such other training as may be agreed upon.
A Worker Safety Representative will be paid at Job Class twenty (20), and upon completion of his term, will return to his regular job which will have been considered a Temporary Vacancy for the period of his absence.
In fulfilling his duties each Worker Safety Representative confers from time to time with the local Union President.

The duties of the Worker Safety Representatives are outlined in the agreed upon Job Description.
Upon notification by the Union given not less than one (1) week in advance to the Company that a Worker Safety Representative will be absent for a period in excess of five (5) consecutive work days, he will be replaced by the Alternate Worker Safety Representative on the first day of his absence. Failing such notification, replacement will occur after the Worker Safety Representative has been absent for five (5) consecutive work days.
The Alternate Worker Safety Representative will be selected by joint consultation between the Company and the Union and will be trained as outlined above. The Alternate Worker Safety Representative shall be paid at the rate applicable to his regular occupational classification except that for such period of time as he is replacing an absent Worker Safety Representative he will be paid at Job Class twenty (20).
The parties agree to meet periodically, but no less than once in each six (6) month period during the term of the Agreement, to discuss and evaluate the system.

Dear Sirs:
negotiations respecting the establishment of Employee Development Programs.
Union, USWA Local 6166, and the Company, INCO Limited, Manitoba Division, has resulted in this Letter of Agreement. This letter sets out terms as to how further efforts will be directed by the parties during the life of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement to establish “Employee Development Programs.” It is expected that the creation of Employee Development Programs as a means of organizing the work will improve effectiveness, flexibility and quality and it should also serve to build good jobs and create a strong Union. Employee Development Programs will also provide opportunities for employees to develop to their full potential and facilitate in fairly compensating those employees for their increased level of knowledge, skill and responsibility. The following describes the basic principles that would allow the Union to jointly proceed with the Company on this project. Basic elements of how Employee Development Programs are structured will be jointly established in another Letter of Agreement.
1.	An Employee Development Program is generally defined, in any area, as the establishment of new occupational classifications through the combination of existing occupational classifications to provide employees with
This will confirm the agreement reached during A discussion of the organization of work by the
Page 144
broader job assignment and to provide the Company with a more flexible, efficient, skilled workforce. The new occupational classifications will be evaluated to determine the appropriate pay level.
2.	All areas selected for the implementation of Employee Development Programs will be by mutual agreement of the parties (The President and Staff Rep. of the Union and the manager of Employee Relations and the Manager of the area or their designates), and contained in Letters of Agreement. The Parties agree that initially an Employee Development Program will be implemented in the Warehouse.
3.	An Employee Development Coordinator will be appointed by the President of the Local Union, from the membership of the Local Union to facilitate the identification, establishment, development and implementation of all Employee Development Programs. The Employee Development Coordinator will be located at the Local Union office and be compensated in accordance with the provisions of Clause 19.04 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, except that the basic rate for time spent attending to duties in connection with Employee Development Programs will be at Job Class twenty (20).
4.	Joint Consultation Committees will be established for each Employee Development Program. These committees will include the Employee Development Coordinator and representation from the employee affected and Management. The Company will reimburse members of this committee in accordance with the provisions of Clause 19.04.
Page 145
5.	To facilitate the successful development and implementation of any Employee Development Program it is equally important that proper training programs be established that will produce high skill, flexible employees. To that end, existing Company Trainers will consult with senior employees in each work area.
6.	The Employee Development Coordinator will work with the joint Consultation Committees and the Trainers on the development and implementation of all training programs to make sure that all training requirements of all Employee Development Programs are consistently met.
7.	There may be a need to solicit individuals who have special knowledge and those individuals will be selected by mutual agreement and the Company will bear the cost of such individuals.
8.	The parties agree to test and evaluate the S.E.S. system. If the test is mutually deemed to be successful, the parties will then implement the S.E.S. (Simple Effective Solution) job evaluation system in the Warehouse section of the Surface and Miscellaneous Department. Where it is further mutually agreed the Company will give consideration to the application of S.E.S. in other areas or departments.
9.	It is understood by both parties that there will be no participation of the Union in any Employee Development Program if there is no form of employment security or it is recognized that Union members are simply working themselves out of employment. With that in mind there will be a guarantee by the Company that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the introduction of an Employee Development Program.

Dear Sirs:
While the Company and the Union may give different emphasis to the interests of their various constituents, they share the common objective of a successful, continuing operation, functioning in an atmosphere of respect between a strong union and a strong company.
As both parties acknowledge that the ultimate determinant of employment security in the Manitoba Division is the cost of production, and as recent fundamental changes in the Division have resulted in an increased cost base, the Company and the Union commit that they will actively pursue mutually agreed upon initiatives to address this imperative.
This is an enabling document, intended to formalize the mechanism by which the Union and the employees may contribute to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Division and thus provide greater employment security, opportunity and enhanced workplace safety and health.
A joint Union/Management committee shall be established with the responsibility to achieve these objectives.
It is agreed that the broad mandate of the committee is to focus upon:
-	improved effectiveness of labour relations.
Page 157
-	the on-going management of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
-	initiatives to reduce the costs of production, better utilize the plant and equipment and increase product quality without negatively impacting employment security.
The committee shall be governed by the following terms of reference:
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.	The committee will be known as the Joint Problem Solving Committee (JPS Committee).
2.	The JPS Committee will consist of up to seven (7) members of the bargaining unit selected by the Local Union President, including the Local Union President, and up to seven (7) representatives of the Company selected by the Company, including the Manager of Employee Relations. A representative of the United Steelworkers of America may also attend JPS Committee meetings and otherwise be involved in matters dealt with by the JPS Committee. It is recognized that it is most desirable that the JPS Committee initially be comprised of the Negotiating Committees for the 1996 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	The JPS Committee will meet at least once in each month or more frequently if mutually agreed. The JPS Committee meetings will be co-chaired by the Local Union President and the Manager of Employee Relations.
4.	A member of the JPS Committee, appointed by the Local Union President following consultation with the Manager of Employee
Page 158
Relations and paid by the Company, will act in the capacity of Facilitator and Resource Person. The individual appointed to this position will be paid at Job Class twenty (20) and upon completion of his term, will return to his regular job which will have been considered a Temporary Vacancy for the period of his absence.
5.	The duties of the individual appointed to this position will include but not be limited to the following:
i)	facilitating JPS Committee meetings in conjunction with the Company facilitator;
ii)	liaising with other joint committees;
iii)	reviewing material provided by the Company concerning work to be contracted out;
iv)	developing and maintaining a working relationship with Department Heads;
v)	carrying out special projects and tasks as may be assigned from time to time by the JPS Committee.
6.	It is recognized that replacement of JPS Committee members will from time to time be necessary. In order to minimize the impact on the functioning of the JPS Committee, the parties will endeavour to keep to a minimum the number of individuals replaced on the JPS Committee at any given time.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

STATEMENT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Inco Limited, Manitoba Division and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 6166, are jointly committed to maintain a work environment that is free of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated and any person who is in breach of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action or discharge.
Inco Limited, Manitoba Division will not knowingly permit the sexual harassment of any person and will take all reasonable steps to terminate such harassment, as required under the Human Rights Code of Manitoba.
Sexual harassment is any unsolicited and unwelcome sexually oriented behaviour. It may include but is not limited to the following:
-	unwanted sexual attention of a persistent or abusive nature, made by a person who knows or ought reasonably to know that such attention is unwanted; or
-	implied or expressed promise of reward for complying with a sexually oriented request; or
-	implied or expressed threat of reprisal, in the form either of actual reprisal or the denial of opportunity, for refusal to comply with a sexually oriented request; or
-	unwelcome remarks, jokes, innuendos, propositions, or taunting about a person's body, attire, sex or sexual orientation; or
-	displaying of pornographic or sexist pictures or materials.
An individual who is being subjected to any form of sexual harassment may tell the offender that what is being said or done is offensive and ask that such behaviour stop or report the incident, at the earliest opportunity, to a union steward or committeeman, or a supervisor or other management personnel.
