between
SEFTO CANADA CORP, an indirect subsidiary of COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.
having operations at 300 North Harbour Road, Goderich, Ontario, N7A 3Y9, hereinafter referred to as the “Company”
and
THE COMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND PAPERWORKERS UNION (CEP) Local 16-0, located at Goderich, Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the “Union”.
1
i£>
ARTICLE 1 PURPOSE
1.01	a) The Company and the Union have entered
into this Agreement at Goderich, Ontario, for the purpose of recording terms and conditions of employment, resulting from collective bargaining which are to be observed by the parties hereto. It is their desire to maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees, to settle all differences in an amicable manner as herein provided, and to work together to achieve the most efficient operation of the plant and to promote the safety and health of the employees.
b) The rights, terms, and conditions of employment in this Agreement will not be modified in any manner unless mutually agreed upon by the parties. In addition, the Company shall not exercise any of its Company Rights in any manner that is in conflict with this Agreement.
1.02	There shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint, coercion, harassment, or intimidation by the Company or the Union against any hourly or salaried employee because of membership in the Union, age, race,
2
religion, colour, sex, sexual preference, marital status, ancestry, or nationality.
ARTICLE 2 SCOPE
2.01	The Company recognizes the CEP Local 16-0 and its properly appointed executive as the sole Bargaining Agent of the employees covered by this Agreement. The rights, terms and conditions of this Agreement apply to Bargaining Unit employees unless stipulated otherwise.
2.02	The following employees are excluded from the bargaining unit:
•	All	office staff including executive,
managerial, sales, engineering, laboratory, accounting, coordinator and clerical.
•	All	Supervisory employees and all
employees above the rank of supervisor.
•	Security guards to protect the property of the Company.
•	All part time and any temporary employees who have not completed the probationary period described in Clause 6.01. Such employees shall be subject to equivalent provisions to those provided by Article 5
3
(check-off) Article 13 (hours of work and overtime) Article 14 (rates of pay) Article 15 (mine holidays) and Article 18 (bereavement leave). It is understood that such employees shall be released before any regular employees are laid off and no new employees will be hired under this Clause if any regular employee is on layoff.
2.03	Supervisory employees shall not do work which is customarily performed by members of the bargaining unit. This does not apply when the supervisor is engaged in any of the following:
•	Training an employee in a manner, which does not supersede or preclude established training.
•	Conducting work of a research and development nature.
•	In emergencies, for the safety and health of employees or the protection of Company Property.
2.04	Security guards shall not do work which is customarily performed by members of the bargaining unit.
2.05	Except as provided in Clause 2.02 above, this Agreement shall not apply to probationary employees. It is understood and agreed that
4
the termination of any such employee shall be deemed to be for just cause.
2.06	The following departments are recognized:
•	Mining
•	Surface Operations
•	Surface Maintenance
•	Underground Maintenance
•	Hoisting
2.07	So far as practicable with the work force available, normal maintenance, repair and production work which has been done regularly by the Company’s own employees will continue to be done by such employees.
New construction, installation or modification of equipment, major repairs, major maintenance, major overhaul work, warranty work or other work not regularly done by the Company’s own employees may be done by outside contractors.
This Clause is not intended to restrict the Company to let contracts when it feels it necessary, economical, or expedient to do so, such as not having the necessary equipment, supervision or employees immediately available with the necessary skills or when peaks of work would require a temporary increase of the Company’s forces with subsequent layoff of such forces.
5
If it becomes necessary to contract out work as provided for above, the Company agrees to give a written notification of the reasons for such contracting out to a designated representative of the Union, prior to the work being performed. The Company will normally provide three (3) days notice for major contracts involving more than ten (10) outside workers. If time does not permit, the Company shall notify a Union official and follow with a written notice. In the notification, the Company will give the name of the contractor, the approximate number of personnel involved, the approximate duration and the job to be performed.
The Company will not cause an employee to be laid off, demoted, terminated or transferred by bringing in outside contractors to perform normal maintenance repair or production work on the plant premises.
Maintenance Contracting Out Clarification:
If it becomes necessary to contract out work and in order to obtain maintenance crew involvement for the identification and planning of work that will assist in the minimization of contracting out the Company will discuss with the Union all work that has the potential to be contracted out, prior to the work being performed. The Company agrees to give a
6
written notification of the reasons for such contracting out to a designated representative of the Union.
Under currently agreed to Overtime Guidelines the Company is committed to the use of qualified Sifto employees, from the volunteers on all Departmental overtime sign up lists ahead of having contractors carry out the required work.
Modification of equipment, major repairs, major maintenance and major overhaul work will be first offered to the Company’s own employees as per Clauses 6.05 k) and 6.09 b). Both parties understand that normal service levels must be maintained.
Jobs requiring four (4) days or less (that can include modification of equipment, major repairs, major maintenance and major overhaul work) will first be offered to available Sifto Journeymen. Shift assignments will be assigned in the following order:
•	Regular posted shift Journeyman’s normal duties.
•	Assignment of prioritized work
•	Job continuity
•	Backfilling other unplanned work
7
Supervisors will consider Journeyman’s specific job interest (as per Clause 2.08) prior to contracting out work. Contractors can be utilized so that normal service levels can be maintained.
The Company agrees to no open ended contracts.
Notification of a Maintenance Contract:
If it becomes necessary to outsource work the Union will be notified.
An e-mail will be sent to the “contracting out” distribution list. The notification will classify into two categories:
1.	Pre-note - 3 days or more advance notice
2.	Urgent - Less than 3 days notice.
The purpose of the notification of a contract is to ensure that the workplace parties are aware of what work is being contracted. In the case of the “pre-note” the Union will be allowed to suggest alternative solutions to out-sourcing.
2.08	To ensure that maintenance department employees are focused on performing maintenance and repair work related to their trade and, to ensure hoisting department work, surface operations department work and
8
underground mining department work is not being performed by maintenance department employees, the Company agrees that maintenance department employees will follow the mutually agreed to “Maintenance Employees Operating Equipment Guidelines”, unless mutually agreed upon otherwise by the parties.
Maintenance department employees will not be permitted to perform any job duties associated with the hoisting department, the surface operations department and the underground mining department. Maintenance department employees shall be permitted to utilize equipment in the performance of their core duties.
In order to consider seniority when assigning tasks, maintenance department employees will submit their specific job interests in order of priority, which will be used by the supervisor for daily job assignments, realizing that at all times their choice(s) may not transpire.
ARTICLE 3 COMPANY RIGHTS
3.01	The Union acknowledges that it is the exclusive function and right of the Company to:
9
a)	Operate and manage its business in all respects, except where any right to do so has been specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement;

The Company agrees to notify the Union of pending technological change, at the earliest practical date which will permit a meaningful discussion of the impact of the change on the operation and the workforce. Such discussion shall include the following:
•	the probable effective date;
•	the approximate number and classification of employees to be affected, if any;
•	the approximate number of jobs to be abolished and/or created, if any;
•	any change in the terms, conditions or security of employment.
It is understood and agreed that any new or significantly changed job created by the technological change will be posted in accordance with Clause 6.05.
If the technological change creates a permanent reduction in the number of employees at the operation, the reduction shall
11
be effected in accordance with the terms of Letter of Understanding #6.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #12
INTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM
The IRS (Internal Responsibility System) is a commitment of all employees to ensure a healthy and safe workplace. The commitment is internal, not relying on third party involvement for the resolution of safety concerns or compliance to regulations and standards. The IRS requires all employees at all levels of the organization to take personal ownership for their own safety, the safe performance of their assigned tasks and the resolution of safety concerns. Employees taking ownership for their own safety does not absolve management, of their legislated and moral obligation to provide a safe working environment for all employees. Creating an organizational framework for safety and promoting awareness of individual safety responsibilities can be as simple as a discussion between employees to remind themselves of a hazard or reviewing a procedure.
Keys to a successful IRS - all employees must:
•	have a sincere wish to prevent incidents
•	understand safety is an essential part of their job
•	believe causes and risks can be eliminated
•	avoid conflicts when trying to reduce risk
•	not be fearful of reprisals when using the IRS
•	understand their responsibilities under the Act
•	take steps to make it effective
198
• co-operate with others and strive to improve the process
The IRS is divided into:
1)	Direct Responsibility: All employees working along with their supervisor should deal with issues at the lowest level of the organization possible. This process starts with the worker and goes up the line to include immediate supervisors, second line supervisors, department heads, and manager.
2)	Indirect Responsibility: It provides assistance to the operations in making the appropriate decision. This includes occupational health and safety committee members, human resources, engineering, and safety department.
The “Direct” and “Indirect” responsibility will be
reviewed yearly with employees.

•	To ensure the integrity of this program, and prior to the employee’s return to work, the attending physician must provide the Company with full details of the employee’s capabilities. Workplace parties will determine what suitable and available duties are within the worker’s functional abilities that can be performed safely.
•	Employees are expected to participate in the Joint Modified Work Policy program provided for them. Work will be selected which will not aggravate their condition and will gradually return the employee back to his regular work. Efforts will be made to accommodate the worker to his regular department and shift.
•	Should an employee working in the modified work program develop discomfort or pain while performing work, he shall stop work immediately and report it to his supervisor. The workplace parties will reassess the work assigned and again determine if appropriate modified work is available. •
•	Normally, accommodation on the modified work policy is of a temporary nature, the employee
201
should be capable of returning to work in twelve (12) weeks or less, but the time limit may be extended to meet the employee’s individual healing time. Reassessments may be required by the workplace parties.
Employees returning with permanent restrictions may be permitted to work on light duty until a permanent solution is obtained. The workplace parties are responsible for determining whether a particular job that becomes available is suitable for the worker.
A written agreement on the early return to work understanding will be issued to the employee on modified work and to his immediate supervisor. Any disputes, which can not be resolved by the workplace parties, shall be directed to the Union President and Mine Manager. Only after the Union President and Mine Manager have unsuccessfully resolved the Issue, will the issue be forwarded in writing to WSIB.
