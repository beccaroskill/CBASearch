WITNESSETH:
PURPOSE & VALUES
The Hiram Walker & Sons Ltd. Plant will become the benchmark of the Distilled Spirits Industry. We the members of the Hiram Walker Plant, strive for excellence in service to our customers through the talents and commitments of our people and the use of modern processes and practices. We will establish and maintain a healthy and safe workplace that fulfils individual needs for mutual trust, personal growth, and appreciation of effort. The Hiram Walker operation will be recognized as having employees that are willing to learn, to change, and to act quickly, to maintain a leading edge position in a constantly changing and challenging market environment.
To realize our goal of becoming the benchmark of the Distilled Spirits Industry requires the combined efforts of the Company, Union and employees. Therefore, all employees (both managerial and bargaining unit) will:
•	Meaningfully participate in the decisions which affect them.
•	Work and assume all tasks for which they are qualified, subject to the collective agreement.
•	Develop and maintain a high level of technical skill.
•	Work toward the satisfaction of internal and external customers needs.
•	Promote efficiency, quality and waste reduction.
•	Support initiative, new ideas, trust, mutual respect, equitable treatment and cooperation.
•	Communicate information promptly, accurately and completely.
•	Assist in training other employees.
•	Take pride in their work and promote and adhere to the highest standards.
•	Provide support to those employees who have difficulty adapting to change
or learning new processes.
•	Willing to do any task which they are capable of performing safely and
responsibly, subject to the collective
agreement.
Both parties agree that their common objective is the desire to make the operation more effective and to enhance the job security of all employees. The parties believe that these objectives can be met through planning, monitoring and guiding departments, in their efforts to bring lasting changes to overall performance.
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, by each party, to the other in hand paid, at the ensealing of these presents, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in further consideration of the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter contained, it is mutually agreed as follows:
CLAUSE 1 - UNION RECOGNITION
(a)	The Employer hereby recognizes the Union as the sole labour organization representing the Employer's employees at its Walkerville/Windsor plant, including Pike Creek and any newly acquired plant in Essex County in the Province of Ontario, which may be operated and managed by the Employer, provided, however, that application of this clause conforms with any federal or provincial law or regulation relating to the recognition of any labour organization as the certified representatives of any employees and agrees to treat and negotiate with the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agency for and on behalf of such employees.
(b)	The term "employees" as used in this instrument shall not include foremen, persons above the rank of foremen, office and clerical staff, chemists, laboratory employees, powerhouse employees and plant guards. Assistant foremen and employees who clean plant offices, other than employees who clean non-plant offices or the reception centre, are to be included in the bargaining unit.
(c)	The Employer shall instruct its supervisory employees of the rank of foremen or higher or other employees of the Employer not covered by the bargaining unit that they shall not perform any work that is performed by or assigned to members of the Union by the Employer except for the purposes of instructing and training employees or in cases of emergency. A case shall be considered an emergency if action by the supervisory employee is necessary to avoid or to eliminate a dangerous or hazardous condition, or to avoid loss or damage to the Employer's property or equipment or to the Employer's product.
CLAUSE 2 - UNION MEMBERSHIP
(a)	All employees in this bargaining unit will be required to maintain good standing in the Union as a condition of employment with the Employer.
The Union shall be the sole judge of the good standing of its members and any employee who shall hereafter cease to be a member in good standing according to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union shall, subject to the provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, on notice to the Employer be discharged or suspended immediately, which notice shall contain the reason for expulsion or suspension.

(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
Employees subsequently hired by the Employer shall be deemed temporary employees for a trial period of ninety (90) calendar days after hiring and during such period may be released by the Employer at any time without the necessity of specifying any cause therefore. Upon the request of the Union President the Employer will discuss the reasons for such release.
If a temporary employee works for a period of less than ninety (90) calendar days and is laid off, the first period worked will apply against the ninety (90) calendar days, provided not more than one (1) year has elapsed between the date of layoff and the date he is subsequently rehired.
Such temporary employees shall during such trial period be subject to and abide by all rules and regulations of the Union and they shall pay all required dues as prescribed by the Union.
Temporary employees who are retained by the Employer after the trial period of ninety (90) calendar days shall become regular employees and shall, as a condition of employment, become members of the Union, and their seniority shall date from their date of hire but not more than one (1) year prior to the date they complete their probationary period.
Except for good and sufficient cause, the Union agrees that it will accept all future employees into the Union for the regular initiation fee and accept them into the Union as full members at the conclusion of their ninety (90) calendar days' trial period upon payment of all fees and regular dues.
Subject to the provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act all members in good standing shall continue as such provided they abide by and adhere to the Constitution and Rules and Regulations of the Union.
If any employee is expelled or suspended by the Union for good and sufficient cause, he shall upon written notice to the Employer be discharged or suspended immediately. An employee discharged by the Employer for any cause shall be paid off as soon as possible thereafter. Any employee suspended shall retain and accumulate seniority.
(i)	Notwithstanding any provision in Clause 2 above, students may be hired for a period not to exceed one hundred & twenty (120) calendar days in a calendar year, within a window period of May 1 to August 31.
Such students shall be paid the basic hourly rate as specified herein, but shall not accrue seniority nor be eligible for any Company benefits under the Collective Agreement. Students shall, as a condition of employment, pay Union dues each month. Once the requirement for a student has ended, his/her employment will terminate.
(ii)	Preference in hiring will be given to students who are dependants of Local 2027 bargaining unit employees or dependents of Local 2027 retirees.
6
A Student shall be defined as someone who has:
(a)	Successfully completed their first year of university or community college; and
(b)	Provides proof of enrolment on a full-time basis for the upcoming school semester; and
(c)	Attained 18 years of age.
(iii)	The number of students hired will not exceed ten percent (10%) of the active workforce.
(iv)	Local 2027 employees with seniority will not be laid off in any calendar year during which students have been utilized or probationary employees have been hired during the May 1 to August 31 window period.
(v)	Students will not be utilized while seniority employees are on lay off.
(vi)	A student cannot be hired for more than four (4) summer periods.
CLAUSE 3 - UNION DUES
(a)	Upon written authorization by the employee, the Employer agrees to deduct from the last pay cheque of each employee in each calendar month such sum as from time to time may be authorized by the Union from all of its members for regular monthly dues and initiation fees and assessments duly authorized by the Constitution and By-Laws of the Local and National Union and the labour agreement between the Union and the Employer, and deliver the total amount so deducted to such person as the Union shall designate to receive and receipt for such money in the form of a cheque payable to the Union not later than the seventh (7) working day of the following month.
An employee who has and/or was made available forty (40) hours of work in a calendar month or received benefits in lieu of work equivalent to forty (40) hours pay within any calendar month shall be required to pay regular monthly dues.
Benefits in lieu of work shall include the following: SUB Supplemental Unemployment Benefits, vacation pay, holiday pay, Jury duty pay, bereavement pay and paid absence allowance, but shall not include Pension benefits, sick and accident benefits and Workplace Safety & Insurance benefits.
An employee receiving Supplemental Unemployment benefits equal to or greater than fifty (50) per cent of his/her gross pay for a forty hour week, less statutory deductions, within any calendar month, shall pay dues equal to one (1) hour straight time pay per month.
(b)	The Employee authorization for such deductions shall be on a form to be approved by the Employer and shall not be revocable by the employee during the term of this agreement, except for assessments which shall be for a specific period of time. The Employer assumes no responsibility for obtaining the execution of such authorization forms from employees. (Appendix No. 1).
7
(c)	Notice from the Union of any change in regular initiation fees, regular dues, or assessments as stated in (a) above shall be given in writing, signed by proper officers of the Union, to the Employer not less than thirty (30) calendar days before such contemplated change is to become effective.
CLAUSE 4 - UNION ACTIVITY
(a)	There shall be no coercion, restraint, or discrimination by the Employer or any of its agents against any members of the Union because of membership therein, or the carrying on of any proper union activity.
(i)	The company shall provide the Union with eight (8) bulletin boards (i.e. 2 in Finished Goods, 1 in Grain Elevator, 1 in Manufacturing, 1 in Drain & Fill, 1 in Blending and 2 in Pike Creek) to be placed in locations suitable to the Company and solely for the purpose of posting Union matters. All posted material must be pre-approved by the Industrial Relations Department.
(ii)	The Company shall provide (including maintenance of) four pagers to the Union. The Company shall provide a yearly reimbursement of $400.00 for associated wireless service charges to the Union.
CLAUSE 5 - UNION REPRESENTATION
(a)	Each department shall be represented by a Union Steward or other Union representative certified as such by the Secretary of the Union, who shall be recognized by the Employer. The Union shall keep the Employer informed as to the names, departments, current mailing addresses and home telephone numbers of all such representatives.
(b)	Both parties recognize that all employees, including Union representatives, have regular duties to perform for the Employer. Both parties recognize that meetings will not be held on the Employer's time for wholly Union matters. Union representatives after arrangements with and permission from the foreman, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be allowed during their working hours, without loss of time or pay, to leave their regular duties within thirty (30) minutes for a reasonable length of time to investigate, adjust, write and present grievances or complaints within the area(s) they respectively represent, subject to the fact that this procedure shall not be abused by either party. The Union representative is to be advised when he is being requested by an employee. If a Union representative is required to leave his own department for Union business, he shall also be required to obtain the permission of a member of the Industrial Relations Department; or in their absence, permission may be obtained from the representative's immediate foreman.
If there is a dispute pertaining to abuse of this procedure by either party, discussions shall be held and if no agreement is reached, the matter shall be subject to grievance and arbitration procedures.
8
(c)	Union representatives up to four (4) in number shall be allowed reasonable time without loss of pay to attend meetings with Management or meetings mutually called by both parties. The Company shall recognize two skilled trade representatives (Bottling & Central Maintenance), one of which shall be included in the aforementioned "four (4) in number.”
The Company and Union will meet monthly or at such greater or lesser intervals as may be agreed to by the parties for the purpose of discussing grievances, complaints and matters of mutual concern. The Company further agrees to hold other meetings to deal with important issues such as suspensions and discharges at mutually agreeable times.
One union representative (eg. union president) shall be permitted to join the company representative during the "New Hire Orientation" process. Such union representative shall be compensated at their regular rate should the orientation be conducted during regular working hours or compensated in accordance with the collective agreement, if such orientation is conducted outside of regular working hours.
The union shall appoint one representative from each trade. Should a jurisdictional/demarcation dispute arise over work assigned to Local 2027, one trade representative from each of the trades involved will meet with a management representative for the purpose of resolving said dispute.
(d)	Representatives of the National Union may attend meetings between the Industrial Relations Manager and the Grievance Committee. Such representatives may visit the plant during normal business hours to investigate pending grievances. All visits shall be of a reasonable duration. It is understood that permission must be obtained from the Industrial Relations Manager or his designate prior to such representative entering the plant. It is further understood that such representatives shall be subject to all plant rules and regulations while on the Employer's premises.
(e)	The company will pay six (6) members of the Union Committee for straight time lost from scheduled work as a result of attending negotiating sessions with Company representatives during the negotiations of the Collective Agreement between the parties. Such pay will be at the employees’ regular straight time rate.
CLAUSE 6 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Employer shall have full authority in the operation of all branches of its business, including the right to employ any person it may see fit, to maintain discipline and enforce reasonable employment rules, and to discharge or suspend any employee who is in any way unsatisfactory to it; provided, however, it shall not discriminate against any member of the Union for a proper union activity nor shall this clause be interpreted to invalidate other portions of this contract. Upon request of the Union, the Employer shall advise the Union President (or his designate) upon request the reason(s) for any discharge or suspension.
9
CLAUSE 7 - WORKING SCHEDULE
(i)	The working schedule for all employees shall consist of not more than forty (40) hours per week divided into not more than eight (8) hours per day, Monday through Friday, except in the manufacturing departments including manufacturing maintenance where the schedule calls for Monday through Saturday operation.
(ii)	Notwithstanding 7(i), should the Employer require a 7 day/21 shift operation, the Company and the Union will meet to determine a pattern of work schedules equitable to both parties. Alternatively, at the Union’s request, the Company will implement a 7/day/12 hour/day shift schedule provided the Company incurs no penalties or additional cost. Hours worked on a Saturday or Sunday will be maintained at current Premium pay.
It is understood that the Company will only implement a 7 day /21 shift operation when projected yearly requirements exceed what can be produced on a 5 day work schedule. This schedule will not be used to accelerate production to enable a distillery shutdown. If a 7 day /21 shift operation is implemented in Manufacturing during the term of this agreement and then is subsequently discontinued, Clause 14b(ii) (90 day recall) can not be utilized for a period of 6 months from the date the 7 day /21 shift operation ceased. The aforementioned does not apply when the discontinuance of the 7 day /21 shift operation is due to a major maintenance or capital installation in the Manufacturing Division.
(iii)	The Employer agrees to post the various working schedules in appropriate locations within the plant by the preceding Wednesday of each week. The Employer will give at least seven (7) calendar days notice of its intent to change an employee’s schedule, except in the case of emergency.
An employee’s regular day shift schedule shall commence between the hours of 6:00 am and 9:00 am.
CLAUSE 8 - OVERTIME
(a)	(i) All time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period
beginning with the starting time of employees' regular scheduled shifts, or forty (40) hours in any one week, shall be deemed to be overtime and shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half. It is understood that eight (8) hours in such twenty-four (24) hour period will be paid at straight time if worked. This overtime rate does not apply in the case of mutual arrangement between employees and the Employer on exchange of shifts, upon the request for such exchanges by employees. When shift workers are required to work overtime, the shift premium shall be added to the regular rate of pay and the overtime rate applied to the total thereof. The employee's shift as outlined in clause 21(h) and (j) shall determine the amount of shift premium applicable on overtime. In determining overtime compensation, employees shall receive credit for a regular work schedule on a holiday.
10
(ii)
All hours worked or refused by an employee prior to and/or after an employee's regular scheduled shift, shall be deemed overtime and charged as such.
(iii)	All hours worked on a Saturday in excess of 8 overtime hours will be compensated at the rate of double time the employee's regular rate.
(b)	For Saturday work and work on a scheduled day off, the Employer shall pay all employees at the rate of time and one-half their regular rate and for Sunday work at the rate of double time their regular rate.
(c)	(i) Subject to (c)(ii), an employee's Monday through Friday shift shall determine the
shift he/she is eligible to work when overtime is required on more than one shift on either Saturday or Sunday.
(ii)	When weekend overtime is required on one shift only, that overtime will be offered in turn regardless of the employee's Monday through Friday shift.
(iii)	Scheduled "shift rotation” will not be changed for the purpose of equalizing overtime.
(d)	Any overtime required in any department or classification shall be performed by employees of such department or classification if help is available. Overtime work will be equalized as far as possible. No employee on restrictions will be bypassed while overtime is being offered provided they have the capability to perform the required overtime work and such work falls within their restrictions.
(e)	Overtime work will be voluntary on the part of each employee and no employee will be disciplined for refusal to work overtime if someone else is available to do the work. The Employer may assign needed employees to work overtime in inverse order of seniority, with the understanding that an employee will not be assigned to work more than twelve (12) hours of overtime in a given week.
(f)	It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Employer is to equalize overtime as far as possible among its employees as herein set out.
The Union understands that the Employer may on occasion make an honest error in selecting employees from the equalization lists for overtime work and agrees that, provided the Employer assigns at least an equal amount of overtime work he would not have otherwise been offered to employees passed by through honest error within ten (10) calendar days or pays the overtime missed by the improper assignment, such honest error will not be cause for grievance. Any overtime hours compensated pursuant to this, paragraph shall be charged as such.
(g)	Overtime will be distributed equally as far as possible according to department and classification.
(1) An employee's classification, for the purpose of recording overtime, will be that classification which he or she holds (either permanent or temporary).
11
(2)	Anyone temporarily assigned or on loan to a classification shall not receive overtime in that classification until all regular classified employees have been asked. All overtime hours worked in the classification will be charged against the employee's classification which he or she holds (either permanent or temporary).
(3)	An Employee temporarily assigned or on loan to a classification who is not required to work overtime in such classification shall be eligible to work overtime in his/her permanent classification provided that all employees in his/her permanent classification within his/her permanent department have been offered the overtime.
(4)	Any employee on official union business in the event overtime occurs is not available and cannot be charged.
(5)	A newly hired employee will be credited with the highest number of overtime hours in the classification and department to which he/she is initially assigned.
(6)	For overtime purposes Students will be maintained on an overtime list separate from all other employees. Students will only work overtime after exhausting all regular employees.
(h)	When employees:
(1)	Transfer into a department as general help, or
(2)	Qualify in a classification, they will be charged with the greater of the average recorded overtime in their new classification within that department or with the number of overtime hours carried over from their previous department or classification. From that date, they will be offered overtime in their turn.
(i)	Overtime of one hour or less need not be offered in rotation. Overtime in excess of one hour will be offered to employees with the least recorded overtime within the classification as far as possible and according to seniority when the overtime hours are equal. All overtime will be recorded.
(j)	For the purpose of recording overtime, the employee will be charged with the number of hours' pay involved at the regular hourly rate, e.g. eight (8) hours worked at one and one-half times the regular rate would be charged as twelve (12) hours' overtime. All overtime paid at one and one-half or double time will be charged as such. All hours refused by an employee will be charged as if they had worked.
(k)	(i) Many departments have developed their own procedures regarding ordering
meals and arranging for meal breaks and recesses. These current practices will be continued.
(ii) Employees required to work overtime in excess of one hour will receive a fifteen (15) minute break period at the conclusion of their regular work schedule. A fifteen (15) minute break period will be allowed at the conclusion of each two (2) hours of overtime.
12
(l)	Employees returning to work or to the classification to which they return after a leave of absence, suspension, layoff, job posting, or transfer, or loan in excess of two (2) weeks will be charged with the average recorded overtime in their classification if their recorded overtime hours are less than the average overtime hours in such classification and if overtime has been worked during their absence.
(m)	An employee who will be absent from work during a week, due to vacation or approved leave of absence, and who wishes to make himself available in the event weekend overtime occurs (i.e. willing to work on both the Saturday and Sunday) must do so by completing a form supplied by the Company for that purpose. Such form must be submitted in person to the employee's supervisor prior to commencement of such vacation or approved leave of absence.
(n)	Employees having their restrictions removed or employees absent in excess of one week because of illness, injury, Jury Duty, or employees returning to work from a leave of absence for union business in excess of thirty (30) days will be charged with the lowest recorded overtime of an employee currently working in their classification provided their recorded overtime hours are less than the lowest in the classification and if overtime has been worked during their absence.
(o)	Department overtime lists showing classification, employee's name, seniority and number of overtime hours worked by each employee will be posted the day following each time overtime is worked in a place accessible to the view of employees.
(p)	Section A of this procedure covers departments which require supplementary procedures to cover specific problems, and such supplementary procedures shall prevail if there is a conflict with the overtime procedure outlined herein.
(q)	Section B of this procedure will cover such incidental matters as method of recording, notice to stewards, etc.
SECTION A
1.	If due to the absence of an employee overtime is necessary, in general it will be given to the classification in which it occurs until such time as a new schedule can be drawn up. In all instances, equalizing of overtime will be given consideration.
2.	Overtime not in any definite classification will be offered to that employee in the department who has the least overtime or according to seniority when the overtime hours are equal, providing the employee is physically able and has the ability to do the job.
If the overtime referenced above pertains to the type of work normally performed by General Help during the day shift, this overtime will be offered to the eligible General Help employee. This would be overtime (eg. cleanup), following the General Help employees eight (8) hour day shift; overtime which heretofore would have been performed by an operator.
3.	Overtime in excess of one hour will be given to the operator already on duty when such
13
overtime occurs on a regular operating shift due to the unexpected absence of the relief operator.
4.	To be available for scheduled overtime, an employee normally must have eight consecutive hours off shift, both prior to working the overtime and before commencing his next scheduled shift.
5.	Unexpected overtime will be performed by the employees available at work when the overtime develops e.g. overtime required to complete the evaporator boil-out will be considered unexpected overtime.
6.	Eight hours overtime would not normally be split between two shifts, i.e. twelve hours each, unless in case of emergency due to illness, or other reasons such as lack of a suitable operator. Sixteen-hour shifts, for the purpose of equalizing overtime, will be avoided at all times.
7.	For extraordinary cleanup, which is primarily operator's work, but where a knowledge of the equipment is desirable in the interests of safety to personnel and equipment, e.g. such as drilling tubes in the evaporators, or scraping tubes in the dryers, an operator from the classification directly involved would work, provided he is deemed not required to operate. The balance of the help would be drawn from general help by the regular procedure.
EMPLOYEES ON LOAN
a)	Subject to (g) (4) and Section A of Clause 8, employees on loan to other departments are eligible to work any overtime connected with their daily assignment.
b)	When plant departments have insufficient help available to perform their required overtime work, after asking all employees within,
1)	classification
2)	department
3)	additional overtime help will come from other plant departments. Overtime is offered in turn to the employees with the least recorded overtime in the department from which the help is requested.
BOTTLING MAINTENANCE
1.	On some jobs where training or experience is required, overtime personnel selection may not follow rotation.
2.	Personnel are allowed to finish a job on overtime which they have started on their regular shift (when and where necessary at supervisor's discretion), regardless of overtime position.
CENTRAL MAINTENANCE
14
Overtime will be offered as equally as possible considering the individual abilities and qualifications of the tradesmen involved and the requirements of the job.
Overtime will be posted forty-eight hours ahead of time whenever practicable within the Central Maintenance Department.
SECTION B
1. At the beginning of each calendar year, the employee with the lowest recorded overtime hours within a classification or department shall be recorded as having zero hours on the overtime list and the remaining employees in the classification or department shall have their recorded overtime hours adjusted accordingly.
e.g.	Dec. 31/77	Jan. 1/78
Ray Reid........ 39 hrs.	6	1/2 hrs.
John Jones......	37 hrs.	4	1/2 hrs.
Sam Smith.......	32 1/2 hrs.	0	hrs.
2.	The Company will notify affected employees of required overtime on the Thursday preceding the weekend in which the overtime is to be worked. However, it is understood that equipment failure, material delivery shortages, quality problems as well as unforeseen or emergency demand for product may necessitate providing notice of overtime later in the week. In these instances and other emergency situations, notice will be given within the first four (4) hours of the shift on Friday for weekend overtime. The Company will consider an occasional request from an employee who wishes to be excused from such mandatory overtime for a legitimate personal reason.
Cancellation of any scheduled overtime will be provided as far in advance as possible. An employee who has accepted a daily overtime assignment for a duration of two (2) hours of work or more will be guaranteed a minimum of two (2) hours of overtime work.
3.	Area reps and stewards will be given written notice of all overtime worked, or refused within their department on the working day following working of the overtime.
4.	Subject to paragraph #5 overtime hours worked or refused by an employee (providing an employee would have received overtime rates) will be charged against his or her recorded overtime hours.
5.	Hours worked by an "employee” - reporting to work as a result of an "Emergency Call In” - shall not be charged. Employees refusing the "Emergency Call In" will have the hours charged against recorded overtime hours.

Employees of the Trades Departments shall not be eligible for any openings in the plant or seniority rights outside the Trades Departments. In the case of shortage of work within the Trades Departments, any transfer within the Trades Departments will be according to inverse order of trade seniority, considering also ability for the job. Layoff will, in all cases, be in inverse order of trade seniority, considering also, ability for the job (subject to Clause 14 (c).
Note: The intent is that Trades personnel will not be eligible to perform production work and production workers will not be eligible to perform trades work.
Employees from other plant departments who successfully bid and qualify on a Trades Department job classification shall have their trade seniority start thirty (30) calendar days prior to their date of qualification.
30
(f)	The movement of an employee from one department to another shall not affect such employee's basic seniority as an employee of the Employer.
(g)	LOSS OF SENIORITY
An employee shall forfeit all seniority rights for the following reasons:
(i)	Discharge for proper cause (subject to Clause 16).
(ii)	Quitting (voluntarily leaving the employ of the Employer).
(iii)	Failure to report for work on the workday following termination of a leave of absence or extension thereof (subject to (iv)).
(iv)	Failure to report for work for five (5) successive working days without notifying the Employer. When this condition exists, the Employer undertakes to so advise the appropriate area representative at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the end of the fifth workday, so as to afford the Union the opportunity to advise such employee or employees of their obligation to the Employer in this regard.
(v)	Failure to report for work within seven (7) calendar days after recall, subject to Section (d) of this Clause (Recalls).
(vi)	For Employees whose seniority date is on or after January 1, 1978, layoff in excess of their recall rights as established by the following scale:
-	Employee with seniority of 2 years or less - recall rights equal 2 years
-	Employees with seniority over 2 years and up to 10 years - recall rights equal 4 years
-	Employees with seniority over 10 years - recall rights equal 5 years
Before any employee is discharged, or when an employee loses his seniority for any of the other foregoing reasons, the Union President and/or Vice-President will be notified.
(h)	Where more than one shift may be required the employer will favour senior qualified employees in their initial shift selection whenever possible. Thereafter and in so far as it may be practicable employees will rotate through shifts. Employees in the same classification may switch shifts subject to their supervisor’s approval. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(j) SENIORITY LIST
The Employer will supply the Union with an updated seniority list every April and October.
CLAUSE 15 - LETTERS OF REPRIMAND
31
The Company agrees that it will not take into consideration letters of reprimand on the record of any employee for any purpose after fifteen (15) months from the date of such letter.
When disciplinary action is taken against an employee, he shall be advised in writing. As such, an incident which has not been confirmed in writing to the employee as disciplinary action can not be relied upon by the Company as constituting disciplinary action.
CLAUSE 16 - DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINE
An employee who feels that he or she has been unjustly discharged or suspended may enter a grievance at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure within five (5) business days after the discharge or suspension becomes effective. If the employee does not file such grievance within the five (5) business days prescribed, the matter shall not be entitled to consideration. This clause does not apply to temporary employees. Before an employee is discharged or when an employee is suspended, the Steward in his department or, if unavailable an appropriate Union official will be notified. An employee discharged by the Employer for any cause shall be paid off as soon as possible thereafter. Any employee suspended shall retain and accumulate seniority.
When Management is contemplating disciplinary action after the normal working hours, the following Local 2027 officers are to be contacted:
1.	The initial person to be contacted is the Steward of the department where the incident occurred.
2.	In the event it is impossible to contact the Steward, the Area Representative of the
department should be notified.
3.	If both the Steward and the Area Representative are not available, the Grievance Chairman is responsible for the handling of the action.
4.	Should the Company request a Union Representative to report to work after normal working hours, the Company will compensate that Union Representative in accordance with Clause 22(b).
CLAUSE 17 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(a)	In the event that any employee or group of employees considers that he has a complaint which might result in a grievance or if either party shall be of the opinion that any provision of this agreement has been or is being violated, an earnest effort shall be made by the Union and the Employer to adjust such complaint as quickly as possible in the following manner and in accordance with the agreed upon procedure as set out in
32
section (f) of this clause:
Note: It is understood by both parties that any resolution of a grievance at Step One shall not establish a precedent for future cases and shall not be relied on by either party in the handling of any other matter.
STEP 1. Before a written grievance is filed, an earnest effort will be made by the employee jointly with his Steward and his foreman to settle the complaint by discussion at a place and time mutually convenient.
STEP 2. If such discussion fails to settle the complaint, then the employee having a grievance against the Employer shall have same presented in writing, on forms provided to the Grievance Chairman by the Employer, to the Steward of the department within five (5) business days after occurrence of the alleged cause for grievance. Otherwise, unless there is a reasonable excuse, such grievance may not be heard or considered by the Employer or the Union. The written grievance shall first be presented by the Steward representing the aggrieved employee to the appropriate Divisional Superintendent with a copy of the grievance to the Industrial Relations Manager. The Employer will answer the Grievance within five (5) working days from receipt of the grievance, unless the time is mutually extended by the Employer and the Union.
STEP 3. In the event that this procedure fails to produce a satisfactory settlement within five (5) business days, the matter shall be referred by the chairman of the Grievance Committee of the Union to the Industrial Relations Manager with copies of the appeal to the appropriate Divisional Superintendent.
A grievance will not be denied at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure until the Industrial Relations Manager or his designate and the grievance committee have met to discuss the matter.
(b)	In the event that the last named procedure fails to produce a satisfactory settlement within five (5) business days, which period may be extended by mutual consent for the purposes of completing investigations by both parties, or seeking additional assistance and joint discussions of the grievance, it shall then be submitted to arbitration.
(c)	It is agreed that any grievance referred to arbitration shall be ruled on by a single arbitrator selected by agreement between the Company and the Union. If the parties are unable to select an arbitrator within thirty (30) calendar days of any first meeting held for such purpose, the matter may be referred to the Minister of Labour of the Province of Ontario, or the Arbitration Commission for the appointment of an arbitrator.
(d)	The decision of the arbitrator shall be rendered within thirty (30) calendar days and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties involved, and shall conclusively determine the matter. The arbitrator shall in respect of a grievance involving suspension or discharge of an employee be entitled to modify or set aside such penalty if in his opinion it is just and equitable to so do, and to determine also the question of back pay or compensation, if any, due any employee. Any expense involved in arbitration shall be shared equally by the Employer and the Union.
33
(e)	The President or Vice-President of the Union may submit a policy grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
(f)	The following procedure is subject to Clause 5 and other provisions of this clause and is meant to detail the general manner in which complaints and grievances are to be handled. It is subject to amendment by mutual consent as conditions warrant.
It is agreed that maximum effort will be expended by both parties in resolving complaints at Step 1 of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, the foreman of the complaining employee will arrange for the Steward to meet with such employee to investigate the complaint. If the Steward or the foreman request, a meeting will be arranged for joint discussion between the complaining employee, the Steward and the foreman. If this discussion does not resolve the problem, the Area Representative and the appropriate Department Head may be called in to the discussion. If there is still no resolution of the problem, the complaint goes into the form of a formal written grievance at Step 2.
At Step 2, the Divisional Superintendent and the Grievance Chairman may arrange meetings to discuss the problem. At these meetings, any person who could add to the possible solution of the problem may be requested to attend and contribute.
At Step 3, the matter is in the hands of the Industrial Relations Manager and the Grievance Committee and every effort will be made to resolve the problem short of arbitration.
The above procedure is not intended to deprive either party from seeking any additional assistance they may require at any step in the procedure.
(g)	Neither the National Union nor the Local Union shall call or authorize, and no officer, official or agent of the National or Local Union shall counsel, procure, support or encourage a strike, sit-down strike, slow strike, boycott, jurisdictional strike, sympathetic strike, cessation of work or any other stoppage of work during the life of this contract or extension thereof. The Employer shall not engage in any lockout during the life of this contract or extension thereof.
In the event any employee or group of employees covered by this contract shall, during the life of this contract or extension thereof, participate in any strike, sit-down strike, slow strike, boycott, jurisdictional strike, sympathetic strike, cessation of work or any other stoppage of work, upon the request of the Employer, both the National and the Local Union and their officers and agents shall immediately direct such employees or group of employees to resume work. Any employee or group of employees who participate in the above types of strike activity shall be subject to immediate discharge or such other discipline as the Employer may impose.
If the National Union and the Local Union fulfil the obligations under this clause, they shall not be sued for damage arising out of the above stated actions of any employee or group of employees covered by this contract.
34
In the event of any strike, employees of the Employer not engaged therein, and particularly Powerhouse employees and the Plant Police, shall be permitted free access to the Employer's premises for plant maintenance and plant protection.
(h)	GRIEVANCE COMMISSIONER: As an alternative to the regular arbitration procedure (clause 17(a) through (g)) the parties shall have the option of mutually agreeing to refer a Step Three grievance to a Grievance commissioner. The selection of the commissioner shall also be by mutual agreement between the Union and the Company.
The decision of the Grievance Commissioner shall only be applicable in the case in question and shall not constitute a precedent nor be used by either party as a precedent in future cases. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement, the decision of the Grievance Commissioner shall:
(i)	be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement
(ii)	be confined to the grievance referred to him.
It is agreed that a grievance relating to Clause 1 (c) of this Agreement will be referred to a Grievance Commissioner herein provided rather than an Arbitrator pursuant to Clause 17 (c) of the Agreement.
CLAUSE 18 - NO PYRAMIDING
(a)	Hours worked by an employee in any work week on which overtime or premium rates have once been allowed shall not be used again in any other overtime computation with the exception of hours worked on a holiday.
(b)	Overtime shall be paid on a weekly or daily basis, whichever is greater but not for both.
(c)	Overtime or premium rates may not be pyramided on any given day of work; if, for example, weekly overtime, daily overtime, holiday premium pay, and Saturday or Sunday premium pay occur on the same day, the employee shall receive only one such overtime or premium rate on a given day, whichever is higher.
(d)	A holiday that occurs on any day, Monday through Friday, and is not worked, but which the employee would have worked had it not been for such holiday, and for which the employee is eligible to receive holiday pay, shall be counted as a day worked for the purpose of computing weekly overtime for hours actually worked. In no event will the holiday, if not worked, be paid for at other than the regular rate.
CLAUSE 19 - RECESS PERIODS
Employees in certain departments now receive a recess of 15 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the afternoon. This practice will be continued but not extended.
The Company shall not reschedule lunch and recess periods to excess.
35
Employees will receive a recess of fifteen (15) minutes in the first four (4) hours of their shift and a recess of ten (10) minutes in the second four (4) hours of their shift, excluding employees who are deemed to be Bottling direct labour (that is those production employees who continuously work directly on an automated bottling line), who will receive one fifteen (15) minute break and one ten (10) minute break in both the first four (4) hours and the second four (4) hours of their shifts. Tag relief will be utilized in this area whereby Bottling Utility Operators will relieve Bottling Utility Operators and General Help will relieve General Help positions requiring relief.

(a)	The "Hire-In” rate for new employees (excluding tradesman) shall be as follows:
-	85%	of "job rate” for first 52 weeks worked
-	90%	of "job rate” for next 26 weeks worked

When CPI changes would result in a decrease in the total COLA payable, it is agreed and understood that the total COLA payable will be maintained at the level in effect prior to the decrease in CPI in exchange for future offsets. These offsets will take the form of postponing any new COLA generated until such time that the CPI used for an adjustment date exceeds the CPI that generated the last positive COLA payment.
The cost-of-living allowance will be established in accordance with changes in the official Consumer Price Index published by Statistics Canada (1992=100) and hereinafter referred to as the Consumer Price Index, which was 133.4 as of June 2007 (May 2007).

(e)	The continuance of the cost-of-living allowance shall be contingent upon the availability of the official monthly Statistics Canada Consumers Price Index in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the Index published June 2007, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. In the event the form or basis of the Index is changed, the parties agree to request said Statistics Canada to continue to furnish, for the term of this agreement, the Index in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the Index published June 2007.

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
The Company agrees that the following is the procedure for the APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM in conjunction with the Ontario Department of Labour to provide the Company with a source of qualified trades people. The need for the number of apprentices will be reassessed by Management periodically as vacancies occur in the trades classification.
REGISTRATION
All apprentices will be registered with the Ontario Department of Labour and the Ontario Training Adjustment Board. All apprentices will sign a written Apprenticeship Agreement with the Company.
APPLICATION
a)	Notice of apprenticeship openings will be posted on the Company's Bulletin Board.
b)	Applications for apprenticeship will be accepted by the Human Resource Department from seniority "production" employees who consider themselves eligible under this program of training.
SELECTION
Selection of a candidate will be at the sole discretion of the Employer with consideration given to:
1)	Grade 12 or equivalent	- all	Ontario academic credits.
2)	Mechanical Aptitude Test Results.
3)	Previous experience.
4)	Interview results.
SENIORITY
a) Apprentice will be on a 3-month probationary period. If during the 3-month probationary period, a person for one reason or another can not continue on the Apprenticeship Program, they will return to their former job classification. However, once beyond the 3-month period and training is relinquished, then the
68
person will be reassigned to General Help in the Bottling Department.
b) Upon satisfactory completion of the Apprenticeship Program, the apprentice will obtain skilled trades seniority as of the starting date of the apprenticeship, minus any time spent on layoff or in production due to exercising transfer rights in lieu of layoff. Accumulation of production seniority is frozen and excludes time served in apprenticeship.
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE
Apprentices will be required to attend classes for related instructions outside of their regular working hours. Classes will be held by St. Clair College. The Employer will pay for required books and applicable tuition fees (if any) for approved required courses.
CREDIT FOR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
Credit for previous related experience in an apprentice training program, or a skilled trade in any plant, may be given up to the time required on any phase of the apprentice shop training or related training schedules. Credit for such previous experience shall be given the apprentice at the time he/she has satisfactorily demonstrated that he/she possesses such previous experience and is able to do the job. Related training credit shall be given the apprentice at the time that he/she is requesting credit under the related training schedule. At the time such credit is given, the apprentice's wage rate shall be correspondingly adjusted within the apprentice rate schedule based on the amount of credit given toward completion of the shop training schedule.
TRAINING RECORDS
Progress reports and records will be reviewed periodically by the Company's Training Officer, Maintenance Supervisor and Union's Skilled Trades Representative.
DISCIPLINE
The Employer, after consultation with the Union's Skilled Trades Representative, shall have the authority to discipline an apprentice and to cancel the apprenticeship agreement of the apprentice at any time for cause pertaining to his apprenticeship such as:
a)	Inability to learn
b)	Unsatisfactory work
c)	Lack of interest in his/her work or	education
This shall not limit the right of the Company to discipline an apprentice for cause for matters not related to his/her training as an apprentice. Such discipline by the Company shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
APPRENTICES - WAGE RATES
69
Apprentices in each of the Trades covered shall be paid a progressively increasing schedule of wages as follows:
1st 1000 hours not less than 65% of the Maintenance person's rate 2nd 1000 hours not less than 70% of the Maintenance person's rate 3rd 1000 hours	not	less	than	75% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
4th 1000 hours	not	less	than	80% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
5th 1000 hours	not	less	than	85% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
6th 1000 hours	not	less	than	90% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
7th 1000 hours	not	less	than	95% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
8th 1000 hours	not	less	than	95% of	the Maintenance	person's rate
An employee with seniority rights who enters the apprenticeship program will remain frozen at his/her current hourly rate until such time as the percentage (%) of the maintenance person's rate is greater of the two and will continue to progressively increase as per above chart.
A new hire placed directly into an apprenticeship will begin at 65% of the maintenance person's rate and progress according to the apprentice wage schedule.
HOURS OF WORK
Apprentices shall work the same hours during the contractual work week, and be subject to the same conditions as the skilled workers of his/her trade employed by the Company. Apprentices may work overtime hours, providing that all skilled workers of that trade have been given first opportunity. In case an apprentice is required to work overtime, he/she shall receive credit on the term of apprenticeship for only the actual hours worked with the assigned journeyperson.
RATIO
The ratio of apprentices to journey persons shall not exceed (1) apprentice to each six (6) journeypersons employed in a respective trade.
LAYOFF & RECALL
When a reduction in force occurs in a trade where apprentices are employed, apprentices first shall be laid off.
The apprentices will exercise their seniority in their own group. For example, if there are four apprentices in any specific trade and a reduction in this number is required due to lack of work, the first hired shall be the last laid off, and the last laid off shall be the first to be reinstated.
An employee having seniority in the plant who enters the apprentice training program, shall, during the period of his/her apprenticeship, retain seniority. If laid off or dismissed from the apprentice training program, he/she shall be returned to replace the junior employee in the plant, seniority permitting, and to his/her former seniority in the plant.
When the work force is increased in a trade, apprentices must be recalled according to trade
70
apprentice seniority. Thereafter, all apprentices in a trade shall be recalled before any new journeypersons shall be hired, and in accordance with the Collective Agreement.

THE FOLLOWING GENERALLY OUTLINES THE PROCESS TO BE UTILIZED IN DESIGNATING GENERAL HELP EMPLOYEES PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 13 A(I)(IV)
It is the intent of the parties to continue to provide an opportunity for the senior General Help employees within the Bottling Department to be eligible for interdepartmental assignments.
Designates will be obtained through a designated posting procedure as follows:
To be eligible you must be in the Bottling Department in the General Help classification. Postings will be advertised for seventy-two (72) hours. Area Reps if authorized by an employee on vacation may make an application for the employee. Area Reps if authorized by an employee on Weekly Indemnity, Long Term Disability or Workplace Safety & Insurance may make application provided they have a return to work date within seven (7) calendar days of the posting’s expiration date.
Selections will be awarded on the basis of seniority and the successful applicant(s) once qualified will be referred to as the senior "Designated” General Help employee(s).
Where there are no applicants for the designate posting, the Company will assign the low seniority Bottling Dept. General Help employee not on a designate position.
Designated employees not already qualified will be trained. If within 30 calendar days from commencing training an employee fails to perform in accordance with the Employer’s requirements, he/she shall be removed from the designated list.
Training will be scheduled as soon as practicable following the closing of the notice. The Company will endeavour, in so far as may be practicable, to provide a trial period that is one continuous period.
Eligible employees can only be designated in one classification.
A Designated General Help Employee will maintain the rate or the classification for which he is a "Designate”.
An employee will not be able to remove himself from his designate position, unless he was originally assigned to such designate position as the low seniority Bottling
74
Department General Help employee, he has been in the designate position for at least twelve (12) months, and there is a regular full-time Bottling General Help employee with less seniority who is not assigned to any designate position.
Employees who successfully bid out of the Bottling General Help designate classification will be removed from the designated position.
Being a designate does not exempt you from being assigned a vacancy where there are no applicants (i.e. clause 13A (d)) or being placed on a temporary assignment or loan.
The following are the designated positions with the maximum number of designated. The addition of designate positions to this list will be discussed and agreed upon by the parties.
Grain Control Operator	2
Drain & Fill Utility Operator	1
Blending Process Operator	2
Distribution Utility Operator	2
Maturing Barrel Inspector Stacker	2
Material Handling Utility Operator	2
Central Maintenance Storekeeper	1
Designated employees must take the assignment.
Manufacturing Division employees while covered under Clause 14 (b) (ii) are not eligible to be on a designate list.
Employee’s currently in other departments who are transferred to Bottling General Help are eligible to place their name on any of the active classification lists, only if they are fully qualified in that classification. The most senior employee will then be the designate.
The above represents a framework aimed at balancing the requirements of the company to realize a significant return for its training initiatives along with the unions desire to provide senior bottling general help employees an opportunity to be considered for interdepartmental assignments. To this extent the parties agree to meet as required to address and mutually resolve any procedural problems which may arise during the life of the agreement.

“ABILITY” DETERMINATION - PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES
This letter summarizes our method for determining “ability” in accordance with Clause 13A of this Agreement.
It is recognized that the plant’s machinery and processes are continually becoming more complex and that for key positions requiring significant technical capability such as the Technician and Distillery Process Operator classifications the selection process will be undertaken in seniority order and will be for up to ten (10) days in duration for the Distillery Process Operator classification and for up to five (5) days for the Technician classification. An applicant may be required to successfully pass a pre-determ ined test as well as practical testing on job functions as part of the selection process. Thereafter, successful applicants will validate ability by undergoing a further evaluation pursuant to Clause 13 A (b).
Testing requirements will be reviewed and discussed with the President or Vice President and the Area Representative. Should the requirements of the testing subsequently change, these changes will again be discussed with the appropriate union representatives and will be outlined in the job posting. Failure to follow this procedure will void the posting.
Furthermore, at the request of the President or Area Representative, the company agrees to review and discuss the test results of an unsuccessful applicant.
For less technical job classifications, “ability” will be determined by the senior applicant undergoing an evaluation process pursuant to Clause 13A (b).
The Company recognizes the importance of maximizing job advancement opportunities for all its employees.

CLARIFICATION OF CLAUSE 35 (c) - JOB SECURITY AND WORK OWNERSHIP FOR TRADES PERSONNEL
This letter is intended to clarify the procedure for offering "equivalent hours of work” pursuant Clause 35 (c) (iv). All terms and conditions specified in Clause 35 (c) (iv) shall apply to the following clarifying examples.
a)	Monday to Friday
Example: Where a contractor has three (3) electricians working ten (10) hours (i.e. two (2) hours of overtime) on a Tuesday, the company will initially offer 2 hours of overtime work to three (3) electricians. In the event an electrician refuses the overtime the company will continue to offer 2 hours of overtime (in accordance with Clause 8(p)) until 3 electricians have accepted the work or until all electricians in the classification and department have been offered.
Once all the electricians have been offered there shall be no further obligation on behalf of the company.
b)	Weekend
Example: Where a contractor has one (1) or more mechanics working on a Saturday for six (6) hours, the Company will offer 6 hours of overtime to all mechanics in the classification and department capable of performing the work assigned to the contractor. Similarly if a contractor has one (1) or more fitter/welder(s) working for 10 hours on a Sunday the Company will offer 10 hours of overtime to all fitter/welder(s) in the classification and department capable of doing the work assigned to the contractor.
In the above cases where the work performed by a single contractor involves duties encompassing more than one (1) skilled trades classification, the work will be offered to the skilled trades classification constituting the majority of the work performed.
