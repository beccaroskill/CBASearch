To the Union:
Further to negotiations with the Bargaining Committee, 1987, towards concluding a Collective Bargaining Agreement effective October 1, 1987, the Company has agreed to resubmit Letters of Agreement regarding past practise of providing transportation to Snow Lake. It is, therefore, the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
Flin Flon employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2h) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (2 h) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools fim Snow Lake when they return from the completion cf a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a fill shift on the day they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare,
Flin Flon to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion cf the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Flin Flon for a temporary period.

APPENDIX "B"
RIGHT TO REFUSE PROCEDURE EFFECTIVE 12 AUGUST 1987
As a result of the 1984 negotiations, a tripartite committee consisting of Company Management, United	of America and the Association of Flin Flon Trades was
established to design and implement a training program to deal with the administration of the terms of Article 6.05 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The Company and the Unions will continue to perfect and maintain a safe and healthy work environment which can only be achieved through the co-operation of all members of the workforce.
The enclosed definition and situations have been designed and agreed to by both Company and the Unions and will form the basis of a "Right to Refuse" Company policy.
(signed) KIJ, Elitmstle
116
ARTICLE 6.05 RIGHT TO REFUSE
DEFINITION
Where an employee of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited has reasonable cause to believe that:
A)	his or her use or operation of the equipment will result in a danger to that employee or another employee, or
B)	a condition in or associated with the work place could cause a danger to the employee,
that person may refuse to use or operate the machine, device or thing or to work in the place.
* Canada Labour Code refers to danger as:
"Any hazard or condition that could reasonably be expected to cause injury or illness to a person exposed thereto before the condition or hazard can be corrected."
LIMITATIONS
An employee may not refuse to work if:
A)	the employee's refusal puts the life, health or safety of another person directly in the danger, or
B)	the perceived danger is inherent in the employee's work or is a normal condition of employment.
Where an employee takes unfair advantage of the Right to Refuse, for frivolous reasons, he . may be subject to such discipline as is considered appropriate by the Company.
SITUATION #1
(Both employee and supervisor agree something exists that would constitute a danger. The situation is resolved between employee and supervisor.)
Step 1:	Employee should contact immediate supervisor immediately and explain the
reasons why he/she believes that the task is dangerous.
Step 2:	A Visual investigation should take place, at that point, between immediate
supervisor and employee.
117
Step 3:	A safe solution is agreed upon and the matter is rectified to the satisfaction of
employee and supervisor which would allow employee to return to work, or perform the new task at his own free will.
SITUATION #2
(Employee and supervisor cannot come to an agreement, but the matter is resolved to the satisfaction of the employee by the senior supervisor of the area, the appropriate Safety Committee representative and a Safety Department representative.)
Step 1:	Employee should contact immediate supervisor immediately and explain the
reasons why he/she believes that the task is dangerous.
Step 2:	A visual investigation should take place, at that point, between immediate
supervisor and employee.
Step 3:	If satisfactory conclusion does not occur,, employee should be reassigned to
another job, preferably in the immediate area but must be available pending any further investigation.
Step 4:	The incident is recorded.
Step 5:	F immediate supervisor is attempting to fill the job that was previously refused
by another employee, the employee contacted must be informed that another employee has refused to do the job and the reasons for refusing must be given.
Step 6:	Since the situation cannot be resolved between the immediate supervisor and
the employee, it is now referred to senior supervision (e.g. foreman, assistant superintendent), the appropriate Union Safety Committee representative and the Safety Department. This group may consult with the department superintendent and the matter wi be resolved at this point to the satisfaction of the employee.
SITUATION #3
(Employee and supervisor cannot come to an agreement. Also, the matter has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the employee by the senior supervisor of the area, the appropriate Safety Committee representative and a Safety Department representative; however, Government Inspection Branch rules in favour of the employee.)
Step 1:	Employee should contact immediate supervisor immediately and explain the
reasons why he/she believes that the task is dangerous.
Step 2:	A visual investigation should take place, at that point, between immediate
supervisor and employee.
118
Step 3:	If satisfactory conclusion does not occur, employee should be reassigned to
another job, preferably in the immediate area, but must be available pending any further investigation.
Step 4:	The incident is recorded.
Step 5:	If immediate supervisor is attempting to fill the job that was previously refused
by another employee, the employee contacted must be informed that another employee has refused to do the job and the reasons for refusing must be given.
Step 6: , Since the situation cannot be resolved between the immediate supervisor and the employee, it is now referred to senior supervision, the appropriate Union Safety Committee representative and the Safety Department.
Step 7:	If, after consultation with the department superintendent, the matter has still not
been resolved to the satisfaction of the employee, the problem will be referred to the appropriate Government Inspection Branch. The employer and the employee shall each notify the Government Inspection Branch and the employee, or another employee selected by the employee who refused to work, must be available during the investigation.
Step 8:	Where the Government Inspection Branch representative decides that the use
or operation of a machine, device or thing, would constitute a danger to the health or safety of an employee or that a condition exists in a place that would constitute a danger to the health or safety of an employee, he shall give such direction as he considers appropriate, and an employee may continue to refuse to use or operate the machine, device or thing or to work in the place until the directive is complied with or until it is varied or rescinded.
SITUATION #4
(Employee and supervisor cannot come to agreement. Also the matter has not been
resolved to the satisfaction of the employee by the senior supervisor of the area, the
appropriate Safety Committee representative and a Safety Department representative;
however, the Government Inspection Branch rule in favour of the employer.)
Step 1:	Employee should contact immediate supervisor immediately and explain the
reasons why he/she believes that the task is dangerous.
Step 2:	A visual investigation should take place, at that point, between immediate
supervisor and employee.
Step 3:	If satisfactory conclusion does not occur, employee should be reassigned to
another job, preferably in the immediate area, but must be available pending any further investigation.
119
Step 4: Step 5:
Step 6:
Step 7:
Step 8:
The incident is recorded.
If immediate supervisor is attempting to fill the job that was previously refused by another employee, the employee contacted must be informed that another employee has refused to do the job and the reasons for refusing must be given.
Since the situation cannot be resolved between the immediate supervisor and the employee, it is now referred to senior supervision, the appropriate Union Safety Committee representative and the Safety Department.
If, after consultation with the department superintendent, the matter has still not been resolved to the satisfaction of the employee, the problem will be referred to the appropriate Government Inspection Branch, the employer and the employee shall each notify the Government Inspection Branch and the employee, or another employee selected by the employee who refused to work, must be available during the investigation.
Where the Government Inspection Branch representative decides that the use or operation of a machine, device or thing would not constitute a danger to the health or safety of an employee, or that a condition does not exist in a place that would constitute a danger to the health or safety of an employee, an employee is not entitled to continue to refuse to use or operate the machine, device or thing or to work in the place, but he may, by notice in writing given within seven days of receiving notice of the decision, require the Government Inspection Branch representative to refer his decision to the Canada Labour Relations Board, and thereupon the Government Inspection Branch representative shall refer the decision to the Canada Labour Relations Board.
