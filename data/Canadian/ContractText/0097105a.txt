Contracts are awarded according to iteria established by these agencies. Forest Companies n obtain information from MoF district offices.
le Forest Sector Strategy Committee reviewed the oposed spending program and was advised by FRBC at it was our intention that, where possible, tenure ilders should complete this work. We have also stated is intention to MELP and MoF. In addition, we ‘vised both groups that we expect tenure holders to e their own employees and/or regular contractors lere possible, and companies from outside the area luld agree to hire locally when not possible. These eferences are for 1994/95 work and FRBC will devel-' criteria for future work with the understanding that
127
the promotion of community stability is a major concern.
In addition, the issue of employment adjustment is one which FRBC will be addressing.
In order to accomplish our goals as they will be determined by our Board of Directors, we will require inpu’ from a variety of industry stakeholders, labour/manage. ment. Therefore I propose we plan on meeting at the conclusion of your negotiations.
