1.01	The Union shall be the exclusive collective bargaining
representative of all employees of the bargaining unit which consists of all employees of the Company except -
(a)	foremen and persons above the rank of foreman;
(b)	office staff;
(c)	operating engineers performing shift and maintenance duties, and who constitute a separate bargaining unit represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 772, provided that if any shift engineer is regularly assigned to that kind of maintenance work which is regularly performed by members of the bargaining unit for more than five days per month, he shall be required to be a member of the Union as provided in Section 2, but wherever possible only one such operating engineer will be so assigned.
(d)	guards;
(e)	employees covered by a subsisting agreement between Molson Breweries and Brewery, Malt and Soft Drink Workers, Local 304 or successors thereof.
1.02	The Company will supply to the Union a list of the supervisory personnel who are classified as supervisor whose duties are mainly supervisory
but who may occasionally relieve an employee in the bargaining unit for a short period or work in emergency situations, or to train or demonstrate.
1
1.03	Wherever the masculine is used in this Agreement, it shall be considered as if the feminine has been
used where the context so requires.
1.04	PURPOSE AND VALUES
In striving to become a "WORLD CLASS BREWERY", and providing added value for our shareholders, we the members of the Toronto Brewery, will strive for excellence in QUALITY and RELIABILTY in order to deliver the highest degree of SERVICE to our customers; this will be achieved through the talents and commitments of our people and the use of modern processes and practices.
We will establish and maintain a healthy and safe workplace that fulfills individual needs for mutual trust, personal growth, and appreciation for results. The Toronto operation will be recognized as having employees that are willing to learn, to change, and to act quickly, to maintain a leading edge position in a constantly changing and challenging GLOBAL MARKET environment.
To realize our goal of becoming a "WORLD CLASS BREWERY" requires the combined efforts of Management and Union leaders, and all employees. Therefore, all employees within the Brewery will:
•	Meaningfully participate in the decisions which affect them.
•	Be willing to do Work and assume all tasks for which they are qualified.
•	Develop and maintain a high level of technical, administrative and relationship skills.
•	Work toward the satisfaction of shareholders, internal and external customers needs.
2
•	Promote Quality, Reliability, Efficiency, and waste reduction.
•	Support initiative, new ideas, trust, mutual respect, equitable treatment and cooperation.
•	Communicate information promptly, accurately and completely.
•	Assist in training other employees.
•	Take pride in their work and promote and adhere to the highest standards.
•	Provide support to those employees who have difficulty adapting to change or learning new processes.
•	Be willing to do any task which they are capable of performing safely and responsibly (Flow to work concept).
•	Know, understand, respect and practice the intent of the Collective Agreement.
Both parties agree that their common objective is the desire to make the operation more RELIABLE and to enhance the JOB SECURITY of all employees. The parties believe that these objectives can be best met
through good planning and monitoring; the BM/UE (Brewery Management/Union Executives) will provide guidance to all the departments in their efforts to bring lasting changes and sustainable results.
The company will hold departmental meetings on a monthly basis to discuss the current standing agenda as mandated by the BMUE.
SECTION 2 - UNION SHOP
2.01	Each member of the bargaining unit shall be a
member in good standing of the Brewery Workers Component No. 325.
3
2.02	The Union agrees that any employee engaged by the Company to work in the bargaining unit who is satisfactory to the Company will be allowed to make application for membership in the said union on payment of the regular initiation fees and monthly dues, and will not be denied membership without just cause.
2.03	Whenever an employee is suspended or expelled, the Union will give the Company, in writing, the reason for such action.
SECTION 3 - MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
3.01	The Union acknowledges that it is the exclusive function of the Company to:
(a)	Maintain order, discipline and efficiency.
(b)	Hire, discharge, transfer, promote, demote or discipline employees provided that the claim that an employee has been discharged, transferred, demoted or disciplined without just cause may be dealt with as hereinafter provided.
3.02	It is understood that in exercising these functions
the Company must conform to all other clauses of this Agreement. When an employee is disciplined or discharged the appropriate Steward and the Union Secretary will be given in writing reasons for such action.
SECTION 4 - CHECK-OFF
4.01	The Company agrees to provide for the convenience of its employees a voluntary revocable check-off arrangement which will permit the employees to
4
have their regular dues and assessments deducted from their pay. The Company shall forward the amount so deducted to the Treasurer of the Union, in a lump sum by direct deposit, no later than the tenth day of the month following the date on which the dues and assessment deductions have been made, together with a list of the employees, giving particulars of those who have been terminated or who have been laid off since the previous list was forwarded.
In the event that any such deductions are not
made for reasons of sickness, vacations, leave of absence, etc., they should be made upon written request of the Union from the first pay of the next
following month in which wages are owing to such employees.
SECTION 5 - HIRING PRACTICE
5.01	In the event that the Company engages new employees, it is agreed that these new employees will be required to sign a dues authorization card at the time of hiring.
The Company shall promptly notify the Department Steward and the Union Secretary when a new employee is engaged for that Department.
SECTION 6 - UNION ACTIVITIES
6.01	No employee shall be discriminated against or discharged for his activity as a Union member or for doing committee or other work for the Union, provided, however, that permission from the
5
employer is obtained if such activities occur during
working hours and interfere with the employee's normal duties on behalf of the Company. It is agreed that such permission, if requested, will not be
unreasonably withheld in any instance.
6.02	The Company agrees to grant leave of absence for a period of not more than 12 months, or for the balance of the duration of this Agreement, whichever is the longer, to any employee who has been elected or appointed as an Official of the Canadian Union or of the Component, if such duties require him to have leave of absence from his Company duties on a full time basis.
6.03	Employees on such leave of absence will be continued as active members of the pension and welfare plan upon payment of the total contributions whether from the Union or from the employee concerned. During such periods of leave of absence the employee's seniority shall continue to accumulate as if he were employed at his regular post by the Company.
6.04	Upon written application of the Union, the Company
agrees to grant an educational leave of absence, without loss of regular pay, not to exceed five normal working days in any one calendar year, to two Union executives, elected Stewards, Alternate Stewards as defined in the Grievance Procedure Section. Such educational leave shall be so arranged between the Company and the Union so as to minimize disruption of the Company's operations.
An application for leave form will be submitted to the Company at least fourteen (14) calendar days in
6
advance of the date for which leave is requested.
The Company shall respond to the request within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the form.
SECTION 7 - INJURY OR ILLNESS
7.01	Sickness or disability resulting from an accident shall
not be sufficient cause for discharge. Upon recovery the employee shall receive his former position or some other suitable job in his department if held by an employee with less seniority, if the recovered employee is capable of performing the job in a satisfactory manner.

(b)	If an employee is absent from work for three (3) consecutive days without having notified the Company in advance, where that is possible and received permission to be absent. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(c)	If an employee has been laid off and fails to report for work within 7 days after written notice to report to work has been sent by registered mail to his last address registered with the Company; provided that when an employee

(d)	If an employee has been discharged for just cause;
(e)	In case of lay-off for a period of 24 months, unless this period has been extended because the employee was granted leave of absence for sickness or other reasons.
SECTION 10 - APPLICATION OF SENIORITY TO REDUCTION OF FORCE IN A DEPARTMENT AND RECALLS
10.01	Whenever it is necessary to reduce the working staff in any department, the reduction shall be accomplished as follows:
10
10.02	The Company shall first lay off temporary or probationary employees, plant wide, if any, with the exception that temporary and probationary tradesmen, if any, whose skills continue to be required shall be retained.
Temporaries or probationers who are laid off in a department shall not have any right to displace temporaries or probationers or other employees in other departments.
10.03	If further reduction is necessary, the most junior employees shall be laid off in order of departmental seniority.
If it becomes necessary to layoff employees with five (5) or more years of seniority, for an anticipated duration of one month or more, then such employees will be permitted, if qualified, to displace more junior employees in other departments.
10.04	An employee on a seniority list in a department
who, to avoid lay-off is transferred to a temporarily vacant position in another department, shall after 5 working days in the new department be subject to bumping by an employee of his regular department who has higher seniority and subsequently is laid off. Conversely, an employee who is on lay-off and is recalled to a temporarily vacant position in another department shall, after 5 working days in the new department be subject to bumping by an employee of his regular department who has higher seniority and has subsequently been laid off.
10.05	One Shop Steward designated by the Union in each department except in the Bottle Shop where there
11
shall be two Shop Stewards, and the Plant Chairman shall be exempt from any lay-off so long as there is work in their respective departments which they can perform satisfactorily.
10.06	When it is necessary to shut down a machine for the purpose of overhaul, any available work in the department will be given to the most senior men displaced by such temporary reduction of operations if they are capable and willing to accept such assignment.
10.07	In all cases employees who are transferred to a different job as a result of the application of these seniority rules must be able to perform the job satisfactorily, and must accept the rate of the job to which they are assigned.
10.08	When the working force of a department is increased following a lay-off, the employees will be recalled to their former jobs in their departments from transfer or lay-off in order of seniority.
10.09	The Guaranteed Wage Plan, which is a supplement to this Agreement, is intended to provide assistance for those eligible employees who have one or more years of seniority who are laid off as a result of
the application of above clauses, and is not to be construed as authorization to alter existing practices.
SECTION 11 - TRANSFER OF SENIORITY
11.01	When an employee is transferred from one
department to another as a result of his selection for a posted job, he may return to his original department without loss of seniority (and displace
12
a more junior employee if necessary) if his transfer is cancelled before he has worked 90 working days in his new department or if he is laid off from his new department before he has worked there for 90 working days, but for the purpose of determining his ranking for lay-off purposes in his new department his seniority shall be deemed to have been transferred at the time of his actual transfer.
11.02	When an employee is transferred from one department to another for any other reason his seniority position shall remain in the department from which he was transferred for a period of 132 working days. If the transfer remains in effect
for a period of 132 working days in a particular department, his seniority shall then be transferred to that department permanently, and he shall have no claim in any other department where he may have worked.
11.03	An employee who has been on a seniority list in any department and is promoted to a position not covered by this Agreement and later demoted, shall after 132 working days in any 12 month period in the department to which he has been assigned,
be given seniority equivalent to his total service with the Company except if the demotion occurs before he has worked for 132 working days outside of the Bargaining Unit he may return to his original department and regain his total seniority without delay. This kind of demotion shall not take place during periods when seniority employees are laid off.
An employee who has never appeared on a seniority list in any department covered by this Agreement
13
shall, if transferred into any such department, retain credit for his total service with the Company for the purpose of vacation and benefit entitlement
and pension but such service shall not be counted towards seniority.
11.04	An employee who has been on a seniority list in any department as of January 1, 1985, and is promoted to a position not covered by this Agreement and later demoted, shall, after 132 working days in any 12 month period in the department to which he has been assigned be given seniority equivalent to his total service with the Company in the Bargaining Unit except if the demotion occurs before he has worked for 132 working days outside of the Bargaining Unit he may return to his original department and regain his total seniority without delay.
SECTION 12 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FORMS
12.01	An employee on being laid off shall receive such
documents as required by the Unemployment Insurance Commission to enable him to make a claim for benefits or to accept a temporary job elsewhere during the lay-off. In either case, a regular employee shall retain all his rights and privileges under this Agreement, provided that he reports for work within seven days after written notification to report for work has been sent to his last address registered with the Company.

such Members a one-time irrevocable election when

Monthly
Date Age 65 is Reached	Amount
January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000	$	2,451

multiplied by the ratio that the Member's Credited Service bears to 30 years.
If the Member elects this option 1) then his pension will continue to be escalated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10 of the Pension Plan
as those provisions existed immediately prior to December 31, 1999.
2)	Have his/her pension increased, if applicable, such that the new pension payable from the Pension Plan is equal to the Member's Credited Service at
70
retirement (to a maximum of 30 years) multiplied by an applicable lifetime benefit rate from Section 3 of Part B. The lifetime benefit rate shall be chosen as the rate applicable to a Member then retiring in the year the Member entitled to crossover attains age 65.
If the Member elects this option 2) then his pension
will cease to be escalated and will be subject to Section 10 of Part B.
The cost of the Company providing this election opportunity to Members with unmatured crossover entitlements will be paid for by supplemental Member contributions in addition to those defined in Section 1 of Part B. Between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002, Members shall make a supplemental contribution to the Pension Plan of $0.20 per hour worked to a maximum of 2080 hours per calendar year.

Payments will commence on the first day, if disability is due to an accident, and on the fourth day, if due to sickness, and will continue up to a maximum of 26 weeks for any one period of disability.
The aforementioned 26-week period will consist of a combination of Employment Insurance sick benefits coupled with a sub plan "top up" which will equate to 70% of employees regular earnings.

The Plan will provide payment of 66 2/3% of wages (hourly rate x 40) in effect at any time during the first 78 weeks of the Long Term Plan. Following such period the payment will be 66 2/3% of wages (hourly rate x 40) in effect at the end of the said 78-week period. The Long Term Disability Plan and the Weekly Indemnity Plan will be of a standard nature which will include an offset clause for integrating statutory payments such as Canada Pension Plan and Unemployment Insurance, and in the case of Long Term Disability, will also include an offset clause for integrating Worker's Compensation.

Sick Leave will be paid to the employee in cash on the last pay day before Christmas.
Employees who attain seniority during the year, shall be credited at one half their then existing daily basic wage rate, for each full month worked from the date they attain seniority.

LETTER OF INTENT RE: SECTION 30 - WELFARE PLAN
This will confirm our understanding with respect to the above Section of the collective agreement.
As you are aware, the Company changed the carrier of the insured health and welfare benefits during the terms of the previous collective agreement.
This letter shall be your assurance that, as a result of this change, there will be no change in the terms and conditions or reduction in the level of benefits provided to employees covered by the previous carrier (Great-West Life).
As well, the Company agrees that disputes concerning a particular employee's entitlement to or eligibility for a particular benefit may be referred to arbitration under the collective agreement.
As agreed, this letter shall form part of the collective agreement.

Component 325 1 Carlingview Drive Toronto, Ontario M9W 5E5
Dear Mr. Hamilton:
As the result of discussion between the Company and Component 325, it is agreed that the following policy with regard to vacations will be put into effect following ratification of the Collective Agreement.
1. Deferment of Summer Vacation (Block Vacation)
On the first working day of each calendar year, a notice will be posted on all bulletin boards for 2 weeks advising employees that it is permissible to forego their summer vacation and take that year's entire vacation entitlement in one continuous period outside the regular summer vacation time. Those desirous of doing so are to list their names. In order of seniority and within occupational groups, where applicable, the Company will approach those who have applied and will complete and post a schedule in conformity with the following two paragraphs.
The period will commence on the first Monday following September 15 and end on the last Friday prior to the second Monday in June the following year.
The following is the maximum number of men per week to be granted this privilege and, once confirmed, cannot be revoked by either the employee or the
Company.
78
Bottling	6
Brewing	2
Maintenance	3
Shipping and Receiving 2 Kegging	1
Employees waiving summer vacation and taking all their vacation in the off season cannot be bumped from their preferred time by someone of higher seniority who has had summer vacation.
The Company agrees to notify all applicants by January 31st whether they have confirmed dates, so that anyone who is unsuccessful in obtaining "Block Vacation" can still apply for regular summer vacation.
Each department, in calculating the total number of employees normally granted vacation time off each week, will include in the count those who have been given advance confirmation of their total vacation entitlement in the off season, i.e., "Block Vacation".
2. Early Service Vacation and Regular Summer Vacation
From February 1st to February 21st of each year, the "early service weeks" and regular summer vacation schedule will be posted. Employees will indicate their preference of dates during that time period.
From February 22nd to March 15th the Company will make the selection, in accordance with present practice. The number of employees allocated on vacation at any given time cannot be exceeded. This may result in junior employees having to make a second choice. The final approved schedule for the above will be posted on March 16th of that year. A third week of summer
79
vacation will be offered to employees from available unused weeks, by seniority.

RE: SECTION 10.03
This will confirm our understanding reached during negotiations concerning the application of Section 10.03 of
the current collective agreement.
If a lay-off of employees in a department was anticipated to be of a duration of less than one month but, in fact, extends beyond one month, those laid off employees with five (5) or more years of seniority affected by such lay-off will be permitted to displace more junior employees in other departments after one month or more of lay-off.

Re: Determining Qualifications in Section 10 and Section 13 of Collective Agreement
An employee will be found to be qualified for a job if he is able to perform all duties of the job immediately. If a training period of less than thirty (30) days would be sufficient to provide an employee the minimum requirements to perform the job reasonably, the said employee will be given the opportunity to become qualified within that period for the purpose of these clauses.

who are temporarily transferred out of their respective departments for more than 5 consecutive working days, without a resultant lay-off, will be entitled, if qualified, to exercise the option of displacing temporary or probationary employees if any in their respective departments, and if necessary, displace the most junior employees who have seniority in order of seniority.

Dear Mr. Hamilton:
LETTER OF INTENT
Not to be included in the Collective Agreement RE: APPLICATION OF SHORT NOTICE RECALL - G.W.P.
During 1988 negotiations, the Company and Union discussed the recall procedure with respect to application of recalls on short notice for employees in receipt of G.W.P benefits. It was agreed by the Union, that notwithstanding the arbitration award of Ian Hunter, dated October 14,
1987 between Labatt's Ontario Breweries, London Plant and National Brewery Workers Union, Local No. 1, the agreement with respect to procedures for short term lay off established previously between the parties will be continued.
Such procedure is as follows:
1. During your layoff from Molson Breweries, you must be available for recall.
We recognize it is not practical to assume that every employee will sit by his telephone every minute of the day.
It must, however, be clearly recognized that payments will not be made to employees who are not available or who we cannot contact.
103
Therefore, every employee who is subject to G.W.P payments must be available to be contacted for recall between the hours of:
7:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.
Monday - Friday
It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the
Personnel Office, personally if on any given working day, he may not be available during those times and arrange for alternate, satisfactory communication.
Failure to meet these requirements may result in benefit disqualification.
2. All changes of address and phone number must be immediately communicated to the Personnel Department.

employees enrolled in the Apprenticeship Program.
It is understood that this understanding overrides the provisions of the Collective Agreement and, in particular, Articles 11.01 and 11.02.
The following agreement applies for purposes of job posting, shift assignment, removal from the Maintenance Department for lack of work and vacation selection but will not affect the exercise of his ordinary seniority rights in other departments.
We have agreed that any apprentice whose seniority transfers to the Maintenance Department from another department, will be placed at the bottom of the Maintenance Department seniority list as of the first day that he commenced to work in the Maintenance Department regardless of his ordinary seniority date.
For all other purposes however, the employee's ordinary seniority shall govern.

Dear Mr. Hamilton:
RE: Scheduling of
Bottlina/Cannina/Palletizina/Shippina Employees
The Company agrees that it will endeavor to assign employees to work groups based on their expressed preference and seniority. In stating their preference, employees will be expected to learn and demonstrate the core operational aspects of all jobs within that work group. The employee will be assigned to a single job selection within the work group giving consideration to seniority, skills, and training. After the 2010 job picks have been completed, this process will be conducted thereafter on a biennial basis. The BM/UE will annually review individual, work group and departmental skill needs and requirements to determine potential changes to work group preference and job selection.
Weekly scheduling will be done based on the above mentioned work group preference and job selection. It is understood that absenteeism, vacation, shift level variations and training activities will affect the Company's ability to accommodate the employee's preference and selection. With the intent of maintaining work group stability and minimizing employee movement, the BM/UE will develop guidelines which will be followed by the Supervisor to deal with daily adjustments to the schedule.
112
If a new job is established in a work group, employees within that work group will be able to re-select their jobs in accordance with seniority. If a new work group is established, employees will be given the opportunity to transfer into the work group based on a process established by the BM/UE.
Projects or tasks which are assigned through the volunteer process will not be treated as a new job.

Dear Mr. Hamilton:
Letter of Intent RE: WORK REFUSAL
During negotiations, the Union raised its concern regarding possible future changes to the Occupational Health and Safety Act with respect to the rights of employees to refuse to do unsafe work.
It is agreed that the work refusal process in the current Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1995 will be adhered to by the parties for the term of this collective agreement, as long as such process is not in contravention of any prevailing legislation.
In the event that amendments to legislation make adherence to the current process impossible, the Company and Union will meet to make appropriate modifications to the procedure for refusal of unsafe work.
Yours truly,

Re: Retail Store Transition
During negotiations leading to the renewal of the Collective Agreement the parties agreed to the following terms and conditions in connection with the use of temporary employees in the Retail Store.
The Retail Store will be staffed by temporary employee(s).
Temporary employees employed in the retail Store may be scheduled on a part time basis, and work hours less than the regular hours of work described in Section 17 of the Collective Agreement.

During negotiations leading to the renewal of the current collective agreement the parties agreed to the following terms and conditions in connection with the following:
Commitment to Learning
For an Organization to really change, it must Learn to change. It must implement ways to explore and identify opportunities to change, designing how the organization will respond to this opportunity to change, and helping the people within the organization make this transition from the old to the new. In short, it must become a Learning Organization. Training is a tool to help people learn.
During negotiations the Union raised, with the Company, the need for a serious commitment to Training by the Company. Training is essential to all employees in order to successfully implement and sustain the changes that are required in becoming a "World Class Brewery".
Both parties recognize that a "Training System Standard" needs to be jointly developed and implemented. This Training Standard will serve as the foundation for the BM/ UE to develop and implement a Training Plan for the Toronto Brewery.
The primary reason for providing training is to assist Toronto in achieving its business goals and to improve organizational and individual performance.
In order to demonstrate the Company's commitment to Training, a minimum of 4 % of all hours worked by Union Members will be dedicated to Training every year, for the term of this agreement. Any additional needs for training will be justified on a "Return" basis and will be discussed at the Brewery Steering Committee (BSC).
132
January 1, 2010
During negotiations leading to the renewal of the current collective agreement the parties agreed to the following terms and conditions in connection with the following:
Learning Transition
All operators and trades within the Molson Toronto Brewery will continually strive to become a highly Reliable "World Class Brewery". Both parties recognize that the implementation of a "World Class
Manufacturing Environment" is essential in achieving that objective.
The Company recognizes that, as the organization transits towards becoming a "World Class Brewery", operators and trades will need tools and support in order to learn and apply new skills, and contribute to their full potential.
In order to get full commitment from operators and trades in going through this intense phase of changes, the Company recognizes that utilizing operators and trades in the performance of new tasks, will not result in any regular maintenance employees losing his employment within the maintenance department or any other regular employee losing his employment with the Brewery.
Both parties recognize that this commitment to change by all employees is the best strategy to implement in order to attract more volume for the Toronto Brewery, and sustain employment.

Dear Mr. Hamilton:
LETTER OF INTENT
Not to be included in the Collective Agreement RE: Departmental Boundaries
This will confirm our understanding at negotiations regarding the movement of employees across departmental boundaries in order to achieve a true flow to work in the daily operations. Flow to work across departmental boundaries will ensure that our quality is not compromised, the highest level of customer service is attained and operational efficiencies and costs are met.
The following was agreed to with regards to Kegging, Warehouse and Packaging flow to work without a premium penalty.
1.	When an operational need exists for full goods to be removed from the Palletizer discharge conveyors Shipping employees shall flow to work and assist the Packaging employees in moving product to prevent quality issues or ensure that efficiency and productivity are not affected. Non Palletized product may be removed from Palletizer collection areas by shipping operators for the purposes of repacking or re-working.
2.	When kegs are required for loading in the warehouse, employees from the warehouse will flow to work in
135
the keg room to retrieve staged kegs that are required to meet the customer demand and ensure on time delivery when Keg room employees are not on shift.
If kegs are not staged then the Warehouse Operator will retrieve the required number of kegs to meet the customer demand and ensure on time delivery.
3.	Warehouse cleaner may, as required, operate the scrubber across departmental boundaries to correct unsafe situations when the bottle shop has no cleaner on shift.
4.	Employees in warehouse may perform inventory counts as part of their normal scope of duties, if needed, in the keg room if the kegging employees are not on shift, and/or, are not able to perform the duties in a timely manner.
5.	When operationally feasible employees from Packaging, Kegging and/or Warehouse may flow to work to perform re-work, or re-pack of "hold beer" to ensure quality standards are met and the beer is shipped as fresh as possible to our customer(s).
Other situations may arise where flow to work opportunities
may arise. These situations will be discussed at the BMUE.

Dear Mr. Hamilton:
World Class Manufacturing (WCM)
MolsonCoors Toronto Brewery will operate in an environment defined by World Class Manufacturing (WCM). In this environment, all employees understand their individual contributions to achieving the overall business results.
Employees will work in stable, self-sufficient Teams which include Operations and Maintenance employees as well as a Team Leader. The Team Leader supports the other members of the Team from the standpoint of direction-setting, coaching, performance management and leadership. The primary responsibility of the Team is to make, pack or ship beer or support someone who does to achieve our business results. Teams will be multifunctional and multi-skilled and will have the necessary skill mix needed to deliver their daily production expectations.
In this structure, individuals will support the entire Team by "flowing to the work" necessary to meet the Team expectations. The Team will be fully involved in key decisions affecting their area. Accurate, fact-based and timely information will be communicated and will form the basis for these decisions.
Training will be an integral and ongoing part of WCM. Technical (operations and maintenance), Administrative, and Relationship skills will be developed and maintained by each
140
Team member. Additionally, Team members (Operations and Maintenance) will learn the core responsibilities of every job in their Team to enhance work flexibility within the Team. To ensure that the training and development needs are satisfied, every Team member will be responsible to have an up-to-date Personal Development Plan. Skill development and training will be based on business need, skill, and ability.
Based on the above guiding principles, Team members will:
•	receive skills training on operations, maintenance, and administration
•	perform machine adjustments
•	perform machine changeovers
•	perform process control, including measurement and adjustment
•	perform quality checks
•	perform preventative maintenance, including lubrication
•	perform routine maintenance with support as required by Maintenance
•	perform line coverage maintenance with support as required by Maintenance
•	troubleshoot and problem solve issues affecting their area
•	plan, coordinate and execute work orders
•	enter operation/maintenance information into the computer
•	perform auditing, including safety, quality, maintenance
•	train other employees and team members
•	take individual ownership for the key functional responsibilities (i.e. productivity, quality, safety, maintenance, customer service, training and administration) specific to the Team
•	attend all Team meetings
•	perform advanced technical functions to support process, quality, safety and customer needs
141
The Team will:
•	ensure representation on all key functional responsibilities
- quality, safety, maintenance, training and administration
•	track, monitor and communicate Team results related to key functional responsibilities
•	satisfy internal/external customer requirements
•	administer manpower scheduling, overtime allocation, and internal Team group rotation (within the guidelines of the collective bargaining agreement)
The specific tasks and duties are not intended to completely identify all potential activities related to the new environment. New tasks and duties may arise which are fundamentally aligned with the guiding principles of WCM.

Not to be included in the Collective Agreement Compressed Work Week
This will confirm our discussions during negotiations on a compressed work week implementation in the Toronto Brewery.
It is recognized that a compressed work week may not be suitable for all areas and will only be justified by production demand.
However, as operating teams improve their performance they may identify additional opportunities to reduce either direct or indirect operating costs by implementing a new shift schedule.
The implementation of a compressed work week arrangement would necessarily be on a trial or preliminary basis and will require mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.

Employee participation in a compressed work week arrangement would be on a voluntary basis and an evaluation of the impact on our employee's quality of life

RE: TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES - WAREHOUSE DEPARTMENT
The purpose of this letter is to confirm our agreement reached during negotiations respecting amendments to the terms and conditions under which temporary employees will be employed in the warehouse department for the duration of this collective agreement. The company will commit * to and maintain a minimum number of sixty (60) regular employees.
It is agreed that the terms of the Letter will override the provisions of the Collective Agreement where necessary. The use of temporary employees will not result in a regular employee being laid off from employment or cause the layoff from employment of another regular employee currently in the bargaining unit.
Accordingly, we have agreed that this Letter forms part of the Collective Agreement and that this letter will terminate on December 31,2016 unless the parties agree to renew it.
For the period of time covered by this Letter of Understanding a temporary employee may be employed beyond one hundred and thirty two (132) working days
150
without becoming eligible to acquire seniority and become one of the sixty (60) regular employees. At the conclusion of this period, the Company shall either reclassify him or her as a seniority employee in accordance with the principles of employment equity, lay him or her off or terminate his or her employment.
Note: * based on current volume levels in the Toronto
Brewery and warehouse and the present state of technology in the Department. In the event that volume levels experience a significant decrease from the present levels, or the Company introduces new or modified equipment which significantly alters manpower requirements in the warehouse, this commitment will no longer be binding.
