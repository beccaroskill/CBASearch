The Employer will inform the Union of any new standard or change in standard before its implementation. The Employee shall have the right following, thirty (30) days from the implementation of any new standard to request a review of such standard. Such review shall consist first of a recheck of the standard in question by the Employer’s engineer. If then requested by the Employee or the Union, a Union engineer may be called upon to examine the standard in question. The Company shall be notified by the Union of the qualified engineer’s name.

ARTICLE XVII - TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
17.01	It is understood that the Employer shall make every reasonable effort to reassign those employees displaced as a result of technological change by offering the displaced employee a choice between a vacancy in the same job class on the same shift or the job held by the most junior employee in their own job class on the same shift or a lower job class on the same shift. The junior employee displaced as a result will be placed in a vacant position and if there is no vacancy, then Article XIV (Seniority) will apply.
17.02	The Employer will make a reasonable effort to inform the Union and the affected employees of planned technological changes at the earliest possible date and the potential impact on the affectedjobs or employees.
17.03	Insofar as practicable, when ajob is eliminated and one is created in its place, the employee(s) on the affected job(s) will have right of first refusal on the newly created job.

Once the employee accepts the job they will be placed on a training program. Should the employee fail to demonstrate satisfactory progress, then the employee would be subject to placement in an available position regardless of pay group. If there are no available positions, then the employee is subject to layoff as governed in Section 14.03. Once placed, the employee remains subject to Section 18.04 from the date of the most recent placement.

18.06	Every reasonable effort will be made to transfer the successful candidate within two (2) weeks from the date the employee accepts the position. The Employer will make every effort to inform the employee of the reasons for any delay and will attempt to rectify the problem as promptly as possible.
18.07	Employees who accept a position with the employer outside the bargaining unit may at the Company’s discretion, return to the bargaining unit.
In the event he or she returns to the bargaining unit within six (6)months, he or she shall be credited with full seniority less time spent outside the bargaining unit.
