2.	The Personnel Department shall screen bid sheets for the successful bidder on the basis of seniority and competency.
3.	The Personnel Manager shall maintain a list of successful bidders on the plant bulletin board which list shall accumulate for three (3) months. As the successful bidders are selected, their names shall be entered with the date and, if possible, the date the job becomes effective. All bids shall be entered five (5) days after the bid sheet comes down. Successful bids shall become effective on the 6th working day after the bid sheet comes down.
4.	A "Successful Bid Sheet” shall be published weekly with copies given to the Department Superintendent, Foreman's Office, Payroll Section and Committee.
5.	In the event the Personnel Manager and/or Superintendent and the employee concerned and/or Committee Chairman cannot settle on an effective date which has been delayed because of exceptional conditions, a Committee meeting shall be held to appraise the exceptional conditions. Failing settlement in this manner, grievance procedure shall be instigated.
6.	(a) When commencing employment at Weldwood of Canada Ltd., all
employees automatically become part of a "labour pool". To get out of the labour pool and acquire departmental seniority employees must bid on posted jobs or be placed on a job where no one else has bid.
(b)	Alternatively, employees may find themselves in the labour pool owing to
insufficient departmental seniority to remain in their department;
(i)	in case of curtailment of forces; or
(ii)	in case of the disappearance of jobs owing to technical
change.
(c)	In the event that senior employees in the labour pool fail to bid, the Company and the Committee shall make every effort to place such employees. In regard to employees as defined under Sub-section (b) (i) an (b) (ii) above:
(i) Placement by the Company and the Committee shall not interfere with the employee's right to return
automatically to	the jobs which they held before
reduction when the jobs are	re-established;
(ii)	The ninety (90) day bidding restriction (see Article 8 below)
does not apply, and;
(iii)	Nothing contained in (c) (i) to (iii) above shall interfere with
the application of Section 5(d) of Article VIII.
(d)	Any employee in the labour pool who refuses a job in line with his seniority	on any given day shall relinquish his seniority rights for that day.
7.	When more than one employee bids on a job and the successful bidder fails to qualify, all employees who bid shall be considered before the job is re-posted. However, if the job is not filled within six (6) weeks, it shall be re-posted.
8.	The foregoing bidding procedure may be revised annually.

Management may choose their second representative from amongst persons not employed at the plant, and the Union may do likewise except that neither Party may choose as its representative a member of the Plywood Evaluation Committee or any person who is employed as a Job Evaluator by Forest Industrial Relations Limited or by Regional Council No. 1 of the Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers of Canada.
(b)	The Company shall reimburse any of its hourly paid employees for time lost while acting as a member of the Review Committee or while presenting information, regarding his/her own job, before a regularly convened meeting of the Review Committee. The Company shall not be responsible for remunerating employee representatives who are not its hourly paid employees.
6.	Function of Review Committee
(a)	The Review Committee will be responsible for seeing that all requests for evaluation or re-evaluation of jobs are adequately and accurately documented before being passed to the Plywood Evaluation Committee for further action. The documents required will include a "Request for Job Evaluation” form submitted either by an individual employee or by local Management, and a fully completed Job Description which provides sufficient information for the subsequent work of the Plywood Evaluation Committee.

(b)	Decisions of the Review Committee respecting the appropriateness of a request for evaluation or re-evaluation, or respecting the adequacy and accuracy of documents, shall be by unanimous agreement. Failing such agreement within the established time limit, the Review Committee shall, at the request of any one of its members, immediately forward the Request for Job Evaluation, together with any other documents on which there is unanimous agreement, to the Plywood Evaluation Committee and shall then have no further responsibility for documenting that request.
(c)	When the Plywood Evaluation Committee has made a decision respecting the evaluation of a job, it shall communicate that decision to the appropriate Review Committee.

7.
Application of Program:
The job evaluation program shall apply to all employees in the plywood industry except Journeymen, Tradesmen, Improvers, Helpers and Powerhouse and Boom Crews.
8.	Direction of Work:
Job Evaluation descriptions are written with the intent to set forth the general duties and requirements of the job and shall not be construed as imposing any restriction on the right of the Company to assign duties to employees other than those specifically mentioned in job descriptions, provided always that if the assignment of such duties changes the job content sufficiently to justify a review of the evaluation the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall make such a review in accordance with the procedure as set out herein.
9.	Re-Evaluation:
(a)	When a job has moved to another grade as a result of re-evaluation, the wage rate for the new grade shall be effective on the date that Management or the employee has applied to the Review Committee for re-evaluation.
(b)	When a job is moved to a lower grade as a result of re-evaluation, the incumbent shall maintain his/her job rate as a red circle rate subject to the provisions of Paragraph 11(c) herein.
10.	New Jobs Created
Where the Company has exercised its right to create a new job, a temporary rate shall be set by Management. The permanent rate for the said job as determined by the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall be effective as of the date the job was installed. If the evaluated rate for the new job is lower than the temporary rate the incumbent (s) shall be allowed to continue at the temporary rate.
11.	Red Circle Jobs
(a)	The Company shall supply the Union with a list of employees holding red circle jobs, the said list to include the name of the employee, name of job category filled, the evaluated rate for the job, and the actual rate paid.
(b)	Employees on red circle rates who are promoted to a higher grade shall regain the red circle rate if subsequently found incompetent to continue in the higher grade.
(c)	Employees holding red circle jobs who are demoted during a reduction of

(d)	When the Company terminates a job, or a job is not occupied during a period of one year, a record as to the cancellation of the applicable job description and classification shall be established.
(e)	If an employee is temporarily transferred at the request of the Company he/she shall retain his/her existing rate or receive the rate for the new job, whichever is higher. On return to his/her regular job, the said employee shall regain his/her red circle rate.
12.	Seniority:
(a)	Subject to the provisions herein set out, Article VIII, (Seniority) shall continue to apply.
(b)	Promotions shall be made only where a vacancy exists.
13.	Referral Procedure (Appeal Procedure)
(a)	When the Plywood Evaluation Committee has decided the outcome of a Request for Job Evaluation, it shall transmit its decision to the appropriate Plant Job Review Committee.
(b)	When an employee's request for re-evaluation results in no change being made in the job grade, or in a reduction, or when Management requests results in no change or in an increase, the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall give to the appropriate Review Committee a short statement of the reasons for the decision. The statement should not go into great detail, but should indicate the criteria used in sufficient depth to show the applicant that the request was given adequate attention.
(c)	An evaluation done by the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall be final and binding on the Parties but, at any time after five years since the last evaluation or re-evaluation of a job, Management or an individual employee may submit a request for re-evaluation of that job and no other reason than the elapsed time shall be necessary.
- 77 -
(d)	If the Plywood Evaluation Committee is unable to reach agreement regarding the disposition of a Request for Job Evaluation or any other matter regarding the job evaluation program which falls within their jurisdiction the matter shall be referred to Forest Industrial Relations Limited, and to the Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers of Canada, Regional Council for settlement.
(e)	All communication between any Plant Review Committee and the Plywood
Evaluation Committee referred to above shall be effected by sending one copy to the Union representative or representatives on the Committee and one copy to the Company Representative or representatives. In the case of communications to a Plant Review Committee, the Union representatives will be addressed care of the office of the appropriate Union Local and the Company representatives care of the Company's office at the Plant.

Dear Sirs:
We wish to confirm our Agreement originally drawn up March 25th, 1955 for the
duration of our present Agreement in regard to logging contractors employed by the
Company in the Quesnel area.
1.	We shall hold our uncertified logging contractors responsible to abide by the relevant provisions of the present Agreement, in particular as it regards wage scale, holiday pay and seniority clauses. Dues for all employees and a list of employees for whom dues are submitted must be submitted to the Local Union once a month, without application for Union membership.
2.	The seniority provisions are interpreted as follows:
a)	Men working for any contractors gather seniority on that operation only.
b)	If another contractor or ourselves takes over all or part of one operation, men whose jobs essentially continue under the new setup will retain their jobs and go on the new contractor's seniority list as per the date they were hired by the previous contractor.
c)	If, due to layoff or reorganization of a show or for any other reason, a man's job "disappears", he has no claim to be transferred to any other logging show, the plywood mill or sawmill.
3.	The Company will encourage logging contractors to make reasonable arrangements to help compensate for travelling were no camp is provided.

Dear Sirs:
RE:	CHARGE HAND
The normal duties of a Charge Hand are to transmit work orders to direct the activities of a group of workers in his charge. He may from time to time supervise a shift on a temporary basis, but will not assume the responsibility of a Foreman for an extended period of time.
He may or may not perform work within his area of supervision. He, as a Union member, is not granted the right to hire or discharge.
None of the foregoing is intended to restrict any of the usual activities of a Charge Hand in this operation but merely to clarify the fact that the Company does not give Charge Hands the right to hire or discharge employees.

Attention: Gordon Gray Dear Sir:
Re: Agreement on New and Evolving Work
This letter is intended to clarify I.W.A. Canada's intent with regard to the terms and conditions of the Letter of Understanding in 1994 negotiations on New and Evolving Work.
During discussions on this, the Industry raised concerns that we answer as follows:
1.	It is not the intention of I.W.A. Canada to use this agreement to replace existing logging contractors with IWA members or crews.
2.	It is I.W.A. Canada's desire to have opportunities to discuss with employers the possibility of either using IWA company crews, or IWA contractors, to perform work under Forest Renewal, but it is not our intent to cause companies to purchase equipment without having the costs of such equipment considered as part of the efficiency and cost effectiveness that the IWA agrees to address under the New and Evolving Work agreement.
3.	It is I.W.A. Canada's intention that discussions concerning new operations under the agreement may lead to voluntary recognition.and certification - it is not our intention to achieve certification first and enter into discussion later unless certification occurs as a direct result of an IWA organizing drive.
As stated earlier, this letter is to clarify our intentions concerning our agreement. It is not intended to form part of the agreement, as is not arbitrable by either party.
Sincerely,
Harvey Arcand 4th Vice President I.W.A. Canada
