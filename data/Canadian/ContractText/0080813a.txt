ARTICLE 5 ■ STEWARDS
5.01	The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise select stewards, who shall be permanent regular employees with seniority.

When meetings take place between the Company and the Union for purposes other than for the renewal of the collective agreement, grievance meetings, and arbitration hearings, the Company reserves the right to limit participation by bargaining unit members to a reasonable number from each affected classification for a particular committee or subcommittee provided that in exercising this right, they refrain from making capricious and arbitrary decisions.
