AGREEMENT entered into January 20, 1995 BY AND BETWEEN
THE NATIONAL AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, TRANSPORTATION & GENERAL WORKERS UNION OF CANADA (CAW - CANADA) and its LOCAL 2027 (hereinafter referred to as the Union),
- and -
HIRAM WALKER & SONS LIMITED, whose principal office and place of business is located at Walkerville, Ontario, (hereinafter referred to as the Employer).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to promote and improve the industrial and economic relations between the Employer, its employees and the Union, and to establish and encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining between the parties hereto.
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, by each party, to the other in hand paid, at the ensealing of these presents, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in further consideration of the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter contained, it is mutually agreed as follows:
CLAUSE 1 - UNION RECOGNITION ,
(a)	The Employer hereby recognizes the Union as the sole labour organization representing the Employer’s employees at its Walkerville plant, including Pike Creek and any newly acquired plant in Essex County in the Province of Ontario, which may be operated and managed by the Employer, provided, however, that application of this clause conforms with any federal or provincial law or regulation relating to the recognition of any labour organization as the certified representatives of any employees and agrees to treat and negotiate with the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agency for and on behalf of such employees.
(b)	The term “employees”as used in this instrument shall not include foremen, persons above the rank of foremen, office and clerical staff, chemists, laboratory employees, powerhouse employees and plant guards. Assistant foremen and employees who clean plant offices, other than employees who clean non-plant offices or the reception centre, are to be included in the bargaining unit.
(c)	The Employer shall instruct its supervisory employees of the rank of foremen or higher or other employees of the Employer not covered by the bargaining unit that they shall not perform any work that is performed by or assigned to members of the Union by the Employer except for the purposes of instructing and training employees or in cases of emergency. A case shall be
-2-
considered an emergency if action by the supervisory employee is necessary to avoid or to eliminate a dangerous or hazardous condition, or to avoid loss or damage to the Employer's property or equipment or to the Employer's product.
CLAUSE 2 - UNION MEMBERSHIP
(a)	All employees in this bargaining unit will be required to maintain good standing in the Union as a condition of employment with the Employer.
The Union shall be the sole judge of the good standing of its members and any employee who shall hereafter cease to be a member in good standing according to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union shall, subject to the provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, on notice to the Employer be discharged or suspended immediately, which notice shall contain the reason for expulsion or suspension.
(b)	Employees subsequently hired by the Employer shall be deemed temporary employees for a trial period of sixty (60) calendar days after hiring and during such period may be released by the Employer at any time without the necessity of specifying any cause therefor. Upon the request of the Union President the Employer will discuss the reasons for such release.
If a temporary employee works for a period of less than sixty (60) calendar days and is laid off, the first period worked will apply against the sixty (60) calendar days,

provided not more than one (1) year has elapsed between the date of layoff and the date he is subsequently rehired.
Such temporary employees shall during such trial period be subject to and abide by all rules and regulations of the Union and they shall pay all required dues as prescribed by the Union.
(c)	Temporary employees who are retained by the Employer after the trial period of sixty (60) calendar days shall become regular employees and shall, as a condition of employment, become members of the Union, and their seniority shall date from their date of hire but not more than one (1) year prior to the date they complete their probationary period.
(d)	Except for good and sufficient cause, the Union agrees that it will accept all future employees into the Union for the regular initiation fee and accept them into the Union as full members at the conclusion of their sixty (60) calendar days' trial period upon payment of all fees and regular dues.
(e)	Subject to the provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act all members in good standing shall continue as such provided they abide by and adhere to the Constitution and Rules and Regulations of the Union.
If any employee is expelled or suspended by the Union for good and sufficient cause, he shall upon written notice to the Employer be discharged or suspended immediately. An employee discharged by the Employer for any cause shall be paid off as soon as possible thereafter. Any employee suspended shall retain and accumulate seniority.
-4-
CLAUSE 3 - UNION DUES
(a)	Upon written authorization by the employee, the Employer agrees to deduct from the last pay cheque of each employee in each calendar month such sum as from time to time may be authorized by the Union from all of its members for regular monthly dues and initiation fees and assessments duly authorized by the Constitution and ByLaws of the Local and National Union and the labour agreement between the Union and the Employer, and deliver the total amount so deducted to such person as the Union shall designate to receive and receipt for such money in the form of a cheque payable to the Union not later than the seventh (7) working day of the following month.
(b)	The Employee authorization for such deductions shall be on a form to be approved by the Employer and shall not be revocable by the employee during the term of this agreement, except for assessments which shall be for a specific period of time. The Employer assumes no responsibility for obtaining the execution of such authorization forms from employees. (Appendix No. 1).
(c)	Notice from the Union of any change in regular initiation fees, regular dues, or assessments as stated in (a) above shall be given in writing, signed by proper officers of the Union, to the Employer not less than thirty (30) calendar days before such contemplated change is to become effective.
5
CLAUSE 4 - UNION ACTIVITY
There shall be no coercion, restraint, or discrimination by the Employer or any of its agents against any members of the Union because of membership therein, or the carrying on of any proper union activity.
CLAUSE 5 - UNION REPRESENTATION
(a)	Each department shall be represented by a Union Steward or other Union representative, certified as such by the Secretary of the Union, who shall be recognized by the Employer. The Union shall keep the Employer informed as to the names, departments, current mailing addresses and home telephone numbers of all such representatives.
(b)	Both parties recognize that all employees, including Union representatives, have regular duties to perform for the Employer. Both parties recognize that meetings will not be held on the Employer's time for wholly Union matters. Union representatives after arrangements with and permission from the foreman, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be allowed during their working hours, without loss of time or pay, to leave their regular duties within thirty (30) minutes for a reasonable length of time to investigate, adjust, write and present grievances or complaints within their own department, subject to the fact that this procedure shall not be abused by either party. If a Union representative is required to
- 6
leave his own department for Union business, he shall also be required to obtain the permission of a member of the Industrial Relations Department; or in their absence, permission may be obtained from the representative's immediate foreman.
If there is a dispute pertaining to abuse of this procedure by either party, discussions shall be held and if no agreement is reached, the matter shall be subject to grievance and arbitration procedures.
(c)	Union representatives up to six (6) in number shall be allowed reasonable time without loss of pay to attend meetings with Management or meetings mutually called by both parties. The Company shall recognize two skilled trade representatives (Bottling & Central Maintenance), one of which shall be included in the aforementioned "six (6)in number."
The Company and Union will meet once every three (3) weeks for the purpose of discussing grievances, complaints and matters of mutual concern. The Company further agrees to hold other meetings to deal with important issues such as suspensions and discharges at mutually agreeable times.
One union representative (eg. union president) shall be permitted to join the company representative during the "New Hire Orientation" process. Such union representative shall be compensated at their regular rate should the orientation be conducted during regular working hours.
The union shall appoint one representative from each -7-
trade, Should a jurisdictional/demarcation dispute arise over work assigned to Local 2027, one trade representative from each of the trades involved will meet with a management representative for the purpose of resolving said dispute.
(d)	Representatives of the National Union may attend meetings between the Industrial Relations Manager and the Grievance Committee. Such representatives may visit the plant during normal business hours to investigate pending grievances. All visits shall be of a reasonable duration. It is understood that permission must be obtained from the Industrial Relations Manager or his designate prior to such representative entering the plant. It is further understood that such representatives shall be subject to all plant rules and regulations while on the Employer's premises.
CLAUSE 6 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Employer shall have full authority in the operation of all branches of its business, including the right to employ any person it may see fit, to maintain discipline and enforce reasonable employment rules, and to discharge or suspend any employee who is in any way unsatisfactory to it; provided, however, it shall not discriminate against any member of the Union for a proper union activity nor shall this clause be interpreted to invalidate other portions of this contract. Upon request of the Union, the Employer shall advise the Union President
8
(or, his designate) upon request the reason(s) for any discharge or suspension.
CLAUSE 7 - WORKING SCHEDULE
The working schedule for all employees shall consist of not more than forty (40) hours per week divided into not more than eight (8) hours per day, Monday through Friday, except in the manufacturing departments including manufacturing maintenance where the schedule calls for Monday through Saturday operation.
The Employer agrees to post the various working schedules in appropriate locations within the plant by the preceding Wednesday of each week. If such schedules are to be changed, as much notice as possible of such change will be given.
CLAUSE 8 - OVERTIME
(a)	All time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the starting time of employees' various scheduled shifts, or forty (40) hours in any one week, shall be deemed to be overtime and shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half. It is understood that eight (8) hours in such twenty-four (24) hour period will be paid at straight time if worked. This time and one-half rate does not apply in the case of mutual arrangement between employees and the Employer on exchange of shifts, upon the request for such exchanges by employees. When shift workers are required to work
-9
overtime, the shift premium shall be added to the regular rate of pay and the overtime rate applied to the total thereof. The employee's basic shift shall determine the amount of shift premium applicable on overtime. In determining overtime compensation, employees shall receive credit for a regular work schedule on a holiday.
(b)	For Saturday work and work on a scheduled day off, the Employer shall pay all employees at the rate of time and one-half their regular rate and for Sunday work at the rate of double time their regular rate.
(c)	No employee shall be laid off during his or her regular working schedule to equalize any overtime which the employee has worked during the same working week or pay period.
(d)	Any overtime required in any department or classification shall be performed by employees of such department or classification if help is available. Overtime work will be equalized as far as possible.
(e)	Overtime work will be voluntary on the part of each employee and no employee will be disciplined for refusai to work overtime if someone else is available to do the work. The Employer may assign needed employees to work overtime in inverse order of seniority.
(f)	It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Employer is to equalize overtime as far as possible among its employees as herein set out.
- 10-
The Union understands that the Employer may on occasion make an honest error in selecting employees from the equalization lists for overtime work and agrees that, provided the Employer assigns at least an equal amount of overtime work to employees passed by through honest error within eight (8) calendar days or pays the overtime missed by the improper assignment, such honest error will not be cause for grievance.
(g)	Overtime will be distributed equally as far as possible according to department and classification if help is available.
(1)	An employee's classification, for the purpose of recording overtime, will be that classification which he or she holds (either permanent or temporary).
(2)	A Trades Group Leader shall not work on overtime to the extent that he replaces another tradesman.
(3)	When the company does not require a trades group leader to work overtime and where insufficient tradesmen have consented to work the required overtime, the company, prior to implementing Section (e) of this clause, will offer such overtime to the qualified trades group leader. Any overtime in such instance will be worked at the regular trades rate.
(4)	Anyone temporarily assigned or on loan to a classification shall not receive overtime in that classification until all regular classified
- ll ■
employees have been asked. All overtime hours worked in the classification will be charged against the employee's classification which he or she holds (either permanent or temporary).
(h)	When employees:
(1)	Transfer into a department as general help, or
(2)	Qualify in a classification, they will be charged with the average recorded overtime in their new classification within that department. From that date, they will be offered overtime in their turn.
(i)	Overtime of one hour or less need not be offered in rotation. Overtime in excess of one hour will be offered to employees with the least recorded overtime within the classification as far as possible and according to seniority when the overtime hours are equal. All overtime will be recorded.
(j)	(i) For the purpose of recording overtime, the
employee will be charged with the number of hours' pay involved at the regular hourly rate, e.g. eight (8) hours worked at one and one-half times the regular rate would be charged as twelve (12) hours' overtime. When an employee "doubles back" within a twenty-four (24) hour period and does not work in excess of eight (8) continuous hours, the resulting time and one-half payment will not be recorded for overtime equalization purposes. If in his new twenty-four
12
(24) hour period the employee works more than eight (8) hours, any time worked in excess of such eight (8) hours will be recorded for overtime equalization purposes. Employees who refuse to work overtime will be charged with the number of hours involved as if they had worked. (ii) Notwithstanding any of the forgoing subclauses, when an employee doubles back and works a full eight (8) hour shift within a twenty-four (24) hour period (commencing with the starting time of the employees' scheduled shifts), all time worked will be paid at one and a half time and will not be charged; all time worked over the aforesaid eight (8) hours will be paid at one and a half time and will be recorded for overtime equalization purposes. This sub clause shall supersede the provisions of clause 19.
(k)	(i) Many departments have developed their own
procedures regarding ordering meals and arranging for meal breaks and recesses. These current practices will be continued.
(ii) Employees required to work overtime in excess of one hour will receive a fifteen (15) minute break period at the conclusion of their regular work schedule. A fifteen (15) minute break period will be allowed at the conclusion of each two (2) hours of overtime.
(l)	Employees returning to work or to the classification to which they return after a leave of absence, suspension,
-13-
layoff, job posting, or transfer in excess of o,ne (1) week will be charged with the average recorded overtime in their classification if their recorded overtime hours are less than the average overtime hours in such classification and if overtime has been worked during their absence.
(m)	An employee who will be absent from work during a week, due to vacation or approved leave of absence, and who wishes to make himself available in the event weekend overtime occurs, must do so by completing a form supplied by the Company for that purpose. Such form is valid for the forthcomingweekend only and must be submitted in person to the employee's foreman prior to commencement of such vacation or approved leave of absence.
(n)	Employees absent in excess of one week because of illness or Jury Duty, or employees returning to work from a leave of absence for union business in excess of thirty (30) days will be charged with the lowest recorded overtime of a man currently working in their Classification provided their recorded overtime hours are less than the lowest in the classification and if overtime has been worked during their absence.
(o)	Department overtime lists showing classification, employee's name, seniority and number of overtime hours worked by each employee will be posted the day following each time overtime is worked in a place accessible to the view of employees.
14
(p)	Section A of this procedure covers departments which require supplementary procedures to cover specific problems, and such supplementary procedures shall prevail if there is a conflict with the overtime procedure outlined herein.
(q)	Section B of this procedure will cover such incidental matters as method of recording, notice to stewards, etc.
15 -
SECTION A
MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT
1.	If due to the absence of an employee overtime is necessary, in general it will be given to the classification in which it occurs until such time as a new schedule can be drawn up. In ail instances, equalizing of overtime will be given consideration.
2.	Overtime not in any definite classification will be offered to that employee in the department who has the least overtime or according to seniority when the overtime hours are equal, providing the employee is physically able and has the ability to do the job.
If the overtime referenced above pertains to the type of work normally performed by General Help during the day shift, this overtime will be offered to the eligible General Help employee. This would be overtime (eg. cleanup), following the General Help employees eight (8) hour day shift; overtime which heretofore would have been performed by an operator.
3.	Overtime in excess of one hour will be given to the operator already on duty when such overtime occurs on a regular operating shift due to the unexpected absence of the relief operator.
16
CEREAL PRODUCTS DEPARTMENT
'iS
1.	To be available for scheduled overtime, an employee normally must have eight consecutive hours off shift, both prior to working the overtime and before commencing his next scheduled shift.
2.	Unexpected overtime will be performed by the employees available at work when the overtime develops. Overtime required to complete the evaporator boil-out will be considered unexpected overtime.
3.	Eight hours overtime would not normally be split between two shifts, i.e. twelve hours each, unless in case of emergency due to illness, or other reasons such as lack of a suitable operator. Sixteen-hour shifts, for the purpose of equalizing overtime, will be avoided.
4.	For extraordinary cleanup, which is primarily operator's work, but where a knowledge of the equipment is desirable in the interests of safety to personnel and equipment, such as drilling tubes in the evaporators, or scraping tubes in the dryers, an operator from the classification directly involved would work, provided he is deemed not required to operate. The balance of the help would be drawn from general help by the regular procedure.
EMPLOYEES ON LOAN
Subject to (g) (4) of Clause 8, employees on loan to other departments work any overtime connected with their daily assignment.
When plant departments have insufficient help available to perform their required overtime work, additional overtime help will come from other plant departments. Overtime is offered in turn to the employees with the least recorded overtime in the department from which the help is requested.
BOTTLING MAINTENANCE
1.	On some jobs where training or experience is required, overtime personnel selection may not follow rotation.
2,	Personnel are allowed to finish a job on overtime which they have started on their regular shift (when and where necessary at supervisor's discretion), regardless of overtime position.
CENTRAL MAINTENANCE
Overtime will be offered as equally as possible considering the individual abilities and qualifications of the tradesmen involved and the requirements of the job.
Overtime will be posted forty-eight hours ahead of time whenever practicable within the Central Maintenance Department.
- 18 -
SECTTON B
1.	At the beginning of each calendar year, the employee with the lowest recorded overtime hours within a classification or department shall be recorded as having zero hours on the overtime list and the remaining employees in the classification or department shall have their recorded overtime hours adjusted accordingly.
e.g.	Dec.	31/77	Jan. 1/78
Ray Reid ............39	hrs.	6	1/2 hrs,
John Jones...........37	hrs.	4	1/2 hrs.
Sam Smith............32	'A hrs,	0	hrs.
2.	Employees will be requested to work overtime with as much notice as is possible. Whenever possible, at least 48 hours' notice will be given for scheduled overtime and 4 hours' notice for unscheduled overtime.
3,	Stewards will be given written notice of all overtime worked, or refused within their department on the working day following working of the overtime.
4.	Subject to paragraph #5 overtime hours worked or refused by an employee (providing an employee would have received overtime rates) will be charged against his or her recorded overtime hours.
5.	Hours worked by a "Tradesmen" - reporting to work as a result of an "Emergency Call In" - shall not be
19
charged. Tradesmen refusing the "Emergency Call In" will have the hours charged against recorded overtime hours.
CLAUSE 9 - VACATIONS

Employer for a period of at least one (1) year, but less than five (5) years, shall be eligible for a vacation of two (2) weeks.

21
(ii)	In connection with paragraph (f) (i) of this clause, the Company wishes to state that it will make every effort to allow employees to take vacations at the time desired. It must be recognized that when vacations are granted under these circumstances, senior employees will receive preferential consideration and the Company's ability to grant these vacations is dependent on the number of employees in the classification and department involved.
(g)	The Employer will post a notice to all employees each year, not later than February 1, setting out the planned dates for the July and Christmas shutdowns. The employees shall be required to notify the Employer of their preferences for their vacation period by March 1 each year or forfeit their seniority preference for vacation periods. A final schedule of vacation times for employees shall be posted by the Employer not later than April 14 of each year.
