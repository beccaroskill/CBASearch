LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
KORET CANADA INC.
AND
LOCAL 287 OF INTERNATIONAL LADIES GARMENT WORKERS UNION
CONCERNING THE
PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT STUDY PROGRAM
During the 1993 negotiations the parties devoted a good deal of time
discussing the ways to achieve a higher level of productivity and earnings in order to ensure the future success of the Company and benefit employees of Koret. It is mutually agreed and understood that both the Company and the Union should work together to seek new ways to accomplish this.
Therefore during the term of this new agreement, a joint partnership in the form of a committee will be formed in the first half of 1994 for this purpose. The committee will consist of at least one member of Koret's management and one member of the I.L.G.W.U.'s management plus one but not more than two bargaining unit employees from the factory.
The committee will undertake the task of looking into new methods, operations and production processes that are not being used at Koret but that do exist and are in practice in other companies and/or factories in our industry. This research, review and evaluation will include consideration of non-traditional team / modular and multicraft operations that have been proven to be successful in sewing factories with similar product and styles. The committee will attempt to select one or more of these methods to pilot in the Koret factory. After an appropriate measure of the results if such a new method is implemented, the committee will decide on a reasonable and practical formula for productivity gain sharing and/or additional incentive pay for the employees' of the section or department where such new method is implemented and proven to be profitable.
Every attempt will be made by both parties to contribute ideas and develop a way to pilot a program at Koret within the first two years of the new agreement.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
KORET CANADA INC.
AND
LOCAL 287 OF INTERNATIONAL LADIES’ GARMENT WORKERS’ UNION CONCERNING REQUEST FOR EDUCATION LEAVE
During the 1993 negotiations the subject of education leave for the purpose of attending classes for English as a second language was discussed. Koret endorses the concept and respects the reason behind this proposal.
Therefore, as a result of those discussions, the Company agrees to consider such leaves, without loss of seniority, for properly approved and authorized ESL courses as a means of supporting the union's request to allow employees the opportunity to better themselves. Such request will only be considered for employees who have more than one year of service and whose release for a limited amount of time, to be determined by the Company, would not create a hardship or otherwise disrupt production operations, As pointed out in the meeting, the Company must also control the number of employees that could be released. Employees would not be allowed to use such leaves for any other purpose other than that described above.
