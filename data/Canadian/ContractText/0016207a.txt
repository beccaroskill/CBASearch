fluctuating Wages February 2002
{Modified October 16, 2003)
In keeping with the Company’s initiative of ensuring the Myra Falls Operation becomes and remains financially viable, the following fluctuating wage scale has been developed for implementation during periods of low revenues due to reduced metal prices or unfavorable currency exchange rates.
Although we can control our costs and production, we do not control four of the main external elements that affect revenues for the Mine. These are world prices for Copper, Zinc and Gold (as determined by the London Metal Exchange), and US/CDN exchange rates. Changes in metal prices or exchange rate directly affect the cash available to pay for the operating expenses of the mine.
The Company’s yearly budget incorporates copper, zinc and gold prices, and an exchange rate. Metal prices that forced the shut down, and current prices are at unacceptable levels to support our operating cost structure and production plans. ii 2002 we hope that these key components will average $.75 for copper, $.43 for Zinc, $267.00 for gold, and the exchange rate will average at least $1.50 (budget levels), which combined with the other measures being undertaken to improve our cash flow, will provide the necessary bottom line results for operation. Unfortunately, current metal prices are significantly below required levels. The following mechanism will help to offset the impacts of fluctuating metal prices and exchange.
Budgeted prices and exchange have been combined to create a ’’base line”, calculated as follows:
((Cu price + (Zn price x 4) (ratio of product mix)) 5 (ratio of product mix) + (Au price + 267 (budget price) x 2.5 (ratio of product mix)) x Exch. Rate = Price Factor
Using the 2002 budget numbers, the base tine calculation for this year will be:
(75 + (43 x 4)) = 247	5 + (267/267 x2.5)= 51.9 x 150 = 77.9
The formula will be recalculated at the end of each month using the average rates for the month just ended. If the new calculation reflects a number that is below the base line number of 77.9, wage rates (2003 wage rates in the Collective Agreement), will be reduced by 1.% for each one unit change in the calculation, (rounded to the nearest decimal point), to a maximum of 10%. Effective January 1, 2004 the maximum will be 7.5%.
If the new calculation reflects a number that is above the base line number of 77.9, wage rates will be increased by 0.5% for each one unit change in the calculation, (rounded to the nearest decimal point), to a maximum of 10%. Increases or decreases will be applied to the pay periods that commence in the month following the calculation. Effective January 1, 2004 the maximum will be 7.5%
The following examples are for demonstration purposes.
				Calculation		Adjustment	
Cu	Zn	Au	Exch	Factor	Var.from 77.9	Units	%
65	35	267	1.55	67.43	-10.48	-10	-10.0
67	37	295	1.59	72.76	-5.14	-5.1	-5.1
67	37	267	L 1-59	72.35	-5.56 _	-5.6	-5.6
75	43	267	1.5	77.85	-0.05	0	0.0
80	45	295	1.55	84.88	6.98	3.5	3.5
85	47	295	1.55	88.91	11.01	5.5	5.5
Note: A percentage reduction in wages does not translate into an equivalent reduction in net take home pay because employees will pay less taxes. For example, an employee with basic tax deductions grossing $2,500 dollars in a pay period (bi-weekly), will receive a net take home pay of $1,747.51 (after income tax, CPP, and El deductions). If the gross pay is reduced by 10% ($250), the net take home pay is $1,597.89 (a reduction cf $149.62 or 6%).
This fluctuating wage program will remain in effect until June 30, 2004, at which time itwill be deemed null and void and notsubjectto the provisions of Article 4.02.
