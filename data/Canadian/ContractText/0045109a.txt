Vacations will be granted at such times through the calendar year as is found most suitable, considering both the wishes of the employees and the Company.
Vacations will be scheduled in such a manner as to provide for even distribution of the number of people who are absent due to vacation.
Vacation weeks will begin on Sunday, however, the Company may permit a change, if practical, for individual employees. Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their department scheduler.
Vacation lists will be posted prior to October 1st for the first time frame, and prior to April 1st for the second time frame.
Preference will be indicated in advance, in writing, on the Vacation Request Form, and separated into two time frames of January 1st to the 2nd Sunday in June, and the 2nd Sunday in June to December 31st. The deadline is September 30th 4:00 p.m. for the first time frame and March 1st 4:00 p.m. for the second time frame.
Protest of assignment of vacation dates must be made within two weeks following the posting of the lists. Otherwise, allotted dates will be assumed as correct.

3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this process is not filled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this time, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.
4.	It is understood that the process of shift balancing under item 3 above may result in overtime being moved between shifts.
5.	In the event that there is a vacation opening that becomes available after the vacation scheduling process is complete because of the cancellation of scheduled vacation, the senior employee(s) on the shift involved who are on the vacation waiting list will be offered such openings.

Company and Union.
A.	Union Representation
1.

1.	The Company and the Union agree that the President and the Chief Steward and the Certified Union Safety Representative will work day shift during the incumbents’ term of office.

It is understood that either party may terminate the above portion (refers to B. 1. portion) should it become unsatisfactory.
3.	Assignments of extra shifts to the Chief Steward, the President, and the Certified Union Safety Representative will be on day shift only, according to the following guidelines:

They will be assigned hours by taking the next senior person’s hours, once per shift. The Chief Steward, President of the Union and Certified Union Safety Representative will only use their overtime hours on whichever shift is on days, “A”, “B”, “C”, or Core shift, he/she is scheduled for that week. They will be charged hours by the same rules as per 6:04 R. Charging of Hours and/or 6:10 I. 9. Charged Hours and Overtime Policy. They will have no rights to the afternoon shift or night shift, but will be charged hours on the afternoon or night shift by the same rules as per 6:04 R. Charging of Hours, and/or 6:10 I. 9. Charged Hours and Overtime Policy.
C.	In cases where the Human Resources Department requests the attendance of the Chief Steward and it
is necessary to call this person into work, the Company will pay the hours involved. The decision of
payment will be the exclusive right of the Company.
D.	1. If an employee on weekend work accepts the President, Chief Steward, or the Certified Union
Safety Representative position or an employee already holding the President, Chief Steward, or the Certified Union Safety Representative position successfully bids a Weekend Worker position his/her Weekend Worker job would be posted as a temporary bid and held until he/she no longer hold these positions.

How to Make a Claim
Written proof of all claims must be submitted to the Benefits Carrier within twelve (12) months of the date the expense was incurred. When your coverage terminates for any reason, written proof of claim must be given within ninety (90) days of the date of termination of coverage.
Drug Claims
You will be provided a drug card. This will provide your pharmacist with immediate confirmation of covered drug expenses. To fill a prescription for covered drug expenses:
1.	Present your Drug Card to the pharmacist at the time of purchase; and
2.	Pay $2.00 for each eligible prescription.
S. 15:03
104
You will be required to pay the full cost of the prescription at time of purchase if:
1.	You cannot locate a participating pharmacy.
2.	You do not have your Drug Card with you at the time.
You are encouraged to obtain a three (3) month supply of maintenance medication if available, as it
will reduce the number of trips you have to make to the pharmacy as well as overall plan costs. For
details on how to receive reimbursement after paying the full cost of the prescription, please contact
the Benefits Carrier.
Extended Health Care and Dental Care Claims
1.	All Claim Forms, available from the HR service centre and London Health Centre, must be correctly completed, dated and signed. Remember to always provide your Group Plan Number and Employee Identification number (found on your Drug Card) to avoid any unnecessary delays in the processing of your claim.
2.	You may also obtain Claim Forms from the Benefits Carrier’s website and may sign up for direct deposit of claim reimbursement. The HR service centre or a Union Benefit Representative can assist you with information about direct deposit as well as in properly completing the forms, and answering any questions you may have about the claims process and your Group Benefits Program.
3.	In the case of dental claims, some dentists may file your claim electronically. In order for you to learn in advance what cost sharing there may be, it is recommended that a Treatment Plan be filed whenever the total cost of the proposed dental work is expected to exceed $300.
4.	After completing the appropriate form, you can mail your claims directly to the Benefits Carrier or drop them off at the London Health Centre for direct courier to the Benefits Carrier.
5.	Remember to keep copies of all forms and attachments submitted to the Benefits Carrier.
6.	You should receive settlement of your claim within three (3) weeks from the date of submission to the Benefits Carrier. If you have not received payment, please contact the Benefits Carrier.
7.	You may also view your claim payments on-line as well as see when any maximums have been reached and when next you may be reimbursed for vision care.
Out-of-Province/Out-of-Canada Claims
1.	The Travel Assistance service arranges for the payment of eligible emergency medical expenses in excess of $200. If you do not contact the Travel Assistance service before the medical expenses are incurred, or as soon as you are medically fit to contact them, you may be responsible for paying the entire expense and submitting the claim for reimbursement to the Benefits Carrier which will then coordinate payment with the provincial government health insurance plan (if applicable).
2.	If medical expenses are $200 or less, you are responsible for paying the expense and submitting the claim for reimbursement to the Benefits Carrier which will then coordinate payment with the provincial government health insurance plan (if applicable).
3.	You will be asked to sign an Authorization Form, allowing the Benefits Carrier to co-ordinate payment of the claim on your behalf through your provincial government health insurance plan and the Benefits Carrier.
S. 15:03
105
4.	If required, Travel Assistance will forward an advance deposit to the hospital before medical services as rendered. If payments made on your behalf are subsequently determined to be for ineligible services or amounts, the Benefits Carrier reserves the right to recover the overpayment from you.
Co-Ordination of Medical and Dental Care Benefits
If you or your eligible dependents are covered for similar benefits under another Plan, the Benefits Carrier will take this into account when determining the amount of expenses payable under this program. This process is known as Co-ordination of Benefits. It allows for reimbursement of covered medical and dental expenses from all Plans, up to a total of 100% of the actual expense incurred.
Order of Benefit Payment:
A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the "Primary Payer" (i.e. responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the "Secondary Payer" (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).
1.	If the other Plan does not provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, it will be considered as the Primary Payer, and will be responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense.
2.	If the other Plan does provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, the following rules are applied to determine which Plan is the Primary Payer.
a)	For claims incurred by you or your dependent spouse, the Plan covering you or your dependent spouse as an employee/member pays benefits before the Plan covering you or your spouse as a dependent.
b)	In situations where you or your spouse have coverage as an employee/member under more than one Plan, the order of benefit payment will be determined as follows:
•	The Plan where the person is covered as an active full-time employee, then
•	The Plan where the person is covered as an active part-time employee, then
•	The Plan where the person is covered as a retiree.
3.	For Claims incurred by your dependent child, the Plan covering the parent whose birthday (month/ day) is earlier in the calendar year pays benefits first. If both parents have the same birth date, the Plan covering the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet pays first.
4.	However, if you and your spouse are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
•	The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
•	The Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child (i.e. if the parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the dependent child), then
•	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
•	The Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child (i.e. if the parent without custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the dependent child).
S. 15:03
106
5.	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Care Plans.
6.	If the order of benefit payment cannot be determined from the above, the benefits payable under each Plan will be in proportion to the amount that would have been payable if Co-ordination of Benefits did not exist.
Submitting a Claim for Co-Ordination of Benefits
To submit a claim when Co-ordination of Benefits applies, refer to the following guidelines:
1.	As per the Order of Benefit Payments section, determine which Plan is the Primary Payer and which is the Secondary Payer.
2.	Submit all necessary claim forms and original receipts to the Primary Payer.
3.	Keep a photocopy of each receipt prior to submitting your claim to the Primary Payer.
4.	Once your claim has been settled by the Primary Payer, you will receive a statement outlining how your claim has been handled. Submit the statement along with all necessary claim forms and copies of the receipts to the Secondary Payer for further consideration or payment, if applicable.
Section 15:08

Regular full-time employees are automatically included in the Retirement Plan after completing one year of continuous service.
S. 15:03
107
C.	Normal Retirement Pension
1.	Normal retirement is on the first day of the month immediately following your sixty-fifth (65th) birthday.
2.	This plan provides a pension income at age sixty-five (65), based on your credited or length of service in any year as follows:
Hours Worked	Credited Service
0-149	0 year
150-299	1/10 year
300-449	2/10 year
450-599	3/10 year
600-749	4/10 year
750-899	5/10 year
900-1,049	6/10 year
1,050-1,199	7/10 year
1,200-1,349	8/10 year
1,350-1,499	9/10 year
1,500 or more	1 year
3.	For employees suffering from long term illness (over thirty [30] days), up to fifteen hundred (1500) banked hours may be withdrawn over a three (3) year period, in order to supplement credited service for pension purposes.
D.	At age sixty-five (65), your monthly retirement income benefit will be equal to the monthly pension amount in effect, multiplied by your years of credited service since January 1st, 1980.
Monthly Defined Benefit			
	April 5, 2009	January 1, 2010	April 4, 2011
Single Pension Group	$75.00	$79.00	$79.00
1.	This plan covers only your service with the Company from January 1st, 1980. Your pension is calculated by multiplying your years of service by the appropriate amount shown in the table above, which will equal your monthly amount.
2.	Any pension benefits you may have earned from former plans are in addition to the pension from this Retirement Income Plan.
E.	Annual Benefits Statement
Your Annual Benefits Statement shows your pension earned to date and estimates your pension for future service based on your current earnings. These levels may change each year and your estimated total pension will change accordingly. The nearer you get to age sixty-five (65), the more accurate the total estimated pension on your benefits statement will be.
S. 15:10
108
F.	Early Retirement
You may retire and receive a pension any time after reaching age fifty-five (55). Certain subsidies may apply according to your years of service and your age.
1.	If age fifty-five (55) or over and age plus years of service total eighty-five (85) or more, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension with no reduction.
2.	Furthermore, you receive a Bridge Benefit of $12.00 a month for each year of service to a maximum of $360.00 a month. This Bridge Benefit is paid until age sixty-five (65) at which time the government pensions begin.
3.	With twenty (20) years of service, but age plus years of service are less than eighty-five (85), your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced. The reduction is 2% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62), down to age sixty (60) and then 4% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty (60).
4.	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62). There are no adjustments to the calculation after age sixty-two (62).
G.	Pension Payment Options
1.	Spousal
a)	If you have a spouse when you retire, the Pension Benefits Act states that your pension must be paid on a joint and survivor basis with at least 60% of the pension payable to you continuing to your spouse after your death, should your spouse survive you.
b)	The normal pension fund distribution if you take the spousal option is 90/60%. The retiree will collect 90% of his/her pension until death and then their spouse will collect 60% of the pension until death.
c)	If you have a spouse but wish to select a form other than the Joint and 60% Survivor form then you and your spouse must sign a Spousal Waiver form.
2.	Life Only
If you do not have a spouse when you retire, the normal form of pension is "Life Only" which means that payments stop when you die.
3.	Guaranteed 5, 10 or 15 Years
Under each of these options, the pension is payable for as long as you live. If you should die before the guaranteed period ends, pension payments are continued to your beneficiary for the balance of the guaranteed period.
H.	Termination of Benefits
1.	If you leave the Company after completing three (3) or more years of service you will be entitled to a deferred pension payable at age sixty-five (65).
2.	You may elect to transfer the commuted present value of the earned pension to a "locked-in" vehicle. Locked-in pension amounts must be used to purchase a life annuity at retirement unless paid as a death benefit prior to retirement.
3.	You will be 100% vested for all earned benefits in this Plan as well as any benefits you may have earned from former plans, after three (3) years of service for full-time employees.
S. 15:10
109
4.	You earn one year of service for each year you have worked fifteen hundred (1500) hours in a calendar year.
I.	If You Die Before Retirement
1.	If you have less than two (2) years of participation in the Plan, there is no death benefit. If you should die after completing two (2) or more years of participation in the Plan, your beneficiary or estate will receive the value of your pension accrued at date of death.
2.	In addition, any death benefits from previous plans would be payable.
J.	Special Disability Provision
If you become disabled, you may be entitled to receive a Disability Retirement Benefit provided you have at least ten (10) years of continuous service. This will be based on your accrued pension at the time you become disabled. The Plan will pay a monthly pension as though you had retired at the time you become disabled.
K.	If You Die During Retirement
If you elected at the time of retirement to provide a continuing payment to your spouse or beneficiary in the event of your death and the conditions of that payment are still applicable, payment will be made to them as you directed. If you retired prior to age sixty-five (65) and were receiving a bridge benefit at the time of your death this payment would not continue to your spouse or beneficiary.
L.	Weekly Indemnity
Suspension of pension credit accrual except for absences in excess of thirty (30) consecutive days -may draw "banked hours” to a maximum of fifteen hundred (1500) hours every three (3) years.

Stock Purchase Plan
A. Features of the Plan
1. Kellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder of Kellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 U.S. per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars, which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan.
S. 15:11
114
Shares will be purchased by Wells Fargo for employees on the open market. Dividends are reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
2. Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for:
a)	Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.)
b)	However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and payment to the Wells Fargo will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Wells Fargo a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
c)	Wells Fargo will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the Plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Wells Fargo protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
B.	How the Plan Works
1.	You may sign up to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the Payroll Deduction Form (see your Human Resources office). The following guidelines apply:
a)	Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this Stock Purchase Plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes significantly in foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this minimum amount may have to be changed.
b)	Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S. (in total) per year.
c)	A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
d)	The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
e)	Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
f)	You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Wells Fargo will be refunded to you.
2.	Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at the time of each dividend payment. Since dividends are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three (3) decimal places.
3.	Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
S. 15:14
115

Eligibility
Beginning October 1, 2009 any employee who meets the eligibility criteria, outlined below, prior to the expiration of the Collective Agreement, will be eligible for the early retirement incentive:
• The employee is within three (3) years of being eligible for full, unreduced retirement; or

•	Eligible employees electing to take the early retirement incentive will remain on active employee extended health care, dental, and life insurance benefits through the severance period ending at the employee’s full, unreduced retirement date.
•	Eligibility for retiree benefits will be based on an employee’s full, unreduced retirement date, including determining any cost sharing for eligible dependents.

Dear Mr. Martin:
Subject:
Great West Life Policy 157948
Global Medical Assistance London Hourly
Per the letter that was issued by Great West Life, dated March 31, 2006, we confirm
that an extensive review was completed regarding the Out-of-Pro vince/Out-of-
Country (Global Medical Assistance) benefit plan details in the prior coliective
agreement language (2003), the pnor benefit carrier contract (Manulife) and the
current governing contract (GWL).
We confirm that while Great West Life currently purchased the Global Medical
Assistance benefit from a different vendor than was used by Manulife, the intent is to
provide identical benefits
Therefore, we confirm that the Global Medical Assistance
benefit details outlined in the 2003/2006 collective agreement and prior benefit carrier
contract, will continued to be eligible for payments under the above Great-West Life
Plan.
We trust that this confirmation alleviates any concerns you may have had with
respect to the coverage that is in place for the membership.
Yours truly,
Ct\

Dear Mr. Martin:
Subject:	Great West Life ASO Plan 55489-2
London Hourly Dental Benefit
Per the letter that was issued by Great West Life, dated March 19, 2006, we confirm that an extensive review was completed regarding the prior collective agreement language (2003) and the current governing plan document.
This will confirm that the dental procedures outlined in the 2003/2006 collective agreement, which are detailed in the hourly benefits booklet, have been aligned for claim payment purposes under the appropriate sections of the plan document and are covered under the above Great-West Life Plan. Otherwise, the plan document remains the governing document per section 15:01 (A) of the collective agreement.
We trust that this confirmation alleviates any concerns you may have had with respect to the coverage that is in place for the membership.
Yours truly,

Dear Melodie:
Subject:	Great West Life Policy ASO Plan 55489-2
Kellogg Canada Inc. London Hourly Dental Plan
You will recall that in transitioning the group benefits plan at October 2005, Great-West Life duplicated the plan document language of the prior carrier (Manulife Financial).
With respect to the Dental benefit, Great-West Life also reviewed the collective agreement in effect at plan inception to ensure that services listed were aligned under the appropriate sections of the plan document for the purpose of paying claims. In other words, the services in the collective agreement were matched to their respective points/service summaries in the plan document, which is the governing document per Section 15:01(A) of the collective agreement.
Based on the draft benefits booklet we have been provided to date, we can confirm that although not specifically identified in the plan document, the dental services as outlined in the benefits booklet match the services and reimbursement levels coded on our claims system.
We would be pleased to address any questions you may have in this regard.
Yours truly,
Brian Galt

Dear Melodic:
Subject: Great West Life Policy 157948GMA-2
Kellogg Canada Inc. Global Medical Assistance London Hourly
From a contract issue standpoint, Great West Life separates the insured benefits from those which are funded or an Administrative Services Only (ASO) basis, even within the medical benefit itself. The Global Medical Assistance (GMA) benefit is fully insured.
You will note that the style of the GMA policy is different to that of the ASO document. This is due to the fact that we duplicated the prior carrier’s language in the latter (and included updates/clarification where appropriate). Carriers purchase their travel assistance product from a vendor (Great West Life uses Medex Corp.), and as such the language of the product itself is fixed as it applies to all groups with travel assistance in their portfolio.
We are pleased to confirm that in the unlikely event that there is a gap between the prior vendor’s contractual amount available for payout and ours, we will bridge that gap provided that proper claim documentation is submitted.
We invite you to contact us in the event that you have any questions in this regard.
Yours truly.
