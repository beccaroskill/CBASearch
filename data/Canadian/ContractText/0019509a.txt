OVERTIME BANKING
Banked time is established to allow employees the opportunity to take time off without loss of pay. It is available to those employees who have completed their probationary period.
Employees working overtime may elect, at the time the overtime is worked, to bank the overtime instead of receiving payment.
Overtime hours worked will be banked at the applicable overtime rate (ie. two (2) hours overtime worked at one and one-half (1 1/2) times = three (3) hours banked at straight time).
Only overtime worked over and above your normal work schedule, overtime worked on a Statutory Holiday, or overtime which is paid at overtime rates under 8.05 (a), may be banked. (Training hours, all hours described in Articles 8.08 (a) i), 8.08 (b) and 8.10 cannot be banked).
Employees may accumulate a maximum of ninety-six (96) hours straight time at any given time.
92
Employees may take a maximum of ninety-six (96) hours banked time off in any calendar year. Banked time off may be broken into blocks of hours at a time, provided it is mutually agreed to between the parties. Accrued banked overtime hours may be carried over into the next calendar year, but the maximum of ninety-six (96) hours banked time off in any calendar year applies.
If the scheduling of banked time off conflicts with the scheduling of vacation, vacation requests received prior to February 15th will be given preference.
93
Preference for banked time off will be determined on the basis of Company seniority within the department of those employees whose applications for banked time off are received by February 15th in each year. Banked time off requests received after February 15th will be allocated, based on the dates they are received, on a first received, first scheduled basis.
The Company will grant banked time off at times most preferable to employees, provided that such requests do not unreasonably interfere with the requirements of operations.
An employee may request one (1) pay-out of banked time per calendar year.
All banked time will be paid out upon termination.
Hours will be banked at the employee's base hourly rate and hours will be paid out at the rate they were banked. Any rate overrides associated with working in a higher classification associated with the overtime hours banked will be paid in the pay period earned.
