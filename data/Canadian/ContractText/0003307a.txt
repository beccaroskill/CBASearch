12.03	(a) Seniority will be applied on a Company wide basis in
recalls, promotions, transfers from camp to camp and layoffs.
When layoffs are required due to the completion of seasonal operations, or a part thereof, each of the employees so affected will be permitted to exercise his seniority and transfer to a job, within the same Zone, for which he is qualified, provided that, having received advance notice in accordance with Section 12.04, he advises the Company, prior to the effective date of the advance notice and in writing on forms to be supplied by the Company, of his desire to transfer or to be laid off.
The Company will provide the Union Grievance Committee, prior to the intended layoff, with a list of jobs filled in the Zone by employees with less seniority than those employees given notice.

An employee wishing to exercise his seniority rights in another zone must make application to the Company's Employment Office within the three (3) consecutive work days immediately following the date of layoff, either in person or by letter postmarked during that period, otherwise he forfeits his right to bump on that occasion.

The parties mutually agree to the following process, which provides for utilization of contractors on the Company's Limits and worksites as per Article 3.01 (a) & (b) of the Collective Agreement.
The parties agree to delete the current Letter of Understanding on Employees of Contractors originally dated July 25, 1997, and renewed June 6, 1999, effective on the ratification of this Agreement.
All active employees currently on the Bowater seniority list that were hired by the respective contractors to work on Bowater limits, will be Bowater employees (non-protected). In addition, all inactive nonprotected employees currently on the Bowater seniority list will become Bowater employees (non-protected) when and if, they are recalled within two (2) years of signing this Agreement.
The above group of employees is listed on Appendix #1 (see original letter on file for details Aug. 2, 2001).
Forty percent (40%) of the persons engaged in woods operations on the Limits and worksites of the Company that supply wood fibre to Bowater mills shall be Bowater employees who may be under the direction of a Limit Contractor. Limit Contractors are defined as contractors on Bowater Canadian Forest Products Inc. - Thunder Bay Woodlands Operations limits who employ and supervise workers on
- 122 -
the Bowater seniority list and who do not have separate Collective Agreements with I.W.A. Canada, Local 2693, or are operating under a Third Party Agreement, as per Article 3:01 (c).
In addition, this Agreement and/or Letter does not change or impact upon the Remote Contractors Letter of Understanding, Article 3.01 (c) of the Collective Agreement, or the Letter of Understanding on protected employees including any previous practices with respect to protected employees.
The balance of persons engaged in woods operations on the Limits and worksites of the Company that supply wood fibre to Bowater mills may be employed by Additional Contractors.
1.	Additional Contractors will initially include but are not limited to the following:
a)	Shuniah Forest Products Ltd.
b)	Firesteel Contractors Limited
c)	Upsala Forest Products Limited
d)	Rigato Contracting Inc.
The above group of initial “Additional Contractors” will continue to maintain their individual owner/operator arrangements as may be required and determined by the respective contractors.
2.	These Additional Contractors will be required to each have a separate Memorandum of Agreement with I.W.A. Canada as outlined in Appendix 2 - Sample 1 & 2 [attached].
3.	Additional Contractors can be added as necessary after discussion with the Union and each will be required to have a Memorandum of Agreement with I.W.A. Canada as noted above. The Agreement will not be unreasonably withheld by the Union. Conversely, any Additional Contractor could be deleted with due regard for overall seniority as outlined below.
- 123 -
4.	All workers employed under the Additional Contractor Agreement will, in all respects, be employees of the Additional Contractors.
5.	Employees of these Additional Contractors will be paid and provided benefits through their respective Contractors on their payrolls.
6.	Employees of these Additional Contractors will be maintained on seniority lists specific to that Contractor.
7.	There will be one (1) overall seniority list of all Additional Contractor employees covered under this Letter of Understanding with respective lists provided by the Contractors to Bowater who will maintain the overall seniority list. The parties will mutually agree on a protocol for determining the initial overall seniority list. Bowater shall supply the overall seniority list to I.W.A. Canada.
a)	There will be no bumping by employees between Additional Contractors.
b)	If an employee on lay-off from one of the Additional Contractors elects to fill a vacant position with one (1) of the other Additional Contractors and is successful, he will maintain his right of recall to his previous position with the former Additional Contractor for a period of one
(1)	year.
c)	In the event an Additional Contractor operation ceases to exist (i.e., goes out of business or shuts down for an extended period of time), the Company will first determine the operational impact and requirements and implement one (1) of the following:
i)	If it is determined the Additional
Contractor operation needs to be replaced, the Company will undertake to replace the Additional Contractor. The affected employees will be given first
- 124 -
preference for employment with the “new” Additional Contractor subject to seniority and qualifications.
ii)	If it is determined the Additional
Contractor does not need to be replaced, affected employees will be given first preference in filling vacancies with other Additional Contractor operations subject to seniority and qualifications.
8.	Employees interested in moving to another Additional Contractor operation will be required to contact Bowater's administration office and have their name added to a list for consideration. When a vacancy becomes available, interested employees will be contacted subject to seniority and qualifications.
Employees awarded with and filling a vacancy with another Additional Contractor as outlined above will be placed at the bottom of the seniority list with that Additional Contractor and will be removed from the seniority list of his former Contractor after successfully completing the thirty (30) day probationary period.
9.	In all cases these employees will continue to maintain their seniority for the purpose of benefits, vacation pay, severance pay and filling vacancies as outlined above.
10.	Additional Contractors will be responsible for all their Grievances and will be required to follow the Grievance procedure as outlined in the Bowater Collective Agreement.
Bowater will only be involved prior to Arbitration for the purpose of ensuring compliance with Bowater policies and standards.
- 125 -
The above Agreement is subject to the respective approvals by all parties concerned and will not be the subject of negotiations during the renewal of the next Collective Agreement but will remain in full force and affect during the period of the next Collective Agreement. In doing so the parties shall select one (1) Arbitrator who shall deal with all Grievances and Arbitrations pertaining to this Letter for the remainder of this Agreement and for the term of the next Agreement. The Arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon in advance and will be required to review the above Agreement with the parties to ensure its content and intent is fully understood prior to ratification by the respective parties.

Dear Sir:
Re: Dental Plan
This letter will confirm our understanding regarding the continuation of coverage for an employee who is off work due to lay-off or Leave of Absence.
This Company's interpretation shall be to the effect that, provided a prescribed course of treatment has commenced prior to the end of the month following the month in which lay-off or Leave of Absence has occurred, services provided under the prescribed course of treatment will be covered under the terms and benefits of the plan.
A course of treatment is defined as a planned program of one or more procedures or services, rendered by one or more dentists, for the correction of a dental condition diagnosed by the attending dentist as the result of an oral examination. The course of treatment begins on the date a dentist first renders treatment to correct the diagnosed dental condition. (It should be remembered that whenever the charges of a dentist for a proposed course of treatment are expected to be $200.00 or more, the treatment program must be filed (through use of the normal claim form) with the Company prior to the commencement of the course of treatment.)
