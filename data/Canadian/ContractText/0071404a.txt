ARTICLE V
Grievance Procedure
5.01 The employee who has a complaint shall refer it to his/her immediate supervisor either directly or through his/her union representative. If the complaint is not satisfactorily settled, it may then be treated as a grievance and may be reduced to writing, dated and approved by the proper Union official. The grievor's supervisor or department/area manager shall acknowledge the request for a grievance meeting by signing the grievance form in the appropriate place. A copy of the dated and signed grievance will be provided to the supervisor at the time of his/her acknowledgment of the grievance. The grievance thereafter shall be processed through the following channels in sequence.
Step 1
The Department steward and Vice-President and/or his/her authorized representative and the Department/Area Manager of the grievor's department and/or his/her authorized representative. A steward shall be a member of the department which s/he represents. However, in the case of a small department, a steward can be a member of another department.
Step 2
The Department steward, President, Vice-President and/or their authorized representative(s) and the Department Head of the grievor's department and/or his/her authorized representative(s).
If a steward, at Step #1 or #2, is away from the plant and will either not be available within a reasonable period of time to negotiate the grievance, or it is desired that the grievance be processed without undue delay, the President, Vice-President and/or their authorized representative(s) may be substituted.
Step 3
The Department steward and/or a member or members of the bargaining committee and the Manager Industrial Relations and the Plant Manager and/or their authorized representatives. A staff representative shall attend upon request of the Union.
Step 4
Any grievance arising from the interpretation, application, administration, or alleged violation of the Agreement, including incentive standards, which has not been settled under the grievance procedure including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable may within, but not more than forty-five (45) calendar days after completion of Step #3 be submitted to arbitration by either party. When either party to this Agreement requests that a grievance be submitted to arbitration, they make such request in writing, and address same to the other party. Such request shall contain insofar as possible, a complete and accurate statement of the grievance matter to be arbitrated. Within five (5) calendar days of receipt of this notice, each party shall appoint an arbitrator, and notify the other party of its appointee. The two arbitrators so appointed shall select a chairman of the arbitration board within five (5) calendar days. In the event of failure to agree upon a chairman, either or both parties shall make application to the Minister of Labour for Ontario, asking that s/he nominate a chair-
man.
5.02	A decision by the majority of the arbitration board shall be final and binding upon both parties and the employees.
5.03	Each of the parties shall pay the charges and expenses of its appointees. The charges and expenses of the chairman of the arbitration board (if any) shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union.
5.04	The arbitration board shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify, or amend any part of the Agreement. Unless mutually agreed, no matter may be submitted to arbitration which has not been properly carried through all previous steps of the grievance procedure.
5.05	(a) In all cases of arbitration, a single arbitrator will be substituted for a Board of Arbitration provided for in this Article V unless the Union and the Company mutually agree to proceed by means of a Board of Arbitration.
(b) In all cases of substitution of a single arbitrator for a Board of Arbitration, as outlined in subsection (a) above, all other applicable provisions of Article V will continue to apply so far as they are relevant.
5.06	Grievances on occupational hourly rate ceilings and base rates in effect on the effective date of this Agreement are not subject to arbitration. Grievances pertaining to hourly rates under ceilings and new base rates established after the effective date of this Agreement (except those rates affected by general wage adjustments) shall be subject to the arbitration procedure as defined in STEP 4 except that in such instances a single arbitrator will be substituted for the arbitration board.
This arbitrator will be selected by agreement between the parties or by the Minister of Labour for Ontario if the parties fail to agree on their selection within five (5) days after either party files a request for arbitration of the grievance, and s/he shall be a member of a reputable industrial engineering company and knowledgeable in the field of Industrial Engineering.
5.07	On a question pertaining to incentive standards and/or the application or cancellations of fixed process allowances for physically restricted increments of time and variable process allowance schedules in connection with an incentive standard, the Company and Union arbitrators shall appoint a reputable industrial engineering company for advice and counsel. Failing agreement on such appointment, the Chairman of the arbitration board shall make the appointment.
The Company so selected shall be required to make a thorough time study of the standard and/or process allowance schedule that is questioned before reporting to the Board. The charges and expenses of the industrial engineering company shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union.
5.08	Any difference between the Company and the Union as to the interpretation of this Agreement and any allegation by either party that the other has violated any terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be a grievance. In the event that such interpretation affects all employees in the bargaining unit, it shall be presented originally in STEP 3 of the grievance procedure.
5.09	Meetings will be arranged promptly in accordance with clause 5.13 to suit the convenience of the parties, but insofar as possible not to interfere with working hours. A block of time shall be set aside each week (if needed), mutually agreed to by both parties, to deal with outstanding third step grievances. An aggrieved employee may be required to attend a meeting by either party. However, no more than one employee shall be requested to attend a meeting unless it is mutually felt that more than one is necessary.
5.10	If a problem arises requiring a steward to contact employees during working hours, such contact shall be arranged by the steward through either the immediate supervisor or the Department/Area Manager concerned.
5.11	Executive Officers of the Union, Stewards and authorized local Union representatives (a current list to be provided by the Union) shall be permitted to enter the plant when off shift for the purpose of investigating grievances or conducting Union business. Before entering the plant, s/he shall comply with Company security regulations then in effect which regulations currently provide as follows:
1)	He shall register with the security guard and be issued a pass.
2)	He shall present his/her pass to the supervisor of the employee to be interviewed and secure his/her permission to contact the employee so that the least possible delay will result. Such pass shall be signed by the supervisor designating the time of entry and departure from the department.
3) Upon his/her departure from the plant, s/he shall register out and surrender his/her pass to the security guard.
5.12	Within three (3) working days excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, after receiving a dated grievance, supervision shall answer in writing giving the necessary information to show the solution or the action being taken toward the solution of the grievance.
5.13	A request for a meeting on a grievance may be written and if in writing, it shall be in triplicate signed by the steward concerned, and presented to management in the following manner:
At Step #1 of the grievance procedure, the steward will present copies 1 and 2 of the written request to the Department/Area Manager or his/her authorized representative. Such written request shall be dated as of the date of presentation. The Department/Area Manager or his/her authorized representative will initial receipt of same on both copies and return copy number 2 to the steward. If the grievance is not settled at Step #1, and the Union desires to obtain a meeting at Step #2 of the grievance procedure, the President or Vice-President of the Union or a representative authorized by them will present copies 2 and 3 of the written request signed by the contact man to the Department Head concerned and such copies shall contain the date of presentation. The above Department Head will initial receipt of same on both copies and return copy number 2 to the Union contact man.
If the grievance is not settled at Step #2 and the Union desires to obtain a meeting at Step #3, the Union will arrange such meeting with the Manager Industrial Relations through their normal contact. Such request will not be made in writing.
A meeting on a grievance shall be scheduled within three (3) working days excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays, after the date of request for a meeting or at such later date as may be mutually agreed. If succeeding meetings at any step in the grievance procedure are required, they shall be arranged within three (3) working days unless otherwise mutually agreed upon; provided however, meetings shall not be scheduled on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays except by mutual agreement.
5.14	The Union agrees that the final written answer of management to a grievance at any step in the grievance procedure shall dispose of the grievance unless such grievance is appealed within ten (10) calendar days excluding any vacation shutdown period from the date of management's final answer. The only exception shall be that of an appeal to arbitration wherein forty-five (45) calendar days is allowed.
5.15	If the Company requests the presence of an employee at a meeting, the Company shall compensate the employee for such time as follows:
Time Work - At his/her customary hourly rate.
Incentive - The Base Rate of his/her job at his/her average unit hour.
In addition, the employee will be paid any shift premium to which s/he would be entitled for hours lost from his/her normal shift because of such meeting. Company agrees to provide all grievance meeting minutes to the local Union.
5.16	Discharge Clause
If an employee feels that s/he has been unjustly suspended or discharged, s/he shall have the right to appeal his/her case in accordance with the grievance procedure set forth in Article V of this Agreement. Such appeal must be in writing addressed to the Company and the Union, and must be in the Company's hands no later than three (3) working days, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays, after the effective date of his/her suspension or discharge.
If such appeal is properly made, the matter shall be negotiated through the regular channels and if it is determined that the employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, s/he shall be reinstated to his/her former position without loss of seniority, and shall be compensated at his/her average earnings for normal hours lost from work because of the suspension or discharge less any penalty mutually agreed or decided by arbitration.
It is understood that when a department/area manager receives a written grievance pertaining to the appealing of a suspension or discharge, s/he shall be available for negotiating such grievance within one (1) working day, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays, after the receiving of the grievance.
Both parties of Step #2 shall be available for negotiating such grievance within one (1) working day, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays, after the completion of Step #1.
Both parties of Step #3 shall be available for negotiating such grievance within one (1) working day, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays, after the completion of Step #2.
One (1) day as referenced in this clause may be extended by mutual agreement.
In the event an employee is suspended or discharged, the supervisor concerned shall notify such employee's steward if on shift, or as soon as possible, of such suspension or discharge. The action of restricting an employee from work will follow the process as set out in Grievance #111 (1994).
5.17	The Company and the Union desire that, insofar as possible, all grievances should be settled at the first step of the grievance procedure. A grievance after it has reached Step #3 shall not be settled at any previous step unless with the consent of the Manager Industrial Relations or his/her authorized representatives and the bargaining committee or their authorized representatives. Both parties agree to follow the grievance procedure in the sequence of steps as outlined in this Article.
5.18	The Union agrees there shall be no strike, partial or complete, slowdown, or stoppage of work on grievances that are proper subjects for arbitration, nor shall there be any strike, partial or complete, slowdown or stoppage of work on grievances that are not proper subjects for arbitration. The Company agrees there shall be no lock-out under the same conditions.
The Union agrees that in event of a legal strike, employees in the bargaining unit will provide for maintenance and operation of all essential services for the protection of plant property and products. It is understood that if the Union feels that the Company is requesting more employees in an individual occupation than are necessary for such maintenance, such problem will be negotiated to a satisfactory conclusion.
ARTICLE VI Hours of Work
6.01	Wherever the two parties cannot agree on a shift schedule for a particular area or department, other than the standard schedule, then the standard schedule will be in effect.
Provide for a 12 hour core shift schedule, according to a 4 crew 7 day continuous operation rotating schedule working 168 hours in each 28 day period with up to eight hours worked at premium payment. Work week and pay week shall run from Saturday through to and including Friday (7:00 a.m. Saturday through to the following 7:00 a.m. Saturday).
As part of any schedule rotation, a lesser number of shifts or crews may be scheduled as required to meet business needs. The eight (8) hours of premium payment are the hours which would be withdrawn from the schedule by the company upon two weeks advance notice with no S.U.B. and no premium cost to the Company. Appropriate prior notification shall be provided to the Union and the employees a minimum of two weeks in advance of any changed requirements to any existing schedule (otherwise overtime applicable in the first changed shift, where worked).
It is recognized that the scheduled shift hours shall be exceeded in the starting and stopping of holiday shifts or shutdowns, replacement of absentees, and in cases of emergency.
6.02	In a period of reduced production for any reason, for more than a period of four (4) consecutive days' duration, working hours in a department or in a group within a department, shall be maintained at a reasonable level by the application of the following subsections in their chronological order.
1.	Employees who have no seniority privileges shall be laid off before the hours of employees who have seniority privileges are affected.
2. If, with the layoff of employees as in Subsection 1, it is evident that hours will be less than normal weekly hours, then transferred employees who were transferred under 8.19 and have not attained residence rights will be transferred back to the department from which they were transferred.
3.	If with the layoffs according to Subsection 1 and transfers according to Subsection 2, it is evident that available hours will be less than normal weekly hours, then employees with seniority privileges will be laid off until a normal week is provided for the remaining employees.
Lay-offs made through the application of the above procedures in Sections 1, 2 and 3 are made in conjunction with the lay-off procedures laid down in Article VIII of this agreement.
6.03	The Union recognizes that it is the function of the Company to schedule hours of work and the employee's obligation to work the hours scheduled, provided the hours scheduled do not violate the "Employment Standards Act of the Province of Ontario" and regulations thereunder.
6.04	The Company agrees not to schedule less than four (4) hours work in any given shift, provided this shall not restrict the right of the Company to schedule less than four (4) hours under the provision of clause 6.07.
OVERTIME
6.05	The first eight hours worked on a scheduled day off in a pay week will be paid at time and one-half. All other hours worked on a scheduled day off in the same pay week will be paid at double time.
If an employee on a 12 hour shift schedule misses any one of or part of the scheduled shifts on a Saturday or Sunday, s/he is not eligible for premium payment for the scheduled overtime hours that Sunday unless the missed time is compensated time off for one of the following reasons:	bereavement,
floater, vacation, jury duty, or union business (i.e., pool of hours).
For an employee on an 8 hour shift, premium pay of time and one-half will be applicable only after the fifth day worked or paid for within that normal work week. If an employee misses any one of the days of the six scheduled days in a normal work week, s/he is not eligible for premium payment unless the missed day is a compensated day off for one of the following reasons: bereavement, floater, vacation, jury duty, or union business (i.e., pool of hours).
6.06	Hours worked in excess of scheduled shift hours in a twenty-four-hour period shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half, excepting:
a)	When the hours of an employee exceed his/her normal daily hours because s/he substituted for another employee other than at the Company's request, changed his/her hours at his/her own request, or made a regular shift change. (A regular shift change normally occurs once per week).
b)	For time spent in meetings, however, time lost off the employee's standard shift due to attending meetings at the plant shall be considered as part of the normal shift hours in determining overtime on his/her regular shift.
c)	When an employee reports for work on his/her regular shift and if sent home before the end of his/her regular shift and is required to report back for work within the twenty-four (24) hour period, s/he shall be paid time and one-half for all hours worked on call-back beyond his/her normal stopping time of his/her regular shift.
d)	That overtime premium paid will not be paid twice for the same hours worked or paid for.
6.07	An employee who is called into work at any time between one-half (1/2) hour after s/he has left work and one (1) hour before his/her normal starting time, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours at his/her overtime rate.
6.08	It is understood and agreed that normals as expressed in this Article are not to be construed as meaning hours of work that the Company will guarantee employees. It is, however, further understood and agreed that in the application of clause 6.02 where hours are less than normal and can reasonably be corrected by layoff of employees, then such employees will be laid off.
HOLIDAYS
6.09 An employee who qualifies will be paid for scheduled time lost or for eight (8) hours when not scheduled (Exception: a part time employee as defined in Clause 8.06 will only be paid for scheduled time lost) for the following holidays: New Year's Day, Good Friday, Victoria Day, Canada Day, Civic Holiday, Labour Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day.
Holidays shall be observed from 7:00 a.m. the day of the holiday until 7:00 a.m. the day after the holiday. Example: if the statutory holiday falls on a Monday, the holiday will be observed from 7:00 a.m. Monday until 7:00 a.m. Tuesday. Exception: Christmas, Boxing Day and New Years (and Civic Holiday if moved to adjoin one of these) statutory holidays will start 7:00 p.m. the night before the holiday and end 7:00 p.m. on the day of the holiday. No S.U.B. will be payable for any resulting short pay/work week for any crew.
All holidays will be observed on the day upon which they fall on the calendar during the term of this agreement except for the Civic Holiday, which will be aligned by the Company with another Statutory Holiday to provide two consecutive days (48 hours) for required maintenance work. If 48 hours is not required for such maintenance work by the Thanksgiving Day Statutory Holiday, the Civic Holiday will be observed the day following the Boxing Day Statutory Holiday.
When any of the holidays listed in this clause fall on an employee's scheduled day off, s/he will be paid for said holiday, if eligible, and will not be granted another scheduled day off.
Floating Holidays:
All employees will be credited with 24 hours of Floating Holiday which will be scheduled as two shifts for employees on a twelve hour shift schedule and three shifts for employees on an eight hour shift schedule. The Company will grant a floater request for an open shift in the regular vacation schedule matrix with as little as 24 hours notice. Any other request for floater will be met only where business need and cost are not jeopardized.
Eligibility for Floating Holidays:
Employees must be actively employed and meet the following requirements to receive credit and payment for floating holidays:
Floaters for employees who move between 8 and 12 hour shift schedules within the year will have floater allowances adjusted to insure that no more than 24 hours of floaters are taken or paid in a year.
12 Hour Shift Schedule - One floater equals one 12 hour shift.
4	months but less than 8 months worked	1 floater
in a calendar year
8 months or more worked in a calendar year 2 floaters
8	Hour Shift Schedule - one floater equals one 8 hour shift
2 months but less than 6 months worked	1 floater
in a calendar year
6 months but less than 9 months worked	2 floaters
in a calendar year
9	months or more worked in a calendar year 3 floaters
If an employee was granted and was paid for a floating holiday(s) and did not meet the eligibility requirements specified above, then payment made to the employee for which s/he did not meet the specified requirements, shall be withheld from the employee's final pay or must be reimbursed to the Company.
6.10	In order for an employee to qualify for payment of wages for the paid holidays specified in clause 6.09 when not worked, s/he must report for work at the starting time of his/her shift and be prepared to work the scheduled hours of his/her shift on both the last scheduled work day preceding and the first scheduled work day following the paid holiday. The employee who thus qualifies shall be paid the hours as defined in 6.09 at his/her average earnings.
EXCEPTIONS:	An employee who is unable to report for work on the qualifying
days because:
1.	He was late reporting for work due to a reason beyond his/her control that is acceptable to the Company.
2. He is confined to a hospital or at home due to sickness or injury and is, therefore, in the Company's opinion, prevented from working. This exception is limited to two (2) paid holidays during the same confinement case and provided the employee is not entitled to payment under Workers' Compensation.
EXCEPTION: When two (2) paid holidays occur during the same two (2) day waiting period that an employee must wait before qualifying for a weekly indemnity payment under clause 4.02 of Article IV of the Insurance Program Agreement, such day or days shall be considered part of the waiting period.
If an employee is on sick leave and drawing sickness and accident benefits, the employee will be paid sick leave benefits for the holidays for which he or she is entitled, and upon returning to work will be reimbursed the difference between what the employee was paid as sick benefits and what the employee would be paid for holiday pay.
3.	S/he has an approved Leave of Absence which will be granted under the following conditions:
The supervisor will, upon request, grant a Leave of Absence to an employee up to but not exceeding five (5) calendar days in order for an employee to attend:
a)	The funeral of the employee's mother, mother-in-law, father, father-in-law, sister, sister-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, grandparents, great-grandparents, grandchildren, aunt, uncle, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, husband, wife, and blood or adopted children, and spouse's grandparents, great-grandparents, brother-inlaw and sister-in-law.
b)	Serious illness in the employee's immediate family which shall include such illness on the part of the employee's mother, mother-in-law, father, father-in-law, sister, brother, husband, wife, grandparents, great-grandparents, grandchildren, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and blood or adopted children.
The employee who would otherwise have qualified except for the exceptions herein stated, shall be paid for such holidays.
6.11	Time worked on a paid holiday by the employee who qualifies for holiday pay shall be paid at the rate of double time in addition to the pay s/he would receive for the paid holiday.
6.12	An employee who fails to qualify for pay on the paid holiday and who works on such holiday shall be paid at the rate of double time for time worked.
6.13	An employee is entitled to holiday pay if the paid holiday occurs during his/her paid vacation leave, provided such employee works the last scheduled work day preceding and the first scheduled work day following his/her vacation leave and qualifies under conditions outlined in clause 6.10. Subject to mutual agreement, such employee may, if s/he so desires, be granted another day of leave within thirty (30) days before or after such holiday, provided such holiday does not occur during a shutdown period for vacation.
6.14	An employee will not be entitled to holiday pay while on leave of absence and such holiday occurs during his/her leave of absence excepting in a case where an employee is granted a leave of absence to attend a meeting or convention pertaining to Company or Union matters or other exceptions under leave of absences specifically provided in this Article.
6.15	An employee may request a leave of absence prior to and/or subsequent to a paid holiday. Department managers are authorized to grant a leave if such employee is not required to meet production requirements. Provided the leave is granted and is not in excess of seven (7) consecutive calendar days, the employee who otherwise qualifies shall be paid for such paid holiday.
6.16	An employee who is laid off on a date that is within five (5) normal working days immediately preceding the paid holiday specified in clause 6.09 shall be paid for such holiday.
6.17	When the plant or any part thereof suspends operations, the employee who is laid off for a definite period not exceeding two (2) calendar weeks because of such suspension, shall upon re-hire be paid for the paid holiday or holidays that occur during such lay-off provided s/he otherwise qualifies under the conditions outlined in clause 6.10.
6.18	The words, "holiday" or "holidays" as used in any and all clauses of this Agreement mean and include only those days specified in clause 6.09.
ARTICLE VII
WAGE POLICIES
7.01	Individual base rates and hourly rate ceilings in effect on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain in effect during the life of this Agreement, except that a change in any rate may be made by mutual agreement. Job descriptions will be accessible to the affected employees and the Union time study.
It was agreed that the hourly rates of pay of the seven (7) groups, skilled trades and powerhouse engineers would be added as a reference at the end of the C.L.A.
7.02	Incentive standards shall be established or revised in accordance with the time study practices of the Company which will provide for the accurate measurement of the physical effort required to perform operations.
The company retains the right to perform time study practices which involve the capturing of employee images for the purpose of work measurement. The company will insure that videos taken within the facility for the purpose of work measurement will be obtained on a voluntary basis wherever possible and will not be retained for any purpose other than validation of the standard. Images so obtained will not be used for discipline.
In the revision of an incentive standard, only the elements affected by a change in method, equipment, products, tools, materials, design, or other production conditions shall be revised.
Measured Daywork Standards for all other operations and jobs will be established in accordance with this paragraph to set expected production targets and work content expected for the various hourly-rated production and non-production jobs within the plant. Measured Daywork Standards differ from Incentive Standards in that they are not used to establish employees' earnings and are, therefore, not subject to any guaranteed elements and can be changed as necessary to meet changing needs. The overall intent is that eight (8) hours work is expected of each employee for eight (8) hours pay.
Estimated Incentive Standards: Estimated incentive standards may be established and used for certain periods of time to provide incentive standard coverage on various operations until incentive standards are made effective. The life of an estimated standard is sixty (60) days, and can only be extended by mutual agreement.
When establishing an estimated incentive standard, a procedure covering the operation must be drafted before time studies are taken.
Estimated standards differ from permanent standards in that the elemental values are not guaranteed, and when replaced by a permanent standard, the values of the permanent standard can be established without any reference to the elemental values of the estimated standard.
All data for estimated standards is to be available to the Union upon request.
Grievances on estimated standards can be negotiated up to and including the third step level. If no agreement is reached at third step between the Company and the Union, the estimated standard shall be automatically cancelled. All meetings requested by the Union or the Company on procedures, explanations or protests shall be paid for at the customary hourly rate or base rate and average unit hour on the same basis as is now in effect on permanent standards.
Any increase negotiated on estimated standards shall be retroactive to the date of posting.
Estimated standards in effect in the various departments will be reviewed every two (2) months by the Company and the Union, and the Industrial Engineering Department will be responsible for arranging these review meetings.
Where the earnings of an employee are lower than his/her "average earnings" during the above period, the Company shall upon request, replace such with:
a) where an employee was paid on incentive immediately prior to the application of the estimated standard, payments in accordance with clause 7.17.
b) where an employee was paid an hourly rate immediately prior to the application of the estimated standard, his/her hourly rate.
It is recognized there may be temporary periods of time when incentive standards may not conform to the foregoing due to minor changes in work content which may increase or decrease the incentive standard in effect. In such instances, the Company shall have the right to either cancel or apply such standards and if an increase in effort is required, the Company shall allow time work for work added in addition to the incentive standard.
7.03	(a) No employee shall be paid in excess of a 76 unit hour except
that employees will have the opportunity to earn and be paid in excess of a 76 unit hour up to a maximum of a 85 unit hour with a clean time sheet.
Definition of a Clean Time Sheet:
A clean time sheet is a time sheet with no day work or lost time claimed but is comprised solely of work performed which is covered by incentive standards.
Exceptions to Clean Time Sheet Rule:
The following exceptions must be initialled by the employee's supervisor for payment beyond a 76 unit hour. If the employee's supervisor has not approved the claim, payment beyond a 76 unit hour will not be made:
(I)	attendance at a meeting requested by Management
(ii)	medical tests and safety drills as directed by Management or during safety work refusal per Ontario Health and Safety Act
(iii)	Employee Involvement meetings
(iv)	training in a controlled environment (for example, classroom)
(v)	experimental/developmental time - only lost time which was
not covered by an incentive labour standard and this time must be verified by a staff individual in charge of the procedure as well as the employee's supervisor.
(vi)	Instructors/Teachers - time spent while instructing other employees
(vii)	Temporary Supervision
(viii)	Union Business
(ix)	first aid treatment (up to .3 hour)
(b)	Special Bonus Plan for Incentive Employees
Incentive employees will be eligible for a bonus payment once attaining in excess of 6.4 hours on incentive at a 76 unit hour as detailed below:
(1)	For a regular eight (8) hour shift, bonus payment would be generated on attainment of more than 6.4 hours on incentive at a 76 unit hour. For shifts of different duration (e.g. 4 hours, 6 hours, etc.), this threshold of more than 80% at a 76 unit hour will be applied on a pro-rata basis.
Example:
4 hour shift - more than 3.2 hours on incentive at a 76 unit hour 6 hour shift - more than 4.8 hours on incentive at a 76 unit hour
(2)	Premium payments for overtime hours worked will apply as defined in Article VI. Employees working overtime on their job or similar job on which they are qualified and proficient will have their time sheets pro-rated for the calculation of bonus.
Example:
10 hour	hour	shift	- more than	CO o	hours	on incentive	at	a 76	unit
12 hour	hour	shift	- more than	9.6	hours	on incentive	at	a 76	unit
(3)	Glossary of Terms Threshold:
6.4	hours at a 76 unit hour or 486.4 units on incentive. This is the established criteria which an employee must exceed under the bonus plan in order to be eligible for bonus.
Bonus Value:	Tire Building	$.00022200
Beads	$.00020469
This is a fixed number which will be used in the calculation of the Bonus Unit Value.
Bonus Unit Value:
(Units Generated on Incentive - Threshold) X Bonus Value
If the number equals zero (0) or is a negative value no bonus would be applicable.
Maximum Bonus Unit Value:
[608 units (8.0 hrs. @ 76 unit hour) - 486.4 units (Threshold)] X Bonus Value
(4)	Calculation of Bonus
[Total Incentive Units (up to 608 units) - Threshold] X Bonus Value X Total Incentive Units Generated on Incentive = Bonus to be Paid

8.0	684.8	(85.6 Unit Hour)		17.04
(5)	Time sheets will be prorated for the calculation of Bonus per the "Exceptions to Clean Time Sheet Rule" except, when temporarily reassigned per clause 7.18 (a), (b) or (c), the employee must have attained 7.0 or more hours on incentive; when assigned under 7.18 (d) no proration shall occur.
7.04	Incentive standards may contain allowances for physically restricted increments of time or be supplemented by fixed process allowance to arrive at the incentive pay standard. The fact that supplementation may be currently necessary does not prohibit the Company from replacing supplementation with true physical work at some future time.
7.05	A new or revised incentive standard which has been posted for twenty-four (24) or more hours shall become effective at the starting time of the shift immediately following the posting of said standard. After an employee has worked on a new or revised incentive standard for a period of four (4) days but not exceeding fifteen (15) days, s/he may through his/her steward, protest such standard by a written grievance to his/her Department/Area Manager. The grievances shall be negotiated to a final settlement.
Any adjustments or settlement made shall be retroactive to the date such a standard was made effective, but shall not apply to an employee not on the active payroll as of the date of the final settlement. An employee who is on
leave of absence, pension, severance award, or laid off as of date of final settlement, shall be included.
Upon request of the Union, the Company shall make available at the Company's office, the time and pool sheets used in determining such retroactive pay. When an incentive standard becomes effective and there is less than four (4) days production, but more than twenty-four (24) hours production available in the following fifteen (15) working days, the twenty-four (24) hours of production shall be considered as the trial period. When there is less than twenty-four (24) hours production available in the fifteen (15) working days, the first shift production shall be considered as the trial period.
An incentive standard, or process allowance schedule, that is posted, tried and protested and because of protest is revised, shall not require a further trial period.
During the period of fifteen (15) working days after a new or revised incentive standard has been posted, same may be revised provided an error has been made in compilation or all conditions pertaining to the establishment of such standard have not been studied.
The application or cancellation of fixed process allowances for physically restricted increments of time or variable process allowance schedules in connection with an incentive standard may be protested and negotiated under the same conditions as provided in this clause 7.05 for the protest and negotiations of incentive standards.
7.06	When a re-issued incentive standard is posted, it shall become effective twenty-four (24) hours following the posting of said standard.
7.07	When time studies are being taken for the purpose of establishing incentive standards or measured day work standards, job procedure(s) shall be posted forty-eight (48) hours prior to the study. No employee of the Company in an official administrative or supervisory capacity shall take part in any work performed by the employee while such studies are in progress.
7.08	When an incentive standard is protested and is under consideration at Step #3 of the grievance procedure, the Company, upon request of the Union, will permit a Time Study Engineer of the International Union, U.S.W.A. to make studies of the operation covered by the disputed incentive standard.
Such Union Time Study Engineer must be experienced in the time study practices of the Company and must use the Company work measurement techniques in his/her studies. Any such studies by said engineer shall be made in conjunction with a Time Study Engineer of the Company and if such studies are to be used in further negotiation and/or arbitration, a comparison of the results of the studies shall be made prior to or during further negotiations and/or arbitration procedure.
Upon request, pertinent time study data and other information used or related in determining any new, revised, or protested incentive standard will be made available to the Union for inspection in the Company's office.
7.09	The supervisor will notify the employee of a change made on the employee's time sheet where such changes will affect the employee's earnings. The employee shall be notified of such change on his/her next working shift, or as soon as possible and will be given a copy of time sheet in question.
If the change is of a recurring nature and the employee does not agree with the change and same is protested through the grievance procedure, the employee shall mark his/her time sheet as instructed by his/her supervisor until a final decision is rendered.
7.10	Average unit hour shall mean the arithmetic average paid unit hour including any bonus payments per clause 7.03 (b) for all work performed by the employee on his/her regular job during the last pay period in which s/he worked a majority of hours on such job covered by incentive standards that were not under protest and on which no special allowance or guarantee was paid. The bonus payment to be included will be calculated by dividing total bonus paid over the pay period by the total number of incentive hours. When standards are protested between the fourth (4th) and fifteenth (15th) day of the trial period specified in clause 7.05, such protest shall be deemed to have been in effect on the first day of the trial period for the purpose of applying this paragraph. Said average unit hour shall be established by the Company Payroll Department from the employee's weekly payroll card. Except that when it is not practical to determine the average unit hour by this procedure, such average unit hour will be determined by another mutually agreed procedure.
7.11	Average earnings shall mean total earnings, including any bonus payments per clause 7.03(b), excluding shift premium and overtime premium, paid the employee during the next last pay period divided by total hours worked during said pay period. Except that when it is not practical to determine average earnings by the above procedure, such average earnings will be determined by another mutually agreed procedure.
7.12	The hiring rates for probationary employees will be the hiring rate of the job to which s/he is hired as indicated on the learning schedules issued to cover the job.
7.13	a) For eight hour shifts, a shift premium of fifty-five ($.55) cents per hour shall be paid for hours worked on the third shift (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and sixty (60) cents per hour for hours worked on the first shift (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). Upon implementation of the 12 hour shift schedule, a shift premium of seventy-five ($.75) per hour shall be paid for hours worked on the night shift (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) for twelve hour shifts. Effective June 1, 1996, a shift premium of eighty ($.80) cents per hour shall be paid for hours worked on the night shift (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) for twelve hour shifts.
b)	Shift premium shall not be included in the calculations of an employee's overtime rate.
c)	A premium of $1.75 per shift shall be paid to each employee who is required to hand over a running piece of equipment or operation to the next shift. This payment is in lieu of the five (5) minute washup time at shift end. When the Company wishes to discontinue this practice on a piece of equipment or operation, it will give twenty-four (24) hours notice where possible to the affected employees.
When an employee leaves his/her machine early to attend a meeting (including Employee Involvement or training), the premium shall be paid per the following:
I.	If an employee from the same shift is assigned to cover for an employee attending a meeting, the employee so assigned shall receive the premium.
II.	If an employee is requested to report for work early to cover for an employee attending a meeting, the employee leaving shall receive the premium.
III.	There must be a next shift in order for the premium to be paid.
IV.	No more than one "hand over" payment per machine per shift will be paid.
7.14	The company agrees to allow rest periods consisting of two breaks totalling 40 minutes (8 hour shift) and three breaks totalling 60 minutes (12 hour shift).
7.15	(a) When an employee is required to attend Special Meetings (such as, State of the Business, Plant Manager or those called by the Department/Area Manager), Employee Involvement Meetings, or on Union Business or Safety Committee business, s/he will be paid average earnings.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, experienced employees will be paid the base rate or hourly rate of the job to which they are assigned and shall be guaranteed such base rate or hourly rate as minimum earnings.
SPECIAL PAYMENTS APPLYING TO EXPERIENCED INCENTIVE EMPLOYEES
7.16	Under certain conditions, experienced employees normally working on
incentive operations may be limited for temporary periods of time in their opportunity to maintain their normal incentive earnings. In such situations covered by clauses 7.17,	7.18,	7.19,	7.20,	7.21 and 7.22 listed below,
employees shall be guaranteed special rate payments as provided herein. However, employees receiving any of the special rate payments listed below, are expected to perform at a level consistent with additional effort for which incentive payment is designed to compensate.
7.17	When an incentive employee is required to work on his/her regular job and there is no incentive standard available, s/he will be compensated at his/her average unit hour at his/her customary base rate.
7.18	When an incentive employee is temporarily assigned to a job and there is work available on his/her job, s/he shall be paid the greater of:
a) His/her average unit hour at his/her customary base rate, or
b) The rate of the job to which s/he is temporarily assigned if greater, or
c)	The base rate of the job to which s/he is temporarily assigned and the unit hour which s/he develops on such job.
d)	If assigned in class, the employee will receive no guarantee but will be paid the base rate of the job to which s/he is temporarily assigned and the unit hour and bonus s/he develops on such job.
Examples:
•	First step	builder assigned to another first	step machine
•	First step	builder assigned to second step	machine and	is
qualified
•	Second step builder assigned to a first step machine and is qualified.
•	Bead fill flip operator assigned to another fill flip machine
•	Assigned to	any bead making equipment and is	qualified
•	Assigned to	any building machine first or second stage and	is
qualified.
When there is a reduction in production and there is no work available to him/her on the job from which s/he was assigned, and provided s/he is qualified, s/he shall be paid in accordance with (b) of this clause if to an hourly rated job or (c) of this clause if to an incentive job.
7.19	When an incentive employee is assigned to developmental or experimental work, s/he shall be paid his/her average earnings for the period of an assignment when s/he is specifically assigned to perform work
of a special nature under the direct supervision of a member of supervision or the Technical staff, whether or not continuously present during the period such experimental work is in progress, for the express purpose of developing or experimenting on new manufacturing processes, as contrasted with routine changes in production methods. The time to be claimed on the employee's time sheet is the amount of lost time which was not covered by the incentive standard pertaining to the operation.
7.20	When an incentive employee is requested to remain in the plant and is idle due to mechanical delays, waiting on stock or orders, s/he shall be paid at seventy percent (70%) of his/her average unit hour at his/her customary base rate. However, when an employee accepts assigned work in place of enforced idleness, s/he shall be paid eighty percent (80%) of his/her average unit hour at his/her customary base rate.
In cases of idleness due to reasons other than those listed above, when an employee is assigned other work, s/he shall be paid as follows:
a.	If work is available on his/her job, s/he shall be paid in accordance with clause 7.18.
a)
b.	If work is not available on his/her job, s/he shall be paid in accordance with this clause.
7.21	If the earnings of an incentive employee are reduced because of abnormal stock conditions, s/he will be paid for such amount of extra time required for the handling of the abnormal stock as is reasonable under the circumstances at seventy percent (70%) of his/her average unit hour; provided s/he has exercised an effort satisfactory to supervision under the circumstances. In order to benefit under this clause, the employee must report the stock condition to his/her supervisor at the time the condition occurs.
7.22	If an employee is assigned to a group operation on a temporary basis and because of this temporary assignment the experienced employees are prevented temporarily from producing normal earnings, the experienced employees shall be guaranteed their average unit hour for such period of time as may reasonably be required for the temporarily assigned employee to attain normal production. The temporarily assigned employee will be paid according to the wage payment clause applicable to his/her case.
7.23	If the circumstances are such that the assignment of an employee temporarily to a group operation should not be reasonable cause for any decrease in the group output, no guarantee shall be extended.
7.24	a) When the productive work of an incentive employee decreases without proper cause to less than only sixty (60) units per hour, the Company may pay only for actual productive work performed upon giving written notice to the employee and a copy to his/her Union steward.
b)	In any instance where there is an unjustifiable decrease in the performance of an employee working on any of the guarantees set forth in Article VII, such guarantee may be withdrawn upon giving written notice to the employee and a copy to his/her Union steward.
c)	When a guarantee is removed in accordance with (b) above, and it is not possible to measure the performance of the employee by an incentive standard applicable to the operation which s/he is performing, s/he will be paid sixty (60) units per hour.
PAYMENTS APPLYING TO HOURLY-RATED EMPLOYEES
7.25	When an hourly-rated employee is temporarily assigned work other than in his/her regular job, s/he shall be paid as follows:
1.	If s/he is assigned to a job on incentive, s/he will be paid the greater of:
a)	His/her regular job hourly rate, or

2.	If s/he is assigned to an hourly-rated job, s/he will be paid as follows:
a)	If to a higher hourly-rated job on which s/he has experience and s/he produces at a level of performance required of an experienced employee, s/he will be paid at a rate determined by management which will not be below his/her regular job hourly rate or greater than the hourly rate of the job assigned.
b)	If to a lower hourly-rated job, s/he will be paid his/her regular job hourly rate.
c)	If to a job which has no established rate, s/he will be paid his/her regular job hourly rate.
PAYMENT APPLYING TO EXPERIENCED INCENTIVE & HOURLY-RATED EMPLOYEES

III.	Apply variable capacity attainment schedule to per cent of capacity attainment to determine pay unit hour.
IV.	Pay unit hour multiplied by total chargeable hours equals total pay units.
2.	Allowance schedules will not apply to learners except on those days during the learning period when a learner on an incentive schedule earns in excess of a sixty (60) unit hour or the unit maximum, whichever is applicable. Under this circumstance, the process allowance schedule indicated on the bulletin sheet for the operation will be applied.

ARTICLE VIII SENIORITY
8.01	In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and "The Re-instatement in Civil Employment Act, 1942" or any statute or order-in-council passed or issued in amendment or substitution thereof, the provisions of said Act shall to the extent of such inconsistency prevail.
8.02	Each employee in order to benefit by the seniority provisions of this Agreement, must keep the Company informed of his/her current address and telephone number at all times by notifying the Company as follows:
a)	An employee on the active payroll will notify his/her supervisor by signing the form available.
b)	Former employees who are subject to recall will notify the Personnel Office.
c) Failure to comply with the foregoing could mean a loss of overtime offering, Supplementary Unemployment Benefits, call-in pay or transfer consideration, or a possible delay in recall.
8.03	The Company will maintain a service list in each department, in view of all employees, showing the Company service date and the department service date of each member of the department.
8.04	An employee's hiring date shall be the date of the employee's first working day for the Company, but same shall be changed when required by other clauses in this Agreement.
8.05	An employee shall not acquire seniority privileges until s/he completes three (3) months service with the Company, at which time his/her hiring date shall be deemed to be his/her Company service date and such service shall be deemed to be "credited service". An employee with three (3) or more months continuous Company service shall enjoy back service credit as set forth in Clause 8.16. The three (3) months referred to in this clause shall be deemed the probationary period for all employees.
8.06	A part-time employee shall not acquire or accumulate credited service for seniority purposes while employed as such. A part-time employee is one that by choice is not prepared to work, or does not work the scheduled hours of his/her shift or occupation. A part-time employee shall not by custom or practice, work daily hours that shall exceed five (5) hours per day while employed as such.
When a full-time employee changes his/her status to a part-time employee, s/he shall receive credit for service up to the date of change. When such employee returns to full-time employment, s/he shall receive credit only for the time while employed as a full-time employee.
An employee accepting part-time employment in place of lay-off shall be considered as a laid off employee in determination of credited service while employed as such.

8.07	An employee shall have job seniority when s/he completes three (3) months of continuous credited service on the job on which s/he is hired or to which s/he is transferred, at which time his/her credited service shall be deemed to be his/her job seniority. An employee who is transferred to replace an employee on leave of absence under Clause 10.06 shall be considered an employee on loan for such period.
8.08	When an employee has job seniority and is transferred s/he shall continue to accumulate job seniority on such job until s/he acquires job seniority on the job to which s/he is transferred.
8.09	Notwithstanding Clause 8.07 and 8.08, an employee who has job seniority and who is transferred in accordance with Clause 8.11 and the job on which s/he had job seniority becomes open within two years from the date of his/her transfer from such job shall return to his/her job provided no employee has prior rights under Clause 8.13. The employee who thus returns shall be credited with his/her job seniority on such job as of his/her date of return. This Clause shall not apply where an employee is transferred under 8.11 and exercises job progression or transfers under 8.19 within the two (2) years herein specified.
8.10	An employee shall have residence rights when s/he completes three (3) months of continuous credited service in the department in which s/he is hired or to which s/he is transferred.
8.11	When it becomes necessary to lay-off employees, in a job classification, employees who have no seniority privileges will be laid off first. If after the layoff of such employees a further layoff is necessary, then employees with seniority privileges will be laid off in accordance with
their seniority as follows:
For the purpose of layoff, there are two (2) types of jobs:
(1)	Classified
(2)	General
which are listed under a supplemental agreement. In accordance with the procedures herewith set forth, an employee who is subject to layoff from his/her job will displace the employee with the least amount of credited service among those employees who have less credited service.
An employee must have "qualified experience" on a classified job in order to exercise any bumping rights on such job. "Qualified experience" shall mean that the employee has worked on the job or similar jobs as defined in this Clause, and providing that his/her productivity is equivalent to that of an average employee on such job or jobs.
An employee who is subject to layoff in a group operation and who has qualified experience on more than one job in such group, and provided s/he has job seniority on a job within the group, shall first displace an employee in the group in the reverse order of "job progression" (which are listed under a supplemental agreement) for such group but shall not displace an employee with more credited service. Failing placement in the group, s/he shall follow the procedure.
Application of the procedures laid down in Clause 6.02 of Article VI are to be made in conjunction with lay-offs under Article VIII of this Agreement.
The Company and Union agree:
a)	to review and update all general and classified jobs before October 1, 1995; and
b)	all revised job progressions will be developed by the steward and department manager and then approved and signed by the Union President and Manager Industrial Relations or their designates prior to implementation.

Supervisory or salaried employees returned to the bargaining unit per the above will not result in the layoff of a bargaining unit employee.
8.24	Operations of the plant are conducted on a rotating shift basis, therefore, there shall be no shift preference. Permanent shifts may be assigned only to employees having ten or more years of credited service, and then only if all employees on the shifts affected agree to the assignment, but such will not be implemented unless mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union.
