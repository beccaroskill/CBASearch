work, and does not work, he shall not be paid for the unworked holiday, in addition to other appropriate discipline.
(g)	There shall be no duplication of overtime pay for the same hours of work.

13.01	Bulletin board space will be allowed for posting notices of meetings, elections, social and other recreation affairs of the Union. These notices shall be signed and dated by the Union President or approved by a member of the Executive Committee and shall be subject to the approval of the Plant Manager before being posted.
ARTICLE 14 -WAGES
14.01	Wage rates are increased as set out in Schedule “A", the effective dates of the changes are June 14, 1999, June 05, 2000, and June 04, 2001. Schedule "B" is a description of Skill Areas. All of these schedules are attached hereto and made a part of this contract. These wage rates shall remain in effect for the life of this Agreement, except that the Company may make voluntary increases.
16
14.02	Pursuant to Article 7, the Company will continue to make all decisions in determining training assignments. Its decisions will be based on skill and ability, seniority, and performance. With respect to training and job assignment following training, the Company will endeavour to accord weight to seniority when providing opportunities to advance to higher skill levels or in job placement. Where an employee has physical limitations which prevent him/her from performing the essential functions of other positions, he/she will not be denied work or laid off as a direct result of job rotation to provide other employees with the opportunity to train on his/her current job. To ensure the efficient operation of the plant, Management will determine the appropriate number of employees in training at any given time.
To encourage and reward employees for learning new jobs and to provide the Company with a flexible and experienced workforce, wage rate assignments will generally be based on the employee’s skill and ability in the skill area to which he or she is currently assigned.
Individual employees will be paid at the highest rate for which they qualify in the skill area in which they are currently working, even when assigned to a job ordinarily calling for a lower pay level. For example, when an employee qualifies for an Operator 2 in a skill area, as long as they are working in that skill area and are able and willing to perform Operator 2 duties, they will be paid as an Operator 2 rate, even when assigned to Operator 1 duties. Similarly, when an employee who is an Operator 2 become fully qualified for Operator 3, he or she will be paid as an Operator 3 even though continuing to perform Operator 2 duties. An employee transferring to a different skill area will be paid the highest rate he or she qualifies for in the new skill area.
The foregoing provisions do not apply to the Chargehand classification or the Hantsport Operator 3 classification. Employees will be paid rates for these jobs only when actually performing these jobs.
14.03	If, after an employee begins working on his shift he is transferred to work at a lower rate of pay, the higher rate at which he started the shift shall be maintained until the end of the shift.
ARTICLE 15 - DENTAL PLAN
15.01	A dental plan identical to the salaried plan will be made available to the hourly employees for the life of the contract as provided in the official plan documents. Should questions arise concerning the administration of the benefits and/or the interpretation or application of the benefits, the provisions as set out in the official plan that are in effect at the time the question arises shall prevail.
17
ARTICLE 16 - SAFETY ALLOWANCE
16.01	The Company agrees to continue the practise of reimbursing the employees up to fifty ($50.00) dollars, once in each contract year upon submission of receipts for approved safety equipment.
16.02	Effective January 1,2002, the Company will reimburse eligible employees up to $100.00 per calendar year toward the purchase of approved safety shoes or other approved safety equipment.
16.03	To qualify for reimbursement, safety shoes and equipment must meet all plant and department safety standards, and employees must submit valid receipts for such purchases. This allowance must be used during the calendar year and may not be carried over and taken in the following year.
ARTICLE 17 - DURATION OF AGREEMENT
This Agreement shall become effective on June 14th, 1999 and shall continue in force
and effect to the 2nd day of June, 2002, inclusive.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Company and the Union have executed this Agreement
as follows, by the respective authorized agents.
