(h)	In the event an employee transfers into a department after the final vacation list has been posted, their vacation in their former department shall be cancelled and they shall select from the vacation period available in their new department. However, where production requirements permit, every attempt will be made to allow the employee to maintain one (1) previous vacation selection provided this vacation occurs within a reasonable period of time after the transfer. An employee who is transferred from crew to crew in the same department will be allowed to maintain one vacation selection of their remaining vacation so long as this vacation selection is the only vacation selection in addition to that allowed under paragraph (b) (i) of this Schedule for that same period.
(i)	In the event an employee’s two (2) consecutive “numbered days off” fall during a departmental shutdown, the employee shall have the option of taking the time as scheduled days off or as vacation.
(j)	Whether there is a shutdown or not a minimum of 50% of vacation weeks shall be allowed during the prime time of the 2nd week in May to the 4th Saturday after Labour Day.

(v)	Power House Mechanics
(vi)	Machinists
(vii)	Pipefitters
(viii)	Insulation Mechanics
(ix)	Painters
(x)	Janitors
(xi)	Oilers
(xii)	Tractor Operators
(xiii)	Welders
(xiv)	Utility Person
As business conditions vary the number of units listed above may be enlarged or decreased from time to time.
(c)	(i) Whetherthere isashutdown or nota minimum
of50% of unit vacation weeks will beallowed during the prime time of the 2nd week in May to the 4th Saturday after Labour Day.
■47-
(jj) Each employee in order of seniority shall make their initial choice and indicate this selection inthe week or consecutive weeks affected on the vacation list with the provision that a maximum of two (2) weeks will be allowed during the period July 1stto August 31st. After this process has been completed any open weeks may be selected on the basis of seniority.
(iii) The maximum number of employees permitted off together by unit during prime time will be calculated as follows:
(in a unit with 20 employees whose average vacation eligibility is 4 weeks)
50% X Total Vacation Eligibility Per Unit Total Vacation Weeks in Prime Time (From 2nd week in Mayto 4th Saturday after Labour Day)
EXAMPLE 50% x 80 Vacation Weeks
24
= 1,7 employees
In all cases, as in the above example, the number of employees allowed off at any one time in the prime period will be rounded upto the next whole number. Therefore, in the above calculation the 1.7 employees allowed off would be rounded up to 2.
Should production and work requirements permit, supervision may allow more than the original approved number of maintenance employees indicated by the formula time off during prime time. It is understood that no bumping will result from additional choices and they will be allowed on a first-come-first-served basis.
■48
(d)’ A maintenance employee who is transferred from unit to unit will be allowed to retain the vacation selection made in their former unit.
SCHEDULE“G”
EMERGENCY ABSENCE COVERAGE
The Company and the Union recognize the need for continuous and efficient operation of the Plant in order to obtain unrestricted production and high quality products and it is their intention to co-operate and continue to be committed to the successful operation of the provisions of the Emergency Absence Coverage System. The parties will continue to meet from time to time to re-affirm their respective commitments.
Scheduled and unscheduled absences shall be filled in accordance with the provisions hereinafter described:
(a)	Area Shift Forepersons who experience a scheduled and unscheduled absence may request employees to cover such absence from the Foreperson responsible for the Flex Crew arrangement.
(b)	Ifsuch requests as outlined in (a) above exceed the number of employees available in the Flex Crew arrangement additional employees may be obtained as follows:
(i)	The area Foreperson will determine the area(s) and job(s) where absences exist. The Supervisor will then referto the volunteer list taken from the cover crew for the area(s) affected in order of seniority. On each successive occasion that coverage is required, the opportunity for overtime will be rotated. Records will be maintained by the area Foreperson. Employees who wish to volunteer for overtime coverage will be required to place their names on a volunteer list supplied by area supervision, which will be posted at six (6) month intervals.
-49-
£,0
This list will be posted for a period of fourteen (14) days and any employee who is on vacation, sick or an approved leave of absence will have five (5) days after their return to work to include their name for consideration. An employee will be allowed a total of three (3) refusals before their name will be stricken from the list and they will not be allowed to volunteer again until the beginning of the next six (6) month period. If an employee transfers or is transferred from one area/crew to another, they will be allowed if they desire, to place their name at the bottom of the volunteer overtime list for their new crew.
The top four (4) positions in Staple Spinning (Board, Assistant Board, Process and 1st Operator) and the top two (2) positions in Staple Processing (Senior Staple Process Operator and Staple Drawing Operator) would maintain a separate list for overtime. Overtime occasions for these jobs would be selected from their own pool.
(ii)	If the area Foreperson is unable to obtain a volunteer from the cover crew list, the Foreperson will call those employees from that crew on lieu days in order of seniority.
(iii)	When an employee volunteers and reports to work because of an absence of another employee they may be permitted to work even though the incoming Foreperson might find that the workload is light. In such case, the volunteer could be permitted to leave at their request.
(iv)	An employee at work whose relief fails to report will be expected to work up to four (4) hours overtime until a relief employee reports. The employee may leave at whichever time
-50-
’	occurs first and if they have no transportation,
the Company will provide it.
(c)	If no volunteer is available, the Relief Crewand the remaining non-working crews will then be canvassed in that order.
(d)	If such requests as outlined in paragraph (a) cannot be filled by the procedures in (b), the area Shift Foreperson will then require employee(s) on the basis of reverse seniority from the areacover crew to report to work. The Company may request a particular classification if the situation is such that no trained personnel are available to fill the absence.
(e)	The appropriate number of meal tickets will be provided to those employees who are unable because of the nature of the overtime to make adequate preparations.
(f)	Where excessive difficulties are experienced with the Emergency Absence Coverage System and the parties are unable to resolve these difficulties former Schedule "G" shall be temporarily reinstated while the parties examine alternatives.

Dear Mr. Hayes:
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING In order to clarify the Company’s position with regard to Clause 10.02 and the five-day lay-off provision contained therein, the Company shall limit five-day outages due to market conditions to once (1) per area per calendar year, and such outages for market conditions will not be used in conjunction with a summer maintenance shutdown. The five-day lay-off provisions may continue to be invoked at the time there are mechanical breakdowns, or conditions due to external forces* beyond the control of the Company. In each instance where feasible, the Company will make every effort to effectively utilize those employees who may be affected by such a shutdown. This proposal iscontingent upon Union acceptance and agreement to amend Schedule “E”, item (d) to read: "If a shutdown is scheduled each employee affected will schedule enough of his/her vacation up to three (3)weeks to cover the duration of the shutdown. The Company will endeavourto schedule a shutdown of not more than three
(3)	weeks duration in any one department.”

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE: FLEX CREW ARRANGEMENTS
It is the intent of the Company to maintain the manning in each area at that level required to support normal, efficient production requirements. It is recognized, however, that on occasion employees may be unabie to report for work because of illness. It is also recognized that employees may from time to time need to be absent from work for pre-arranged bona-fide reasons and that area vacation requirements may from time to time result in manning levels below that required for normal operations. For these reasons, the Flex Crew arrangement, utilizing scheduled shift workers, was organized. The following reiterates the Company's intent with regard to Flex Crew organization, assignments and priorities.
a)	The Flex (Core) Crew's initial responsibility is to cover for unscheduled absences.
b)	The Flex (Core)Crew isa specially-posted job with qualifications requiring those posting to be able to do all of the jobs normally covered. The Flex Crew will normally fill in at the bottom of a line of progression.
The Regular Flex (Pool) Crew may be enlarged or decreased from time to time to handle vacation relief requirements and to accommodate short-term area manning requirements.
■74
Notwithstanding the above, it is recognized that under certain non-routine conditions (such as major disruption in an area) Flex Crew assignments and priorities may be temporarily altered.

Energy & Chemical Workers Union Local 9670 Dear Mr. Hayes:
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING POSTING POLICY PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF A CUT BACK OR LAY-OFF
This will confirm the understanding reached between the Company and the Union with respect to the above.
It is the intention of the Company to manage and direct the working force in a manner which will best meet the needs of production commitments. To accomplish this, the Company proposes that prior to any lay-off or cut-back, there be an established date of cut-off to the practice of accepting non-regular postings. Such applications will be accepted, but the listing of these applicants for consideration will be secondary to planned manning moves. The Company, in making this proposai, is cognizant of the need to anticipate training requirements of employees being cut back and the necessity of producing a quality product in those areas affected by a lay-off of employees. To plan and implement training, it is imperative that replacement employees be identified as soon as possible and that once committed to these manning moves they be carried out unless production requirements change sufficiently as to alter the needs of an area. To this end, the Company proposes that, where possible, the cut-off date for accepting non-regular postings should be a minimum of four (4) weeks from the actual date of lay-off of employees. Where the Company is unable to give the
-82-
Union four (4) weeks’ notice of lay-off/cut-back, the cutoff dale will be as per the date of notification. Sincerely,
CELANESE CANADA INC. —MILLHAVEN PLANT J.W. Gibson

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
'his will confirm the understanding between the respec-ive parties that Stationary Engineers in the Powerhouse vill be of assistance to Millhaven maintenance trades-jersons when powerhouse plant equipment is either being refurbished or installed in order to increase their knowl-jdge of the proper operating mode of such equipment. During periods when maintenance personnel are working jvertime in the powerhouse, Stationary Engineerswho are working at the time overtime is required may be used as noted above but will not be called in on overtime to provide maintenance assistance. This increased exposure of Stationary Engineers will not be the cause of any reduction in the number of maintenance personnel currently performing work requiring the skills of a tradesperson.
It is understood and agreed that the cleaning of boilers is work normally performed by Stationary Engineers. Sincerely,
CELANESE CANADA INC. —MILLHAVEN PLANT J.J. Carty
