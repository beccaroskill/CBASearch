all claims for the tool allowance. This would be in effect until the end of the present Contract.
£. Vacation entitlement for maintenance employees will be the same as outlined for all employees in the Contract.
3.	The Corporation will cease to reimburse employees for the
Corporation’3 share of Manitoba Medical services premiums for whom the Corporation paid the? employees’ share of the premium prion’ to June 1,	1973; to take effect January 1,	1987. This means we would
