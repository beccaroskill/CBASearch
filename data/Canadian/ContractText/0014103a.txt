and WABUSH LAKE RAILWAY COMPANY, LTD
hereinafter called the “Company”
and
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA
Local 6285
Hereinafter called the “Union”
Article 1
PURPOSE OFAGREEMENT
1.01	It is the intent and purpose of the Parties to establish, as herein set forth, their full Agreement covering wages, hours of work and other working conditions and to provide procedure for the prompt and equitable adjustment of grievances.
Article 2
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT
2.01	This Agreement covers :
A.	All employees of Wabush Mines, Pickands Mather & co., Managing Agent, located at Wabush, Labrador, Newfoundland except office employees, medical and safety staff, chemists, guards and security personnel, foreman and those above the rank of foreman, students, professional and tehcnical employees, cookery and camp employees, janitors, bakery and laundry workers; and
B.	All employees of Wabush Lake Railway Company, Limited, working on installation, maintenance and operation of the railroad and facilities, except office workers, guards and security personnel, foremen and those above the rank of foreman, students and professional and technical employees.
2.02	As used herein “students” means a person attending a high school, technical school, college or university, who may be employed by the Company during a regular school vacation for temporary work, but who shall attain no rights under this Agreement.
2.03	Supervisory personnel will not perform production or maintenance jobs normally performed by employees in the bargaining unit except under the following circumstances :
A.	For instruction or training;
B.	In experimentation with respect to process operation;
C.	For testing new machinery or new equipment, or assisting employees in testing repaired machinery or equipment;
7
D.	In case of emergency affecting the safety of employees, damage to equipment or adversely affecting operations, for such time as is necessary to overcome the emergency;
E.	Where the work is incidental to supervisory duties.
If a Supervisor performs work in violation of this section and the extent and classification of the work can be established, then the grievor, if he is in that classification, will be paid an allowance equal to the standard straight time rate appropriate to the work performed, for the time actually worked or for four (4)hours, whichever is the greater. If the grievor is not in the classification, as established above, then the employee who receives the payment will be the one who is the lowest on the overtime list in that classification.
A grievance alleging violation of this Section may be filed by the Union directly at Step No. 2 of the Grievance Procedure. In the event such a grievance is appealed to an Arbitrator he shall, if violation of this Section is established, be empowered to order payment of the aforementioned allowance.
2.04	It is general policy of the Company not to contract out production or maintenance work that is normally performed by members of the bargaining unit. However, abnormal circumstances may arise that require such contracting out. When the Company contemplates and decides to contract out production or maintenance work that has not previously been contracted out, it shall give the Union as early written notice as is feasible but no later than twenty (20) days before the contract is awarded providing details of the work to be contracted out. When the Company cannot give twenty (20) days notice, a verbal notice will be given immediately it becomes feasible to do so. On receipt of such notice, the Union may request a meeting to discuss the possibility of qualified employees and available equipment starting and completing the work within the required time. Such a meeting may be attended by three (3) representatives of the Union and will be held within five (5) days of the notice. The Union representatives will suffer no loss of pay for the time spent at such a meeting. Within seven (7) days following such meeting, the Company will
8
advise the Union of the final disposition of the contract. Further, if the Company is unable to provide all the details for the work to be contracted out, at the above meeting, it will provide such details to the Union as soon as the information becomes available.
In no case will the Company contract out production or maintenance work while employees who normally perform that work are laid-off or reduced as a result of a decrease in the work they normally performed or that would result in the reduction or lay-off of such employees. No employees of any contractor will displace the regular production and maintenance employees.
Even though notice from the Company will not be required in the case of continuing work which has been contracted out in the past, the Company will notify the Union when a new contract is to be made for work which has been contracted out in the past and will, upon request, meet the Union concerning such work.
Any alleged violation of the provisions of this Section or of an agreement between the Parties reached at a meeting to discuss contracting out shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure. Similarly, in the event the Parties fail to reach an agreement at such meeting, the matter will be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
An employee who has been laid off and not recalled or who is displaced in violation of the provisions of this article may file a grievance for the pay he claims to have lost.
When a contractor performs work on site beyond the scope of work outlined in the aforementioned notice to the Union, an employee may submit a grievance at Step 2 in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.03 of the Collective Agreement. If the Company has not taken corrective action within twenty-four (24) hours of having been notified of the alleged violation any claim payable will apply from the date the grievance was filed.

ESTABLISHING LINES OF PROMOTION
8.10	Promotional lines as referred to in Section 8.03 are intended to provide channels for purposes of promotion and demotion giving consideration to logical work relationships.

8.13	A. Vacancies resulting from termination in accordance with Section 8.09, permanent promotion or demotion and the creation of new jobs shall be considered as permanent.
B.	Vacancies resulting from absenteeism, illness, injury, suspension or leave of absence will be considered as permanent if they last longer than (15) fifteen shifts.
C.	Vacancies such as those in B. preceding, which last less than fifteen (15) shifts, vacancies which are caused by annual vacation and those which exist while permanent vacancies are being filled, shall be considered as temporary.
D.	An employee whose absence has created a permanent vacancy shall be placed in his former job on his return.
8.14	When there is a requirement for more employ-
19
ees than have been scheduled on a shift, employees of the classifications, who regularly perform the work involved, will first be given the opportunity to perform the work.
8.15	If the Company decides to fill a permanent vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled, by an employee capable of doing the job, in the following order of priority :
A.	By recall to the job, in which the vacancy exists, of the employee having the most job continuous service in the job and who was reduced from that job or from any other equal or higher job in that line of promotion, providing he is not already in that line of promotion in an equal or higher rated job, or if none;
B.	By employee with the most Company continuous service currently in a job of equal classification in the same line of promotion and who has expressed his desire to fill such vacancy by completion of a form furnished by the Company, or who is in a job directly below in the same line of promotion, or who has been reduced from a job directly below in the same line of promotion, or if none by the employee with the most Company continuous service, in the next successively lower job in such line or who has been reduced from it, or if none;
C.	By job posting under the provisions of Section 8,18, except that a vacancy in a labour pool or in a trade or craft job shall not be posted:
When an employee who is selected to fill a permanent vacancy in accordance with B., above is prevented from starting work in his new job, because of personal reason, the job will be filled temporarily for 45 calendar days by the next eligible employee in the line of promotion. If the employee is still unable to be assigned to the job after 45 days, the employee who has been temporarily assigned will be assigned permanently.
8.16	An employee who is not on Mine Equipment or has not previously been trained on Mine Equipment and who believes he has the capacity and physical fitness to operate Mine Equipment may apply in writing to the Company at any time. Applicants, who meet the
20

A.	Hold a valid driver’s license for the Province of Newfoundland.
B.	Be at least 19 years of age.
C.	Be in all respects physically fit to perform the work.
An employee whose performance in such a course is unsatisfactory will be returned to his regular job and will no longer be eligible for such training. Upon satisfactory completion of a course, the employee will be returned to his regular job and he will automatically be considered as having applied to fill a permanent vacancy, in the position for which he was trained, when such a vacancy is posted in accordance with section 8.18. Further, he will be selected to fill a vacancy in a position for which he was trained ahead of any employee who has not taken such course or who has not been previously assigned to that position. If he is selected to fill the vacancy in accordance with the promotion provisions of this Agreement, he will be assigned to the job.
An employee who completes the Mine Equipment Training Course for Produciton Truck ot Tractor-Grader will not be required to complete the learner period for either of these jobs.

Such applicants will be considered when the Company
21
decides to fill such vacancies and will be selected in accordance with provisions of Section 8.12.
8.18	A. When it is necessary to fill a vacancy under 8.15 C., it will be posted for five (5) days. An employee may apply for the job on a form furnished by the Company within this five (5) day period. Within five (5) days following the posting and application period, the Company will post the name of the employee selected and no further selections will be made following the posting of the successful applicants. Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays shall be excluded form the time limits referred to in this paragraph.

1.	Any employee may apply for a Helper job;
2.	An employee may make application for any posted job if he has been permanently assigned in his current line of promotion for at least six (6) months. However, an employee who posts to a lower rated job in his current line of promotion shall then forfeit his job seniority in all jobs which are equal to or higher rated than the job to which he has posted. Also, an employee who posts to a job in another line in which he has perviously established job seniority will not be given credit for any previous seniority date he may have held in that job or in any equal or higher rated job in that line.
B.	If an employee, applying for a posted job, has had no opportunity to demonstrate his ability to perform the job, his ability to absorb the training for the job, as demonstrated by his work record with the Company, shall be taken into consideration.
C.	A copy of each job posting and the name of the applicant selected will be given to the Union.
8.19	A. An employee selected on ajob posting for a single vacancy but who, solely to meet Company needs, is unable to start work on the new job while it is being filled on a temporary basis, shall be paid at the higher
22
of his old rate, or the rate of the new job for work performed after the commencement of the next work schedule following the date of the notice of his selection.
B. If, solely to meet Company needs, an employee selected on a job posting is unable to start work on the new job on the same date as other employees selected on the same posting, while that vacancy is being filled on a temporary basis, he shall be paid retroactively at the higher of his old rate or the rate of the new job for the period between his acquired job continuous service date, as defined in Section 8.02 B., and his actual performance of work on the new job.
If it is determined that the above employee will be delayed from starting work on the new job for a period in excess of three (3) weeks, then the job will be filled on a permanent basis until such time as the employee initially selected is ready to commence work on the new job. The time limit will commence with the beginning of the first work schedule following the date of the notice of his selection.
8.20	An employee before proceeding on vacantion or leave of absence not exceeding thirty-five (35) days, may make application for the job in which he is interested and which may become vacant during his absence. He shall be considered as an applicant for such job should the job be posted during his absence and provided he meets the current qualifications of the job before leaving on vacation or leave of absence.
8.21	If no employee qualified for promotion makes application for a posted job or trade or craft vacancy, the Company shall be free to fill such job by other means.
8.22	When the Company fills a temporary vacancy it will use it to provide training for employees in the same line of promotion and fill it in the same manner as in filling permanent vacancies within the lines of promotion (Section 8.15 B.), subject to the following modifications :
A.	A vacancy shall be filled from among employees on the shifts in which it occurs;
B.	In the event a vacancy cannot be filled from within
23
the line of promotion, it will be filled by the senior employee from the labour pool of the Department Job Group concerned, who is presently on the shift in which the vacancy occurred.
If it is necessary to hold over or call out an employee, an employee in the calssification where the vacancy exists, who is qualified to fill the vacant job will be held over or called out, taking into consideration the equitable distribution of overtime.
REDUCTION AND LAY-OFF
8.23	A. A reduction without lay-off will be effected in the following order of priority by applying job continuous service down the lines of promotion in each Department Job Group affected, resulting in each employee being :
1.	Retained in his present job or in a job of equal classification within his line of promotion.
2.	Reduced to a lower job in line of promotion; or
3.	Return if he so requests, to the highest job in another line of promotion provided his continuous service in the previous job allows him to hold that job and he is then able to perform the full requirement of the job.
4.	Reduced to the Department Labour Pool. However, an employee in a trade or craft job may elect to be laid off rather than accept reduction to the Department Labour Pool. He will be recalled only to vacancies in his trade or in the event he has not been recalled to his trade or craft job and if he desires to return to work after a one-year period he will advise the Industrial Relations Department in writing as soon as possible but not less than 4 weeks before the date he desires to return to work. He will then be recalled to the Department Labour Pool, provided his seniority allows him to do so. This provision is also subject to the time limits specified in Section
8.09	F.
B. In the event of reduction with lay-off, the same procedure will be followed as in paragraph A. preceding, except that :
24
1.	Each employee likely to be affected by lay-off, either directly or through the exercising of his seniority by another employee, will receive a minimum of seven (7) days notice of the lay-off. If such notice is not given, the Company will reimburse each employee so affected for eight (8) hours at the rate of the job from which he was reduced multiplied by the number of regular shifts during which he would have worked had the notice been given;
2.	A reduction as referred to in A. 4. preceding, will be to the General Labour Pool defined in Section 8.04 C. instead of to the Department Labour Pool; and
3.	Before a reduction under B. 2., preceding is made, an employee whose job continuous service enables him to retain the same job in another line of promotion may request to be transferred to that job.
4.	Any employee being reduced under 8.23 B. 2. may exercise his company continuous service within his Department Labour Pool before proceeding to the General Labour Pool.
C. No employee may attain a higher job classification as a result of any reduction or lay-off procedure, except as provided in A. 3., preceding, and any displaced employee must be able to perform the work in the job to which he reverts through the application of the reduction or lay-off procedure.
U. An employee, reduced to the General Labour Pool, may elect to be laid off instead of displacing another employee, by so notifying the Industrial Relations Department, in writing within forty-eight (48) hours (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays excluded) following his being notified of such reduction. Failure to so notify the Company shall be construed as his acceptance of work in the General Labour Pool.
E. An employee will be laid off from the General
Labour Pool on the basis of his length of continuous
service with the Company.
8.24	During a temporary reduction or layoff caused
by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the
Company, the provisions of Article 8 will be waived for
25
a period not exceeding three (3) days (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays excluded). However, where practicable, senior employees in each job shall be given the opportunity to perform any available work in that job, on their shift, within their Department.
8.25	When it is determined by the Company that a reduction or lay-off will exceed three (3) days (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays excluded) the work force will be revised as soon as practicable in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Failure to revise the workforce within five (5) days shall not be subject to grievance.
8.26	RECALL
To a vacancy in a job above a Labour Pool
Such a vacancy will be filled in accordance with Section 8.15 A.
B.	To vacancies in the General Labour Pool
Employees on lay-off will be recalled to vacancies in this Pool in order of Company continuous service, except that employees who accept lay-off rather than displace employees in the General Labour Pool, as provided in Section 8.23 D., will not be recalled to vacancies in the General Labour Pool until all employees laid off from it have been recalled. Further an employee reduced from a trade or craft job and who has elected to be laid off as provided in Section 8.23 D. will be recalled only to his trade or craft job. In the event such an employee has not been recalled to his trade or craftjob and if he desires to return to work after a one-year period he will advise the Industrial Relations Department in writing as soon as possible but not less than 4 weeks before the date he desires to return to work. He will then be recalled to the General Labour Pool provided his seniority allows him to do so. However, this provision shall be subject to the time limits specified in Section
8.09	F.
C.	An employee recalled to work for a period of less than thirty (30) days may refuse such a recall. The employee who refuses such a recall, will retain all rights to a subsequent recall, will retain all rights to a
26
subsequent recall.
Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 8.09 G., the employee must advise within 24 hours of his intention to accept or refuse such a recall. If he choses to accept such recall, he must report to work as required.
The Company will not be responsible for any claims as a result of errors arising out of the administration of this Article.
8.27	An employee who, by reason of minor disability, advancing age or other causes, is unable to maintain the necessary standard of efficiency or safety on his job may, after discussion between the Parties, be moved to some other job for which he is qualified and be exempted from the continuous service provisions of this Article.
8.28	A. An employee in a line of promotion may request transfer to the labour pool of his Department Job Group. If his request is approved by the Company he shall then forfeit his job seniority in all jobs in the line of promotion from which he has requested transfer.
B. When the Company fills a permanent vacancy in a Department Labour Pool it will consider on the basis of Company continuous service, any labourer from another Department Labour pool who has expressed a preference for work in the pool where the vacancy exists except that during the peak vacation period only fifty (50) percent of the Mine Department Labour Pool vacancies may be filled in this manner.
8.29	A. An employee may, by completion of a form furnished by the Company, voluntarily relinquish his eligibility :
1.	For recall to a job outside his line of promotion from which he has been reduced.
2.	For recall and promotion for filling permanent vacancies within his line of promotion.
3.	For promotion for filling temporary vacancies within his line of promotion.
B. An employee may regain his eligibility within his line of promotion by application on a form provided by
27
the Company, not less than thirty (30) days after his voluntary relinquishment. Eligibility for filling temporary vacancies shall be effective immediately on the Company’s receipt of such an application; eligibility for recall and promotion for filling permanent vacancies shall be regained thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the application.
C. An employee who relinquishes his right to recall in accordance with this Article shall lose seniority in that job and in all other equal or higher jobs in that line of promotion.
An employee who has not voluntarily relinquished his eligibility in accordance with A. above at the time a vacancy is being filled, shall be considered eligible to fill such a vacancy and will be promoted in accordance with 8,15 A. andB.
8.30	Except as provided for in this Article, no employee may displace another.

The Union shall immediately advise the Company in writing of the names of those selected and of any changes that may occur. Not more than two Grievance Committeemen may act on the Union Grievance Committee at Step No 1 and no more than three (3) at Step N o 2 of the Grievance Procedure.
9.03	It is the purpose of this Article to settle complaints promptly and no grievance will be processed if the event or circumstances on which it is based occurred or originated more than seven (7) days prior to the time the grievance is first presented in writing except in the event of a suspension. In the event of a suspension a grievance will be processed if it is presented within five
28
(5) days of the return to work of the employee who was suspended. A grievance protesting a suspension of ten (10) days or greater that is appealed to arbitration within the specified time limits shall have the same priority as a discharge as outlined in Paragraph 3 of Article 11.04.
9.04	Any employee who believes that the Agreement has been violated with respect to him shall discuss his complaint with his Foreman, accompanied by a Grievance Committeeman, if he so desires, and there shall be no deduction from their pay for time spent in such discussion. Recognizing the importance of full discussion between the Foreman and the employee in clearing up misunderstandings and preserving harmonious relations, every effort shall be made at this point to settle the complaint. Should the employee feel that his complaint has not been satisfactorily resolved after he has discussed it with his Foreman, he may request and shall receive from his Foreman a signed “Record of Complaint” form in duplicate.
STEP NO. 1
No earlier than twenty-four (24) hours following receipt by the employee of the “Record of Complaint” form, his complaint may become a grievance and be presented to the aggrieved employee’s Department Head in writing, clearly stating the violation being alleged and the adjustment requested. A grievance shall be on a form provided by the Company and shall be signed by the aggrieved employee and by a Grievance Committeeman along with a copy of the “Record of Complaint” form. The Department Head and/or his representatives shall meet with the Grievance Committeeman within five (5) days following receipt of the grievance.
If the circumstances so warrant, the Foreman and/or the grievor may be present.
The Department Head’s decision shall be given in writing and a copy thereof returned to the Grievance Committeeman within seventy-two (72) hours after the Step No. 1 meeting. If no appeal is taken from the Department Head’s decision within the time limit set
29
Forth below, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the Department Head’s decision. STEP NO. 2
If the Department Head’s decision is judged to be unsatisfactory, it may be appealed by the Grievance Committeeman within five (5) days of its receipt. The appeal shall be made by completing the grievance form and mailing it to the Company using the official notice procedure set forth in Article 19.
The Resident Manager and/or his representatives shall meet with the Grievance Committeeman within ten (10) days following receipt of such appeal to discuss the grievance. A representative of the International Union may attend the meeting and witnesses either Party may require may be heard.
Within seven (7) days, the Resident Manager’s decision shall be given in writing to the Union, unless a definite date for decision is mutually agreed upon. If no appeal to Arbitration is taken from the Resident Manager’s decision within the time set forth in Article 10, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the Resident Manager’s decision.
9.05	The Grievance Procedure may be utilized by the Union in processing a grievance which is not a personal grievance and which alleges a violation or misinterpretation of this Agreement. Such grievances may be introduced at Step No. 2 of the Grievance Procedure. In processing such a grievance, the Company and the Union shall observe the specified time limits in appealing and answering.
9.06	Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays recognized herein shall not be included when determining the time within which any action is to be taken under Articles 9, 10, or 11. Any and all time limits fixed by this Article or Articles 10 and 11 may be extended by mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union. Any grievance not answered by the Company within the prescribed time limits may be appealed by the Union to the next step.
9.07	Grievance meetings will be held during working hours and neither a Grievance Committeeman nor a
30
grievor will suffer any loss of pay for attendance. To attend a Grievance Meeting within his working hours a Grievance Committeeman or a Grievor must obtain permission from his Foreman to leave his work. Such permission will not be refused arbitrarily. Time spent in scheduled Grievance Meetings with the Company during a Committeeman’s or a Grievor’s regular scheduled shift shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
When Step 1 and 2 Grievance Meetings are scheduled outside or go beyond the regular scheduled shift of the Grievance Committeeman referred to in 9.02, he shall be paid one (1) hour at straight time rates for such attendance in addition to hours lost during his regular scheduled shift.
9.08	When an employee completes one (1) year of active service free of any written disciplinary action, his official previous disciplinary record maintained in the Industrial Relations Department will not be referred to or considered in establishing any future discipline for him.
When an employee has been disciplined, the Industrial Relations Department will, upon request, inform the Union President, or the Grievance Committeeman involved of the employee’s disciplinary record.
When an employee has been disciplined, the Industrial Relations Department will send copies of all such written discipline to the Union.
9.09	If the facts alleged in a grievance involving a number of employees are identical and the remedy sought is the same, a decision on the grievance of one of the employees involved will be applied to all who are entitled, at that time, to such a decision without the necessity of each filing an individual grievance.
9.10	When the Company has established that an infraction has been committed by an employee and that disciplinary action is warranted, he will be disciplined within five (5) working days.

For the second and each subsequent year of service completed after March 1, 1979, and for which an employee receives an annual vacation pay, extended vacation pay will be increased by a 20-hour Service Bonus. Such Service Bonus will be paid at the same time as extended vacation and at the standard hourly rate of the regular job held at each service year anniversary date in the applicable period of years preceding the date Extended Vacation is paid.
15.11 Vacation Extension pay shall be calculated by multiplying the appropriate calculation factor listed below by one-fifth (1/5) of the employee’s earnings accumulated during the five (5) year period of qualification for the Vacation Extension.

SUBJECT : 12 Hours Shifts
This confirms our understanding with respect to the implementation of a 12-hours shift schedule for employees who are assigned to a seven-day rotating shift schedule. The Company agrees to implement such schedule on the basis that it does not cost the Company any additional monies.
For employees working a twelve-hour shift schedule, the Parties agree that the following amendment shall be applied to the current Collective Agreement (1990-1993).
6.06 An employee required to be absent from work to attend the funeral of his father, mother, wife, child, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandchildren or grandparents shall be granted a funeral leave for the time necessary for that purpose. For twenty-four hours of such leave he shall be paid at his straight time hourly rate.
6,09 An employee who is summoned to serve on a criminal jury or to attend court as a witness in a criminal or quasi-criminal case, will be paid an allowance equal to the difference between the payment he received for each day of service and the pay he would normally have received had he worked as scheduled on each day of such service. To qualify for such an allowance, an employee must give his foreman at least three (3) days notice of his impending absence and later must provide the Company with Court documentation justifying his absence for jury service or his attendance at court as a witness and verifying any payment he has received for
90
jury service. The foregoing provisions shall also apply where an employee is scheduled to work the 20:00 to 08:00 shift immediately prior to being required for jury duty or as a witness in response to a summons for any time during the 08:00 to 20:00 period of the day.
7.01	An employee shall be considered probationary for a period of thirty five (35) days of actual work. At the end of the probationary period such employee’s name shall be placed upon the seniority lists, where applicable, as of the date of commencement of work for the Company.
8.13 B, Vacancies resulting from absenteeism, illness, injury, suspension or leave of absence will be considered as permanent if they last longer than 10 shifts.
C, Vacancies such as those in B. preceding, which last less than ten (10) shifts, vacancies which are caused by annual vacation and those which exist while permanent vacancies are being filled shall be considered as temporary.
11.04	If the discharge is appealed to arbitration, the Arbitrator will have full jurisdiction to uphold or to reduce the discharge to a suspension and to fix the duration of the suspension. If the Arbitrator rejects the discharge or reduces it to a suspension, the employee shall be reinstated and paid for time lost since the date of discharge or for the period of time not covered by the suspension but in no case shall this period exceed 120 working days, to which shall be added any number of days that the Arbitration was delayed by request of the Company or from which shall be subtracted any number of days that the arbitration was delayed by request of the Union. Such payment shall be the difference between the amount of money actually received by the employee for work performed by him in each week during the period that he was off work due to discharge and the amount that he would have received for each such week for regularly scheduled work has he been continued at work in the job classification that he held at the time of his discharge.
12.03 A. The normal week shall be established by the work schedule.
91
12.04	Daily hours of work shall be consecutive and two (2) lunch periods, not to exceed twenty (20) minutes each, shall be considered as time worked. Where required, the employee shall eat on the job and the Company shall not be obligated to provide a relief man for such time. An employee who works more than two (2) hours beyond his regular shift will be provided with a hot meal and the time to eat it (not to exceed twenty (20) minutes) will be considered as time worked.
12.05	Weekly work schedules shall be posted no later than noon, Thursday, of the preceding week and no changes shall be made in sych schedules solely for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime rates. If it is later necessary to change his schedule, without having given him at least twenty-four (24) hours notice of the change, an employee will be paid at the rate of double time for the first eight (8) hours of the changed schedule. The remaining scheduled hours will be paid at straight time.
12.06	Overtime at the rate of time and one-half will be paid for hours worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours or hours worked on an employee’s scheduled days off. Overtime at the rate of double time will be paid for hours worked in excess of sixteen (16) consecutive hours. Overtime will not be paid on the basis of hours worked in a week.
Work scheduled and performed on Sunday will be paid for at the rate of time and one-half for the first eight (8) hours and at the rate of double time for hours worked in excess of eight (8), except that an employee who is scheduled and works 84 straight time hours in a pay period will receive double time for hours worked on a scheduled Sunday off during that pay period.
Any period of overtime which ends with an incomplete half (112) hour, that portion of the half hour will be rounded to a full half (112) hour for pay purpose.
12.10 An employee who reports for and actually performs work as assigned on a scheduled shift will be paid for at least four (4) hours, eight (8) hours if he works more than four (4) hours, twelve (12) hours if he works more than eight (8) hours, at the rate of pay for the job for which scheduled unless he is assigned to a
92
higher rated job in which event he will be paid at the rate of the job performed.
12.12	A. An employee requested to return to work for a full extra shift after having left the property and with at least four (4) hours prior notice or who is requested to provide shift relief with less than four (4) hours prior notice, and who reports for such work and works as assigned, will be paid at the overtime rate of time and one-half or at the appropriate Holiday or Sunday work rate, when applicable, for all hours worked and shall be given the opportunity to work at least twelve (12) hours.
B. An employee requested to return to work, after having left the property other than for his scheduled shift or shift relief, with less than four (4) hours prior notice or for less than twelve (12) hours work, and who reports for such work and works as assigned, will be paid at the overtime rate of double time and for at least three (3) hours for such extra work. Upon being requested to return to work the employee will be informed of the work to be performed and the work required will be confined to work necessitated by the callout. At the completion of said work, the employee, at his discretion, may leave the job or, if he agrees, to be assigned to other work, in which case he will continue to be paid at the rate of double time for so long as the extra work continues, or to the commencement of his scheduled shift.

93
pay for the job performed or for his regular job whichever is higher. Such an employee assigned to a higher rated job during a work day will be paid at the higher rate for the remaining portion of the first eight (8) hours of the shift even though he returned to his regular job during that period. Should the employee work at the higher rate job in excess of the first eight (8) hours he shall be paid at the higher rate for the balance of the shift.
16,01 Each employee shall receive, for any of the holidays set forth in Section 16.02, a holiday allowance equal to eight (8) hours pay at the straight time rate which he receives, or would have received had he worked on such holiday, providing the following criteria are met :

B.	He performs work or is on vacation in the pay period in which the holiday is observed.

-	150% of their regular rate for the first twelve (12) hours;
-	200% of their regular rate for the next four (4) hours;
■	250% of their rate for all hours worked in excess of
