(d)	The order of designated call-in on call mandating will start with the most junior qualified employee and will rotate on a seniority basis within each job category so that designations for call-in on call mandating are evenly distributed among the employees in each classification. When on call, an employee must be available for that one (1) hour period between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m./p.m. and when contacted must report for work within two (2) hours of the shift start. Employees will be notified within the last four (4) hours of their last working day if they are designated mandated to be on call on their upcoming days off.

7.23	COVERAGE FOR SCHEDULED OVERTIME - 12-HOUR SHIFTS
(a)	Qualified employees will be asked by Department if they are interested in having their names on the voluntary overtime list and their names will be listed in order of seniority. Balancing of overtime for the scheduled overtime system will be on a continuous basis. Employees changing shifts or employees wanting their name added to the voluntary scheduled overtime list will be credited with an equal amount of overtime as the most overtime credits documented and would be credited with an equal amount of assignments as the least amount of assignments documented. These employees will only be eligible for overtime from the first day they start their new shift. Employees added to the list would be eligible from the day they asked to be added to the list.
(b)	Employees outside of the classification who are capable of doing the work may have their names on the scheduled overtime list under the
24
heading "Optional Employees". It will be up to the supervisors to decide who is eligible for this heading.
(c)	The Supervisor will post overtime as the dates are known. Overtime shall be scheduled every weekend for the 2-week period starting ten (10) days after the Monday of that weekend. The only exception to this would be in the case of the company receiving less than the above amount of notice for time scheduled off such as floaters. In this case, notice will be given as soon as possible. Overtime will be distributed evenly to the people on the scheduled overtime list starting with the most senior. One day at a time will be chosen by each employee in order of seniority. If overtime is not accepted by anyone on the list, move to the optional list. If still not accepted by anyone, assign in order from the most junior employee in that occupational classification. Mandating should be done only as a necessity. Mandated employees will be given at least 24 hours notice. An employee will be exempt from assignment if they have worked or are scheduled to work overtime within seven days of the shift to be assigned. Mandating to cover scheduled overtime will be shared amongst all qualified employees in the classification starting with the least senior employee with no time period for balancing. Notwithstanding the above, where the Company offers a four (4) hour overtime shift, employees who accept such shift will not be exempt from being mandated.
(d)	Employees will be credited for each shift offered whether:
a)	They work the overtime
b)	They refuse the overtime
NOTE:	To be credited with a shift of overtime, the employee must
have been available to be asked when the overtime was scheduled.
(e)	Employees will also be credited each time it is their turn for scheduled
25
overtime when they are off work on WSIB, Accident or Sickness Benefits or off on vacation or other approved leave.
(f)	Accurate records of all the above will be maintained.
(g)	72 hours notice for time off is considered scheduled overtime and at least 24 hours notice will be given to volunteers on the scheduled overtime list. The above provisions do not apply to less than a full shift.
7.24	MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT RELIEF
Should circumstances arise where none of the rotating shift mechanics are able to cover for unscheduled absenteeism on night shift or weekends (i.e. two shift mechanics off because of illness), then it may be necessary to reschedule day shift maintenance mechanics to cover these vacancies. This may require a short changeover where day shift mechanic(s) report for work at 7:00 a.m. and it is found necessary that they cover the night shift. Then it is the Company's right to send them home no later than 11:00 a.m., otherwise they shall not be required to work more than an additional eight (8) hours unless they agree to cover the entire shift. Earnings will be at straight time except for shift premiums, weekends and Statutory Holiday premiums, while the day mechanic is on shift for relief, with the exception of the first shift which is covered under Article 7.01.
7.25	Statutory holidays falling on Monday to Thursday will be covered by the Fixer scheduled to work Sunday to Thursday of the week in question. When the holiday falls on the Friday, the Fixer scheduled to work Tuesday to Saturday will provide coverage.

26
for their shift, they shall be entitled to a minimum of four (4) hours pay at not less than their standard day rate, unless previously notified by the Company to the contrary either orally or by notice on the bulletin board or by message left at the employee's residence, provided that if requested by the company the employee shall perform a minimum of four (4) hours of such available work as the Company may assign; and further provided that this section shall not apply in cases of a major mechanical breakdown affecting the entire department, work stoppage on the part of any employee or employees returning to work after an absence.

The employee shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 U) times for a minimum of four (4) hours, except on statutory or plant holidays which will be paid at double time for a minimum of four (4) hours. This provision does not apply to an employee called in early or working overtime on their regular shift, except that if any employee is called in early and is sent home prior to the completion of their regular shift, the above provision shall apply. This provision does not apply to the "Coverage for Unscheduled Absenteeism" and "Coverage for Scheduled Overtime" clauses for employees on twelve (12) hour shifts.
7.28	Any Skilled Trades employee called in to work at any time after the close of their regular shift, shall be through when the work which they were called in to do is completed. The employee shall be paid at the rate of triple (3x) time for a minimum of four (4) hours for any call-ins.

The resolution will occur within one (1) week of the employee bringing the matter to the attention of the Company. It is also understood that the day of overtime worked will not have any effect on previously scheduled or short notice overtime. Any short notice overtime that could result from employee absenteeism will be replaced from the unscheduled overtime list and not be replaced by an "opportunity to work" day. The Union and the Company will meet to resolve any issues. The Company will review the above with all Shift Supervisors. A shift Supervisor may not bypass an eligible employee on the scheduled overtime list for any reason not previously approved by the Human Resources Manager.
7.33	Time for all meetings called by the Company will be paid at the applicable hourly rate, provided the training takes place during the employee's regular working hours or where the Company insists on mandatory attendance.

If an employee has had previous experience related to the specific job in question, and can reasonably be expected to reach qualified rate in another occupational group or department and is still physically capable, the employee's seniority shall be recognized. Satisfactory previous experience requires having earned qualified rate in such other occupational group or department or having enough previous experience to enable the employee to perform that job as a qualified employee within forty (40) or forty-eight (48) working hours, depending on whether the employee is an eight (8) or twelve (12) hour worker.
OR
The employee shall be entitled to be transferred to a job in any
45
department which is held by an employee with less seniority, provided the employee is capable of performing that job as a qualified employee within one hundred and twenty (120) working hours. It is understood that certain jobs require certificates or extensive training that would make it difficult to become qualified in a timely manner and therefore they are excluded from the jobs that an employee may bump to. These jobs would be:
Millwright
Powerhouse and Utilities Mechanic Electrical Technician Fixer Overhauler
Loom Technician
Weaver
Process Engineering Technician Quality Control Inspector
Machinist
Electrician
Fixer
Process Control Technician
Loom Technician Over hauler
Spin Take Up Inspector
Lubrication Inspector
3.	When a change in shift schedules between 12 hours - 7 days a week and 8 hours - 5 days per week is to be implemented, placement of affected employees will be handled in accordance with the layoff language in Article 12.
12.02	In order to transfer to Assistant Stores, Shipping/Receiving, and employee must have a valid Firestone Textiles approved tow motor license.
12.03	When laid off, employees shall be presented with all options that may be available to him/her, such employees will be allowed one transfer only from their occupational group under this section. The above-mentioned one hundred and twenty (120) working hours
46
qualification period will not apply to a senior employee who is displacing a probationary employee in a production classification. However, such employees must show progress towards qualified status for that classification in accordance with standard practice.
12.04	When layoffs occur, and there are unqualified union employees in protected job classifications, the following will be considered when determining whether these junior employees shall be laid off, as their seniority dictates.
(a)	The junior employee must have posted or been placed, in accordance with the Collective Agreement, to the protected job classification prior to the announcement of any layoffs, and been working in the classification for a period of at least five (5) months.
12.05	During a recall anyone who bumped a less senior employee in another department must go back to his or her original classification or go on layoff. Such employees do not have the choice of waiving recall and staying on the job they bumped. This reinforces the policy that a permanent job classification change can only be achieved through a job posting. The training times for layoff or recall can be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. Employees recalled to their original classification shall be transferred by seniority to their original shift when there is an opportunity to do so until such time as the next job posting for that classification.
12.06	Students may be employed from April 15th to September 15th and December 20th to January 8th All students, temporary employees and probationary employees shall be laid off prior to the layoff of any regular full-time employee.
47
12.07
12.08
12.09
12.10
12.11
Employees laid off with more than 640 hours but less than two (2) years seniority shall retain their seniority for a layoff period of one year. Employees with two (2) years or more service with the Company shall retain their seniority for a period of two (2) years. Employees laid off with more than 640 hours' seniority shall accumulate seniority for a period of one (1) year or a period of time equal to their seniority at time of layoff, whichever is the lesser.
Recalled employees must reply within three (3) days and return to work within seven (7) days after notification by registered mail to their last known address. Should they fail to reply within three (3) full working days, but do reply within thirty (30) calendar days, they will be eligible for the next vacancy for which they are qualified, otherwise the employee shall be deemed to have lost all seniority rights. The Company shall take into consideration any exceptional circumstances.
When it becomes necessary for the Company to recall employees from layoff, the most senior laid off employee shall be recalled to the classification where there are available positions, provided that the employee is capable of performing the job as a qualified employee within one hundred and twenty (120) working hours. An employee recalled to a classification other than his/her own classification retains recall rights to his/her own classification and must except any recalls to this classification, as per Article 12.
Laid off employees must notify the Human Resources Department of any change in address and keep their addresses up to date at all times or their names will be removed from the recall list.
Employees desiring to leave the employ of the Company shall give seven (7) days notice where possible.
48
12.12
12.13
12.14
12.15
The Company will not be obliged to follow the seniority rules when laying off employees for less than three (3) and two (2) days of work, with eight (8) and twelve (12) hour shifts respectively, provided that such layoffs do not result in lost time for any employee of more than five (5) and four (4) days of work, for eight (8) and twelve (12) hour shifts respectively, in any eight (8) month period. In the case of any shutdowns or slowdowns that are department specific, all such layoffs will be by seniority within the classification.
(a)	Seniority lists will be brought up to date four (4) times annually and posted on the bulletin board, as well as a copy given to the Union Committee.
(b)	In the case of any grievance dealing with seniority dates, pertinent information in the employment records shall be made available for Union committee examination.
Employees may only hold seniority in one classification at a time. When an employee changes classification through job postings, layoffs, recall, etc. seniority will be retained in their previous classification until they have reached qualified rate in the new classification for the purpose of overtime.
Seniority shall apply in all case of promotion or demotion, layoff and recall provided the employee has the necessary occupational and physical qualifications. In the event that a classification is eliminated or no longer available the employee’s recall rights shall be to the first (1st) position acquired through the bumping process. Further, should an employee’s original classification be reintroduced in to the Plant within a one (1) year period, and the employee has not posted out in the interim, the employee’s recall
49
rights will then revert to the original classification from which he/she was displaced.
ARTICLE 13 - JOB POSTING
13.01	When a permanent vacancy occurs within the bargaining unit, notice shall be posted on the bulletin boards in Plant 2 and Plant 3 for a period of three (3) calendar days. Any notice posted on a Friday shall remain until Tuesday - 4:00 p.m., unless there is a paid holiday on Monday in which case the notice will remain until Wednesday - 4:00 p.m.

13.03	However, the Company may temporarily fill the vacancy with the most senior of qualified applicants who have submitted applications prior to the vacancy occurring. If, subsequently, a senior employee qualified under the above-mentioned posting bids for the job within the posting period, the senior employee shall be given the opportunity and the junior employee previously transferred shall return to the job they vacated.
13.04	An application for transfer is considered as granted from the date of job posting. A successful applicant will not be permitted to apply for another posting for a period of fifteen (15) months, with the exception of a higher qualified job. However, the employee will be given an opportunity to transfer if there are no other eligible employee(s) wishing to transfer to the classification in question before the company would recruit from outside.
50
13.05
Probationary employees may not bid on any job postings.
13.06	Any employee who is transferred to a new classification through job posting, and is subsequently removed from the job by the Company during the training period, for reasons other than discharge, shall return to their previous occupation and shift without loss of seniority. All other employees who have moved as a result of the job posting will likewise be returned to their former occupation shift without loss of seniority. All other employees who have moved as a result of the job posting will likewise be returned to their former occupation shift without loss of seniority. An employee who is awarded a job and subsequently gives up such job within the five (5) day or two (2) day period shall not be entitled eligible to sign another posting for a six (6) month period unless such posting is of a higher rate of pay.

51
13.08
13.09
13.10
Employees who are retained on the job will have their performance reviewed on a monthly basis until they reach qualified rate. However, within five (5) shifts of a transfer, an employee will have the option of returning to their previous occupation and shift.
An employee who accepts a job posting and has previously accepted the same occupation and subsequently returned to their previous shift and occupation, will not have the option of returning to their previous shift and occupation within five (5) shifts, but will be entitled to a two (2) shift orientation in the occupation he/she has applied for, and have the option of returning to their previous occupation and shift.
The following factors will be considered in evaluating an employee's skill, competence and ability, related to the performance of the work for which they are a candidate.

2.	Results of aptitude tests.
3.	Satisfactory performance on present occupation for previous six (6) months.
4.	Verified experience gained outside the Company on a similar occupation or occupations which are related to the occupation for which they are a candidate.

6.	Licenses or specified educational standards where required.
It is understood that some of the above-mentioned factors will have more relative importance than others, depending on the occupational vacancy.
13.11	The initial determination of capabilities and qualifications where it may apply to seniority shall be an exclusive function of management, with consideration of the factors set out in 12.07 but the final determination of capabilities and qualifications shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
13.12	Occupational seniority shall be recognized in the matter of shift preference when vacancies occur. Applications for shift preference will be accepted by the Department Manager or the Human Resources Department up until the time the posting is removed. However, the Company reserves the right to transfer the least senior qualified employee, as required, to maintain a balance of qualified employees and trainees on each shift. If such qualified employee is required by the Company to transfer to another shift for training purposes, this employee will be given the opportunity to return to their original shift when the trainee receives qualified rate on that job.
13.13	If the Company creates a new job classification, or combines existing job classifications, the Company will establish a wage for such new or changed job classification and notify the Union in writing within thirty (30) days. The Union has seven (7) calendar days thereafter to object to the rate set, and the matter will then be subject to negotiations between the
