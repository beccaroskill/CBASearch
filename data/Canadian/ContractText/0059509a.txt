Re; Yasatlan Banking
The following procedure will apply to the Vacation Banking option referred to in Article 13 of the parties' Collective Agreement:
1)	Elections to bank vacation should be submitted prior to the deadline for vacation scheduling requests. No additional banking of vacation will then be allowed without mutual consent.
2)	Where the Collective Agreement provides that vacation pay will be based on a percentage of prior years earnings this amount will be converted to eight (8) hour days of pay at the employee's regular rate. The result of the conversion will be the number of days to be banked.
Example:
An employee eligible for 10% vacation pay has earnings of $15,000 in the previous year. He elects to bank his "5th week' entitlement. His current rate is $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount would be 2% of $15,000 divided by $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount equal to 25 (twenty five) hours or 3.125 days.
61
3)	Employees will be advised at year's end of the amount of vacation which has been banked on their behalf. Once vacation is banked it is "locked in" until retirement, resignation or other form of termination.
4)	Payment for the banked days will be based upon the rate in effect at time of termination. The Company will co-operate to the extent practical and proper to make the payment in the manner the employee feels to be most tax effective.
5)	Where banked vacation becomes payable as a result of death the payment will be made to the deceased employee's beneficiary as indicated by their life insurance beneficiary designation and in the absence of such beneficiary to their estate.

A committee formed of two Union Stewards, the Human Resources designate and the Plant Manager will review special cases to determine if there is basis for paying benefits at the standard level for those days prior to benefits entitlement under the strict interpretationof the insurance contract.
In the case of "ties" the matter will be resolved in the favour of the employee. If the $600.00 dollars (six hundred) fund is exhausted the committee will not meet until the next calendar year and no cases will be eligible for special treatment.

Re: Continental Work Week _ Article 8 B1
The Continental Work Week (CWW) will not be introduced into coffee manufacturing or the syrups (manufacturing, filling and packing) department unless and until additional volumes are introduced into the factory.
The Company believes that the support function(s) impacted by the continental work week will be limited to the following:
Shop/Line Mechanics A
Any addition to the above will be by mutual agreement between the parties. Such agreement shall not be unreasonably wlth-eld.
All employees when working a continental work week shall be paid a shift premium of twelve percent (12%) for all regularly scheduled, non-overtime hours worked. This payment includes employees in syrups (manufacturing, filling and packing), coffee manufacturing and the power house.
Empoyees working a twelve (12) hour CWW shift will be paid twelve (12) hours for all scheduled working time lost for bereavement and juty duty period. Statutory holidays will be paid for twelve (12) hours when work-
66
ing a twelve (12) hour CWW shift. Vacation calculation will be based on hours.
The continental work week is not designed to eliminate overtime. Overtime will continue to be required based on production requirements and employees will continue to receive time and a half for working on their sixth day and double time for working on their seventh day. The only change is that there will be no premium payments for working on Saturday or Sunday where Saturday or Sunday are not the sixth or seventh day that an employee works in the week.

LETTER OF INTENT Rp- Job Redundancy
Where a seniority employee's regular job becomes redundant such employee will acquire the right to displace less senior employees. The following procedure would apply:
1)	The number of redundant position(s) will be determined.
2)	The posted position(s) held by the most junior employee(s) in the factory, production or ticketed trade, whichever is applicable, would be reassigned to the displaced employee(s).
3)	The most senior displaced employee(s) would indicate their order of preference on the available job(s). The displaced employee would be placed in the job that best matches their ability and qualifications. Qualifications shall mean that, at the reasonable discretion of management, the employee has the capability to qualify for the job within a reasonable period of time and /or has competently performed the job. The employee must possess the necessary licenses or trade qualifications if applicable. Failure to select a job will result in the employee bumping to general labour or being laid off.
74
4)	These jobs would then be considered
the employee’s posted position. The reassigned employee would be unable to bid for six months as per Article 5(a).
5)	The six month no bid clause will not apply for the affected junior employees.
Redundancy may rise from a changing business practice which results in the removal of a classification, elimination in a classification and/or a department closure.

Re;_P.umpinq
The Company respects the need for consideration of employee seniority. The Union established bumping as an important issue during negotations as a result a joint committee will be establishedto reviewthe possibility of introducting some protection for seniority employees resulting from a temporary lay-off. The objective of the committee is to make a recommendation that will meet the following criteria;
•	Current language on article 4(d) would apply for lay-offs of two weeks or less
•	Placement of the employee will be based on their skill, ability and qualification
•	If competency can be achieved within 50% of the lay-off period, training will be provided (e.g. a four week lay-off - would receive up to two weeks training)
•	Employees may choose not to participate i.e. elect lay-off
•	Does not result in lower line efficiencies
•	Minimal disruption
•	Minimal administration
Deadline for a bumping process recommendation would be September 30, 2001.
The Director, Operations will review the recommendation to ensure the above criteria are met before implementing. There will
77
be a three month trial basis. Employees would not be able to grieve during the trial period if a procedural error is made, unless the employee brought the error, in writing, prior to the actual bump/layoff to the Company's attention.
After the three months the process would be reviewed, by the Director, Operations to determine if it effectively met the established criteria. If the trial failed to meet the established criteria, the bumping process would revert back to Article 4 (d).
