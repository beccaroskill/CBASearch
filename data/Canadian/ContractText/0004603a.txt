In this case, as the probationary period for apprentices three (3) months, apprentices will not enter school prior to the completion of their three month probationary period.
10.	Thereafter, entry into school will depend on the schedule of school sessions set up by the Apprenticeship Board. The Company will make up the difference between the Canada Manpower Training and Assistance Program Allowance and the employee’s normal earnings (based on his regular straight time hourly rate multiplied by 40 hours per week) for the duration of the school term. Upon completion of each period of training in an approved vocational school, apprentices will be required to pass examinations set by the Apprenticeship Branch. In the event of failure to pass the examination, apprentices shall be required to be re-examined within 12 months. Failure to pass the second examination will result in the apprentice being removed from the program. Apprentices removed from the program will return to their original position. In the event the original position no longer exists, he will return to one with an equivalent rate. Existing Maintenance employees hired prior to September 1, 1981 and still in our employ who have not obtained a Journeyman’s ticket will be encouraged to enter the program at a level to be individually determined by the Apprenticeship Branch. Persons presently employed as Journeymen who do not wish to become certified, or who take the technical qualifications examination and fail
40
shall continue to be employed as journeymen, and if a
person presently employed as a journeyman fails to pass the test for a voluntary Technical Qualifications Certificate, he can then become indentured as an apprentice. Once started in the Apprenticeship program, subject however to the provisions of the Collective Agreement, the apprentice shall have the right to continue providing he passes all prescribed tests as provided for him by the apprenticeship regulations, and work is available to him. Upon completion of his first year of apprenticeship an apprentice shall not be affected by operational curtailment as it applied to other employees exercising their seniority.
