The Company and the Union agree that the Insurance coverage generally summarized in this Article is noted in this Collective Agreement for purposes of convenience only; that the actual insurance coverage for crew members is by the Insurers and not by the Company; that the Company will assist the Union and crew members with any claims under such insurance but shall not itself be liable for any claim related to such insurance coverage which is not subject to arbitration but is rather governed by the actual Insurance policies of the Insurers.
LIFE INSURANCE & ACCIDENTAL DEATH & DISMEMBERMENT
$50,000 Life Insurance and $50,000 Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage (atotal of $100,000 on Accidental Death) shall be provided at all times while a crew member is with National Sea Products Limited including days at sea and days on land between trips or while on a granted leave of absence or while the vessel is on refit. This insurance shall be a condition of crewing on Company vessels and will continue while a crew member until the age of 65 at which time the benefit will be reduced by 50% until the age of 70 years is reached. An insurance card must be signed
22
on the first trip at sea and coverage will be for that trip and future trips on Company vessels.
Crew members can purchase, at their cost, optional life and A,D. & D. coverage.
If a member of this group insurance plan becomes totally and permanently disabled from a sickness or accident before the age of 65 years, after a waiting period of 6 months and as long as they remain totally and permanently disabled they will be eligible to receive the amount of this Life Insurance in monthly instalments spread over a 5 year period.
GROUP ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS INSURANCE
This benefit is available to all members and is a condition of crewing on Companytrawlers. The coverage is effective on completion of the first trip to sea. The benefits are payments of $250 per week. Weekly sickness benefits start on the fourth day, nonindustrial accident benefits start on the first day; both continue through to 26 weeks of disability. This means that the first 26 weeks of disability are covered by this plan. The next 15 weeks are covered by U.I.C. (Industrial accidents are, of course, covered by Worker's Compensation and not by this policy.) This benefit continues to age 70, if still crewing on Company vessels.
Premiums are paid in advance, but even if paid, when a crew member is on leave or layoff a weekly indemnity benefit cannot be claimed until there is available work for the crew member.
DENTAL PLAN
This benefit is available to all members and is a condition of crewing on companytrawlers. The coverage is
23
effective on completion of 6 months of continuous service. The plan pays80% of the 1990 provincial dental fee guide for the basic maintenance of teeth, such as cleaning, extractions and fillings, 50% of the 1990 provincial dental fee guide for major dental care services such as crowns and dentures to a maximum of $1000 in any one calendar year, and 50% reimbursement for orthodontia which covers children from 6 to 18 years, to a $1500 lifetime maximum.
The plan will pay for covered services after an annual deductible is satisfied - $50 single and $100 family.
PENSION PLAN
The company agrees to establish a flat rate benefit pension plan effective January 1, 1989 for all crew members within the bargaining unit. Terms and conditions with respect to the pension plan are outlined in the pension plan document which will be attached to this agreement as schedule “E”. Crew members will be credited service as of January 1, 1991 at a benefit rate of $12 per month per year of service. The basic year of service for crew members under the provisions of the plan will be 17 trips or 90% of trips offered. Any trawlerman employed as of January 1, 1989 who reaches age 65 and retires after January 1, 1989 will be guaranteed a minimum pension of $75 per month. Crew members will also have the option of supplementing their retirement benefit by contributing $7 per week of service to a money purchase plan. Contributions accumulate with investment income for each member until the member's retirement date. The accumulated amount of the member's “fund” is then used to determine how much retirement benefit he will receive.
24
All of the statementswith regardto benefits are a summary of items covered in the policies and where an interpretation is required the policies themselves shall govern.
BLUE CROSS PLAN “13S”
This benefit is available to all members and is a condition of crewing on Company trawlers. The coverage is effective inthe month-following the first premium paid. Plan“13S" Group Package providesfull cost of semiprivate room and out-patient care and pays 80°/o of cost (no deductible) for extended hospital and related service, vision care at $125 per 24 months and hearing aids. For prescription drugs a plastic credit card is supplied and a member pays $1.00 per prescription with the balance paid by Blue Cross directly to the pharmacist.
MONTHLY COST OF BENEFIT TO CREW MEMBERS
To keep up eligibility a monthly payment must be made each month and it shall be deducted from each new crew member on the settlement of the first trip in each month. If for any reason a trip is not made in a month such as for sickness, leave of absence, etc., it is important to arrange for the monthly payment to be paid in advance in order to maintain eligibility.
STARTING MONTHLY DEDUCTIONS
The Insurance Company or Blue Cross may increase or decrease their rates and therefore the above deductions are initial starting deductions. In any event the Company will pay an equal amount to the following plans: Group Accident and Sickness, Blue Cross Plan“13S" and Dental. The rates shown are one-half the total initial cost of these plans.

THE LAY ARRANGEMENT
1.	A charge for leers will be deducted from the Gross Stockfor each trip of a vessel to determine the “Shared Stock” and thirty-seven percent (37%) of this amount shall be set aside as the crew’s share from which the cost of provisions will be deducted before sharing the balance. From this balance Learners (three (3) consecutive trips on a vessel) shall receive five-eighths(5/8) of a share, then the balanceshall be shared equally among the rest of the crew. When a new unknown crew member joins a vessel claiming to be experienced the Captain and crew shall jointly decide during the first trip if such crew member shall be designated as a Learner.
Crew members making their 1st trip will receive full share if the Captain and the majority of the crew agree. This can go on for three (3)trips but
29
the crew member must take a deckhand test after three (3) trips, if not they will go on 5/8 share.
2.	In addition to the foregoing share the Company will pay the following commissions to the following officers:
Mate	- 2% of Shared Stock
Chief Engineer	- 2% of Shared Stock,
when Certified -1/2% of Shared Stock, when not Certified Bosun	-1% of Shared Stock
when Certified - 1/2°/o of Shared Stock, when not Certified Cook, 2nd Engineer - 5/8% of Shared Stock
3.	ICERS
(a)	Four (4) leers per vessel shall each be paid according to the following schedule and conditions. Payments shall be $60 per trip on the first 100,000 pounds plus $5.00 for each 10,000 pounds in excess of 100,000 pounds. For this pay the leers shall take the responsibility for proper icing and shelving procedures on behalf of the crew regardless of who assists them in the icing.
(b)	For leers to receive their full icing payments they shall separate the species in the pens with the fish well iced and shelved in accordancewith the shelf plan designed to assure good quality fish. This plan will be posted on each vessel. There shall be no more than 10% Grade C plus Rejected fish which will be measured on a per
30
pen basis. Fish in a pen can be downgraded due to improper icing and where the shelf boards are not resting on the strongbacks or when indications are that the boards were resting on ice and when a pen has mixed species. Mixed species will be permitted on the last part of a trip when the hold is full.
4.	TRAWLERMEN

NATIONAL SEA PRODUCTS LIMITED QUALITY GRADING PROGRAM FOR TRAWLER CAUGHT GROUNDFISH
Fish shall be graded, at the time of discharge, as
Grade “A’, Grade “B”, Grade “C” of Rejectaccor-
ding to the following procedures:
1.	At-Sea Fish Handling Practices
To qualify as Grade A the following requirements shall
be met:
(i)	All fish shall be properly penned and shelved. To qualify as properly penned and shelved, the shelf boards shall be arranged according to a company approved shelving plan as posted on each vessel. The shelf boards should be resting on the shelf streaks (strongbacks) at the time of discharge and there should be no indicationthat the shelf boards rested on ice. Fish will not under any circumstances be downgraded for improper shelving caused by reasons that are beyond the control of the fishermen such as: penboards buckling from the weight of fish and ice, stanchions being distorted, shelf streaks improperly installed by shore personnel, etc.
(ii)	All fish shall be properly iced. Proper icing is achieved when each shelf of fish is encased in ice on all sides, top, and bottom and ice is mixed through the fish at time of discharge. Heavy layers of ice and layers of fish with no ice mixed
. through the fish shall not be considered proper
37
icing. Fish shall not be downgraded for poor icing if the company fails to remove contaminated ice or ice that is more than 2 trips old.
(iii)	The fish flesh shall be 3.3 degrees Centigrade (38 degrees Fahrenheit) or less but not frozen at the time of discharge.
(iv)	All fish shall be properly washed so that they do not contain sand, mud, gravel, any sea bottom debris or extreme amounts of blood at time of discharge.
(v)	All fish that are required to be gutted shall be cleanly gutted so that the gut content shall be less than 1% by weight at the time of discharge. Fish that contain more than 1% gut content by weight shall not qualify as Grade “A". All fish shall be properly ripped so that they are not ripped beyond the anal opening to ensure the fish are suitable for machine processing and so that they are not ripped on the side so as to affect fillet yield or the product in which the fillet can be packed.
All fish that are required to be bobtailed (all turbot and all flatfish except greysole) shall be properly bobtailed so that proper bleeding I s assured and so that fillet yield is not affected. Tails shall not remain attached to the fish in any single days catch, providing 10% or less of the fish have the tails attached the fish shall qualify as Grade “A”, When more than 20% of the fish havethe tails attached the fish shall not qualify as Grade “A” and there shall be a weight deduction for tails that remain attached to the fish.
38
(vi)	Boxed or containerized fish shall be properly filled and stacked so that the weight of one container is not resting on the fish in another container.
In the application of all of the above standards in borderline cases the benefit of doubt shall always be given to the fish qualifying as Grade "A". Fish that do not meet the above requirements shall be downgraded to Grade “B" provided they are wholesome and satisfy other standard requirements.
The purpose of the above standards is to ensure all fishermen use good at-sea fish handling practices to ensure that they land the maximum amount of top grade fish. In application of these standards fish shall not be downgraded for any reason that is beyond the control of the fishermen themselves.
NATIONAL SEA PRODUCTS LIMITED FISH WEIGHING AND RECEIPT PROCEDURES
1.	All fish shall be unloaded directly from the trawler through existing unloading systems and weighed over scales approved and stamped by the Department of Weights and Measuresand monitored regularly by the Union.
2.	Scales shall not be adjusted upward or downward to allow for any factors and shall balance at zero (0) all year round.
3.	The Weighmaster shall record the actual weight and specie contained in each lot of fish before tripping scales or allowing the removal of each lot of fish, and make available to the Union, if requested, a copy of the original record.
39
4.	Gross weight shall be the total weight that passes over the scales or the total weight passing over scales plus anything culled out prior to tallying weight.
5.	Deductions from gross weight may be made for the following reasons:
(a)	ice and water
(b)	undersize fish
(c)	inedible species
(d)	green spots
(e)	congenital defects not including normal infestation by worms
6.	Deductions to be made from the gross weight shall be arrived at in the following manner:
(a)	for ice and water - random samples, minimum of five (5) per shift, to determine appropriate percentages;
(b)	for undersizefish- random samples, minimum of five (5) per shift to establish appropriate percentage to be deducted from gross weight. Where practical the foregoing percentage shall be checked against the actual weight of undersized fish culled out on the production line anywhere from trawler to cutting line, to ensure that the percentage is reasonably accurate. Where this comparison is made and carried out to completion, and the results do not coincide, the actual weight culled out will be used for making deductions from gross weight;
(c)	for inedible species - (i) random samples, minimum of five (5) per shift, to establish the appropriate percentage to be deducted from gross weight, or (ii)' the actual weight of such specie culled out on the production line;
40
1(d) for green spots ■ these fillets shall be culled out, weighed and converted back to dressed fish on the basis of a standard twenty-eight percent (28%) yield;
(e) for congenital defects not including normal infestation by worms - in the same manner as green spots.
7.	Deductions for reasons outlined in 5(d) and 5(e) herein, which amount to five percent (5%) or more of gross weight, will be certified in writing by a Federal Fisheries Inspection Officer provided one is readily available and is willing to do so.
8.	In any dispute over quality at time and point of discharge, the opinion of the Federal Fisheries Inspection Officer shall prevail providing the Officer is available and willing to express his opinion subject to arbitration as herein provided.
9.	If all fish are processed before the trawler is settled, the deductions will be the actual amounts found. If the trawler is settled before all fish are cut, the deduction will be based on the percentage found up to the time of settlement.
10.	The Company will endeavour to ensure that quality does not suffer as a result of any of its actions. An allegation by the Union that the Company has failed in this regard may be dealt with without disruption through grievance and arbitration.
11.	The receipt shall show the net processable fish as per species and size, the deductions from gross weight for items5(a) to 5(e), and the reasons for same.
12.	With respect to boxed or containerized fish the following shall apply:
41
(a)	For each species boxedor containerizedfish, the contents of a minimum of 10% of the boxes or containers, randomly chosen, shall be applied to the entire catch as the basis for settling the trip.
(b)	With respect to quality dockside grading, a sampling procedure similar to that usedfor penned fish shall be applied to the sample boxes in A above, as the basis for determining the quality grades.
