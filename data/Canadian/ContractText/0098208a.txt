Re: Return to Work Program
We believe that a workplace-based joint Company/Union approach, which will assist employees who become injured or ill to return to work is the most effective strategy towards reducing the economic cost of disability and maintaining the employability of our employees.
We believe that this Return to Work Program can be implemented and be compatible with current statutory and collective agreement obligations.
Both parties agree to participate and implement this effective Return to Work Program, which will return workers to a full productive capacity.
