PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
1.1	The general purpose of this Agreement is to continue

- EXCLUSIONS
The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of collective bargaining in respect to wages, hours of work and working conditions on behalf of all employees of the Company at its operations in the Townships of Zorra and Southwest Oxford save and except foremen, persons above the rank of foremen, office staff and non-bargaining unit stores and laboratory staff.
The Union recognizes that there are working staff employees in the Stores and Laboratory Departments in addition to bargaining unit members. However, the Company will not displace or replace bargaining unit members with staff employees in these departments. The Company and the Union agree that, if the incumbent staff Storekeeper permanently leaves the position for any reason, his present bargaining unit function will not continue to be performed by a staff person and that supervisory personnel may continue to supplement bargaining unit stores personnel during peak periods or on off-shifts when a full time bargaining unit job is not justified.
Under normal conditions, employees outside the scope of the bargaining unit to which this Agreement applies, shall not do work which is customarily performed by members of the bargaining unit. This shall not apply to staff employees who are engaged in:
i)	training employees
ii)	experimental work
iii)	work which is required due to emergency conditions beyond the control of the Company.
(b) Outside contractors will not perform bargaining unit work. The Company, however, does reserve the right to use outside contractors:
i)	on jobs that are capital in scope and beyond the availability of bargaining unit personnel
ii)	on jobs that require excess manpower for a short period of time (However, the Company agrees that they shall not use contractors if it is possible to utilize laid off employees.)
iii)	on jobs that involve detailed mechanical or electrical repairs of major importance requiring warranties
iv)	on jobs of an emergency nature where qualified bargaining unit employees are not available.
The Company will discuss with the Union the intent to use contractors per the above, unless an emergency situation exists precluding that.
NO DISCRIMINATION
2.3	(a)	The Company and the Union agree that there shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint or coercion by the Company, the Union, or any of their respective agents against any employee because of membership in or legitimate activity on behalf of the Union.
	(b)	The Union agrees that there shall be no Union activity on Company property at any time unless such activity is specifically permitted elsewhere in this Agreement or the
Page..	. 9	
2.4
2.5
2.6
Page..
Company grants permission therefore in writing.
(c) The Company and the Union agree that in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code there shall be no discrimination against any employee by the Union, Company or the employees because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability.
The Company will provide enough copies of the Collective Agreement to the Union for the distribution to its members and will also supply enough copies for the distribution to new members.
The Company agrees to provide up to a maximum of one (1) hour for the presentation of the Union's New Member Orientation Program during the Plant New Employee Indoctrination.
The word "employee" or "employees" wherever hereinafter used in this Agreement shall mean any and all the employees as the case may be in the bargaining unit as defined in Section 2.1 above, unless the context otherwise provides.

ARTICLE III
FUNCTION OF MANAGEMENT
3.1	The Union recognizes the right of the Company to hire, promote and demote, transfer, suspend or otherwise discipline and discharge any employees, subject to the right of the employee concerned to lodge a grievance in the manner and to the extent herein provided.
3.2	The Union further recognizes the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities. In addition, the location of the plants, the products to be manufactured, the schedules of production and hours of work, the methods, processes, the means of manufacturing and operating are solely the responsibility of the Company. The Company also has the right to make and alter from time to time rules and regulations to be observed by the employees, which rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
It is agreed that the enumeration of the above functions shall not exclude customary management functions not herein enumerated.
3.3	The Company agrees that these functions are subject to the terms of this Agreement and will be exercised in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV
UNION SECURITY
MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP
4.1	All employees of the Company covered by this Agreement as set out in Article 2.1(a) shall as a condition of employment, become and remain a member in good standing of the Union for the duration of this Agreement.
CHECK-OFF OF UNION DUES
4.2	The Company will deduct from all wages due each employee such bi-monthly Union membership dues as are levied on all members of the Union. Each such deduction shall be for the then two week period and shall be in the amount from time to time fixed in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union and certified to the Company by the Secretary of the Local Union as being so fixed. The Company will also deduct, once only, and together with the first deduction of Union dues, the amount of the Union Initiation fee, if any, payable by any such employee, and as certified by the Secretary Treasurer of the Local Union.
4.3	The Company shall remit the Union dues deducted on or before the last day of each month to the Secretary Treasurer of the Local Union whose receipt therefore shall constitute full and complete discharge of the Company for the amount so deducted and remitted. Each such remittance shall be accompanied by a list of the names of the employees from whose pay such deductions were made along with the
Page... 12
4.4
amount deducted for that month and the accumulated total to that date. The Company will provide on each individual employee's T-4 slip, the total amount of Union dues deductions for the calendar year.
If the wages due any employee in any week are insufficient to permit the deduction of the full amount of the Union dues for such week after providing for any and all other deductions required by law or authorized by the employee in writing, no Union dues shall be deducted during such week. The employee is responsible to pay full dues for the month in any month in which the employee works five (5) days (vacation shall be considered as days worked for the purpose of dues deduction), however, an employee working less than five (5) days in any month shall not be required to pay dues for that month.

ARTICLE V
HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
5.1	This Article is intended to define the normal hours of work and

SHIFT WORKERS - HOURS OF WORK
Page... 15
5.7	The normal work day for shift workers shall be eight (8)
consecutive hours which shall include a thirty (30) minute lunch period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled within a one and one-half (1-1/2) hour period at the middle of the shift.
The normal work day for twelve hour shift workers shall be twelve (12) consecutive hours which shall include a thirty (30) minute lunch period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled within a one and one-half (1-1/2) hour period approximately five (5) hours into the shift and a fifteen (15) minute lunch period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled sometime after eight (8) hours into the shift.

Page... 16
5.8
Employees working on a shift operation, Monday to Friday, may work a modified schedule (e.g. ten (10) hours per day Monday to Thursday or Tuesday to Friday) providing the schedule is approved by the Company and a majority of the employees affected.
Further, the Company shall incur no penalty whatsoever for the schedule.

c)	Four (4) forty (40) hour weeks in each four (4) week cycle.
d)	The Twelve (12) Hour Shift Schedule of two (2) thirty-six (36) hour weeks and two (2) forty-eight (48) hour weeks in each four (4) week cycle.
It is understood that the twelve hour shift wording in this agreement covers only groups of employees who are working schedules in the same pattern as the Twelve Hour Shift Schedule. The parties may implement a schedule which is not identical to the existing schedule, however, such schedule will be similar in pattern to it. The Company or the Union may, upon giving thirty (30) days written notice, terminate the application of the schedule in which case, the parties agree that a schedule that complies with the provisions of the basic agreement or a schedule that is agreed to by the parties, will be implemented. The implementation or termination of the schedule shall not result in the payment of overtime hours or any other premiums which would otherwise be applicable.
OVERTIME PAYMENT
5.10	Overtime will be paid for all time worked by employees Page... 18
outside of their regular scheduled hours of work, except when such time is worked because the employee, with the consent of the foreman in charge, exchanges shifts with another employee for personal convenience. Payments will be made at the double time rate for all overtime.
5.11	Employees working shift schedules as provided for in Article 5.9 shall receive the double time rate for the normal hours worked on the sixth day of the normal scheduled work week providing they have worked or were legitimately absent for the balance of the scheduled work week. Employees working the twelve hour shift schedule as provided for in Article 5.9 shall receive the double time rate for the normal hours worked on the last scheduled eight (8) hour period in the scheduled forty-eight (48) hour work week (which occurs once in every four (4) week cycle) providing they have worked or were legitimately absent for the balance of the scheduled work week. Such employees shall receive standard overtime premiums for all time worked outside of their regular scheduled hours of work.
DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
5.12	The Company and the Union jointly recognize both the desirability of keeping overtime to a minimum and the fact that all employees should work their fair share of overtime that is required. All overtime is voluntary except the sixth shift as provided in Section 5.9 and employees of regular continuous operating jobs must remain on the job until relieved or a substitute provided.
Subject to the above, employees may apply to waive their
Page... 19
availability for overtime. Each overtime waiver will be for a specific six (6) month period (January 1 through June 30 OR July 1 through December 31). At the end of the waiver period, the employees will automatically be considered available for overtime unless they submit another overtime waiver. If the waiver period is January 1 through June 30 and they become available for overtime again on July 1, their overtime standing will reflect the average of those in the department who have their relative qualifications.
OVERTIME ROSTERS
5.13	The Company will maintain the following overtime rosters and
post same for information purposes for the employees:
Quarry & Screenline Department Pulverized Limestone Department Lime Kiln Department - Centre Lime Kiln Department - West Hydrator / Lime Kiln Department - East Maintenance Department Environmental Department Garage Personnel Stores Department Laboratory Department Production Helpers
a)	All overtime worked will be recorded on the overtime roster based on the hours worked for the assignment.
b)	All overtime refused will be recorded on the overtime roster based on two (2) times the hours worked for the assignment.
c)	Any personnel working under Article 5.9 shall not
Page... 20
count their sixth day in any week as overtime for the purposes of overtime roster records.
d)	Any personnel required to work on a holiday as part of their regular work schedule shall not count hours worked on said holiday as overtime for purposes of overtime roster records.
e)	Any personnel working under Article 5.9 and requested to work overtime on their "long weekend" or "Saturday / Sunday weekend", shall not have overtime refusals during this period marked as refusals for the purposes of the overtime roster.
f)	Overtime rosters will be updated once weekly.
g)	Employees who are returning from a prolonged approved absence (excluding vacations other than the special ten week vacation) in excess of two (2) weeks will have their roster standing adjusted to the same position, in relation to those in the department commensurate with their qualifications, as existed prior to the absence.
h)	Employees who transfer permanently to another department will assume the average overtime standing of the group, commensurate with their qualifications, on the first day of their transfer.
DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
5.14	Overtime will be distributed as equally as possible amongst
qualified employees, who want to work overtime at the time the overtime work is required. Equitable distribution of overtime over the calendar year is the goal. Both parties realize that flexibility is also desirable and that overtime standings may vary because some departments incur more
Page... 21
overtime than others and because some employees, by virtue of their qualifications, have access to more overtime than others. At the end of the calendar year any unjustifiable variation in overtime standing may result in a grievance being successful.
1.	Maintenance Work - Overtime in the Maintenance Department shall be offered initially to maintenance personnel who are qualified in the trade required; if more personnel are required it will be offered first to other qualified employees of the Maintenance Depart-ment, then to qualified employees in the department in which the overtime is being performed and then to all other qualified employees.
2.	Production Work - Production overtime required in any department will be first offered to qualified employees of that department, then to all other qualified employees.
3.	Personnel on Assignment - Personnel on weekly assignment to other departments will carry their total overtime hours with them to that department and will be deemed employees of that department for overtime purposes from the start of that week as defined in Article 5.2. Personnel assigned on a daily basis will carry their total overtime hours with them to that department and will be deemed employees of that department for overtime purposes; however, once personnel assigned on a daily basis have completed their scheduled shift and clocked out, their overtime eligibility reverts to their normal department. New
Page... 22	
employees will be credited with the average hours of overtime of employees in the department to which they are assigned on their first working day.
4. As a blanket rule in the allocation of overtime, once a determination has been made as to department and qualifications, the qualified employee (per the Qualified Personnel Listing) with the least amount of overtime on the roster is the first to be asked and the progression is upward from there. Copies of overtime requests will be sent to the Recording Secretary of the Union twice monthly. There are permissable exceptions to the blanket rule to which both the Company and the Union have agreed, as follows:
a)	Absent Employees - Employees who are off for the following reasons are not eligible for overtime, should not be called and should not have refusals marked against them.
a)	Sickness (Weekly Indemnity or L.T.D.)
b)	W.C.B. cases
c)	Vacation
d)	Leave of absence (excused absence)
e)	Disciplinary suspension
f)	Maintenance apprenticeship schooling (These employees are not available for overtime on weekdays but have access to overtime on weekends and holidays.)
b)	Casual Overtime - Some overtime instances of relative short duration may be handled by keeping crewing over and not allocation per the
Page... 23
overtime roster.
(e.g. The Quarry and Screenline crews on #3 shift may stay over for a couple of hours to get out extra production or resolve an operating problem.)
c)	Job Completion - Should an employee be performing a job prior to the regular quitting time and overtime is required to complete such a job, the Company may request such employee to remain for overtime work without regard to that employee's relative status on the roster
d)	Twelve Hour Shifts - Employees should not be asked to work overtime if it would result in their working in excess of four (4) consecutive days of twelve (12) hour shifts.
5. If the Company makes an error in overtime distribution to an employee outside of the department, the grieving department employee will be given an opportunity for an in-kind remedy (an opportunity to work the same amount of overtime) in the next thirty (30) days. If the opportunity is not convenient for the employee, then another opportunity will be given during this thirty (30) day period. If the second opportunity is declined, the whole issue comes to an end. Should the Company fail to offer the in-kind remedy, the grieving department employee will be paid an amount equivalent to the
Page
24
number of overtime hours misallocated.
EXCHANGE OF SHIFTS
5.15	Employees wishing to exchange shifts for reasons of personal convenience shall request approval of their supervisor(s) for such exchange as far in advance thereof as possible. No overtime payment or other penalty shall be incurred by the Company as a result of any such exchange of shifts by employees. The Company will maintain a file of all shift exchanges that are not completed within the same pay period.
OVERTIME LUNCH PERIODS
5.16	Employees who work one and one-half (1-1/2) or more hours overtime before their regular starting time or after their regular quitting time shall be paid a lunch allowance of nine dollars ($9.00) in cash. In the event employees work more than fourteen (14) continuous hours (more than eighteen (18) continuous hours, in the case of a twelve hour shift worker), a second meal allowance shall be paid. Should employees request and be allowed to leave the plant, they shall not be entitled to a meal allowance. Should employees be requested to work their normal daily work period on a Saturday and / or Sunday for any reason, no overtime lunch allowance will be paid unless such employees work one and one-half (1-1/2) or more hours before their scheduled starting time or after their scheduled quitting time on such days.
REPORTING PAY
Page... 25
5.17	Employees who report for work in accordance with their assigned weekly schedule or scheduled overtime hours shall be given a minimum of four (4) hours work on the day in question or if no work can be provided on the day in question they shall be entitled to payment for the lesser of their scheduled hours or four (4) hours at their assigned rate unless they have been previously notified by the Company not to report to work for the shift in question.
5.18	It is the responsibility of employees to keep the Company informed of their current address and telephone number, or of a telephone through which contact can be made. The Company will not be liable for any penalty arising from employees' failure to fulfill their obligations.
EMERGENCY CALL-INS
5.19	An emergency call-in is defined as any work outside of employees' regular scheduled hours of work, which requires them to report to work as soon as possible after being called, and of which they were not notified before last leaving (i.e. clocking out) the Company's premises.
5.20	Employees who are called in for emergency work shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at double time rate for performance of such emergency work. Such minimum allowance shall be paid whether or not an employee's regular work day commences before the expiration of two (2) hours after call-in. If maintenance employees on emergency call-in are required to perform work on a second emergency, unrelated to the first emergency, which occurs while they are
Page... 26
at the plant and of which they were not notified at the time of the initial call-in, the first call-in shall be considered over at the time they commence work on the second emergency. They shall then be considered as being on, and paid at the rate of, overtime in accordance with Article 5.10.
5.21	Employees who are called in for emergency work shall be paid at double time rate. Employees will be paid one (1) overtime meal allowance if they are called in for emergency work, report to work within a two (2) hour period of notification and are required to remain at work for more than three (3) hours.
5.22	When employees are called in for emergency work, they will punch "in" upon arrival at the plant and the premium rates described herein shall be payable from the time so recorded.
CHANGES IN WORKING SCHEDULES
5.23	It is recognized that variations in business or other conditions may necessitate changes in normal work periods, starting and quitting times, length of work day or work week, movement of jobs from one schedule to another. The Company will advise the Union of any such change before placing it into effect. A meeting will be held to discuss the matter if requested by either party.
5.24	Final weekly work schedules shall be posted no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Friday prior to the effective date of the schedule. If employees' schedules are changed subsequent to the above time, they will be given at least forty-eight (48) hours notice; in the event that they do not receive forty-eight (48) hours notice, they will be paid a premium of four (4)
Page... 27
hours at their base rate of pay for the first period of continuous hours worked after such change of schedule. Their entitlement to the premiums listed in Articles 12.10(a) and 12.10(b) will not be affected by this premium.
FLEXIBLE-PUNCHING OF TIME CARDS
5.25	In any continuous shift operation, where the employees
relieve on the job, if incoming employees clock in prior to the start of their shift and indicate that they are willing to take over the responsibility for the operation, the outgoing employees may clock out and leave without waiting to the end of the shift; employees will receive their regular shift wages. The maximum time frame is thirty (30) minutes.
Participation in the program is subject to a request from a majority of the employees of the particular operation and Company approval. Relieving must take place on the job and there can be no misunderstanding as to whether or not the incoming employee agreed to take over or not; the scheduled employee is responsible until the end of the shift unless there is agreement.

6.4
6.5
Employees who work on holidays and who work their normal scheduled days or shifts immediately preceding or succeeding such holidays will be paid at two (2) times their hourly rate for all hours worked on a holiday in addition to the holiday allowance. In no event shall the payment for hours worked on a holiday amount to more than two (2) times the basic hourly rate plus, if applicable, shift premium, the appropriate holiday allowance and the premium listed in Article 12.10(d).
Holiday allowance is defined as one (1) regular day's pay to a maximum of eight hours at the normal straight time basic rate and excludes any shift or other premium. An employee who is on a week's assignment to an upgraded job will receive holiday pay at the upgraded rate.
Employees who work on holidays, but who do not work and are not absent for an approved reason on their normal scheduled days or shifts immediately preceding and succeeding such holidays, will be paid at two (2) times their normal hourly rate of pay but will not qualify for holiday pay.
6.6	Employees scheduled to work the holiday as part of their
regular work week shall have the following options:
a)	Receiving their holiday pay
b)	Accumulating the hours for one (1) calendar week off with accumulated pay, which must be taken within twelve (12) months after obtaining sufficient hours and at a time mutually agreeable to the employee and the Company. Employees, who are scheduled on twelve hour shifts and elect to do so, may accumulate the equivalent of four (4) hours pay at
Page... 30
their normal straight time basic rate out of their holiday premium to put with their holiday allowance to a total of twelve (12) hours for banking purposes. When employees have accumulated a total of forty (40) hours, they will be advised to schedule their time off; when they take that time off, they will receive the forty (40) accumulated hours of pay.
PAYMENT FOR HOLIDAYS NOT WORKED
6.7	Employees who are not scheduled to work on the above named holidays, will receive one (1) holiday allowance as defined in Paragraph 6.4 provided they work their normal scheduled shift immediately preceding and succeeding the day on which the holiday is observed except as follows:
a)	When a holiday falls and is observed in a period in which an employee is on lay-off or on suspension, no payment will be made.
b)	If an employee is scheduled to work or has agreed to work on a holiday and does not work as scheduled, no payment will be made, unless excused by the Company.
c)	If employees do not work their normal scheduled day or shift immediately preceding and succeeding a holiday, no payment will be made unless excused by the Company. Employees reporting late (up to 120 minutes) for work on the shift shall not be considered absent on that shift only for the computation of holiday pay.
6.8	It is understood that the granting of such excuses [6.7(b) and 6.7(c)] shall be at the sole discretion of the Company, and the
Page... 31
exercise of such discretion in any particular case shall be subject to review through the Grievance Procedure.
HOLIDAY ALLOWANCE WHILE OFF
6.9	When a holiday falls or is observed during a period in which an employee is on lay-off or on suspension, no payment will be made. Holiday allowances as defined in Paragraph 6.4 will be paid to an employee who is on approved sick leave.
6.10	Should it be necessary to work all shifts of a production operation that is on a five (5) day schedule on a holiday, the Company will schedule employees in the department to work their normal scheduled shift and job. In this situation, if an employee requests to be excused from working the holiday and a suitable replacement can be arranged, the employee will be excused. If all shifts and jobs are not required, the Company will fill the requirements by following the overtime roster.

ARTICLE VIII
SENIORITY SENIORITY POLICY
8.1	It is understood that the seniority provisions in this Agreement
are designed to give each employee, according to length of continuous service with the Company, such equitable measure of job preference over less senior employees as is consistent with the efficient operation of the business on which depends the welfare of the employees, the Company and it's customers. It is agreed that senior employees shall be considered as having preference in matters of lay-off, rehiring, promotion and transfer, providing always that the senior employees shall have the necessary qualifications to perform and shall be willing to perform the work in question.
DEFINITIONS
8.2	A "regular" employee is one who has worked four hundred and forty (440) hours from date of hire with the Company with the exception of students as defined in Article 12.7.
8.3	A "probationary" employee is a new employee or an employee rehired after loss of seniority who shall be on probation for a period of four hundred and forty (440) hours worked from date of hire. During this period, the employee shall not be considered as a regular employee and notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this
Page... 39
Agreement, a probationary employee may be terminated by the Company and such termination shall be in compliance with Article 16.4. Upon completion of four hundred and forty (440) hours worked with the Company, a probationary employee shall become a regular employee and shall be placed on the plant seniority lists and the employee's continuous service shall accrue from the last date of hire.
8.4	"Continuous Service" shall mean an employee's service since the last date hire computed in accordance with Paragraphs 8.8, 8.9 and 8.10 hereof. An employee on the seniority roster in use on March 28, 1973 by Cyanamid of Canada Limited or an employee on the seniority roster in use on September 30, 1984 by Domtar Inc. at their Beachville locations, who does not subsequently break the period of continuous service shall be credited with the continuous service as carried in that roster, for all purposes of this Agreement except the calculation of eligible service for pension purposes. (For specific information in the area of pension, employees should consult the Pension Plan Booklet for Hourly-Rated Employees.)
8.5	"Company seniority" shall mean a regular employee's length of continuous service in the plant. The "Company seniority date" shall be the date of starting the last period of continuous service.
SENIORITY LISTS
8.6	The Company will maintain a seniority roster showing the seniority date of all regular employees on the payroll of the Company. The seniority roster will be available to employees
Page... 40
for inspection. Lists will be revised and posted quarterly with copies sent to the Union.

8.7	Continuous service shall terminate when an employee:
a)	Voluntarily quits for any reason.
b)	Is discharged for cause and is not reinstated through the Grievance Procedure.
c)	Is laid off by the Company for a period of:
i)	(if the employee has less than two (2) years of seniority at the date of lay- off) 18 months from date of lay-off
ii)	(if the employee has greater than two (2) years but less than three (3) years of seniority at the date of lay-off) 24 months from date of lay-off
iii)	(if the employee has greater than three (3) years but less than four (4) years of seniority at the date of lay-off) 30 months from the date of lay-off
iv)	(if the employee has greater than four (4) years of seniority at the date of lay-off) 36 months from the date of lay-off
d)	Fails to report to work when recalled after a lay-off as provided in Paragraph 9.12 hereof.
e)	Fails to return from a leave of absence within three (3) days after it expires. This shall not apply if the employee furnishes reason(s) satisfactory to the Company for the failure to return on time.
If a regular employee is re-employed after continuous service
Page... 41
has been terminated for any of the above reasons, the employee shall be considered as a "rehire" and all previous continuous service shall be cancelled.
8.8	Continuous service shall not be interrupted when a regular employee is absent due to:
a)	Illness, provided such illness is shown to be legitimate and the employee returns to work upon recovery; and provided also that the inability to work does not exceed two (2) years, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in accordance with legislative requirements.
b)	Compensable injury i.e. covered by Workers' Compensation Legislation, provided the employee returns to work upon recovery.
c)	Lay-off by the Company (for a period less than that provided in Paragraph 8.7(c).
d)	An approved leave of absence
If a regular employee is re-employed after absence due to any of the above reasons, the employee shall be considered as a "reinstatement" and the last previous seniority date shall be retained.
PROMOTION OUT OF BARGAINING UNIT
8.9	The right to promote employees now in the bargaining unit to positions outside the bargaining unit or to select bargaining unit employees for shift leader status is reserved exclusively to the Company.
Page... 42
8.10
If employees who have been in a job in the bargaining unit accept a promotion or transfer to a job outside the bargaining unit, such employees shall be deemed to have quit the bargaining unit and shall lose their right of return to an hourlyrated position within the bargaining unit. Employees who leave the bargaining unit forfeit all seniority as provided in this Collective Agreement with no rights to reinstatment of the same.
DEFINITION OF QUALIFICATION
8.11	As used in this Agreement, the term "qualifications" is intended to mean such factors related to job performance as physical fitness; skill and ability; and licenses (where required).
8.12	The determination of an employee's qualifications is the responsibility of the Company; with the understanding that any disagreement with the Company's decision may be taken up as a grievance. It is also agreed that in the event that this grievance proceeds to arbitration, the Company shall proceed first to establish the employee does not have sufficient qualifications for the job.

ARTICLE IX
LAY-OFFS AND RE-EMPLOYMENT
LAY-OFF POLICY
9.1	The necessity of lay-offs, the curtailment of the work week, and the reduction or increase in the working force in the plant or any occupational classification shall be at the discretion of the Company.
9.2	In connection with lay-offs and recall after lay-off, seniority shall govern providing the Company shall maintain a competent staff, defined as the senior employee with the qualifications and ability to do the job available. All employees on the seniority list must be recalled before new employees are hired, provided the laid off employees have the necessary qualifications to perform the work available and they shall be afforded the opportunity of refamiliarization to a reasonable extent (maximum ten (10) days) in cases where such an employee may require same. An employee on lay-off will be recalled and trained before a new employee is hired who needs training.
DEFINITION OF LAY-OFF
9.3	There are two (2) types of lay-off which are defined as follows:
a)	Company Lay-Off: When it is necessary to reduce the working force because of lack of work and an employee is released from work in the plant, such action will be considered as a Company lay-off.
Page... 44
b)	Job Lay-Off: When it is necessary to reduce the number of employees in a particular classification, and an employee is released from work in that classification, such action will be considered as a job lay-off.
APPLICATION OF SENIORITY TO JOB LAY-OFFS
9.4	When reductions are expected to be other than temporary (i.e. in excess of thirty (30) days) and a job lay-off is necessary, employees shall be laid off from that job in the reverse order of Company seniority, providing the remaining employees can satisfactorily perform and are willing to perform the work.
9.5	a) An employee who is laid off as provided in 9.4 from his job
shall be entitled to displace another employee with less Company seniority from a job in which the former is capable of performing in a satisfactory manner.
b) With those employees who are subject to job lay-off under 9.5(a), the Company will afford the affected employees the opportunity of training to a reasonable extent (maximum 10 days) in cases where such employee may require same and would be able to do the job at the end of the training period.
RECALL RIGHTS AFTER JOB LAY-OFF
9.6	Employees who are laid off from their job or who are displaced from their job during job lay-off and are transferred to another job will be placed on the recall list of the job from
Page... 45
which they were transferred for a period of eighteen (18) months. They shall be recalled in the reverse order of lay-off if the job re-opens. If employees decline to accept a recall to their previous job they shall relinquish their recall rights to that job. The time frame set out in this section may be extended by mutual agreement of both parties.
APPLICATION OF SENIORITY TO COMPANY LAY-OFFS
9.7	When a Company lay-off is necessary, employees shall be laid off in reverse order of Company seniority, provided the remaining employees have the necessary qualifications to perform, and are willing to perform the work. In the event employees holding a posted position are laid off, they shall retain their posted position upon recall, provided such recall is within thirty (30) calendar days of date of lay-off.
PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING COMPANY LAY-OFFS
9.8	When a Company lay-off is necessary, the Company will be guided by the following procedures:
a)	From the Company seniority list it will select the employee to be laid off in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
b)	It will notify the Union of the employees selected for such Company lay-off and will meet with the Union representatives to discuss any special cases where deviation from seniority order is contemplated. The Company will follow the practice of discussing such cases with the Union in advance of taking action.
Page... 46
c)	Employees who are retained on jobs under such circumstances, out of seniority ranking, will retain their job on a temporary basis and such jobs will be posted and filled in accordance with Article 10.
TEMPORARY DEPARTMENT SHUTDOWN
9.9	In an emergency situation, when it is necessary to shut down a department or operation temporarily, the Company will assign other work to the employees affected without displacing other personnel who are not directly affected by the temporary department shutdown. This situation shall not be considered as a lay-off insofar as the application of seniority is concerned, nor shall the Company be liable for any premium costs or penalties as a result of the reassignment of the personnel affected. As soon as possible, but in any event by the second subsequent posting of the weekly manpower schedule, the employees directly affected will be given assignments as per the normal manpower scheduling as per their listed qualifications.
JOB LAY-OFF FOR MEDICAL REASONS
9.10	When it is necessary to transfer individual employees from a job because they are incapacitated for medical reasons, the Company shall endeavour to transfer them to a job which their experience indicates they are qualified to perform. Such a move shall not displace another employee's posted job; however, by mutual agreement, a job vacancy that opens up may be filled by the affected employee.
Page... 47
NOTIFICATION OF LAY-OFF
9.11	In case it becomes advisable to reduce the number of employees by a Company lay-off, regular employees will be given at least seven (7) calendar days' notice of such lay-off except in situations over which the Company has no control.
RECALL AFTER LAY-OFF
9.12	When conditions warrant increasing the work force after a Company lay-off, regular employees theretofore laid off shall be recalled in order of their Company seniority, provided:
a)	They have the qualifications to perform, and are willing to perform, the work available, and
b)	They have retained their Company seniority rights under the terms of Paragraphs 8.7 and 8.8 hereof.
9.13	It is recognized that deviations from the above order of recall may be made necessary by the sequence in which plant operations are resumed. For example, in the case where plant equipment must be put back in shape before operations can be started up, the appropriate maintenance department employees required to do the work may be recalled, even though other employees with greater Company seniority are still laid off. Similarly, if a particular operating department is to be started up and operating employees with the necessary qualifications and experience in that department are required, such employees may be recalled even though employees of other departments with greater Company seniority are still
Page... 48
laid off.
PROCEDURE

9.16
Page... 49
FOR RECALLING EMPLOYEES AFTER COMPANY
The Company may recall laid off employees by the most convenient method. In the event the employees do not report for work when called by notice other than registered mail, they shall immediately be notified by registered mail to the last known address on file with the Company. If they fail to report for work within seven (7) days of receipt of notice by the Company that they have or have not received the registered letter, they shall be deemed to have voluntarily quit and shall lose all seniority rights.
Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 9.12 and 9.13 above, should the Company fail to recall employees in order of their seniority, such employees shall be compensated beginning as of the day they should properly have been recalled in accordance with their Company seniority. They shall be compensated at their regular rate less whatever earnings they have earned elsewhere during this period. This period shall not exceed ninety (90) days.
In the event of a permanent total plant closure, the Company will notify the Union at least two (2) months prior to the cessation of operations. Following such notification, the Union shall have the opportunity to discuss and explore any possible means of averting the closure. If attempts to avert the closure are not successful, Union and Company representatives shall meet to discuss the manner in which the closure is carried out, with consideration to such things as
retirement options, job market assistance, extended E.A.P. counselling, methods of payment, retraining and relocation.

10.6	a) Among those employees who have applied for a vacancy and
who have the basic qualifications to be trained, in accordance with the following paragraphs, the employees with the greatest Company seniority shall be selected.

10.8	When the Company has any indication that an hourly-rated
employee will be absent from work for in excess of three months for reasons of illness or injury, the employee's job will be posted and filled under this program unless the Company decides not to fill the vacancy at all.
The job will be posted and filled in the normal manner as an "interim replacement" vacancy. The senior qualified
applicant will be the successful applicant and will perform the job throughout its duration.
The interim replacement vacancy will last from the date of the filling until the incumbent employee's return to work OR the expiration of fifty-two (52) weeks of total absence, at which time the interim replacement employees will return to their former status. If the incumbent employee does not return to work at the end of fifty-two (52) weeks, the job will be re-posted as a permanent vacancy.
Some elements of this program conflict with clauses in the Collective Agreement (e.g. Articles 10.2, 10.6(a), 10.6(d), the Procedure for Filling Vacancies on the Weekly Manpower Schedule, etc...). Both parties recognize this fact and agree that the provisions of this program rule where there is a conflict.
RETURNING DISABLED EMPLOYEE
10.9	The job of a disabled employee will be posted as a
permanent vacancy, effective twelve (12) months from the
Page... 55
date of onset of disability, unless the Company decides not to fill the vacancy at all. It will be filled per Article X. If the disabled employee returns to work within a two (2) year period from the commencement of disability and:
1)	If the employee is medically able to return to the former job
a)	the employee returns to the former job.
b)	the incumbent who had taken that permanent job reverts to his / her former job status.
c)	other employees revert to their former jobs as necessary.
2)	If the employee is medically unable to return to the former job
a)	the employee is treated as a medical transfer per contract Article 9.10.
b)	the incumbent who had taken that permanent job retains it.
If the disabled employee returns to work after a two (2) year period from the commencement of disability, the employee has no claim to the former job and returns as a Production Helper.
MANPOWER SCHEDULING
10.10	Posting Vacancies
The weekly manpower schedule will be posted by 4:30 p.m. each Tuesday; all vacancies will be blank, with temporarily displaced and unposted (those who do not have a posted job)
Page... 56
employees showing as a pool to be scheduled. Job vacancies, posted at the same time, will be openings because of:
a)	Vacations
b)	Sickness (one week or more)
c)	Workers' Compensation (one week or more)
d)	Leaves of Absence (one week or more)
e)	Special Jobs, Assignments, etc.. (one week or more)
In departments with progression relief, the lowest job would be posted as the vacancy e.g. normally lowest progression vacancy.
Applying for Vacancies
The vacancy application deadline will be 9:00 a.m., Thursday; an employee not applying by the cut-off time will be assigned a job. Off-shift employees may call in to be added to the list up to the cut-off time. If any employees are going on vacation and they see a vacancy coming up that they wish, they must apply before going on vacation; this applies to vacation only. If a vacancy occurs for any other reason, while the employees are off, they may apply only on the first week of their return, after which they lose that right; if they apply, they will be scheduled on the job the following week for the duration of the vacancy. If posted employees wish to obtain a vacancy inside or outside the department except in departments with progression relief they must bid for the vacancy.
Employees must indicate their order of preference (one being the most preferred) if applying for more than one vacancy.
Page... 57
Employees who bid to a posted vacancy are taking the vacancy for its duration and may not move to another job, unless they have indicated that, when a specific job becomes open, they want to be scheduled to it, and then returned to the job originally bid to. Any qualified employees holding that relief job may apply for the vacancy if it represents an upgrade in their wage rate outside own department or if within own department represents either a lateral or upgrade in their wage rate.
Filling Vacancies
The vacancy will be filled by the senior qualified employee who applies.
If no one applies for the vacancy, it will be filled with the most junior unposted employee first and then the most junior posted employee second, capable of doing the job, even if that employee must be moved off his / her posted job; unforeseen vacancies and vacancies as a result of posted personnel relieving others, will be filled by assignment, but will be posted the following week, if the vacancy is still there. Employees, who are assigned to a vacancy, revert to their previous position after one week and the vacancy is reposted, if it still exists, on the next schedule.
Revised Manpower Schedule
The revised manpower schedule will be posted by 2:00 p.m. each Thursday. All employees on the off-shift, vacation or sickness, who have bid for a posted vacancy must telephone
Page... 58
the plant after 2:00 p.m. on Thursday to see what job they received. All employees working #2 and #3 shifts on Friday are expected to verify their schedules before going off-shift. Any employees, who have not bid for a vacancy and who have completed their work schedule for the week, and who were changed on the revised schedule, will be notified by the Company of their change; if the Company is unable to reach them, they will continue on the schedule that was posted on Tuesday.
General
1)	Qualified Personnel Listing - The Qualified Personnel Listing, as from time to time amended, is the source of employees' qualifications for manpower scheduling purposes.
2)	Posted Employees (except Maintenance Personnel) may:
a)	Hold multiple relief jobs within their own department (lateral and upgrade) but not shift movement on their own job.
b)	Hold only one relief job outside their own department (upgrade only).
c)	Apply for a relief posting outside their own department only if they do not hold a relief posting or if they are willing to relinquish it and are able to do so having held it for two years or if it represents an upgrade to the previous relief job.
Page... 59
3)	Production Helpers may:
a)	Be required to be qualified on three (3) posted jobs.
b)	Apply for a relief posting only if they hold less than three (3) relief jobs or if they are willing to relinquish one and are able to do so having held it for two years or if it represents an upgrade to the previous relief job.
c)	Be appointed to train on the following jobs:
Lime Operator III - East Plant Lime Operator IV - Centre Plant
Lime Operator IV - West Plant Quarry Operator IV Quarry Operator V Pulverizer Operator IV
4)	Relief Postings will be used to select trainees for most Schedule "A" jobs.
5)	New Employees may receive training on the jobs of Lime Operator III - East Plant, Lime Operator IV -Centre Plant, Lime Operator IV - West Plant, Quarry Operator IV, Quarry Operator V and Pulverizer Operator IV and be assigned to those jobs, as relief personnel during their probationary period. They will be trained without benefit of postings and will be assigned, as required, outside of the weekly bidding procedure. If they become permanent employees, they retain qualifications obtained during the probationary period.

The job classifications and wage rates shown in Schedule "A" which is attached hereto, shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be and remain in effect for the life of this Agreement.
It is recognized that mechanical improvements brought about by the Company in the interest of improved methods and products, the development of new manufacturing processes and the use of new materials as well as changes in the character of jobs may from time to time require the establishment of new job classifications or the reclassification of existing jobs. Under such circumstances, the Company and / or Union may request evaluation of the new or changed job. The Company will evaluate the job in question and will inform the Union of the classification and rate established upon completion of the evaluation.
The Union may, through its members of the Grievance Committee, request review of a new or changed job during the thirty (30) day period immediately following such notification. Such Committee may request the presence of the Steward concerned in any particular case. Following such request for review, the Company shall re-examine the contents of the said job. If, as a result of such re-examination, an adjustment in classification and / or rate is required, Schedule "A" shall be revised accordingly forthwith.
Upon completion of the evaluation, the job shall be established in accordance with results of the evaluation. If
the resultant level is below the current or existing level incumbent employees will continue to receive the higher rate of pay until such time as they permanently leave the job or any subsequent general increases in the rate established for the job shall be applied in eliminating the red circle rate but the maximum reduction in the rate at the given time shall be 25% of the original red circle amount.
12.5	Any dispute arising between the parties over a new or changed job ultimately may be referred to arbitration, in accordance with Step 3 of Section 11.2. The arbitrator appointed thereunder shall, in determining the proper classification of the job in question, be governed by the principles and methods on the basis of and by which the schedule of the job classification and wage rates as set forth in Schedule "A" were established.
12.6	If, through such procedure, the classification of a job is adjusted, Schedule "A" shall be revised forthwith. The rate, if adjusted upward, shall be applied retroactively to the date the Union requested review of the new or changed job.
12.7	(a) PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES - RATE OF PAY
