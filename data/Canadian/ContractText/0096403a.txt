The general purpose of this agreement is to provide for the Company and the Association all the benefits of legal
and regulated collective bargaining in reference to hours, salaries, working and living conditions as specified in the articles of this agreement and to insure as much as possible the safety and well-being of employees, good working management, quality and quantity of production and protection of the property. Furthermore, this agreement aims at settling peacefully and equitably all disagreements which could arise between the parties. It is understood that the duty of the parties present, as well as that of all employees, is to cooperate fully, individually and collectively in order to achieve the conditions stipulated in this agreement.
ARTICLE 2 - RECOGNITION OF THE ASSOCIATION

This agreement is aimed at all the employees of Dubreuil Forest Products Limited working in the sawmill, planing mill, yard, boiler room, woodworking, maintenance, cutting operations, lumber transport, chipping plant, and stockroom personnel.
2:02	(1) It is agreed that if the Company engages
contractors to perform work usually performed by employees within the Bargaining Unit as described in Article 2:01, the following shall apply:
(a)	a work permit will be paid to the Association by the Company for every month or part thereof that a contractor is engaged by the Company;
(b)	the engagement of a contractor shall not have the corresponding effect of causing a reduction of employees or of the regular operations of the department affected subject to the usual seasonal changes in the operations of the Company;
1
(c)	where both contractors and Association members perform the same work, subject to Article 2:03, Association members will be laid oft in accordance with Article 12:06 or such other Article as may be specifically applicable, only if the contractors performing the same work have ceased to perform the same.
(d)	It is understood and accepted by the parties that contractors Alain Harvey (Haran Ltd.) and Mr. Plourde will not have the right to increase the amount of their equipment in woods operations after June 1, 1990 without the agreement of the Company and the Association.
2:03 The Company may continue to engage contractors to
exclusively perform the following work:
(a)	hauling lumber, chips, and poplar, including veneer bolts;
(b)	hauling veneer bolts from woods to their destination;
(c)	cutting poplar veneer or birch;
(d)	providing services to the town site;
(e)	erecting structures;
(f)	work on or originating from work sites outside the Company limits and/or within the townships of Bernot, Carmody, Chenard, Dumas and Dumphy.
(g)	within these five townships, only the softwood will be cut in the Hardwood Cutting Groups by union employees unless these employees have always been willing to cut poplar.
2:04 Subject to Article 2:03:
(1)	When poplar is cut for the construction of primary and secondary roads, the Company will pay fifteen percent (15%) less than soft delimbed wood for the delimbed poplar (without separating bonus).

2
2:05 MECHANICAL CUTTING
(1)	Notwithstanding Article 2:02 and subject to Article
2:03, if the Company requires new or additional
mechanized cutting equipment (grappel skidders, delimbers or feller bunchers) it shall advise the Association thereof.
(2)	Employees in departments #1 and #4 (as set out in Article 11:01 (c) who do not own equipment as described above will be given one month to decide if they wish to purchase such equipment and become owner-operators thereof.

(4)	Upon purchase of such equipment, the employee will, if not already, become a member of department #4 as set out in Article 11:01 (c). His departmental seniority will not be transferred if he is not presently in that department.
(5)	Each of the Employees on the seniority list in the departments described in Article 2:05 (2) will be offered the opportunity provided by Article 2:05 only once to purchase each of the pieces of equipment described in Article 2:05 (1). An employee who decides once that he does not wish to purchase such equipment will not thereafter be eligible to be asked again.
(6)	Subject to Article 2:03, the Company excepting short-term and/or season requirements, will not engage new or additional contractors to perform mechanical cutting until all of the employees described in Article 2:05 (2) have exercised their option to purchase as described in the Article or to refuse to purchase the type of equipment which a contractor would otherwise employ.
(7)	Where the Company intends to engage a contractor to perform short-term or seasonal work as described in Article 2:05 (6), it will advise the Association thereof. The Association will advise

the Company within one (1) week if it wishes the Company to invoke the remaining provisions of Article 2:05.
(8)	Further, when it is necessary to increase the amount of equipment in wood operations, for a short period of time the Company will advise the Association thereof.

2:06 TRANSPORTATION OF ROUNDWOOD AND
GRAVEL
(1)	Subject to Article 2:02, 2:03, and 2:07, the Company may engage hauling contractors.
(2)	In order to give preference to Company owner-operators engaged in the wood haul who may otherwise be laid-off during the summer while contractors perform the gravel haul, such wood haul owner-operators will be given an opportunity by the Company to perform the gravel haul, if their vehicle is capable of the same, during the time that they would be laid off the wood haul.

additional hauling contractors, it will advise owner-operators and employees engaged in the transportation of roundwood and gravel of that fact.

2:07	(1) It is understood that employees or owner-operators
cannot 'bump' an employee of a contractor. This does not affect the operation of Article 2:02.
(2)	Notwithstanding anything else in this Collective Agreement, the parties agree that the present employee and owner-operator complement represented by the seniority list for departments #1, #2 and #4 described in Article 11:01 (c) will not be expanded, added to or increased following ratification of this Collective Agreement, except at the sole discretion of the Company.
(3)	If the Company should decide to make or allow any additions to the Employee or owner-operator complement in the above described departments after ratification, these individuals will not be permitted to avail themselves of the options and benefits of Article 2:05 or Article 2:06.
