currently holds on a full time basis,
or
ii)	The hourly rate of the job he would have been performing that shift had he not been assigned to training.

130
limited to assignment on the above mentioned equipment, but may be assigned other work in accordance with the terms of the Collective Agreement, and from time to time, in order to allow training opportunities for trainees.
22.32	When assignments are made to specific types of equipment (e.g. dozers, graders, front-end loaders), the senior employee shall normally be entitled to preference. It is agreed by the Company and the Union that when operational requirements dictate assignments contrary to seniority, it shall be allowable for a reasonable period of time (e.g. if a junior employee is being trained for a more senior employee's piece of equipment, the assignment would be only for that period of time to allow the junior employee to become proficient on the equipment).
22.33	Every six (6) months Mine Operations operators shall indicate their preference as to the type of equipment (either track dozer, grader, front-end loader, rubber tired dozer) they wish to operate, but may only change equipment in the event of a vacancy.

ADDENDUM “A’
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
The Company and the Union agree that this Human Rights Policy deals with and applies only to allegations that an employee has been subject to discrimination (which includes personal and sexual harassment) because of a protected category(s) of the Human Rights Act. The parties undertake to educate their principals as to the correct interpretation and application of this policy.
R. Killough

164
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
PREAMBLE:
The objective of the Human Rights Policy is to ensure that all employees of Highland Valley Copper are assured of a work environment that is free of all forms of discrimination, including personal and sexual harassment. By introduction of this policy, it is the intention of Highland Valley Copper to ensure proper work place behavior and that the treatment of individuals is fair and equitable and in full compliance with all applicable Human Rights Legislation as well as section 14 of the Miles Act and article 1.01 (c) of the Collective Agreement.
The Human Rights Act of the Province of British Columbia protects individuals from acts of discrimination with respect to employment, or any term or condition of employment because of a person's race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age of that person or because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offense that is unrelated to the employment or the intended employment of that person.
165
Definitions:
Discrimination:
Discrimination is to treat a person differently because of that persons race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age, or because of a criminal or summary conviction that is unrelated to the employment or intended employment.
Harassment:
Harassment is a form of discrimination and therefore a violation of the Human Rights Act. Harassment may be direct or indirect. When Harassment is indirect, it results in a work environment that is considered to be “Poisoned”. The work environment may be poisoned by crude language, sexist or racist remarks, unwelcome jokes and cartoons, nude or semi-nude pictures, displaying of racist or bigoted pictures or materials or other unwelcome conduct that creates an uncomfortable or hostile work environment for one or more employees.
Personal Harassment:
Personal Harassment, means any conduct that is unwelcome or that ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome and includes, but is not limited to, vexatious comments or
166
conduct, jokes, insults, threats, cartoons, innuendo, or refusal to talk or work with a person for reason(s) that relate to any protected category of the Human Rights Act.

SUBJECT: TRADESMEN APPLYING FOR APPRENTICESHIPS
The Company and Union agree that only those trades employees who have been, or are about to be, displaced from their trade classification will be accepted as candidates for apprenticeships. This agreement is consistent with the spirit of Article 23, and in particular Article 23,01, which outlines the purpose of the apprenticeship program to provide unskilled employees with the opportunity to receive occupational and vocational training through an apprenticeship. Displaced tradesmen, through no fault of their own, are no longer able to practice their skills and are therefore, in so far as having opportunity to use their skills to earn higher income, unskilled employees. However, tradesmen who bid out of their trade classification are choosing not to practice their skills, and unless they happen to work in a trade where
206
there are already sufficient tradesmen or surplus tradesmen, the Company will have to replace those skills. In this instance, so far as having opportunity to use their skills to earn higher income, they are skilled employees and not eligible for the apprenticeship program.
Where a displaced tradesman bids and is the successful applicant for the apprenticeship, more senior employees in the same trade, from where he was displaced, will be given the opportunity to take the apprenticeship opening on the basis of their Company seniority. If a more senior tradesman exercises his seniority to the apprenticeship, then the senior displaced tradesman with recall rights will be recalled to replace him.

Those employees who had prior service in the Services Department shall have their seniority adjusted to reflect the fact that the job they performed in Services has now been transferred to the Mine, Mill, or Administration departments.

MINE OPERATIONS
1,	In addition to the backup lists as set out in Article 22.23, there is established a Shovel and Rotary Drill Operators' backup list. The Shovel Operators and Rotary Drill Operators have designated their preferred position should their equipment not be operable due to mechanical difficulty or the Company choosing not to operate that piece of equipment. Each operator must choose either Dozer, Grader, F.E.L. or Cableman so long as that was their last position held in Mine Operations. Otherwise, their alternate operating assignment will be Haul Truck Driver. Any new Shovel Operator or Rotary Drill Operator shall make their choice upon being awarded the new position.
2.	In the event a backup operator is required,
240
a selection will be made from the crew's backup lists. If the senior operator is selected from the Shovel Operator and Drill Operator list he will operate that piece of equipment until his regular equipment is available. Should the backup operator be selected from the trained backup operators list as referred to in Article 22.23, the employee next in line on that list in accordance with Article 22.24 will be required to take that position for the remainder of the shift. Such employee shall remain in that position as long as the equipment is operable and shall otherwise be assigned as a Haul Truck Driver.
3.	A Blaster Operator or Equipment Operator, who successfully bids from a day shift position onto a trained operators list, pursuant to Article22.23, which requires an assignment to a continuous shift schedule, shall receive the requisite training and subsequently be assigned to that shift as a truck driver until he moves up in his line of progression or successfully bids on another position.
4.	If a full time operator's position becomes available, the position will be offered to the most senior employee on the backup list for that classification. If the vacancy is on another shift, the employee may refuse the promotion, If the vacancy is on the same
241
shift, the most senior employee on the trained operators list on that shift must accept the job.

Dear Richard:
RE: STUDENT EMPLOYMENT
In the selection of students to be employed, the Company gives preference to sons and daughters of employees and retirees. (Please note that employee/retiree in this context refers to both management and bargaining unit employees.) However, in practical terms, the number of sons and daughters generally far surpasses the company's student requirements. To ensure that the selection of students is equitable, the company has adopted the following guidelines.
1)	Students must have been a full time student in a post secondary institution in the year preceding their application.
2)	Students must provide evidence that they intend to return to school.
3)	Employment is offered first to senior students
247
\
- those who have completed four years of post secondary education then three years etc. - students are required to provide evidence of education level.
4)	Students can only work a maximum of two summer terms.
5)	Students who do not receive a satisfactory or better evaluation are not offered a second term.
6)	Where there are more students than positions available within a grade level, students are selected by a random draw.
7)	Student employment in the Mill Department during the Christmas school break, being of short duration, is not subject to items 3 and 4 above.
Yours truly,
R. J. Killough
