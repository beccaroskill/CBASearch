for in Article 9, may be extended by mutual agreement between the parties, provided that requests for extensions are made prior to the expiry of the time limitations. Employees may have benefit of representation by Union officials at any of the steps in the procedure, and similarly management representatives may have benefit of counsel from the Human Resources Department.

6
working days of receipt of such written notice, each patty shall appoint an arbitrator.

g.	General Holidays
15
i)	The Company agrees to recognize the General Holidays set forth in Article 20 of the collective bargaining agreement. General Holidays are observed on a shift day basis rather than a calendar day basis.

However, if the Company decides not to operate on a General Holiday, employees who were scheduled to work their regular shift on that General Holiday shall be paid for twelve (12) hours at their regular rate. An employee is entitled to General Holiday pay if they have worked during the work week immediately proceeding that in which the General Holiday occurs, or during the work week in which the General Holiday occurs, or during the work week immediately following that in which the General Holiday occurs.
ii)	For employees working the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule, where a General Holiday falls within an employee’s vacation period, such employee will be entitled to an additional eight (8) hours of vacation with pay for each General Holiday.
