These lists will be brought up to date every three (3) months and, at each revision, will be posted on the Union bulletin board for a period of five (5) working days. During that interval, any employee whose name appears on the list for the first time may question his seniority ranking if he is in disagreement with it.

8.06	JOB POSTING
(a)	When a regular full-time job in a seniority group becomes vacant (other than a vacancy of the type referred to in clause 8.06 (e) hereof), the Company shall post a notice of such job vacancy on the Union bulletin board for a period of three (3) working days. During that period, any employee who is in that seniority group may make written application for the vacant job and all such applications will receive consideration in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof.
(b)	The Company will select the successful applicant within five (5) working days of the close of the posting period and will within a further three (3) days, advise the employees in the seniority group concerned of its decision by posting that information on the Union bulletin board.

HAMILTON PLANT - 11 -
ensuing vacancy (or vacancies) shall not be required.
(0 In the event that the Company has no employee in a seniority group who can satisfactorily fulfill the normal requirements of a job vacancy in that seniority group, and if there is, at that time, no qualified employee on layoff from any other seniority group covered by this Agreement who wishes lo exercise the right of temporary transfer provided for in clause 8.09 (d) hereof, the Company may hire a new employee to till such vacancy. The Company may fill any vacancy, temporarily, pending completion of procedures set out herein.
(g)	When an employee has received a change of job or shift assignment under the provisions of this clause 8.06, he shall not be entitled to apply for a posted vacancy during the following six (6) months, unless such job vacancy is in a Wage Bracket higher than his own.
(h)	While the intent of this clause is to provide employees with a means of expressing persona) preference in the assignment of their regular duties, it is understood and agreed that it shall remain the sole responsibility of the Company to determine the number of experienced personnel required on any job or shift.
(i)	A copy of each job posting and notice of successful applicant will be given to the Local Union and copies of same will also be mailed lo the Union Office.
8.07(a) It is understood and agreed that the provisions of clause 8.06 shall apply only in the case of “permanent” vacancies. However, when there is a temporary vacancy in a seniority group (including vacancies created by the addition of temporary shifts), and the Company expects such work to be available for a period in excess of five (5) working days, the Company shall, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, make such temporary assignment available to qualified employees on a seniority basis.

Inside Employees Shippers &. Receivers Materials Handling Garage
Sales Equipment Service
HAMILTON PLANT - 12 -
Outside Employees Sales Representatives
Delivery Salesmen and Delivery Salesmen-in-Charge Transport Drivers

While the intent of this clause is to provide employees with a means of expressing personal preference for temporary assignments of reasonable duration, it is understood and agreed that it shall remain the sole responsibility of the Company to determine the number of experienced personnel required on any job or shift.
In the event that a position which has been filled on a temporary basis should continue to be required for a period in excess of six (6) months, such position will thereupon be considered as a “permanent” position and shall then be posted as provided for in clause 8.06 hereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it is agreed that in making any temporary promotion in the outside seniority group the Company will, whenever practical, endeavour to give due consideration to the relative seniority of the available and qualified employees.
(b) When in the judgement of the Company it is practical, appropriate and timely to do so, the Company will endeavour to make available to employees who are likely to be candidates for a promotion (and who would otherwise be qualified for such promotion) or who are likely to be subject to layoff, the opportunity of receiving such training as may be necessary to enable them to satisfactorily perform the work so made available to them. An employee who has received such training shall not then be entitled to refuse an assignment to the position for which he has been trained.
8.08 DEMOTIONS
If, as the direct result of a reduction in the work force, one or more demotions should become necessary, it is agreed that the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof shall be observed.
It is understood, however, that this clause 8.08 shall not apply in the case of an employee who is demoted as a result of his misconduct or his inability to satisfactorily perform the work required; it being further understood, however, that if within three (3) months of receiving a promotion an employee requests to be relieved of his new responsibilities or is demoted due to his inability to satisfactorily perform such new duties, he shall be permitted
HAMILTON PLANT - 13 -
to revert to his former position and in so doing may displace the employee who succeeded him in that position.
8.09 LAYOFFS
Whenever layoffs in a seniority group are necessary, they shall be accomplished as follows:
(a) The Company shall first layoff temporary employees and then probationary employees, if any, in that seniority group. If further reduction of staff is required, the Company shall then lay off regular employees in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof, it being understood that, in this instance, seniority is reversed (i.e. the most junior man will be the first laid off). If any regular employee is to be laid off for a period of more than five (5) working days, he shall receive live (5) days written notice of such layoff and the Union shall be provided with a copy of same.
It is mutually agreed that for the purposes of administration of the foregoing paragraph, the term “in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05” shall mean that the following procedure will be observed:
(i)	any regular employee for whom work is not available may displace the least senior employee within the same shift and department, providing he has greater seniority
(ii)	the employee displaced in No. 1 above may then displace the least senior employee within the same shift providing he has greater seniority
(iii)	the employee displaced in No. 2 above may then displace the least senior employee within his seniority group, providing he has greater seniority.
For this purpose, the expression “department”, as used in (i) above, shall be defined by reference to the following departmental groupings:
hide Employees Shippers & Receivers Materials Handling Garage
Sales Equipment Service
Outside Employees Sales Representatives
Delivery Salesmen and Delivery Salesmen-in-Charge Transport Drivers
HAMILTON PLANT - 14 -
A regular employee may displace a less senior employee in accordance with points (i), (ii) and (iii) above only if such employee can satisfactorily fulfill the normal requirements of the job occupied by the less senior employee.
(b)	An employee having seniority standing in a seniority group who is laid off for more than one (1) working day shall have the option of:
(i)	displacing a temporary or probationary employee in any other seniority group
referred to in clause 8.02 hereof, or
(ii)	if there are no temporary or probationary employees to be displaced, of
displacing the most junior employee in any other seniority group referred to in clause
8.02 hereof,
provided that such employee submits a written request for such temporary transfer to another seniority group and is capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. It is understood that junior employees shall be laid off in sufficient numbers to permit the exercising of this option and that the resulting temporary transfer of more senior employees shall not become effective until the commencement of the next regular day of work scheduled for the employee to be displaced. The transferred employee will receive the rate of pay of the job to which he is assigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Company is able to arrange the transfer between seniority groups without the ne (1) day waiting period, it shall do so.
(c)	An employee exercising this option shall not acquire seniority in the group to which he is transferred, but shall retain his recall rights in his original seniority group.
(d)	The Company shall maintain a list of employees (other than probationary or temporary employees) laid off by it from each seniority group within the prior eighteen (18) months and such list shall show the seniority of such employees. A copy of the daily layoff list will be provided to the local plant President or Chairman of the Union. When workers are required for a seniority group, the layoff list for that seniority group will be. examined and, to the extent of the number of jobs available, the employees listed therein will be recalled from transfer or layoff in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof. If, following such recalls, there is still a deficiency of workers in that seniority group, then employees on the layoff lists for other seniority groups covered by the Agreement shall be offered, in seniority order, the option of transferring temporarily to the vacant position. Such temporary transfers shall be subject to the provisions of clause 8.09 (c) hereof.
(e)	If, at the time of recall, an employee is not in the active service of the Company, a notice shall be sent to him by registered mail addressed to the last address which he shall have recorded with the Company. Such notice shall indicate the job for which the individual is considered qualified, the proposed time and place of hiring (which shall
HAMILTON PLANT - 15 -
not be less than seven (7) working days from the date of mailing of such notice by the Company) and shall state that if the individual desires to be rehired for such job he shall notify the Company in writing within five (5) working days of the mailing of such notice by the Company. A copy of each such notice shall be mailed to the Union. The individuals to whom such notices are sent and who report ready for work at the time and place of hiring as set out in such notices, shall, if they are then so qualified to fill the jobs available, be rehired. The Company shall not be required, however, to rehire at any time any individual who shall have failed to notify the Company of his desire to be rehired or who shall have failed to report for rehiring in accordance with and at the time stated in any such notice sent to him. The Company shall be entitled to till any jobs available on a temporary basis pending rehiring of those having preferential rights for rehiring as hereinbefore set out. On such rehiring there shall be deemed to have been no break in such employee's continuous service.
In the event that an employee having seniority standing should be laid-off for a period in excess of five (5) working days, such employee may apply for temporary transfer to another plant at which the Collective Bargaining Agreement contains provisions identical to this clause 8.09(e). If there is then a vacancy at the requested plant, or a position which is then held by a part-time, temporary or probationary employee, the laid-off employee shall, if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the work which would so be made available to him, be temporarily assigned to duty at such other plant (and, in so doing, may displace an employee there who does not hold seniority rights).
An employee exercising this option shall not acquire seniority in the group to which he is temporarily assigned, but shall retain his recall rights in his original seniority group.
(0 Notwithstanding anything herein contained it is agreed that if an outside employee has not presented himself for assignment of the day's work prior to the time his shift is scheduled to commence he shall be considered to be unavailable for work on that shift and in such circumstances the layoff provisions set out above shall have no application.
(g) It is mutually agreed that an employee who would otherwise be on layoff may request that part or all of such layoff period be regarded as annual vacation time and be paid accordingly. The Company will honour such requests, provided that the employee has sufficient unused vacation entitlement to accommodate the request.
8.10	Bonafide illness, or disability resulting from an accident, shall not normally be considered cause for discharge. However, if an employee has been continuously absent from work due to disability for a period of thirty (30) months or more the Company may then consider that such employee's services are terminated and his name shall be removed from the seniority list on the grounds that he is no longer an active employee. In making such a determination the Company shall give due consideration to the latest medical evidence available with respect to the anticipated further duration of such employee’s disability.
HAMILTON PLANT - 16
8.11	If, after recovery from an at work accident or illness accepted by the Workers' Compensation Board, an employee is unable to perform his former duties, and if there is, at that time, a regular job in his seniority group which is either vacant or held by an employee having less seniority, such employee shall, if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the required duties, be transferred to such position. If there is no regular job within his seniority group which he is capable of satisfactorily performing, the Company will consider a request for transfer to the other seniority group at his Plant if there is, at that time, a regular job which is vacant and if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties required.
8.12	An employee covered by this Agreement who wishes to transfer to another Bargaining Unit represented by the Union may notify the Company in writing of his desire to do so. When, following completion of the job posting procedure, a vacancy exists at such desired new location, the employee requesting the transfer shall be offered the opportunity of filling the vacancy in preference to a new hire. On assignment to the new location, the employee will be credited with his original seniority date; provided, however, that he will not be permitted to exercise full seniority under the job posting procedure during the first six (6) months of his employment at the new location. For purposes of application of this provision, employees will be classed as “inside employees”, or “outside employees”, and it is understood that in exercising the privileges of this provision the employee must remain within such current classification. It is also agreed that an employee wishing to accept a transfer under these provisions must do so within five (5) days of receiving the job offer and must report for duty at the new location within sixty (60) days of the job offer or such job offer may be withdrawn by the Company.
ARTICLE 9 - HOURS OF WORK - OVERTIME
9.01	For the purposes of this Agreement, the work week shall commence at midnight Saturday-Sunday and all work performed in a shift or other similar work period (including any extension thereof) shall be deemed to have been performed in the same day in which that shift or other similar work period commenced.
9.02	For the purposes of this Agreement, time worked shall be calculated in units of fifteen (15) minutes and periods of work of less than fifteen (15) minutes per day shall be disregarded.
9.03	For the purposes of this Agreement, the normal work periods of all employees (other than those employees from time to time during the currency of this Agreement regularly scheduled to work on Saturday and/or Sunday) shall consist of five (5) consecutive days, Monday to Friday inclusive. The Company does not guarantee, however, to provide work
HAMILTON PLANT - 17 -
for any employee nor to maintain the work week or working hours presently in force.
9.04	Every employee having performed eight (8) hours work at his hourly rate in any day shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1V4) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company in excess of the said eight (8) hours in that day.
9.05	Every employee, other than those regularly scheduled to work on Saturday and/or Sunday, shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on a Saturday and at the rate of two (2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on a Sunday.
9.06	Every employee who is regularly scheduled to work on a Saturday and/or Sunday shall, while so scheduled, be paid a premium as shown below:
For Saturday	$ 1.25
For Sunday	$ 1.50

For the purposes of this Agreement, such premiums shall not be considered as forming part of an employee's hourly rate.
9.07	Every employee who is regularly scheduled to work on a Saturday and/or Sunday shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on the First of his two (2) weekly scheduled days off and at the rate of two (2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on the second of his two (2) weekly scheduled days off.
9.08	(a) Every employee, other than those employed as Stationary Engineers, shall be paid at the rate of two (2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on a day which is observed as a paid holiday under the provisions of Article 11 hereof.
(b) A person employed as a stationary engineer shall be paid at the rate of two (2) times his hourly rate for all work performed by him and required by the Company on a day on which one of the paid holidays named in Article 11 hereof actually falls (as opposed to the day on which it is observed by the Company).
HAMILTON PLANT - 18
9.09	Where it is anticipated that any employee will perform additional work required by the Company for a period of one-half (1/2) hour or more immediately following his normal work period of eight (8) hours in any day, he shall be granted a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes, with pay, before commencing such additional work.
9.10	Where any period of additional work referred to in clause 9.09 hereof will continue for more than two (2) consecutive hours, the employee shall, after having worked for two (2) hours, be given a break of one-half (1/2) hour, without pay, to enable him to have a meal. If he shall not have had at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice that such additional work would be required, the Company shall provide the meal, up to a value of $5.00, plus tax, without charge to the employee. If such additional work continues for more than two (2) consecutive hours following resumption of work after the meal break, the employee shall be granted an additional rest period of fifteen (15) minutes, with pay.
9.11	Every employee will be allowed one (1) paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes during each one-half (1/2) shift. Rest periods will be arranged as near the mid-point of each one-half (1/2) shift as possible.
9.12	The Company will endeavour, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to assign planned overtime work (i.e. overtime scheduled at least 24 hours in advance, or on a Saturday and/or Sunday) on the following basis:
(i)	Such opportunity will first be made available on a seniority basis to those regular employees who normally perform the work on which such overtime is required, and
(ii)	in the event that the Company's needs cannot be entirely satisfied in that manner, the overtime opportunity will then be made available on a seniority basis to other hourly rated employees in the same seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
It is further agreed that overtime will not normally be assigned to temporary or probationary employees while regular employees in the appropriate seniority group are willing to perform such overtime and are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
In the case of unscheduled overtime, other than overtime to be performed as a continuation of work in process, the Company will endeavour, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to make such overtime available on a seniority basis to employees in the appropriate seniority group who are available on the Company's premises at the time such overtime is to commence and who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required. It is further agreed that overtime will not normally be
HAMILTON PLANT - 19 -
assigned to temporary or probationary employees while regular employees in the appropriate seniority group are available on the Company's premises at the time such overtime is to commence who are willing to perform such overtime and are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
It is understood that to facilitate the distribution of overtime work, employees may be required to indicate their desire for such assignments by signing an “employees available for overtime” list and that repeated refusal of overtime work after having indicated availability for such assignments may result in that employee being excluded from further consideration under these provisions. It is further understood that in the event that all overtime requirements cannot be filled on a voluntary basis, such work may then be assigned (subject to applicable law) on a reverse-seniority basis to those employees in the appropriate seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
It is agreed that the Company will not normally offer opportunities for overtime work if doing so may reasonably be expected to result in an employee working more than 16 consecutive hours. However, in the event that an employee should work for more than 16 consecutive hours (excluding unpaid meal breaks), he shall not be considered available for any assignment until 8 hours have elapsed from the completion of the overtime assignment. In such an event, the Company will make every reasonable effort to reschedule, by up to 2 hours, the start time of the employee's next regularly scheduled shift so that he will still have the opportunity to work a regular 8 hour shift.
9.13	Where an employee has left the Company's Plant on completion of his day's work and is then called by the Company and requested to return to work at a time before the commencement of his next schedule day's work, such request shall constitute a “call-out”. An employee reporting for work on a “call-out” shall be entitled to be paid for work performed by him outside his scheduled working hours at the rate of one and one-half (l'A) times his hourly rate or four (4) hours’ work at his hourly rate, whichever is greater.
9.14	An employee who reports for work at his scheduled time, not having been previously notified to the contrary, shall be entitled to a minimum of four (4) hours pay at the rate of pay to which he would have been entitled for the work he had been scheduled to perform on that day, but it is agreed that he shall perform any suitable work for this four (4) hour period, if so required. However, it shall remain the responsibility of an employee who has been absent from work to check with the Company to determine if work is available before returning and failure to do so shall result in his being considered as unavailable for work on that shift. If an employee is absent from work with approval on a Friday, it will be presumed that he will be available for work on the following Monday, unless he advises the Company to the contrary. Therefore, should such an employee be unable to report by Monday, he must
HAMILTON PLANT - 20 -
notify the Company to that effect prior to his scheduled starting time.
9.15	The system of “fixed” shifts (as contrasted with “rotating” or “alternating” shifts) which is currently in effect will not be discontinued during the life of this Agreement without prior consultation with the Union; provided, however, that discussions with a view to possible modification of the system to accommodate any specific problems which arise may be initiated by either party. Should such discussions fail to produce agreement between the parties, then the Company may initiate changes only to the extent that they are necessary to satisfy the needs of the business and the requirements and efficiency of operations.
It is understood and agreed that this undertaking with respect to the method of staffing shifts (i.e. “fixed” vs. “rotating”) does not in any way limit the Company's right to establish or discontinue shifts per se, or to modify the starting or stopping time of shifts, in order to satisfy the needs of the business and the requirements and efficiency of operations.
The Company will endeavour, insofar as it reasonably can, to give twenty-four (24) hours notice of a change in shift starting time to those employees who will be directly affected by such change.
ARTICLE 10 - NIGHT SHIFT PREMIUM
10.01	Every hourly-rated employee shall be paid a night shift premium of:
-	$.90 per hour during the first year of this Agreement
-	$.95 per hour during the second year of this Agreement
-	$1.00 per hour during the third year of this Agreement
for work performed by him and required by the Company after four (4:00) p.m. in a day and before seven-thirty (7:30) a.m. in the following day in the case of Inside employees and after four-thirty (4:30) p.m. in a day and before seven (7:00) a.m. in the following day in the case of Outside employees provided, however, that such premiums shall not be paid for any time worked in respect of which overtime premium is payable.

If, however, any question should arise as to the day in the year to be designated as any one of the holidays mentioned above, the Company shall decide the question for purposes of this Agreement. If an employee should be scheduled to have one of his regular days off on a day designated as a day to be observed as a holiday, that employee shall be allowed another day off with pay in lieu of the holiday with pay and, for purposes of this Agreement, such lieu day will be considered as his “holiday”.
11.03	Each employee who has completed his probationary period shall receive holiday pay for each such holiday, provided that he is at work on his last regular workday before the holiday and his first regular workday after the holiday. An employee’s holiday pay for each such holiday, shall be an amount equal to his regular hourly rate, multiplied by eight (8).
If, in the week in which the holiday falls, an employee works in two (2) different wage classifications, he will be paid for the holiday at the wage rate in effect for the classification in which he works on the day following the holiday.
11.04	An employee who was absent on his last regular workday before and/or his first regular workday after the holiday will qualify for holiday pay (as set out in clause 11.03 above) if such absence:

12.05	If an employee's vacation pay calculated on the basis of his regular hourly rate, HAMILTON PLANT - 23 -
multiplied by forty (40) hours for each week of vacation to be taken would be greater than the amount to which he would be entitled under clause 12.04 above, then he will be paid the greater amount; provided, however, that if the employee has worked in more than one Wage Bracket during the preceding year, the calculation shall be made using the then current rate for the lowest such Wage Bracket; and provided further that if, during the year of service in respect of which the vacation is granted, the employee has been absent from work (in the aggregate) for more than twenty-five (25) working days due to layoff, or for more than ninety (90) working days for any other reason other than an absence on Workers’ Compensation), then vacation pay shall be calculated only on the percentage basis set out in clause 12.04 above.

Such lieu days will be granted during the months of January, February, March, April, October, or November only, but, subject thereto, the Company will endeavour to arrange for the day(s) off at a time suitable to the employee.

(ii)	if he has not yet completed five (5) years of service, his pay for that vacation will be based on earnings from his last anniversary date until a date which is four (4) weeks prior to the date on which his vacation is to commence.
On completion of that year of service, he will receive a vacation pay adjustment based on earnings for the portion of the year which was not included in the original vacation pay calculation.

(c)	No payment shall be made under this clause 16.02 for any day of absence in respect of which the employee is eligible for full or partial payment under any other clause of this Agreement or from any plan or fund to which the Company contributes (e.g. the Group Insurance Plan, Workers’ Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Government Pension Plan, etc.).
(d)	An employee who, at the conclusion of the contract year, has an unused sick pay credit of at least 5 days may, provided he has not been absent in that contract year for any reason other than:

Gentlemen,
Re:	Collective Agreement
Executed on December 18. 1991.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the above-mentioned Collective Agreement which may be to the contrary, it is mutually understood and agreed that the following arrangements and conditions shall apply to the position of Sales Representative:
1,	If a regular, full time job as a Sales Representative becomes vacant, the job shall be posted and any employee in the category of delivery-salesman or delivery-salesman-in-charge may apply for it. The Company will thoroughly consider all applications received and may select the successful candidate from among them. On occasion, however, the Company may elect to also consider applications from persons not then in the Company's employ. In making its final decision between two or more candidates who in the opinion of the Company are equally suitable, the Company shall always give preference to the more senior of two existing employees and to an existing employee over a new hire. It is understood that determination of the job skills and personal attributes required to fill any particular vacancy, as well as the final selection decision against such criteria, are an exclusive responsibility of the Company.
It is further provided, however, that such selection process will be applied by the Company in a fair and non-discriminatory manner and may be the subject of review through the Grievance Procedure, up to and including arbitration.
2,	Temporary promotions to the position of Sales Representative may be made at the Company’s discretion to meet the needs of the business. However, in making such promotions the Company will give due consideration to the relative seniority of the available and qualified employees.
3,	It is recognized that work assignments within the category of Sales Representative shall be the sole responsibility of the Company.
4,	The assigned duties of a Sales Representative may include the supervision and direction of other employees and, in such cases, the Sales Representative shall be responsible for the quantity and quality of the work of those reporting to him; provided, however, that such responsibilities shall not involve the exercising of any formal disciplinary action.
HAMILTON PLANT - 45 -
5.	Should a Sates Representative be unable to fulfill the normal requirements of that position to the Company's satisfaction he may, after having been given a reasonable opportunity to achieve satisfactory performance levels, be reassigned to delivery work and, if necessary, may displace an employee in that job category. Before taking such action, the Company will review the circumstances in detail, with a full-time representative of the Union. It is further understood that this provision will not apply to cases involving misconduct which will continue io be dealt with on a disciplinary basis and be subject to the established grievance procedure.
6,	The position of Sales Representative will be a salaried position carrying weekly rates as set out in Article 17 of the above-mentioned Collective Agreement.
Approved compensating time off (calculated on the basis of one and one-half hours off for each extra hour of approved time worked) will be granted not later than during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which it was earned.
7.	A Sales Representative may receive various forms of incentives, as determined from time to time by the Company, and it is agreed that such incentives may be introduced, changed or withdrawn without negotiations between the parties hereto.
8.	The provisions of Article 9 of the Collective Agreement, relative to hourly-rated employees, shall not apply to the salaried position of Sales Representatives.

Letter of Intent
UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS
INTERNATIONAL UNION
Gentlemen,
The purpose of this letter is. to confirm the Company's intentions with respect to its endeavours to accommodate the individual preferences of employees in regard to their regularly assigned duties.
“INSIDE EMPLOYEES”
1.	(a) Effective on and after October 17,1978, all job postings made, at Production Centres only, under the provisions of clause 8.06 (a) of the Collective Agreement to till the position of General Help or Production Man will identify the shift, department, and “function” within the Job Classification in which the vacancy exists. For this purpose (and this purpose only), the following “functions” will be recognized:
W.B. No. 1 - Job Classification:	General Help
Functions:
(a)	Principally Truck Washing/Gassing
(b)	Principally Sweeping/Cleaning
(c)	General Duties
W.B. No. 2	-- Job Classification:	Production Men
Functions:
(a)	Principally Machine Tender Crew
(b)	Principally Fork Lift Operator
(c)	Principally Load Consolidation/Sorting
(d)	Principally Piling/Unpiling
(e)	Washing/Filling Product Tanks
(0	General Duties
(b) To the degree that it is practical to do so, the more senior employees at Distribution Centres will receive preference in the assignment of available fork lift operation duties.
2.	It is expressly agreed that the function descriptions set out above are intended solely to identify the general or predominant nature of the tasks assigned to any employee and shall
HAMILTON PLANT - 47 -
not in any way limit the Company's ability to assign other duties or tasks within the Job Classification.
"OUTSIDE EMPLOYEES"
3.	The Company will identify the Sales Areas into which the particular plant's sales territory is divided (e.g. Sales Area A’, Sales Area ’B\ etc.).
This identification will permit employees to identify the general or predominant nature of the work assignments in a particular Sales Area. It shall not, however, be construed as an exclusive definition of the work to be performed; rather, it is understood and agreed that employees may from time-to-time be assigned deliveries which are of a kind or location other than those associated with the general or predominant nature of the Sales Area.
4.	For each such Sales Area, the Company shall establish a basic D.S.I.C. complement representing the number of D.S.I.C.’s which it anticipates will be required in the specific Sales Area on a year-round basis.
5.	When a regular, full-time vacancy (as referred to in clause 8.06 (a) of the Collective Agreement) should occur in the basic D.S.I.C. complement for any Sales Area, the ensuing job posting will identify the Sales Area in which the vacancy exists.
6.	D.S.I.C.’s who are assigned to a specific Sales Area, either as a result of the general reassignment or as a result of application of the job posting procedure will (for the purpose of this understanding) be referred to as “regularly” assigned D.S.I.C.’s, while all other D.S.I.C.’s will be referred to as “spares”.
7.	If on any day the sales volume of a Sales Area is such that not all regularly assigned D.S.I.C.’s are required, the most junior of the employees in that Area will be temporarily reassigned to another Sales Area in which there is a vacant route that day. In the event that there should be no vacant route, then such employee shall displace the most junior of all regularly assigned D.S.I.C.’s who, in turn, shall become a Delivery Salesman for that day.
8.	Any routes which remain vacant after the assignment of all available regularly assigned D.S.I.C.’s shall then be assigned to spare D.S.I.C.’s.
9.	Should an additional Sales Area be required on a temporary basis, the D.S.I.C.’s required in such Area will be assigned on a temporary basis. Similarly, should a Sales Area be temporarily discontinued, the affected D.S.I.C.’s will be temporarily re-assigned elsewhere.
HAMILTON PLANT - 48 -
10.	When it is determined that an additional Sales Area will be required on a “permanent” basis, the basic complement of D.S.I.C.’s for that Area will be filled by the job posting procedure.
11.	When it is determined that a Sales Area is to be "permanently" discontinued and if there are no corresponding additions to complement in other Sales Areas, then the D.S.I.C.’s who were so displaced shall in turn displace the most junior of all regularly assigned D.S.I.C.’s.

The Company and the Union agree to the introduction, on a trial basis, of a procedure whereby there shall be an opportunity for transfer between the “inside” and “outside” seniority groups within each Company plant location. In administering such transfers, the following procedures shall apply.
1.	Any regular employee having seniority standing who wishes to permanently transfer from the “inside” seniority group to the “outside” seniority group at this plant location, or vice-versa, shall so notify the Company, in writing.
2.	When, after completion of the job posting procedures, a vacancy exists which the Company would otherwise fill by a new hire, the Company shall, before hiring a new employee, give consideration to those employees who have tiled notice of their desire for transfer between seniority groups. The most senior qualified candidate then on the transfer list shall be transferred. If there is no qualified candidate for a particular vacancy, the Company may then hire a new employee.
3.	Employees changing seniority group under these arrangements shall carry their full seniority with them into the new seniority group but shall not exercise same under the job posting procedure for a period of twelve (12) months following the transfer.
4.	It is understood and agreed by the parties that an employee wishing to transfer under these arrangements must be capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. In keeping with that understanding, it is agreed that a six (6) month trial period shall apply from the date of transfer during which the transfer may be reversed, if so requested by the employee or by the Company. In such case, the reverting employee may displace the employee who replaced him in his previous position. An employee may transfer from one seniority group to the other once during his employment with the Company.
HAMILTON PLANT - 52
5.	This opportunity for transfer between seniority groups shall apply to normally occurring vacancies only - i.e. it shall not apply to a “vacancy” which has been created by the granting of an inter-group transfer under these provisions.
6.	The Company may fill any vacancy temporarily pending completion of the job posting and transfer provisions.

_______Executed oil December 18.1991
In the event that the Consumer Price Index, All Canada (1971 =100), for the month of July 1992 stands at a value which is greater than such Index number for July 1991, increased by 6%, then a cost-of-living adjustment will become payable during the period from August 1, 1992 until July 31,1993. The amount of such adjustment will be $.01 per hour for each 0.3 points by which the July 1992 Index value exceeds the “trigger" value (i.e. the July 1991 value, plus 6%, rounded to the nearest l/10th of a point).
Such cost-of-living allowance will be implemented immediately following the release by Statistics Canada of the July 1992 C.P.I. value, retroactive to August 1,1992. It will be treated as a separate adjustment (not part of the regular hourly rate) but will be paid for all hours paid for by the Company. It will be paid to all Regular Employees, and not to Temporary Employees. No account will be taken of any increase in the C.P.I. value which is in excess of the July 1992 value, increased by 8%. A further adjustment will be payable between August 1,1993 and July 31,1994 if the July 1993 C.P.I. exceeds the July 1992 C.P.I. by more than 6%. The adjustment will be capped at 8%. The formula and application will be as described above.

OF THE FIRST PART
- and -
T.C.C. BOTTLING LTD.
(hereinafter called the “Company”)
OF THE SECOND PART
RE:	COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT EXECUTED ON OCTOBER 13, 1988
(the “Collective Agreement”).
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the Company’s acceptance in 1988 of the Union’s proposal that all members of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall, in future, participate in the Canadian Commercial Workers Industry Pension Plan (the "C.C.W.I.P."), rather than in the Employees’ Retirement Plan of T.C.C. Beverages Ltd. ("E.R.P."). More particularly, the following specific arrangements have been agreed to:
1.	Members of the subject bargaining unit shall not be eligible to participate in the E.R.P. with respect to service after December 31,1988.
2.	It is recognized that the provisions of the Pension Benefits Act, 1987 (Ontario) restrict the ability of E.R.P. members to withdraw prior contributions to the E.R.P. so long as they continue to be employed by the Company.
3.	Members of the E.R.P. shall, subject to the Plan provisions, retain their right to benefits accrued for service up to December 31,1988. Such accrued benefit shall not be subject to increase by reason of future service or increases in earnings after December 31,1988. However, service rendered with the Company after December 31,1988 will be counted towards eligibility for vesting and early retirement under E.R.P., based on benefits accrued at December 31,1988.
HAMILTON PLANT - 58
4.	On retirement, death or termination of service after December 31,1988, benefits payable to former B.R.P. members will be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of that Plan.
5.	Effective from January 1,1989, the Company agrees to contribute to C.C.W.I.P.P. the sum of 35 cents per hour for all hours paid by the Company to seniority-holding members of the bargaining unit (hours paid shall include hours worked, vacation, observed holidays, sick days, jury duty, bereavement leave, paid time off for negotiations, etc.), up to a maximum of:
a) for plant and sales employees, 40 hours per week, or (b) for office employees, 37-1/2 hours per week.
Effective from January 1,1993, the Company’s contribution will be increased to 41 cents per hour.
6.	Effective from January 1,1989, the sum of 23 cents per hour shall be deducted by the Company from all hours for which payment is made by the Company to seniorityholding members of the bargaining unit, up to a maximum of:
(a)	for plant and sales employees, 40 hours per week, or
(b)	for office employees, 37-1/2 hours per week
7.	It is understood and agreed that the contributions listed in paragraphs ft5 and #6 hereof shall not apply to probationary, temporary, or part-time employees (as defined in the Collective Agreement), so long as they are so classified. However, when a regular, full-time employee completes his probationary period and achieves seniority standing, the Company will retroactively calculate the contributions (as set out in paragraph #5 hereof) with respect to such employee for the period from his last date of continuous employment to the completion of his probationary period and shall then remit such contributions in accordance with paragraph tt% hereof.
8.	Contributions, along with a list of employees for whom they have been made, the amount of the weekly contributions for each employee, and the number of hours worked or paid according to the above paragraphs US or #6, shall be remitted to the trustees of the C.C.W.I.P.P. (the “Trustees”) by the Company within the fifteen (15) days after the close of the Company’s four (4) or five (5) week accounting period. The Company agrees to pay interest at the reasonable rate established by the Trustees on all contributions not remitted as stipulated above, not in excess of the rate established for all other employers participating in the C.C.W.I.P.P.
HAMILTON PLANT - 59
9.	The Trustees may allocate the employer and employee contributions at the direction of the Union provided that in the event that the Union or the Trustees receive notice from Revenue Canada, Taxation or its provincial counterpart or any successor thereto, that any Company contributions allocated at the direction of the Union or any part thereof are not deductible by the Company for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or its provincial equivalents or threatening to challenge such deductibility, it is agreed that such notice will be immediately delivered to the Company. In the event of receipt of such a notice by the Company either delivered by the Union or the Trustees or direct receipt itself, the Company shall be entitled to direct the Trustees as to the allocation of the contributions made by it.
The Union hereby agrees to indemnify and save the Company harmless from any additional taxes or penalties (including any interest charges) which the Company may suffer or incur as a result of the allocation of contributions by the Trustees at the direction of the Union such that the tax deduction claimed by the Company in the ordinary course of its business for the contributions to the C.C.W.I.P.P. as a registered plan is denied by the applicable taxing authorities. Such indemnity will not be applicable if the denial of the deduction results from the Company seeking a ruling from Revenue Canada, Taxation as to the allocations.
It is agreed that the responsibilities of the Company under this Agreement are discharged by making such remittances within the period stipulated above. It is further acknowledged and agreed that the Company is not responsible for the administration of the C.C.W.I.P.P. or the payment of any benefits under the C.C.W.I.P.P.
10.	The contributions shall be for the purposes of providing such pension benefits for eligible employees as shall be determined from time to time by the Trustees of the C.C.W.I.P.P. pursuant to the terms of the C.C.W.I.P.P. It is agreed that the C.C.W.I.P.P. shall provide a past service benefit which shall be $10.50 per month for each year of past service, to a maximum of twenty (20) years. The cost of the past service benefits is to be amortized over a fifteen (15) year period.
11.	Given the mutual agreement of the parties, the Company agrees to sign a “Participation Agreement” and supply any other documents, forms, reports or information reasonably required by the Trustees to recognize its participation in the C.C.W.I.P.P. in accordance with the terms hereof and to permit the calculation of payment of benefits to persons who are subject to this Agreement.
12.	The arrangements set out herein shall remain in effect during the life of the above-
HAMILTON PLANT - 60 -
mentioned Collective Bargaining Agreement and any subsequent Collective Bargaining Agreement which contains the same provisions.
13.	This agreement supersedes any prior agreement of the parties pertaining to the matters herein.
