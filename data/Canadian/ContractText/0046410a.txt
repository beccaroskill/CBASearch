The discharge of a probationary employee shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement. Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee's name shall appear on the Company's seniority list as of his latest date of hire with the Company. A probationary employee is not limited in performing any assigned tasks in the plant.
Section 4.04	Consideration of Qualifications
The application of the seniority provisions of this Agreement must be governed by whether the employee is qualified to perform the job required. Terms referring to "qualified" or "qualifications" when used in this Agreement mean qualified to competently perform the job, without further training, in a safe, efficient and productive manner. If the employee is not so qualified, the applicable seniority provisions shall not apply.

Section 4.05	Filling Permanent Vacancies (Except Maintenance and FAWEMA
Operator/T echnician)
Permanent vacancies in existing or newly created job classifications which the Company determines are necessary to fill will be filled by posting for bid for 7 working days. The vacancy will be filled on the basis of seniority and the ability to qualify for the vacancy.

B - Laid off employees will be recalled to the plant in the order of their plant seniority, provided that those called back have the qualifications and ability to perform the functions necessary to the efficient and safe operation of the plant without further training.

Section Note 2: An employee who is laid off must keep the Company advised of his address and where he may be reached by telephone if he desires to be recalled.
Section 4.10	Disqualifications
If an employee (who has completed his trial period in a job classification) is no longer able to perform the required duties of his classification, he may be transferred to the Utility job classification, provided his seniority is sufficient and he is qualified to perform the job in a safe and efficient manner.

C - Multiple shifts may be scheduled and may be rotated (for example: 8-4, 4-12 and 12-8 or two 12's).

Such hours shall not be used to create overtime or premium payments during the employee's regular scheduled shift.
Note 2: For purposes of satisfying the 40 straight time hour requirement, the following unworked hours shall count as straight time hours of work up to 8 hours per day or 40
-9-
hours per week for days the employee was either scheduled to work or was laid off: (1) a worked or unworked holiday for which the employee is paid, provided it falls on an employee's scheduled straight time day of work, or (2) a paid absence resulting from either bereavement leave, jury duty or vacation time off, or (3) 8 hours per day for Union Committee members who miss work as a result of attending contract negotiating meetings with the Company.
Section 5.05	7th Consecutive Day Of Work Premium

Note: For purposes of satisfying the 40 straight time hour requirement, the following unworked hours shall count as straight time hours of work up to 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week for days the employee was either scheduled to work or was laid off: (1) a worked or unworked holiday for which the employee is paid, provided it falls on an employee's scheduled straight time day of work, or (2) a paid absence resulting from either bereavement leave, jury duty or vacation time off, or (3) 8 hours per day for Union Committee members who miss work as a result of attending contract negotiating meetings with the Company.
Section 5.06	Call-In Pay
An employee, who is called in for emergency or overtime work on his scheduled day off or called back after he has finished his shift and left the plant and premises, will be paid at his applicable hourly rate for such unscheduled hours worked or 4 hours pay at his straight time hourly rate, whichever is greater. An employee called back or called in to start in advance of his regular starting time and who continues to work on into his scheduled shift, shall not qualify for the 4-hour guarantee provided for in this Section.
Section 5.07	Overtime
A - The Company shall have the right to schedule overtime when it is required. Employees based on seniority, skill, ability and qualifications will perform the required work and will cooperate fully in working necessary overtime.
B - Maintenance employees must stay until released when assigned to jobs which are necessary to complete from a breakdown or production standpoint.
Section 5.08	Distribution Of Overtime
Employees will perform necessary overtime assignments. Daily and weekly overtime will be filled by active, qualified employees whose bid job classifications are operating. Such employees will be assigned to daily and weekly overtime on the basis of the man-on-the-job concept. If active employees in the job classification are not available, the
-10-
Company may, subject to qualifications, next offer the overtime to any qualified employee on the shift. When necessary, the employee with the least seniority who is available on the shift and is qualified must work the overtime.
Note 1: The term man-on-the-job means the employee who is actually performing a specific task or job. If more than one man-on-the-job is involved, then the employee who is performing the specific task will be offered the overtime. If the employee performing the task declines the overtime, it will be offered to employees on the same shift and in the same classification who are qualified and immediately available to perform the work.
Note 2: Employees whose jobs are in operation may not turn down overtime in their own jobs in order to work overtime in another job.
Note 3: If overtime (including call-ins) is misassigned, an employee so affected shall have the opportunity to make up such missed overtime as soon as is practical within a 30 calendar day period at any time mutually agreeable between the Company and the employee.
Note 4: Temporary employees may work overtime or holidays. Regular employees shall have first preference for daily and weekend overtime and holiday work, provided they are qualified.

Note 1A: If an employee is scheduled on a 2nd or 3rd shift and is involved in a continuous work period requiring him to work on more than one shift, then the shift on which he has been scheduled establishes the shift differential, if any, for all hours worked during the continuous work period. An employee who is scheduled on the day or 1st shift does not qualify for shift differential pay even though he works on the 2nd or 3rd shifts. Shift differentials are not applicable to call-ins or call-backs unless such an assignment continues on into the employee's regularly scheduled 2nd or 3rd shift. If an employee is on a regular schedule which requires him to overlap 2 shifts, then the shift on which he is scheduled the greatest number of hours determines the shift differential, if any. Should he be scheduled an equal number of hours on 2 shifts, then the higher shift differential will apply.
B - 2 Rotating 12-Hour Shifts - A shift differential is paid in addition to an employee's regular straight time hourly rate if he is scheduled and working on either of 2 rotating 12-hour shifts. Such shift differential is 600 per hour.

This provision applies only when the employee is specifically assigned to fill a temporary vacancy created by the absence of an employee from work. It does not apply to employees who may relieve for breaks or who may be supplementing the workforce performing various tasks or jobs performed by employees in other job classifications.
Section 6.05	Permanent Transfers
An employee who is permanently transferred to a lower-rated job classification will receive the lower rate at the time he begins work in the lower-rated job.
