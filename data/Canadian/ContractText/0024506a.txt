APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
A)	Purpose
The purpose of the Program is to provide a means of training and developing tradespersons of the highest calibre for IMC Kalium Esterhazy, further to provide environment and incentive which will assist employees to achieve their maximum potential.
The Program is recognized as requiring the active participation of the Company and the Union, the employee and various levels of government.
B)	Coverage
The Program will cover trades designated as necessary or advisable by the Company.
The number of apprentices required for each trade and number of apprentices at each level within each trade shall be determined from time to time by the Company. The Company will inform the Union of changes in the number of apprentices at each level of each trade. However, once an employee is accepted in the Plan, the employee will be allowed to progress through the full apprenticeship subject to the provisions of this Program or the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
O General
1)	Standards for entry in the Program shall be determined by the Company in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, “Seniority.”
115
Any interviews or examinations in relation to an employee’s entry into the Apprenticeship Program or interviews while in the Program will be done on company time with no loss of pay. Any preliminary tests conducted by the Company shall only be in relation to the employee’s aptitude for the employee’s particular trade. The Union may have a representative to peruse the content of the type of tests used.
2)	The Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board shall
determine at what level an applicant fits into the Apprenticeship Program and that is the level at which an applicant will be placed.
3)	The Company and each accepted applicant shall execute
an apprenticeship contract in the form provided by the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board.
4)	No employee in the Maintenance Department not participating in the Apprenticeship Program will be denied promotion, laid off, or terminated as a result of the Company posting for an opening in the Apprenticeship
Program.
An employee bidding into the Apprenticeship Program in a trade currently being held by said employee shall retain the employee’s rate if it is higher until the employee’s apprenticeship rate surpasses it, at which time the employee shall progress to the higher rate.
In the event a maintenance employee enters into the Apprenticeship Program and is subsequently removed from the Plan in accordance with this Agreement and the employee’s apprenticeship rate is higher than the employee’s rate prior to bidding, the employee will revert back to the employee’s old job title and applicable rate of
pay-
116
5)	Employees accepted into the Program will enter into an apprenticeship probationary agreement with the Company for a period of six (6) months. Such agreement will be registered with the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board. If, at the end of the aforementioned six- (6) month apprenticeship probationary period both the employee and the Company are satisfied to continue the agreement of apprenticeship, a contract or indenture will be made and registered with the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board.
The six- (6) month period shall start at the time the employee is transferred into the Program. However, such transfer must take place within thirty (30) calendar days after being awarded the job.
6)	The Company and each accepted applicant shall execute
an apprenticeship contract in the form provided by the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board, provided that where the terms of the contract provided by the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board differ from the terms set out in this article, the terms of the Agreement shall govern.
7)	Rates of Pay:
Apprentice 4 (B)
Apprentice 4 (A)
Apprentice 3
0-6 Months equivalent to Helper rate.
6-12 Months equivalent to Maintenance Tech. V rate.
12-24 Months
. . . equivalent to Maintenance Tech. IV rate.
117
Apprentice	2	...24 - 36 Months
...equivalent to Maintenance
Tech. 1)1 rate.
Apprentice	1	... 36-48 Months
...equivalent to Maintenance
Tech. II rate.
8)	The basis of the pay schedules in 7) is that after the
introductory period (Apprentice 4 level) an apprentice will only move to the next pay rate after having the required months of experience and after having successfully completed the course as prescribed by the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board. In the event the employee attends school before the employee’s apprenticeship anniversary date and passes, the employee shall only receive the increased rate when the employee has the required time; and, conversely, if the employee attends school after the employee’s apprenticeship anniversary date, the employee shall be paid retroactively to the employee’s anniversary date upon successfully completing school.
9)	The Company will schedule an approved leave of absence for an apprentice to go to the appropriate technical institute as approved by the Saskatchewan Provincial Apprenticeship Board.
10)	An apprentice who attends the required training course shall be entitled to receive from the Company an amount equal to the difference between what the apprentice would have received on a straight-time basis for each day the apprentice would normally have worked during this period if not attending the training course and what the apprentice receives from any provincial or federal governmental department or agency by way of a basic living allowance for each day that the apprentice is in
-118-
attendance at the training school, provided, however, that if an apprentice is absent from training school on a day on which the apprentice is required to attend, then in such case the apprentice shall not be entitled to be paid under the Collective Agreement. “Living Away From Home” and “Travelling” allowances paid by the government will not be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of make-up pay to which the employee is entitled from IMC Kalium Esterhazy.
Notwithstanding the above, where an apprentice has failed the required examinations at any one level and the apprentice repeats same, the apprentice shall receive no pay difference from the Company for repeating such course at that level.
11)	An apprentice may be removed from the training program by the Company or upon request of the employee and the employee’s apprenticeship contract cancelled at any time during the six- (6) month apprenticeship probationary period, and if the apprentice was a member of the Bargaining Unit prior to their entrance into the Apprenticeship Program, the employee shall be given rate retention and shall retain their regular rate of pay from their former permanent classification and department. Such employee agrees to accept any position offered by the Company. At the Company’s discretion, and if available, more than one position from which to choose may be offered. The employee will be placed on the recall list and recalled as per Article 10.01 C) 3).
12)	An apprentice who has completed the apprenticeship
probationary period may be removed from the Apprenticeship Program and the apprenticeship contract cancelled for any of the following reasons:
a)	Just cause.
119
b)	If an apprentice fails to take the training course when the apprentice is scheduled to take same, provided that the apprentice’s failure to take such course is not due to a cause beyond the apprentice’s control.
c)	If an apprentice fails a training course at any one level on more than one occasion.
In the event of an employee being removed from the Apprenticeship Program, for any reason stated above, the employee shall be given rate retention at their level as per
7)	above in the Apprenticeship Program at the time of removal.
Such employee agrees to accept any position offered by the Company. At the Company’s discretion, and if available, more than one position from which to choose may be offered. The employee will be placed on the recall list and recalled as per Article 10.01 C) 3).
13)	Progression to journeyman status shall take place and the employee will be paid the journeyman rate of pay when the employee successfully completes the apprenticeship and/or presents the employee’s certificate to the Human Resources Department of the Company.
14)	For all employees enrolled in the Apprenticeship Program, the Company shall reimburse an employee for driving the employee’s own automobile at the rate of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per kilometer to cover one round trip from Esterhazy to the appropriate apprenticeship school on the basis of once per session.
