Attention: Mr. D. Garvev TEMPORARY MODIFIED WORK PROGRAM
Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the understanding reached by the parties with respect to the currency of the Collective Agreement dated the 28th day of April, 1995, relating to the temporary modified work program.
An employee temporarily unable to perform his previous duties due to an Injury received in the employ of the Company or due to an Illness or injury for which he is in receipt of benefits under the Long Term Disability Insurance Plan, who has been authorized to return to work under temporal-medical^, restriction, and once he has provided the Company with twenty-four (24) hours’ advance notiflcafionof his ^ pending return to work, may be assigned to a temporary modified work program and given such other work as is available and which he Is capable of performing. To be eligible for such modified work the employee must produce appropriate authorization In the form of an authentic Doctor’s Certificate from the attending physician. If sufficient medical statement is not provided, the Company may request, initially and at intervals during the program, further reports from the attending physician or through a Company arranged medical examination.
Assignments under the Temporary Modified Work Program may be of the following nature, provided they do not exceed sixteen (16) worked days and provided no full time employees are displaced from their regular job:
(a)	Temporary assignment, as per 22:01, to a lighter or more suitable class of work for rehabilitative purposes.
(b)	Temporary transfer as per the Letter of Understanding to another Distribution Centre which provides a work environment or conditions more suitable for rehabilitative purposes.
(c)	Temporary shift change, as per 3:10, where the modified work assignment for rehabilitative purposes requires the shift change. In such instance the employee will not be considered to have exercised his shift preference, and will not bump any employee presently on that shift.
(d)	Temporarily reduced work schedule, with reference to 16:01 (a) for rehabilitative purposes.
Such modified schedule may require co-ordination with the Workers’ Compensation Board and therefore must be co-ordinated by the Health and Safety Department.
2-
Since the intent of the program is to provide for the needs of employees who, as a result of Injury, are not fully qualified on a temporary basis with respect to physical fitness, in each of the above applications the seniority provision of the relevant articles of the Collective Agreement will not normally prevail. Therefore the Distribution Centre Managers (or their appointees) will review the non-medical work related aspects of each case or assignment with the representative of the Grievance Committee from the Distribution Centre concerned and the Chief Steward or his appointee, and will waive related seniority provisions, or extend the above time frames, only with the consent of these representatives.
In administering a Modified Work Program, both Company and Union will strive to curb or correct any potential abuse of the program: Should it appear that the best interest of the Company or it’s employees are not being served, either patty may at any time, with written notice, temporarily or permanently withdraw from the aforementioned program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the program is subject to review and evaluation by the parties listed in the preceding paragraph twice annually.

(ii)	An employee shall be allowed payment for one (1) day of sickness in each three (3) month period during a calendar year, up to a maximum of four (4) days in a calendar year, with such days to be applied towards the first two (2) days of an employee’s absence for which there otherwise is no provision for payment. Should such day not be used in the first of subsequent periods, it may be carried over for useage in other periods, but may not be carried over beyond the end of the calendar year.

Attention: Mr. D. Garvev
Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the understanding reached by the parties during negotiations with respect to the currency of the Collective Agreement dated the 28th day of April, 1995, relating to the matter of job redundancies:
(a)	Unit:
(b)	Transfer:
(c)	Lay-off:
Consists of all employees covered by the Collective Agreement referred to above.
Process whereby an employee, surplus at one Distribution Centre, is absorbed
elsewhere in the Unit.
Process whereby an employee surplus at one Distribution Centre results in the layoff from full time hours of a full time employee, in most cases of the most junior full time employee In the Unit.
(d) Plant Closure: - In the event a Distribution Centre closes, employees of that Distribution Centre shall be entitled to displace junior employees elsewhere in the Unit, subject to the requirements of Article 3.03. Any employee so displaced shall be subject to either the transfer procedure or the lay-off procedure as defined above. The foregoing shall not apply in the case of the re-location of a Distribution Centre.
General Procedure:
The first step is to determine if a surplus of employees exists, and if so, in what job classification. The second step is to identify and to reverse any surplus temporary postings in the job classification in question. The third step is to determine whether employees can be absorbed elsewhere In the Unit. If they can, then the Transfer procedure should be used; if they cannot, then the Lay-off procedure should be used. Depending on the circumstances, it may be possible and necessary to use both procedures at the same time.
Transfer Procedure:
To be employed when a surplus exists in a job classification in a Distribution Centre which as an end result will not cause the lay-off of an employee, such employee being absorbed elsewhere in the Unit.
2
Example:
A Receiver Is surplus at Distribution Centre “A”. A General Warehouseman Is required at Distribution Centre "B".
Objective:	To reclassify employees downward, possibly across the Unit, commencing with the
surplus Receiver and culminating with the filling of the General Warehouseman vacancy.
Procedure:	(D Most junior Receiver at Distribution Centre “A” decides whether he wants to
bump junior Receivers at other locations if such exist.
(2)	If #1 Is not possible, or if the Receiver In #1 wishes to remain In Distribution Centre “A”, he will determine what other classifications in Distribution Centre “A” have employees junior to himself, and providing he has the requisite qualifications as set out In Article 3.03, will displace the most junior employee in
the desired classification.
(3)	The procedure as described in (1) and (2) above will continue for such displaced employee until the employee who has no bumping privileges in his own classification throughout the Unit or other classifications within his Distribution Centre is determined. Such employee shall be placed In the vacancy of General
Warehouseman as provided in the above example.
(4)	Should, within three (3) months following the transfer of an employee under this procedure, the position from which the employee was transferred be reintroduced, all affected employees will be returned to their former positions.
Lav-off Procedure:
To be employed when a surplus exists in a job classification in a Distribution Centre which as an end result will cause the lay-off of an employee(s) in the Unit.
Procedure:	Employees will be laid off in accordance with Article 3.03, and once laid off, surplus
employees in classification will be transferred in accordance with the transfer procedure.
