There shall be no more than one (1) Red Tag Miner for every one (1) Black Tag Miner working underground at the working face.
‘Trainee' positions are entry level jobs and will therefore not be subject to the job posting procedure. Trainee 1 A’ position is not a bid position, therefore an employee cannot post to a ‘Trainee 1 A’ position.
All new employees hired, who hold a Black Tag Miner’s Certificate shall enter the work force at the Trainee 1A’ level and shall be required to complete a five (5) working day orientation period.
To bid successfully for those underground job postings that require work at the face, the employee must hold a Black Tag Miner's Certificate (certified Journeyman positions excepted).
