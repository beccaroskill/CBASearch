A A
(a)	Length of continuous service.
(b) Ability, skill and physical fitness.
23


i
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern. Length of continuous service will be based on Company service rather than department service.
All new or rehired employees shall be employed as probationary employees for a period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked).
Probationary employees shall have recourse to the grievance procedure in all matters and during the probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed to be for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
7.03	Students hired temporarily for the period between semesters will continue to forego seniority rights if their period of employment should extend past the probationary four hundred and eighty (480) hours worked (including overtime hours worked). Students hired for the summer period (April 15 through September 15) will be terminated at the end of the summer period (September 15) and then considered eligible for rehire as a permanent employee. Students hired temporarily will be paid at job class one (1). However, if a student works overtime, they will be paid time and one-half the normal rate for the job in question.
7.04	(a) (i) Plant progression lists now in operation
may remain in operation, but shall be con-
24
sistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any changes to progression lists will be made in consultation with the Union.
(ii)	When plant progression lists are not in
effect, permanent occupational vacancies above the beginner level will be bill/, letincd within the department or filled ^ N J by a job request system.

twenty-one (21) calendar days of the expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the appropriate local Union. With respect to vacancies so filled, the seniority date of the successful applicant shah be noted.
(iii)	However, nothing in this article shall be read or construed as preventing the Company from hiring skilled employees to fill such vacancies where current employees do not possess adequate abili-
25
ty, skill and physical fitness. Before hiring an employee into a position above entry level in a department, discussions will take place with the Union President or his designate to review possible alternatives to hiring, such as training.

(c)	Successful bidding on bulletins under this
clause shag be limited to three (3) per calendar year.
(d)	In the event the Company is unable to place the successful applicant in a vacancy within 21 calendar days of being awarded a bulletin, the employee will be paid the higher of the regular hourly rate of the bulletin job or the rate of the job he is performing until he is placed in the vacancy.
7.05	The Company shall maintain seniority lists for the department. A copy of such list shah be posted every three (3) months. Two (2) copies shall also be provided to the Union.
7.06	Where a Statute of Canada so provides, an employee shah maintain and accumulate seniority during service in the Armed Forces of Canada.
7.07	Before filling vacancies in a department or a plant with new employees, full consideration shag be given to any qualified employees who have requested a transfer to the department in which the vacancy exists.
26
An employee wishing such transfer shall file a written “Request for Transfer” application form with the Employment Office at Flin Flon or the General Office at Snow Lake. An employee’s application shah lapse one (1) year after the date of filing but may be renewed from year to year at his request. However, in no event may an employee have more than three (3) such applications on file at any one time. The Company shah maintain a file of such “Request for Transfer” application forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, the Personnel Superintendent or designated representative shah meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
If there are no “Requests for Transfer” on tile from employees deemed acceptable for transfer to the Flin Flon Mill, Warehouse, Surface and Transportation Department or the Flin Flon Mine Department, and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before tilling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shah be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shag thereupon revert to his former job.
7.08	If an employee is transferred from one section to another within the same department there shag be a
27
probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former section and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shah thereupon revert to his former job. Past practice with respect to moves within plant progression lists shah remain in effect.

Article 8
REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF FORCES
8.01	The Company and the Unions are committed to exhausting all reasonable efforts to retain senior personnel. Whenever a reduction of force or a reduction of hours is necessary, the Company shall give fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice, or fourteen (14) days’ pay in lieu of such notice, except in the case of temporary reductions due to breakdown, accident, or other emergencies making such notice impossible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will advise employees as soon as possible after a decision is made to reduce hours or manpower.
8.02
V
$
In all cases of curtailment of operations, lay-off procedures shah be determined in consultation with the Union. In all cases of reduction in the plant forces (other than temporary lay-off not to exceed two (2) weeks resulting from accident, breakdown or other emergency) the Company shag lay off the employees affected in the inverse order of their Company senior-
28
ity ranking except in those cases where certain spe-cialiTed skills and capabilities are required to fill the normal requirements of the job.
8.03	Employees laid off shall keep the Company advised of their address or forfeit their right to consideration when the working force is again restored. Notice of restoration shah be given to the employee not less than ten
(10)	days prior to his recall date by one of the following methods: (i) to the employee personally, or (ii) by leaving a message at the home of the employee, or (iii) by mailing it to him at his last known address by registered mail. The Secretary of the Union will be advised of the method used to try to contact the employee and whether or not the method was successful. Employees who, because of their seniority have been identified for lay-off but at the time of lay-off are entitled to or are in receipt of Workers’ Compensation benefits or sick benefits under the Sick Benefit Plan, will be laid off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such employees will continue to receive life insurance benefits and Health Plan benefits as though they had not been laid off, but pension and vacation accrual will cease at time of layoff and all earned but unpaid vacation will be paid at that time. Life insurance and Health Plan benefits will cease at the time such employee recovers from disability or at such earlier date in accordance with the terms and policies of the Croup Life Insurance Plan and the Health Plan. If such employee is in receipt of a recall notice but is unable to report for work because of a continuing disability, he shag begin accruing benefits as if he were recalled.
8.04
If any employee has followed the above procedure, he shall not lose his seniority status because of a layoff, but his continuous service record&all not be lengthened more than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days during such lay-off.
29
8.05	An employee who has been recalled after being laid off for any reason outlined in this article and who has previously completed the probationary period outlined in Article 7.02 shall not be considered a probationary employee.
8.06	An employee who, for the convenience and benefit of the employee, is temporarily assigned or transferred to another department at his request instead of being laid off due to lack of work, breakdown or machinery, or other like cause, shah be paid while so employed as follows:
(a)	If the regular rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred or assigned is higher than the employee’s regular pay, he shall receive such higher rate provided he can perform the job to the standard normally required.
(b)	If the rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred is less than the employee’s regular rate, he shall be paid a red circle rate.
8.07	An employee who has been temporarily assigned or transferred under Article 8.06 shah, if an additional employee is required in the department from which he was transferred, be given the opportunity to transfer back ahead of other employees who have not worked in that department. Should the employee refuse the opportunity to transfer back to his own section, he will no longer retain any right of preference in this matter.
8.08	(a) If an employee is temporarily assigned to a job
by the Company he shah receive the rate for the job or his regular straight time hourly rate,
30
whichever is the greater. This rate also applies to General Holidays if the General Holiday falls within the period of that temporary assignment. Should such temporary assignment exceed thirty (30) calendar days’ duration the employment card rate of the employee will be changed to the rate of the assigned job for the duration of the temporary assignment.
(b)	Senior employees shah receive preference for temporary assignments, provided these employees are on the same shift and are capable of doing the work. In cases of temporary assignments extended beyond forty-two (42) calendar days in cases of vacation relief, or thirty (30) calendar days in all other cases, the preference will be given to the senior employee available regardless of the shift, provided this employee is capable of doing the work. This provision will not apply to any subsequent vacancies resulting from the above.
8.09	In this article,
(i)	“Card rate” means the rate shown on the time card for the job occupation into which an employee has been placed and as it appears on his time card.
(ii)	“Red circled” means a special wage rate.
If an employee as a result of technological change or organizational change is downgraded by the Company into a classification of work paying a lesser wage rate than the regular wage rate of his permanent job, the employee shall maintain the rate of the permanent job which shah be red circled. If such employee is subse-
31
quently placed into a card rate which equals or exceeds his red circled rate, he will be removed from the red circled rate and paid that card rate.

Red circle differentials established prior to January 1,1995 shah be reduced or eliminated by any increase resulting from an increase in the increment between job classes.
It is a condition of Article 8 that any employee affected by it be required to accept any training the Company offers him and that he accept any other higher card rate job offered to him by the Company through assignment or promotion, and that he be an applicant for any higher card rate job in his department that is posted.

19.05	There will be no Union activity on Company time except that necessary in connection with the handling of grievances and the enforcement of this Agreement: but nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the officers of the Union, who are also employees of the Company, from looking after the matters of membership dues, initiation fees, assessments and solicitation of membership, provided it is done after working hours or during non-compensable
72
lunch hours and does not interfere with the operation of the plant.
19.06
19.07
Without restricting Management Rights as set out in Article 3 of this Agreement, all working conditions now established by practice and negotiation and now in effect shall remain in force insofar as they are consistent with this Agreement.
(i) The Company agrees that the Unions have an understandable concern over “contracting out” by the Company because of its effect upon such f matters as job opportunity for the employees.
v
/ The Company will continue to place its primary ^ reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Unions agree that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1.	The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of operations and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
2.	The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the Presidents or their designate of the affected Unions
73
prior to awarding a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside Company property. The Company will also consult with the appropriate Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the affected Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
74
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
5.
It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, the Unions and Senior Management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
The Company agrees that no employee, shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
(ii) Salaried supervisors whose regular jobs are not in this Agreement shall not work on any jobs which are included in this Agreement except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimenting, protecting the safety of employees or equipment, periods of production difficulties or in emergencies when regular employees are not reasonably available.
19.08	The Company will continue its present practice of supplying free transportation to and from a Company
75
designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.09.
Where an employee is required by the Company to travel in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way to or from a Company designated point and the outlying job site, outside the time of his regularly scheduled shift, a travelling allowance will be paid. Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the 30 minute portion will be paid. Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
19.09	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19.08, and in lieu of those provisions, special travel arrangements in respect of travel to and from Flin Flon and Snow Lake will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement.
A maximum bereavement leave of ton (10) calendar days will be granted to an employee, commencing on the day of the death of his spouse, son or daughter, in order to attend the funeral. For each day the employee was regularly scheduled to work during such leave he shah be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
(ii) A maximum bereavement leave of three (3) scheduled working days will be granted to an employee, upon the death of his mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, spouse’s grandmother, spouse’s grandfa-
76
19.10	(i)
ther, grandchild, and any relative permanently residing in the employee’s household or with whom the employee resides, in order to attend the funeral. In this situation the bereavement leave will be extended by two (2) scheduled working days if the employee attends the funeral outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence the employee shah be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
(iii)	In the event that an employee’s bereavement leave overlaps or occurs during his vacation period his vacation time will be extended by the number of days that his bereavement leave encroaches on it.
(iv)	To qualify for bereavement leave pursuant to
19.10	(i), 19.10 (ii) or 19.10 (iii) the employee shah notify his immediate supervisor as soon as possible following the bereavement.
(v)	Notwithstanding the terms of 19.10 (i) and
19.10	(ii), under the Canada Labour Code an employee is entitled to three (3) calendar days bereavement leave immediately following the death of the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law or father-m-law. There is no requirement under the Code to attend the funeral to be eligible for such leave.

(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, them will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts.

21.03	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay period next preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
21.04	All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.

80
An employee wishing to review his departmental employee tile shall make such request to his department superintendent or designate. All of the material in the file will be reviewed with the employee. If the employee disagrees with the factual nature of any material in his file and the superintendent or designate is unwilling to remove the material from the file, such employee will be entitled to write a note to the file explaining his disagreement.

RE: PARTNERING
The Company and the Unions are committed to a successful profitable operation founded on principles of respect and tolerance between the Unions and the Management of the Company.
Both the Company and the Unions share common objectives relating to achieving the ongoing viability of HBM&S and in turn providing greater employment security and improved working life for employees. The parties recognize that change and involvement is required on the part of all levels of Management, Unions, and employees in order to achieve these objectives.
Therefore the Company and the Unions have established a Joint Restructuring Committee made up of senior Union and Management officials with a mandate to develop and implement:
109
a)	an overall vision for HBM&S,
b)	a highly involved workforce and
c)	improved communications at all levels of the organization

3.	Empowering employees at all levels of our organization to become highly involved and to significantly share in the decision making process.
4.	Fostering innovation, co-operation and commitment to change which will enhance job security through increased productivity and profitability.
The following better define the preceding principles and values:
Safe:
Establishing standards, practices, procedures and responsibilities that eliminate or prevent unsafe conditions or acts.
110
Profitable:
Yielding an acceptable financial profit to the mutual benefit of Company employees and shareholders.
Customer Focused:

Environmentally Responsible:
Making decisions and policies in the building and management of our plants and mines to comply with regulations and rules in the interest of protecting the environment in which we live and work now and in the future.

Highly Involved:
Actively participating in planning and decision making as a normal consequence to employment with HBM&S. This may lead to the role of supervisors evolving into a role which emphasizes coaching and co-ordination instead of directing.

RE: BANKED OVERTIME PAY

117
1)	At an employee’s request, he will not be paid for overtime worked and payment for this work will be banked (banking of pay, not banking of hours).
2)	It is understood that this banked overtime pay may be paid out any time at the discretion of the employee (e.g. short term personal leaves of absence outlined in Letter #10).

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #10 To the Union:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1) Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
118
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
If an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee’s request).
b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked “regular” vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
c)	Employee would take a “special” vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
119
6)	In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
It was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #11
To the Unioi^ ^
RE: PROFIT SHARING PLAN
1.	The Company agrees to establish a Profit Sharing Plan with effect as of January 1, 1994. The Plan, which shall not be amended without agreement of the Unions, includes all employees in the Flin Flon/Snow Lake operations, with the exception of executive officers of the Company and all others who participate in any management incentive plans other than this Profit Sharing Plan.
2.	At the end of each calendar year, ten percent (10%) of the Company’s “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” if posi-
120
tive, as defined in point 3 of this letter, shall be distributed on the first payday following the issue of the Profit Sharing Plan Statement to the hourly and salaried employees on the following basis:
a)	Hourly and salaried employees who are employed for the full year shall receive a full and equal share.
b)	Employees who retire or arc laid off during the year shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
c)	Employees who are hired or are recalled during the year and arc on the payroll at year end shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
It is understood between the parties that employees who quit or are terminated during the year will not be afforded profit sharing. It is further understood that quarterly pro rata basis shall mean an eligible employee who was on the payroll during any portion of a quarter will be afforded profit sharing as if he worked that full quarter.
By way of example, if an employee retires in August, he would receive three (3) quarters of the profit sharing payment afforded an employee who was on the payroll for a full year.
Any negative “After Tax Earnings (Loss)’ for the calendar year shall be eliminated and not carried forward to future years.
3.	For the purposes of this Profit Sharing Plan “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” shall comprise “Net Income (Loss)” calculated in accordance with Minorco's
121
accounting policies and International Accounting
Standards with the following exclusions:
(i)	The greater of Profit Sharing Plan costs or Lump Sum Payment costs
(ii)	Provisions for deferred income tax
(iii)	The Company’s portion of any gains which result in payments under a Gainsharing Plan during the year including the annual global reserve payout.
4.	There is no cap on the size of the Profit Sharing Plan.
5.	Verification
(i) Upon release of Minorco's annual results, the Company shall provide the Unions with an audited Profit Sharing Plan Statement for that fiscal period. Such statement shall include verification of the exclusions per point 3 (i), (ii) and (iii).
6. Lump Sum Payment
For the calendar years 1997 and 1998, the greater of the amount determined per the Profit Sharing Plan above or an amount determined per a Lump Sum Payment formula will be paid to employees. For greater clarity, only the greater of the Profit Sharing Payment or the Lump Sum Payment will be paid for each year.
The Lump Sum Payment formula will be based on actual operating earnings adjusted for:
(i)	Unfavourable cost/volume variance (if any) for each of the approved 1997 and 1998 budgets
122
(ii)	The impact of a	capital write-down as at
December 31, 1996, or any additional write-down during 1997 or 1998 arising as a result of an economic impairment (if any), on 1997 and 1998 non-cash rates.
For purposes of this Lump Sum Payment formula, operating earnings shall be defined as the “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” as defined in 3 above before:
(i)	Exploration
(ii)	Other financing	costs
(iii)	Interest expense
(iv)	Taxes
The adjusted operating earnings so calculated will be compared to the following chart to determine if the amount is greater than the amount calculated per the Profit Sharing Plan.
Adjusted Operating Earnings	Lump Sum Payment (FF/SL)
< $5.0 M	0
$5.0 - $10.0 M	$0.8 M
$10.0 - $15.0 M	$1.2 M
$15.0 - $20.0 M	$1.8 M
> $20.0 M	$2.4 M
The Lump Sum Payment will be distributed in the same manner as outlined in points 1 and 2 above.

RE: SNOW LAKE TRAVEL
Further to negotiations with the Bargaining Committee, 1987, towards concluding a Collective Bargaining Agreement effective October 1, 1987, the Company has agreed to resubmit Letters of Agreement regarding past practise of providing transportation to Snow Lake. It is, therefore, the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
129
Flin Flon employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2 */2) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (21/2) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools from Snow Lake when they return from the completion of a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare, Flin Ron to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Rin Ron for a temporary period.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #26 To the Union:
RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility
136
will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company’s Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate.
b)	Trades - In order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
c)	Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBM&S Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one
137
(1) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (1) representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills required to perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1,1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid off unless such layoffs are the result of the following:
138
a)	Layoffs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Layoffs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	layoffs of any employee hired after October 1,1996.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	layoffs due to closure, sale or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It is understood that any layoff resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterized as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #30 To the Union:
RE: 12-HOUR SHIFTS
The parties agree that no additional wage and benefit costs will be incurred with the adoption of a twelve (12) hour shift schedule and, to this end, the following clauses in the Collective Bargaining Agreement have been revised. This summary is for information purposes only and does not prohibit the establishment of other provisions as may be deemed necessary by individual departments when implementing extended hours.
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be considered to have accumulated 1.5 straight time working shifts for any twelve (12) hour shifts worked for purposes of completing the normal probationary period of four hundred eighty (480) working hours (including overtime hours worked).
142
9.02	Standard rates of pay for hourly employees working extended hours shall be calculated on the basis of working 320 hours in an eight (8) week period (average 40 hours per week).
p Standby allowance will be paid to hourly employees working extended hours if the department requires such an arrangement. The allowance payable will be one-half (1/2) hour’s pay at straight time at the employee’s applicable hourly rate.
For areas which work four on/four off with 12-hour shifts and do not use a swingman, the basis for their scheduled overtime pay will be as follows:
(i)	2.3 hours at 1/2 regular rate will be paid for
each 48-hour working set of shifts which are worked as scheduled.
(ii)	Employees who miss a shift(s) due to sickness or AWOL during a 48-hour set of scheduled shifts will not receive the payment outlined in (i) for that 48-hour set.
(iii)	For the purpose of determining the payment in (i), shifts of paid leave such as vacation and bereavement leave will be considered as shifts worked.
(iv)	Payment under (i) will be prorated for shifts missed in the 48-hour set for shifts of unpaid leave (i.e. if there is one shift of unpaid leave in the 48-hour working set, the payment would be 36 -i- 48 x 2.3 hours x 1/2 regular rate).
9.04 For employees working 12-hour shifts, two (2) working days shall be considered as sufficient notice for
143
change of rest days. Also, shifts paid at overtime rates because of insufficient notice of either change of shift or rest days shall be considered as straight time hours worked for the purposes of calculating subsequent overtime entitlement based on the 8-week averaging period.
11.03 A second-shift differential shall be paid to hourly employees working such extended hours on the basis of 2/3 the combined afternoon and night/ graveyard shift differential payable to employees on standard eight (8) hour shifts.
13.06 Sick Benefit waiting periods, daily payments, and the duration of daily payments for employees working twelve (12) hour shift rotations will be converted to an hourly equivalent and subsequently multiplied by an employee’s normal hours.
14.01	Statutory holiday pay for employees on a compressed work week who are not required to work on a statutory holiday shah consist of eight (8) hours pay at straight time, provided they comply with the regulations of Article 14.
14.02	Statutory holiday pay for employees on a compressed work week, other than those referred to in Article 14.04, who are required to work on the eleven (11) General Holidays listed in 14.01 shah consist of holiday pay in an amount equal to his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours and one and one-half (11/2) times his regular rate of pay for all hours worked by him on that General Holiday.
15.02	(d) Regular vacation bonus for employees on a compressed work week shall be adjusted to 1.5 times the current regular vacation bonus for each compressed day of regular vacation granted and taken under Article 15.08.
144
15.08	Regular vacation entitlement for employees on a compressed work week shall be converted as outlined below. It is understood that anything less than one full compressed vacation day will be taken as a part shift, or paid out at the end of the year.
Vacation Anniversary Date	Regular Vacation Days (8 Hour Shifts)	Compressed Vacation Days (12 Hour Shifts:!

Forexample: 15 days (8 hr. shifts) = 10days(12hr.shifts)
19.11	(i) Bereavement leave for workers on extended hours shall consist of a maximum of ten (10) calendar days commencing on the day of the death of his spouse, son or daughter, in order to attend the funeral. For each day the employee was regularly scheduled to work during such leave he shall be paid his regular rate of pay for twelve (12) hours.
(ii) Bereavement leave for workers on extended hours shall consist of a maximum of two (2) working days, upon the death of his mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, grandchild, spouse’s grandmother and spouse’s grandfather, and any relative permanently residing in the employee’s household or with whom the employee resides, in order to attend the funeral.

For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence, the employee shall be paid his regular rate of pay for twelve (12) hours.
It is agreed that the Company or the Unions may terminate a twelve (12) hour shift schedule in any particular department and/or work area and revert to eight (8) hour shifts by giving the other party fourteen (14) days’ notice.

RE: SPECIAL ALLOWANCE - JOB AMALGAMATION
During 1987 bargaining the Company and the Union agreed that a special allowance of one job class would be paid if, as a result of job amalgamation, the CWS evaluation of the amalgamated job does not result in a minimum one job class increase above the highest classified job being amalgamated and the following criteria are met:
(i)	two or more job descriptions are combined into one or more job descriptions and one or more job descriptions are terminated, and
(ii)	the primary function(s) of the terminated job(s) become part of the primary function(s) of the remaining job(s), and
(iii)	as the result of the amalgamation less employees are required to do the work.
It is understood that if technological change were to eliminate most of a jobs duties and the remaining duties were added to another occupation, or a job were terminated and its duties spread amongst a large number of jobs or incumbents, the special allowance would not apply.
The special allowance will not form part of the CWS evaluation or classification but will remain a separate allowance.

RE: MINE DEPARTMENT TRAINING
Further to the 1993 negotiations, the following practices were agreed to regarding Mine Department training:
148
1)	Vacancies for development miners will be bulletined within the department prior to hiring. If no qualified development miners apply, the Company will commit to training up to four (4) development miners at any one time (two (2) for Callinan and two (2) for Trout Lake). In the event a situation arises which will cause the Company to increase its need for new development miners beyond the four (4) outlined, the Union will be consulted as far in advance as possible to discuss alternatives to hiring. One potential alternative to hiring would be to recall qualified development miners from other departments or from the recall list out of seniority.
2)	If there is a requirement to bring additional employees into the mines to fill temporary vacancies created as a result of the training program, such employees will be required to return to their original department or return to lay-off once the training has been completed.
3)	After completion of the training, if no permanent vacancy exists, the person trained will return to his former job.
4)	During the training period and until the person trained is placed in a permanent development miner position, he shall be paid at the rate of his former job.
5)	Anyone who receives training as a development miner as outlined above will be unable to bulletin to any other position in the mine for a two (2) year period after completion of the training.
6)	Mine Department employees who have completed development miner training will be required to fill future vacancies for development miner positions, either temporary or permanent, regardless of whether such vacancies are at Trout or Callinan.
149
7)	Employees who receive training under this program must be prepared to qualify for all development miner jobs including drift mining and conventional raise mining.
8)	The parties agree to develop selection criteria for development miner trainees to assist the selection process.

The terms of Article 8.08 (b) would apply to such temporary assignment. The returning staff employee will remain at entry level until he is the successful applicant for a bulletin.
It is not the Company’s intent to show favouritism to a returning staff employee. That being the case, any disputes arising regarding job assignment or work location involving a
150
returned staff employee will be considered a proper subject for the Grievance Procedure. The employee and his immediate supervisor are encouraged to settle any disputes prior to proceeding to Step I of the Grievance Procedure.

8.	The Modified Work Program will be co-ordinated by the Superintendent of Loss Control who will also serve as the Company representative on the committee.
9.	Union jurisdiction:
If an employee is assigned to a job outside of his current Union jurisdiction, he will continue to pay dues to his Union for a one (1) year period. At that time it will be reviewed by the committee and the affected Unions.

An employee on temporary modified work can only apply for job bulletins in his original department.
11.	A meeting will take	place	between	the	department,

RE: ELECTRONIC MONITORING
The primary function of electronic monitoring equipment is to observe, measure and monitor production difficulties, problem areas, processes, troubleshooting, etc.
Electronic monitoring equipment is not intended for invading the privacy of employees or to administer undue disciplinary action; however, employees should be aware that performance could be monitored as a by-product of electronic monitoring.
It is agreed that in the event of a criminal investigation (i.e. RCMP), employees may not be notified of the installation of electronic monitoring equipment.

To the Union:
RE: STAFF TO HOURLY - 1993/94 REDUCTIONS NO LAY-OFF OR DISPLACEMENT
There will be no direct lay-off or displacement from the bargaming unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition. That being the case, for each staff employee returning to the bargaining unit, one hourly employee will be removed from the lay-off list.
It is understood between the parties that this approach may, for a time, cause the Company to carry employees beyond those required and that this excess will only be eliminated or reduced by attrition (quits, retirements, terminations, etc.) or the requirement for additional manpower (e.g. Westarm).
The accounting for this attrition will begin for Trades and Steel on the date a staff employee’s return to the individual bargaining unit would have resulted in the lay-off of an hourly employee.

RE: SPECIAL VACATION ACCRUAL
The parties agreed at 1993 bargaining that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 15.10, effective October 1,1994 employees who have three (3) or more years of service who are laid off for ninety (90) calendar days or more, or who retire, will be afforded special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis at time of lay-off or retirement. That is, after three (3) years of service, employees who are laid off or who retire will be afforded one-third (1/3) of the three (3) week special vacation allotment for each full year of employment.
By way of example, special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis shall mean an employee who has been on the payroll for five (5) years and three (3) months at time of lay-off will be entitled to two weeks’ special vacation pay in addition to that earned but not taken on obtaining three (3) years of service. An employee with three (3) years and six (6) months of service at time of lay-off will be entitled to no additional special vacation.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #49
To the Union:
RE: HBM&S AS SECOND PAYER FOR DRUGS
It is agreed between the parties that the Company will continue to be the second payer for drugs as outlined in Article 13.04. That is, the Company will be responsible for paying for only the non-recoverable portion of eligible drug costs for regular participating status members and special participating group members.
It is understood between the parties that the Company will, retroactive to January 1, 1997, provide members with a vision care benefit so long as the cost of that benefit to the i Company is offset by an equal amount of savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by W the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments. The vision care 0 benefit shall be for the cost of prescription lenses, frames and £ contact lenses to a maximum of $100 every twenty-four (24) o months for eligible members.
For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the expression “savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments” shall be defined to mean the reduced Company costs that can be established as being solely attributable to the Company being the secondary rather than the primary payer for drugs covered under Article 13.04 (c) of the Collective Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “savings”). Savings shall include savings related to all bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired), and the cost of the vision care benefits shall be based on the cost required to extend the benefit to all such bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired).
166
The Company will review the savings that are available following each calendar quarter during the years of 1997, 1998 and 1999 to determine if there are sufficient savings available to provide the vision care benefit. Savings may be carried forward from quarter to quarter within a calendar year, but shall not be carried forward from one calendar year to the next.
Members will remit vision care claims direct to the carrier, Manitoba Blue Cross, who will in turn process and pay on a first in, first pay basis provided that the savings are available. If savings are not immediately available, the claims shall be accumulated again on a first in basis and processed and paid in that order provided savings become available within the calendar year.
It is further understood that there will be no obligation by the Company to purchase any additional benefits or to make any concessions related to any subsequent savings other than those set forth herein.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #50
RE: COMMITMENT TO COST AND MANPOWER REDUCTIONS
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties at 1996 bargaining and their commitments with
167
regard to cost and manpower reductions. The parties recognize the need for cost and manpower reductions in 1997 and beyond to enhance our chances of survival.
It is understood that there is a need to reduce operating costs in 1997 by $30 million and, as part of this effort, the Company has decided that the hourly Steelworker and Trades Association memberships will be reduced by 48. These reductions will be measured against the January 1, 1997 budgeted manpower number of 982 which does not include hourly employees who may need to be laid off in 1997 as a result of the Westarm Mine closure (37 employees as of February 7,1997).
It is understood that 48 Steelworker and Trades Association positions will be reduced by voluntary means. To this end, incentive programs have been put in place. It is understood that it may have the effect of reducing the Steelworker and Trades Association memberships by more than the target of 48.
In association with the Company’s commitment to reduce manpower by 48 by voluntary means in 1997, the Unions underscore their commitment to the terms of Letter #26 by the following:
1.	Each Union President will communicate in writing to their members the need and their support for the flexible use of employees’ skills.
2.	The parties will work together to educate the employees of the necessity for flexibility to reduce costs and improve productivity while adhering to safe working practices and standards.
3.	To not allow their demonstrated commitment to waiver in the face of disputes over other issues.
