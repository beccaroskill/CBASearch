5.09	Leave of Absence
5.09.1	Unless otherwise noted, provisions for leave of absence apply to regular employees only.
5.09.2	Seniority rights of employees shall not be affected if inability to report to work arises from sickness or from reasons acceptable to the Company. Absence for reasons other than sickness, if for a period in excess of one week, must be covered under the following leave of absence conditions.

Once they have recommenced their employment they shall return to their place on the seniority list as determined by their full service with the Company in the occupational group or department concerned.
5.09.7	The upgrading of skills and technical courses, whether relatedto an employee’s classification or not, shall be deemed just and sufficient cause for the granting of a leave of absence without pay to regular employees. Such leave of absence will not exceed one (1) year in length. An employee granted leave of absence under this article shall suffer no loss of seniority for such leave.
5.09.8	Appointment or election to a Union position shall be considered good and sufficient cause for granting leave of absence.

Shift Arrangements:
6.13	If it is the intention of Management at any plant to institute night and/or graveyard shifts, the Management shall post, prior to commencement of processing, a schedule cf the various alternative nights and/or graveyard shift arrangements contemplated during the season showing the precise regular hours (i.e. starting time, lunch period, quitting time) of all such contemplated shifts. The method to be used in determining the calendar day of night shifts shall also be posted. The first day of the week shall be Monday and first shift of the day shall be the day shift.
Alternative shift arrangements and application of same shall be as follows:
6.14	A single night shift when the Company decides on instituting a two shift pertwenty-four hours operation (i.e. two twelve-hour shifts). Should the second shift commence processing earlier than its appointed starting time, overtime at the multiple rate of time and one-half shall be paid for all hours worked priorto 7:00 p.m. (prior to 6:00 p.m. for start-up crew) in accordance with Section 7.02.3.
6.15	An afternoon and graveyard shift when it is decided to have three shifts per twenty-four hours operation.

Where meal breaks and rest periods are staggered for each shift by the Company to allow for continuous processing, a penalty equal to the straight time rate shall be paid for such meal breaks. The time taken for meal breaks shall not be included in the calculation of hours worked to determine payment for overtime.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
22.01	During the life of this Agreement, should any difference arise concerning the interpretation, application, operation, or any alleged violation of this Agreement, including any question as to whether any matter is arbitrable or should any local trouble arise in a plant, there shall be no stoppage of work or strikes on the part of the Union nor shall there be any lockouts on the part of the Company.
22.02	In the event that a grievance or dispute arises, the Shop Steward Committee shall function as the Grievance Committee and the members thereof shall be afforded such time off without pay deduction as may be required to attend the necessary meetings with the Management. At major plants, where there is a large number of Shop Stewards, the Shop Steward Committee shall elect a sub-committee who shall with the Chief Shop Steward and the Shop Steward representing the section in which the grievance has occurred, constitute the Grievance Committee, Nothing herein shall prevent the holding of meetings between the Management and the full Shop Steward Committee if the need arises.
21
22.03	It is the general interest of both parties to prevent the elevation of minor questions into formal grievances and, as a possible means to this end, employees are urged to raise grievances imagined or otherwise with their foreman as quickly as possible. Employees have the right to go directly to their departmental Shop Steward if they wish to do so.
22.04	The successive steps to be taken in the handling of any grievance until it is settled shall be set forth as follows:
Step One:
The employee shall notify the departmental Shop Steward of any incident which gave rise to the grievance as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the incident which gave rise to the grievance. The Shop Steward shall immediately approach the Departmental Supervisor, Plant Manager or Personnel Manager (which ever is appropriate) to resolve the grievance with or without the employee in attendance.
At this time, the shop steward may request additional time to investigate the grievance. The company will not unreasonably refuse to grant this request.
Step Two:
If the grievance remains unresolved at Step One, the departmental Shop Steward shall apprise the plant's Chief Shop Steward of the details of the grievance. The grievance shall be placed in writing and include details of the alleged violation and reference to the pertinent section(s) of the Agreement. Upon receipt of the written grievance, a meeting shall be arranged between the Grievance Committee and Plant Management in a further attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is one that is complex in nature or involves the operation of a seniority plan, either party may request the assistance of, and where necessary, the attendance of, a representativefrom their respective Headquarters.
Step Three:
If the grievance remains unresolved, the Union may provide any additional information deemed necessary in writing to the Company. The Company shall place in writing its reasons for rejecting the grievance. When the exchange of written positions is complete, a meeting shall be arranged between representatives from
Headquarters of the Union and Headquarters of the Company for a final attempt to settle the grievance., Should this meeting fail to settle the matter in dispute, step four may be invoked.
Step Four:
If the grievance remains unresolved each party shall appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to nominate a third impartial arbitrator who shall act as Chairperson of the Arbitration Committee. Failing to agree upon such an impartial arbitrator within three (3) days of their appointment, either party may request the Honourable Minister of Labour to appoint such an impartial arbitrator. In the case of a grievance or dispute involving interpretation of this Agreement, the majority decision of arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, it being understood that notwithstandingthe foregoing, no decision of such Arbitration Board shall change this agreement in wording or format. Where the parties mutually agree, a single arbitrator may be used.
22.05	Where, after exhausting the first three steps of the grievance procedure of this agreement, a difference remains between the parties relating to callouts, seniority issues, pay issues (individual cases), leaves of absence, vacation issues, bereavement issues, the discipline of an employee (other than discharge), or any other matters the parties may mutually agree to, including any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable, Mr. D. McPhillips or Mr. B. Greyell, in rotation, or a substitute agreed to by both parties, shall at the mutual request of both parties:
a)	Investigate the difference,
b)	Define the issue in the difference, and
c)	Make an order in writing, with reasons, for final and binding settlement of the dispute within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of the request, or such extension of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
d)	Notwithstanding (c), where the parties have mutually agreed before the request is submitted, the arbitrator shall make written recommendations to resolve the difference within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her; receipt of request, and for those twenty (20) days time does not run in respect of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
22
As the process is intended to be non-legal, the parties will present their own arguments.
All presentations are to be short and concise and are to include a comprehensive opening “statement”. The parties agree to make limited use of authorities and such witnesses as are necessary during the presentation of their cases.
Prior to rendering a decision, the arbitrator may assist the parties in mediating a resolution to the grievance.
All decisions of the arbitrator are to be limited in application to that particular dispute and are without prejudice. These decisions shall have no precedential value and shall not be referred to by either party in any subsequent proceeding.
The parties shall jointly apply to the Minister cf Labourfor payment of remuneration and expenses cf the arbitrator to be made in accordance with S. 104 of the BC Labour Relations Code. Any remuneration and expenses not paid under that section shall be borne equally by the parties to this agreement.
If both parties agree, other matters may be referred to the troubleshooter for either recommendations on how to resolve the dispute or for resolution, depending on the particular dispute.
22.06	If, after ninety (90) calendar days of its instigation, the grievance has not been settled, either party may refer the matter to arbitration or the grievance shall be deemed abandoned. If either party decides to go to arbitration, they must advise the other party of their nominee within ten (10) calendardays of the decision to go to arbitration or the grievance will be deemed abandoned. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent of both parties, it being agreed both parties are interested in and will strive to achieve settlement of all grievances or disputes in the shortest possible time.

SECTION 6
NETWORK_________________________________________________________________________________________
6.01	Contract Net Work
No work on nets shall be done on a contract or piece work basis, other than by mutual consent of both parties. Should any group of fishers preparing their seine desire to work on a contract basis there shall be no objection on the part of the Union.
6.02	Networkers employed at a camp facility may be given alternate days off to Saturday and Sunday as the weekly days of rest. The principle of giving consecutive days shall be followed. This article shall apply only to the following categories when employed at a camp facility: Net Boss and Qualified Networker.
6.03	Monthly Rated Networkers
Employees commencing network for the first time shall be classified as “First year Networkers.” They shall serve a three year (one season shall be equivalent to one year) apprenticeship being classified successively as “First”, “Second” and “Third” year Networkers. At the commencement of their fourth year (or season) they shall be classified as “Qualified Networkers” and paid accordingly.
6.04	Should instances occur where, in the opinion of the management, sufficient skill and ability has not been demonstrated by an individual employee during the qualifying period to justify upgrading, such cases shall be referred to the Qualified Networkers in the net loft concerned:
If, in the opinion of the qualified workers, the employee is entitled to the upgrading, they shall meet as a committee with the management for the purpose of working out a satisfactory solution. If it is found impossible to work out a mutually acceptable solution by this procedure, the case shall be dealt with in the regular grievance procedure.
6.05	In no case shall there be more inexperienced workers (First, Second, Third year) employed than qualified networkers in any net operation. This principle shall apply to gillnet networkers; it being understood that circumstances may occur which make it impossible to rigidly apply the condition in all gillnet operations. At no time shall qualified workers be laid off in favour of apprentices.
The companies shall recognize and cooperate in the establishment of an individual record book system showing the service and experience of a networker engaged in net work.

UNDERSTANDING
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY STATEMENT
The Company and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers’ Union/CAW recognize and support the right of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment, and to that end, are committed to providing a workplace free of sexual harassment and making every reasonable effort to ensure that no employee is subjected to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment shall be defined as “any unwanted sexual comments, looks, suggestions, or physical contact, directed at an employee, which creates an uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, or defensive working environment.”
The offence need not necessarily infer “compliance” as a condition of employment, or the offer and/or maintenance of some benefit in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual advances outside of normal working hours and away from the working environment may be construed as harassment where there is a critical link to employment.
This policy applies to all employees, both in and outside of the bargaining unit, recognizing that the alleged perpetratoror harasser, and the harassed, may represent any level of the organization. Harassment as defined is not limited to male-female, but also includes female-male, male-male and female-female incidents. Harassment need not be accompanied by threats or rewards to be termed such.
Any employee who feels his or her rights under this policy have been violated S encouraged to report the incident to his or her supervisor either verbally or in writing. The employee may be accompanied by another person of their choice during this process if they deem this necessary. The supervisor will advise the Personnel/Human Resources Department of the complaint and all pertinent information.
The Company and the Union shall each appoint a designate to conduct a joint investigation and each designate must have experience and/or training concerning sexual harassment. The joint investigation shall be a fact-finding investigation and the designates shall submit a report, detailing their findings and recommendations, to the Personnel Human Resources Department and Union headquarters as soon as possible after receipt of the complaint. Management will take immediate action if necessary. Nevertheless management shall within thirty (30) days of receiving the report, give such orders as may be necessary.
Nothing shall preclude an employee from involving a Shop Steward outside official or a union official at any stage of the investigation.
No complainant shall be transferred to positions against his or her will.
Anyone who is found to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. The amount and form of the discipline will depend upon the circumstances of the harassment, whether the person recognizes the seriousness of his or her conduct and whether the person has previously been disciplined for such conduct.
The Company and the Union agree that extreme care will be taken to ensure that confidentiality will be respected throughout.
Employees should be aware that provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act provide for redress in respect to sexual harassment.

The parties agree to establish a joint working group comprising appropriate company, union and pension trustee representativesto investigate possible changes to the structure of Parts 1 and 2 of the Shoreworkers Pension Plan with Canadian Fishing Company.
The intent of the analysis is to determine if there are options to rearrangethe company contributions and/or structure of the Plan so as to continue a good pension for employees of the company while providing an incentive (or at least no disincentive) for older workers to retire, should they so wish.
The working group will undertake the study as soon as practicable and will provide its results and recommendationsto the parties.
If mutually agreed, the parties may implement the recommendations during the term of the collective agreement, or the parties may use the report and recommendationsto inform the next round of bargaining.
