DATED JULY 2, 1987
87
PREAMBLE
The "Compressed Work Week" will apply to those employees who are presently working on regularly scheduled twelve hour shifts.
Continued operation of this "Compressed work Week" requires that a majority of eighty-five percent (8 5 L) support it in any vote. Votes may be held at the request of the Union but not more often than once in any s ix (6) month per iod.
Further implementations of this "Compressed Work Week" will require a majority vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of the individuals in favour of a trial period. Before the end of the trial period, if both parties agree, another vote can be held to continue the schedule. The majority in favour at this time should be eighty-five percent (85%).
The success of the "Compressed 'Work Week" program depends on the co-operation of employees to request overtime work to replace individuals who are absent. This will be accomplished by means of a Spare Board which will be completed two (2) days in advance of any set of shifts.
If the most junior employee volunteering for a job is not available for work for good reason, that employee must contact the Company giving the name of the qualified employee who will be replacing him on the spare board.
If there are no volunteers on the spare board and if the designated employee is not available for work for good reason, the designated employee must contact the Company giving the name of the qualified employee who will be replacing him on the spare board.
88
Co-operation in this respect is essential.
Payment for time worked will be made according to hours worked each week.
Application to the Department of Labour must be made before proceeding with a schedule change. Approval by the Minister of Labour is necessary.
The Company reserves the right to schedule all its employees on an eight (8) hour shift during any shutdown or emergency period.

Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation Limited (Mining Division), at the request of Local 5385 United Steelworkers of America agrees to institute a 12-hour shift schedule. The continuation and success of this "Compressed Work Week" is contingent on meeting the following conditions:
