S. 9:01
163
Vacation weeks will begin on Sunday, however, the Company may permit a change, if practical, for individual employees. Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their department scheduler.

S. 9:02
164
2.	When the departmental allotment is allocated, it will be applied so that there are an equal number of employees who may be off on vacation on each shift, by seniority.

3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this process is not filled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this time, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.

2.	If medical expenses are $200 or less, you are responsible for paying the expense and submitting the claim for reimbursement to the Benefits Carrier which will then coordinate payment with the provincial gove^ment health insurance plan (if applicable).
3.	You will be asked to sign an Authorization Form, allowing the Benefits Carrier to co-ordinate payment of the claim on your behalf through your provincial gove^ment health insurance plan and the Benefits Carrier.
4.	If required, Travel Assistance will forward an advance deposit to the hospital before medical services as rendered. If payments made on your behalf are subsequently determined to be for ineligible services or amounts, the Benefits Carrier reserves the right to recover the overpayment from you.
Co-Ordination of Medical and Dental Care Benefits
If you or your eligible dependents are covered for similar benefits under another Plan, the Benefits Carrier will take this into account when determining the amount of expenses payable under this program. This process is known as Co-ordination of Benefits. It allows for reimbursement of covered medical and dental expenses from all Plans, up to a total of 100% of the actual expense incurred.
S. 15.03
220
Order of Benefit Payment:
A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the "Primary Payer” (i.e. responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the "Secondary Payer" (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).
1.	If the other Plan does not provide for Coordination of Benefits, it will be considered as the Primary Payer, and will be responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense.
2.	If the other Plan does provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, the following rules are applied to determine which Plan is the Primary Payer.
a)	For claims incurred by you or your dependent spouse, the Plan covering you or your dependent spouse as an employee/member pays benefits before the Plan covering you or your spouse as a dependent.
b)	In situations where you or your spouse have coverage as an employee/member under more than one Plan, the order of benefit payment will be determined as follows:
• The Plan where the person is covered as an active full-time employee, then
•	The Plan where the person is covered as an active part-time employee, then
•	The Plan where the person is covered as a retiree.
i
S. 15.03
221
3.	For Claims incurred by your dependent child, the Plan covering the parent whose birthday (month/day) is earlier in the calendar year pays benefits first. If both parents have the same birth date, the Plan covering the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet pays first.
4.	However, ifyou and your spouse are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
•	The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
•	The Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child (i.e. if the parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the dependent child), then
•	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
•	The Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child (i.e. if the parent without custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse's Plan will pay benefits for the dependent child).
5.	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Care Plans.
S. 15.03
222
6.	If the order of benefit payment cannot be
detennined from the above, the benefits payable under each Plan will be in proportion to the amount that would have been payable if Coordination of Benefits did not exist.
Submitting a Claim for Co-Ordination of Benefits
To submit a claim when Co-ordination of Benefits
applies, refer to the following guidelines:
1.	As per the Order of Benefit Payments section, detennine which Plan is the Primary Payer and which is the Secondary Payer.
2.	Submit all necessary claim fonns and original receipts to the Primary Payer.
3.	Keep a photocopy o f each receipt prior to submitting your claim to the Primary Payer.
4.	Once your claim has been settled by the Primary Payer, you will receive a statement outlining how your claim has been handled. Submit the statement along with all necessary claim fonns and copies of the receipts to the Secondary Payer for further consideration or payment, if applicable.

Single Pension Group	$83.00	$83.00	$83.00

2.	Any pension benefits you may have earned from former plans are in addition to the pension from this Retirement Income Plan.
E. Annual Benefits Statement
Your Annual Benefits Statement shows your pension earned to date and estimates your pension for future service based on your current earnings.

S. 15:10

The reduction is 2% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62), down to age sixty (60) and then 4% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age sixty (60).
4.	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age sixty-two (62). There are no adjustments to the calculation after age sixty-two (62).
S. 15:10
227

b)	Under the Retirement Plan the normal form of pension fund distribution if you have a spouse at pension commencement is 61.1% joint and survivor pension. The retiree will collect 90% of his/her pension (or the actuarial equivalent of a life only pension, if greater) until death and then their spouse will collect 61.1% of the pension until death.
c)	If you have a spouse but wish to select a form other than the Joint and 60% Survivor form then you and your spouse must sign. a Spousal Waiver form.

K.	If You Die During Retirement

Section 15: 14
Stock Purchase Plan
A. Features of the Plan
1.	Kellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder ofKellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 U.S. per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars, which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan. Shares will be purchased by Wells Fargo for employees on the open market. Dividends are reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
2.	Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for:
a)	Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.)
b)	However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and
S. 15:14
241
payment to the Wells Fargo will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Wells Fargo a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
c)	Wells Fargo will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the Plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Wells Fargo protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
B. How the Plan Works
1. You may sign up to participate i n the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the Payroll Deduction Form (see your Human Resources office). The following guidelines apply:
a)	Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this Stock Purchase Plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes
S. 15:14
242
significantly in foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this minimum amount may have to be changed.
b)	Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S.
(in total) per year.
c)	A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
d)	The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
e)	Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
f)	You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Wells Fargo will be refonded to you.
2.	Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at the time of each dividend payment. Since dividends are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three (3) decimal places.
3.	Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
S. 15:14
243
4.	At year-end, Wells Fargo will provide you with information on the payment ofbrokerage charges and bank service charges. Payment of these charges on your behalf must be reported as income for tax purposes.
C.	Purchase of Shares through Cash Payment
1.	Cash payments of $25 U.S. (minimum) to $25,000
U.S. (in total) during any calendar year for purchase of shares can be made by sending cheques directly to Wells Fargo at any time. Kellogg Company or Kellogg Canada Inc. will not handle voluntary cash purchases.
2.	Wells Fargo will purchase shares on or about the 15th ofeach month. Cheques received on or after the purchase date will be held until the next month.
3.	If shares are not purchased by the 15th of the month preceding a dividend payment, no dividend will be paid on the newly purchased shares until the next quarter.
D.	Safekeeping of Shares
1. For your convenience, Wells Fargo will hold the shares it has purchased for you. Whole and fractional shares will be held in a dividend reinvestment account. You may also deliver for safekeeping any Kellogg Company stock you already hold. Upon written request, Wells Fargo will issue you certificates for any or all of the full shares credited to your account, and you may continue to reinvest dividends on those shares.
S. 15:14
244
2. Any employee who withdraws his or her shares from the custody of Wells Fargo may subsequently sell these shares only through a broker registered under the Securities Act of the province in which he or she resides. The employee is responsible for the brokerage fees.

Letter of Understanding
London Plant - Early Retirement Incentive
This letter of understanding will memorialize our agreement regarding the postretirement benefits administration for employees who elect to take the early retirement incentive that was negotiated as part of the 2009 London Plant contract. This letter of understanding applies only to those affected London Plant employees whose full unreduced retirement eligibility date under the early retirement incentive falls after the expiration of the 2009 contract (April 14,
2012).
We have agreed that, consistent with the early retirement incentive and the applicable plan documents, the individuals covered by this letter of understanding will be eligible to receive the negotiated increase in the pension multiplier, if any, in the 2012 London Plant collective agreement, as long as the negotiated increase goes into effect prior to the employee's full unreduced retirement eligibility date. Any such increase in the pension multiplier would not result in an increase in the employee's monthly severance payment under the early retirement incentive program.
We have further agreed that the post-retirement health and dental care benefits for eligible employees covered by this letter of understanding will be those provided in the 2009 London Plant collective agreement. Any changes to the postretirement health and dental care benefits or any other postretirement benefits negotiated during the 2012 London Plant negotiations, whether they are enhancements or reductions, will not apply to these employees.
260
Agreed: June 10, 2010
Renewed Negotiations: April 27, 2012
Letter of Understanding Long Term Disability
The parties agree to find mutual solutions to the Long Term Disability issues. We will work together to get employees back to productive, meaningful work in the Kellogg London Plant.
The parties agree that employees who are on Long Term Disability longer than the twenty-four (24) month period will be subject to the following conditions:
After an employee’s disability benefits have been paid for twenty-four (24) months the individual may be re-evaluated to determine if they are able to perform all of the material duties of any gainful occupation for which he/she is reasonably fitted by training, education or experience to perform work, within the Kellogg (London) organization.
If said employee is unable to maintain regular employment within the Kellogg Company he/she will be considered for totally disabled under the application of the Plan and will be immediately reinstated at the prescribed benefit level.
Once an employee is eligible for an unreduced pension (age plus years of service) and applies for CPP Disability Benefit the Company will ensure the employee receives no less than $2,300/month (CPP and Pension) up to age 65. The employee will be required to provide all necessary documentation to confirm proof of payment and/or denial of CPP claim within sixty (60) days of the eligible payment date. This will apply to all existing employees under the current disability payment plan.
261
Employees that are eligible for full retirement (age plus years of service) will be counselled as to the various retirement options available to them versus continuing on the Long Term Disability.
If any such employee is transferred into a non-bargaining unit Kellogg position due to the application of this agreement, they will be reamed to the bargaining unit if they are no longer found to be totally disabled.

When a Maintenance job has been discontinued:

•	If the retiring worker is not the most senior in classification and severance letters are sent out to the classification without anyone claiming the "A" severance the retiring worker will claim severance package.
