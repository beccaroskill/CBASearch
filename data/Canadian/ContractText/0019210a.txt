7.02	Eligibility Criteria
Permanent employees automatically become a member of the Pension Plan on the first date coincident with or following date of permanent hire.
7.03	Employer Account and Employee Account
(a)	Employer Account
The Company will contribute the equivalent of seven percent (7%) of basic earnings to the Employer Account each pay period on
22
behalf of each employee. Basic earnings mean the standard hourly rate of pay for all regularly scheduled hours worked, including vacation hours taken [e.g. twelve (12) hours at straight time on a twelve (12) hour shift schedule]. Contributions will be deposited to the registered defined contribution plan. Contributions shall not be less than five thousand dollars per year ($5,000/year) based on a full year worked.
(b)	Employee Account
Employees will contribute each pay period the equivalent of half a percent (0.5%) of basic earnings to the Employee Account. Employees may choose to contribute above the half a percent (0.5%) basic earnings. Employee contributions will be deposited into a group RRSP sponsored by the Company.
7.04	Pension Plan Administration
Both the employee contributions and the contributions the Company makes on the employees' behalf will be invested in a pension fund managed by a financial institution. Employee mandatory contributions of half a percent (0.5%) of basic earnings will remain in the group RRSP while he or she is employed by the Company. Employee voluntary contributions may be withdrawn once per calendar year.
7.05	Statements
Employees will receive individual annual statements showing the amounts of both the Employer and Employee accounts.
23
7.06	Employees on Disability Leave
Employees receiving WCB, short term disability or long term disability benefits will receive Company contributions based on deemed earnings using the standard hourly rate at the commencement of the disability leave. Contributions to employees on long term disability will be to a maximum period of time equal to the employee's seniority at the time he or she commenced disability leave. In no case will pensionable service continue to accrue after an employee's normal retirement date or while he or she is gainfully employed by an Employer other than Cardinal River Operations.
7.07	Temporary Mine Shutdown
In the event of a temporary mine shutdown, employer contributions will continue for a further thirty (30) day period based on deemed earnings using the standard hourly rate at the commencement of the temporary shutdown.
7.08	Death Benefit
Should an employee die while a member of the Pension Plan, all amounts credited to him or her will be paid to his or her beneficiary as specified by the Alberta Employment Pension Plans Act. This will include a contribution for the balance of the calendar year in which death occurs providing that the employee has worked in the year the death occurs and to the extent permissible under the Income Tax Act. The contribution will be based on deemed earnings using the standard hourly rate at the time of death.
24
7.09	Termination
Upon termination of employment, the value of the employee's Pension Plan will be transferred to any registered vehicle permissible under the Alberta Employment Pension Plans Act.
7.10	Provincial and Federal Regulations
The Pension Plan terms and conditions will be registered in accordance with the Alberta Employment Pension Plans Act and the Income Tax Act of Canada.
7.11	Voluntary Contributions
In addition to the voluntary contributions allowable in Article 7.03 (b), employees may direct the Company to make additional deductions to the Group RRSP at the Servus Credit Union, or another financial institution agreed to between the Union and the Company.
