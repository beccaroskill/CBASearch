6

(b)	Seniority shall govern on all occasions when:
a lay-off which the Company expects to remain in effect for more than one (1) week occurs provided employees are sufficiently qualified. Sufficiently qualified shall be deemed to mean that the employee is qualified to perform the normal duties of the job. In the event of a workforce reduction, employees designated as temporary will be terminated before any regular employee.
a transfer or a promotion to a classification included in Schedule “A” which
23
the Company expects to remain in effect for more than thirty (30) days occurs, provided however, that the senior employee has qualifications equal to or better than those of other employees. If any such temporary layoff, transfer or promotion should subsequently become permanent, or exceed the stipulated time limits, the provisions of this clause (b) shall apply immediately but such application shall be without retroactive effect.
(c)	For the purpose of this Agreement, seniority shall be calculated from the date an employee first enters the bargaining unit under this Collective Agreement with the Company or its predecessor. Employees who leave the bargaining unit, for any reason, shall maintain and continue to accumulate seniority for the total period of their subsequent employment with the Company or its predecessor.

24
time between the date of termination for such reason and the date of re-employment does not exceed eighteen (18) months. This paragraph shall not apply to anyone hired and designated as temporary.

(d)	When an employee who has been in a classification for twenty-six (26) or more consecutive weeks is regressed to a lower classification due to lack of work, he/she will be given four (4) weeks’ notice of such regression or paid at the rate of the higher classification in lieu of such notice.
(e)	When employment offers are made, former employees whose employment with the Company was terminated during the preceding eighteen (18) months due to lay-off and who are qualified for the job or jobs
25
available shall be offered employment on the basis of seniority accumulated prior to termination. Any person being re-employed under this clause shall not be designated as temporary. The Company shall be under no obligation to re-employ such a former employee unless he/she has filed his/her current address and telephone number with the Company for this purpose, can be reached when the opportunity for employment arises and is available for work when his/her services are required.
In the event that a former employee fails to accept re-employment, other than of a temporary nature, the Company may consider that he/she no longer wishes to be re-employed.
(f)	The Company agrees to post seniority lists showing the seniority status of each employee and to furnish a copy of such lists to the Union.
(g)	The Company agrees to alter the seniority lists from time to time and to correct any errors therein whenever proof of error is submitted by the Union or any employee.

27
(iii)	without the employee having been reemployed for a continuous period of at least nine (9) months following a previous termination, except that if severance pay in weekly installments upon such previous termination was discontinued as a result of such reemployment, the severance pay to which the employee was previously entitled will be resumed upon the subsequent termination.

be paid to an employee when:
(i)	the termination is for any reason other than lack of work;
(ii)	the employee accepts employment at any Company location, or with an affiliated company, before termination becomes effective;
(iii)	the employee is offered employment with a successor company at the same location before termination becomes effective;
(iv)	the employee becomes a pensioner;
(v)	the employee resigns, even in antici-
28
pation of termination:
(vi)	the employee elects termination in lieu of demotion, promotion, transfer or any change in status. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee in the classifications of Stationary Engineer 2nd Class or 1 st Class Tradesperson who is demoted due to lack of work, will be given the option of being terminated by the Company due to lack of work.
(c)	The amount of an employee's severance pay, subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article, shall be:
(i)	one (1) week’s pay for each of the first four (4) years of seniority, plus
(ii)	one (1) week’s pay for each year of seniority over four (4) and an additional week’s pay for each year of seniority over fifteen (15) reduced by the amount of any severance pay previously paid by the Company for seniority of over four (4) years.

29
3>
be limited to fifty-two (52) weeks’ pay.

For severance pay purposes a week's pay shall be equal to the employee’s current straight time hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours, not to exceed forty (40), constituting the employee’s normal number of weekly hours of work at the said Site at any time of termination, and shall not include overtime or any other premium pay or allowance.
(d)	The Company may elect to pay severance pay in weekly installments or in a lump
sum.
(e)	In the event that an individual receiving severance pay is re-employed by the Company, payments thereof shall cease with the payment for the period ending the day
30
immediately preceding the date of re-employment.
(f)	An individual who has received severance pay shall not be required to return any portion of such pay to the Company in the event that they are re-employed.
(g)	When a former employee is offered and refuses re-employment, other than work
of a temporary nature, severance pay shall be discontinued.
ARTICLE X — SAFETY AND HEALTH
(a)	The Company will continue to make reasonable provisions forthe safety and health of its employees during the hours of their employment.

(b)	Whenever the Company recommends to the employees for their better protection the use of additional personal safety equipment which it does not supply free of charge, it will make such equipment avail-
31
able to employees at cost, except that should safety shoes not be stocked by the Company, it will subsidize the purchase of these shoes for the personal use of the purchaser.
The subsidy will be the lesser of the cost per pair or $84.00 for the first pair purchased in each calendar year, and the lesser of the cost per pair or $57.00 for subsequent pairs purchased in each calendar year.
ARTICLE XI — DISCHARGES
The Company agrees to notify the Union of the reason for the discharge of any employee. Such notice shall be given in writing and mailed by registered mail addressed to the President of the Union within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge. Regardless of the foregoing, at the point of discharge, a regular employee may request the presence of a Union Officer or Steward. Any discharge may be discussed as a grievance, provided that the grievance is submitted in writing within seven (7) days after receipt of notification of discharge by the Union. In the event that an employee is discharged and after subsequent
32
investigation is exonerated and reinstated he/ she shall be reimbursed for the time lost by reason of such discharge on the basis of his/ her normal number of daily hours of work less earnings received from other employers in respect to the period for which he/she is to be reimbursed.
In the event that an employee is discharged and is not exonerated by subsequent investigation, a lesser penalty may be substituted where, in the opinion of an arbitrator, the penalty of discharge is considered to be inappropriate.
ARTICLE XII -GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(a)	Any dispute, grievance or misunderstanding (hereinafter called “grievance”) involving occupational classification, wages, the Industrial Relations Plans, seniority, hours of work or other working conditions which any employee or group of employees may desire to discuss and adjust with the Company, shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

Step 1
The employee may report the matter to the steward designated to represent his/her group, who, together with the employee may take up the matter with the foreperson and shall at the same time present to the foreperson a written summary of the grievance. If the written decision of the

Submit the grievance to the appropriate Manager or his/her appointee.

Step 3
Submit the grievance in writing to the Union Bargaining Committee which may bring the matter to the attention of the Site Manager by presenting to him/her or his/ her appointee the written statement of the grievance. The Union Bargaining Committee may then discuss the grievance with the Site Manager or appointee at a time to be agreed upon. If the written
35
decision of the Site Manager or appointee does not settle the matter to the satisfaction of the Union Bargaining Committee or six (6) weeks have elapsed since the grievance was submitted under this step, the provisions of Article XIII may be invoked.
(d)	All decisions arrived at by agreement between the Site Manager or appointee and the Union Bargaining Committee with respect to any grievance shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding upon the Company and the Union.
(e)	Nothing in this agreement shall bedeemed to take away the right of an individual employee to present any personal grievance to the Company.
