Thereafter, the employee will be paid the contract rate for the job.
11.09	In the event that such a transferred employee is retransferred to their original department before August 1st of the following year for production work, the employee will be paid the higher rate for the balance of the calendar year in which he/she was transferred plus a maximum of ten (10) months.

11.11	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of the Company to assign employees where necessary in order that the efficiency of the department is not
14
impaired. Should an employee who has been transferred at their own request as outlined in Section

This section does not include employees while on work stabilization or a defined training program.
11.13	If at any time it becomes necessary to make transfers because of lack of work or departmental reorganization the following procedure will be followed:

15
11.14
a)	The Company must supply adequate manpower in all operations in all departments at all times so that an employee will not be required to perform more than a fair days work.
b)	Clause (a) shall not be construed to mean that the manning of all operations is at present exactly adequate or that all employees are presently assigned exactly a fair days work and accordingly changes in an employee's work load may be made so long as the resulting situation is not a violation of Clause(a).
c)	Whenever changes are to be introduced, which may affect bargaining unit personnel, the Company agrees to notify the Union as soon as it is practicable prior to finalization of plans. A meeting will be arranged with the Union to discuss an appropriate disposition of the employees affected.
11.15	Classifications During Overhaul
When a scheduled overhaul is planned and lay-offs are avoided through work stabilization, a list of selected employees to support the mechanical trades will be made by Management. Selection will be based on aptitude and ability for work. Compensation will be based on the following criteria:

b)	Employees assigned to work with Maintenance Mechanics or Painters to do routine general maintenance or painting work will be paid the Maintenance General Rate.
16

It is also understood that, from time to time, there may be employees selected whose aptitude and ability to do the work assigned to them is to be assessed. Whenever this circumstance occurs, the employees will be paid the Maintenance General Rate for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks.
It is also understood that employees who are assigned to other work stabilization jobs outside the Maintenance Department in order to avoid lay-off will be paid their regular rate.
The Company agrees to supply the Union with names of those employees who when performing work that required the use of their additional abilities would receive the "C” mechanic rate. This list will be updated from time to time as employees show their ability.

12.07	The selected employee may, within the above probationary period, request a return to his/her former position if he/she provides reasons satisfactory to the Company for such request. In the event that the employee is permitted to so return, he/she shall not be eligible to apply for any further posted jobs for a period of one year from the date of his/her return to their former job. This restriction shall not prevent an employee from applying for a posted day job at any time.

It is agreed that before Line Manager appointments are announced, the Company will advise the Union of its selection but nothing in this section shall affect the right of any applicant having greater seniority to submit a grievance ifhe/she feels that they have been discriminated against as a result of such decision, but such grievance shall not be arbitrable.
12.09	With qualifications for the job being given full and prime consideration, employees having the greatest seniority shall be given preference for promotions to Line Manager positions.
12.10	The Company may post other job opportunities outside the bargaining unit to give Union members an opportunity to apply but the postings of such jobs shall not be considered a contractual matter or governed in any way by the terms of this Agreement.
12.11	If a permanent employee transfers to a non-bargaining unit Company position he/she will continue to pay Union dues for a period of six (6) months from the date of their transfer, the employees seniority in the bargaining unit shall be frozen as at the date of their transfer, and the employee will forfeit his/her seniority in the bargaining unit unless he/she transfers back to the bargaining unit within six (6) months from the date of the transfer. The Company will deduct the required dues and remit them to the Union.
12.12	Withdrawal cards will be issued free by the Union to those who qualify under the constitution and By-Laws of the Union.
19
12.13	If an employee from the bargaining unit is selected for a position outside the bargaining unit the normal probationary period will be three (3) months, but such period may be extended in specific instances after discussion and agreement with the Union. If an employee demonstrates that he/she will not qualify within the probationary period, the employee may be required to return to their former position before such time without prejudice and without loss of seniority.
12.14	The procedure for filling temporary Line Manager positions will be the same as for permanent nonbargaining unit vacancies. While working in such a position, bargaining unit employees will be paid the rate as set out in the Wage Classifications as "Group Leader".
SECTION 13
Reprimands, Suspensions and Dismissals
13.01	In the event of a decision by the Company to dismiss an employee who is a dues-paying member of the Union, such decision shall immediately be subject to review by the Company and the Union, and shall, if desired by either party, be treated as a grievance in the third step of the grievance procedure in Section 15 of this Agreement.

It is intended that the following will cover all conditions of employment, however it is recognized that certain provisions of the collective agreement will continue to be applicable to Weekend Workers. Where the provisions of the two agreements conflict, this Memorandum will prevail. Where this memorandum is silent, the provisions in the main body of the collective agreement will apply with any modifications necessary to give efficacy to this Memorandum. It is intended that a Weekend Schedule employee shall not be able to duplicate or pyramid any benefits or entitlements and that he/she should not enjoy terms and conditions of employment superior to those extended to eight (8) hour shift workers except as specifically set out in the Memorandum.
The parties agree as follows:
1.	Hours of Work and Payment
The Company may implement a weekend work schedule consisting of two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts on each of Saturday and Sunday of any week.

2.	Notice and Duration
The Company will give affected employees three (3) weeks notice of its intent to start the Weekend Work Schedule.

3.	Staffing
The Company will post annually during the first sixty (60) days of the year for volunteers who wish to work the Weekend Schedule. Selection of employees will be based on seniority amongst qualified competent applicants. Successful applicants shall remain on the Weekend Schedule for one year. In the first year of operation, the Company will post for volunteers who shall commit to work the weekend for six (6) months.
Temporary Employee's will be used to supplement the seniority employee workforce. In the event that the company's needs cannot be filled with volunteers and Temporary Employees, the least junior, qualified competent employees will be required to work the weekend schedule.
Interviews for first time applicants will be conducted by management with representation from the Union present, and the purpose shall be to advise the applicant of the conditions of the position and provisions of this memorandum.
Employees who are on the Weekend Schedule will not be eligible for weekday overtime. Upon return to a
66
weekday work schedule, such employee will be credited with the average overtime hours worked by employees in his overtime distribution group to that date.
Replacements for absent Weekend schedule employees will be drawn from the list of employees who have signified an interest in working Weekend Schedule but who are not currently assigned thereto. In the event that insufficient volunteers are found, the junior most qualified competent employee will be required to work. Payment for weekend time worked by replacement workers shall be in accordance with ‘Article 19' of the Collective Agreement.

5.	Weekly Indemnity Benefit
If you become totally disabled and are prevented from working due to a non-occupational accident or a sickness not covered by Worker's Compensation, you will receive weekly indemnity benefits provided you are under the care of a licensed physician. If disability commences during a period of lay-off you will be eligible for Weekly Indemnity benefits from the date you are recalled to work only if you have 10 or more years seniority and you are recalled within a period of two weeks from the date of lay-off and you are totally disabled on that date.
The amount of your weekly indemnity benefit is 70% of your basic weekly earnings rate as of the date disability commences. When a general change in wage rates takes effect under the terms of the labour agreement, the amount of your weekly indemnity benefit from the effective date of such change will be 70% of the basic weekly rate to which you would be entitled if you were at work. Your weekly indemnity benefit payments will be reduced by the amount of any disability payments which you are eligible to receive from the Canada Pension Plan or any other government source.
The benefit payment is based on a seven (7) day week. For each day of absence for which a benefit is payable you will receive one-seventh of the weekly benefit. Benefits are payable from the first day of absence if disability is due to accident, or from the fourth day of disability due to illness. Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term
84
Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks).
Where it is necessary for an employee to have dental surgery, benefits will be payable commencing on the fourth day following such surgery and will continue up to a maximum of two weeks for any such claim, but only on receipt of proper certification by a dental oral surgeon.
A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation of the disability unless you have completely recovered and have been back at work for at least fourteen (14) days.
Your weekly indemnity insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your weekly indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	Long Term Disability Benefit
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received weekly indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received W.S.I.B. payments for a continuous period of twenty-six (26) weeks.
During the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, your benefit will be payable weekly at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect during that period. At the end of the first seventy-eight (78) weeks, your LTD benefit will be fixed at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect in the 78th week of the LTD benefit period and thereafter your LTD benefit will be payable in an equivalent monthly amount at the end of each month. For example, if your earnings rate in the 78th week is $26.50 per hour:
(a)	your weekly earnings rate is 40 x $26.50 =$1,060.00
85
(b)	your weekly LTD benefit in the 78th week is 66-2/3% of $1,060.00 = 706.60
(c)	thereafter your monthly LTD benefit is 4-1/3 X $706.60 =$3,061.93
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker's Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
In order to qualify for LTD benefits you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, be unable to perform a regular job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least six (6) months.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefit will continue for up to twenty-four (24) months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from
86
rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $3,061.93 and you earn $1,500 in rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD benefit
Subtract 75% of S1,500
LTD benefit during rehabilitation
Earnings from rehabilitative employment
Monthly income during rehabilitation

When you or any of your dependents are entitled to receive insured benefits, you should obtain the necessary claim forms from your foreman or department head. When you have completed the employee's portion of the claim form you should have your physician or dentist complete his section. Then send the completed hospital, major medical or dental form to the insurance company and the completed weekly indemnity or LTD forms to the medical department.

94
by the fourth day, your benefits will be payable only from the day on which you first visit a doctor. In case of accident, you must see the doctor no later than the day following the accident in order to qualify for benefits from the first day; otherwise benefitswill be payable as if the disability is due to illness. Diagnosis and prescription by telephone only does not constitute a “visit” for this purpose.
b)	Long Term Disability Benefit - Claim must be filed within six (6) months following the date from which LTD benefits become payable but the earlier the better in order to avoid any delay in commencement of your LTD benefit payments.
c)	Semi-Private Hospital Benefit - Claim must be filed within ninety (90) days of the date of hospitalization. Standard claim forms are available at all hospitals. Benefits will be paid to you unless you complete the appropriate section of this form to assign benefits to the hospital.
d)	Major Medical Expense Benefit - Claim must be submitted no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred except that, when your insurance is canceled for any reason, proof of claim must be submitted within ninety (90) days of the date af termination of your insurance.

It is suggested that such claims not be submitted until the total bills exceed the deductible by at least $10.
e)	Dental Care Benefit - Claim must be submitted by the end of the calendar year following the year
95
in which the expense was incurred except that proof of claim must be submitted within ninety (90) days of the date on which your insurance is canceled for any reason. A separate claim form must be filled out for each member of your family for whom you are making claim. The dentist's statement on this form, or any bills supporting your claim, must show the patient's name, dates and nature of the treatment and the charge. If the total cost associated with proposed dental work is $500 or more, a Treatment Plan must be submittedto the insurer as explained in Section 9. You should have your dentist complete a claim form setting out details as to the proposed treatment and the cost and send this form to the insurance company for their review. You will then be advised as to the charges, or portion thereof, which the insurer considers eligible for benefits. Upon completion of the dental treatment you again submit a claim to receive payment of the approved benefits.
Failure to see your doctor promptly or to submit your claim together with the doctor's or dentist‘s report or other itemized statements within the above time limits will result in the rejection of your claim.

Within two (2) months of ratification all employees shall complete the necessary forms to enable the carrier to implement this process. Failure to complete the necessary forms shall result in postponement of payment of any benefit claims submitted until such times as the forms are satisfactorily completed.

Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits provided by the Labatt Retirement Plan (LRP).
1.	Eligibility For Membership
A new employee becomes a member of the Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the attainment of seniority and his/her seniority date will then be established as his/her date of employment for purposes of this Plan.
You will be advised when you are eligible and are enrolled as a member and you will be asked to submit proof of your age.
2.	Contributions
You are not requiredto make contributionsto the Plan in respect of your service after January 1, 1974, Any required contributions which you have made in respect of service before January 1, 1974 remain to your credit in the Plan and will be applied to provide benefits in respect of your service before January 1, 1974.
98
The Company contributes whatever amount is necessary, along with the required contributions made by employees in respect of service before January 1, 1974, to provide the benefits called for under the Plan.

Normal retirement is at age 65. Your pension commences as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following your 65th birthday.
4.	Service And Credited Service
Your service to qualify for certain of the benefits under the Plan is the total number of years from your date of employment as established under the Plan to the date on which you retire, die or terminate service.
The number of years of your "credited" service determines the amount of pension you are entitled to receive. Credited service is calculated as explained below:
a)	From January 1, 1974 you receive a credit of one year for 1800 or more hours of work in a calendar year while a member of the Plan or a prorated partial year of credit for less than 1800 hours. For example, if while a member of the Plan you work only 900 hours in a year, your credit for that year will be one-half year (900 divided by 1800). If you are absent due to disability, you will receive service credits for any periods during which you are totally disabled and receive weekly indemnity or long term disability insurance benefits or
99
W.S.I.B. payments, but in no event will you receive more than one year of credited service for any one calendar year.
b)	Your credited service for the period from January 1, 1958 to December 31, 1973 is the number of years for which you have made the required contributions to the Plan.
c)	If you were a member of a previous company pension plan before January 1, 1958 when the Labatt Retirement Plan became effective, your credited service to December 31, 1957 is the period from your date of employment to December 31, 1957 but excluding any periods when you were eligible to but did not contribute to the previous plan.

In addition you will receive any pensionwhich is payable to you under a previous plan (see Section 16) and any statutory pension (such as CPP and OAS) which is payable to you under government plans. You may also qualify for a supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan under the minimum pension provision explained in Section 7.
7.	Minimum Pension At Normal Retirement
If you retire at age 65 with at least 25 years of credited service you are entitled to a minimum monthly pension from Company plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined of:

b)	$3,256	if you	retire	on or after January 1,	2005;
cj	$3,306	if you	retire	on or after January 1,	2007;
d)	$3,356	if you	retire	on or after January 1,2008;
These amounts represent the minimum monthly pension payable from Company Plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined before allowing for the provision of a spousal survivor pension. The Company pension will be adjusted to provide a survivor pension unless the spouse who will benefit from that survivor pension waives their right to receive it in writing.
102
You will receive a minimum lifetime pension supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan equal to the amount, if any, required to be added to your accrued basic pension from all Company plans and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits determined at the date of your retirement to provide the above minimum monthly pension.
If you retire at age 65 with less than 25 years of credited service, the minimum lifetime pension supplement shall be determined as above except that the minimum monthly pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit shall first be prorated by the ratio of the number of years of credited service to 25 years.
To determine what, if any, amount of supplement is needed, your basic pension from Company plans is the basic amount payable before the amount of the survivorship pension is calculated, and your CPP pension is the amount you are entitled to receive when you first become eligible at Normal Retirement Age, whether or not you actually make application for such benefits, but disregarding any increase in your CPP pension after its date of commencement.
8.	Special Early Retirement
If you are age 60 or over and you have 25 or more years of credited service you may elect Special Early Retirement in which case you will be entitled to an immediate accrued basic pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of early retirement, without reductionfor your earlier age of retirement.
This pension will be supplemented by an amount necessary to provide the minimum monthly pension amounts set out below, until you first become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits:
103
a)	$2,704	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2002;
b)	$2,904	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2005;
c)	$2,954	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2007;
d)	$3,004	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2008;
Once you become eligible to receive unreducedCanada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65), the supplement will be recalculated as the amount required to be added to your accrued basic pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, determined as at the actual date of your retirement, to produce the following monthly pensions:
a)	$3,056	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2002;
b)	$3,256	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2005;
c)	$3,306	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2007;
d)	$3,356	if you	retire on or after January 1,	2008;
(Once again, both sets of figures above do not take account of the reduction required to produce a survivor option for the surviving spouse.)
This recalculatedsupplement shall become your lifetime supplement.
In addition to this recalculated lifetime supplement, you may be entitled to receive a further supplement commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following your 65th birthday. This further supplement will represent the amount, if any, necessary to produce a total pension from Company plans equal to the pension that would be payable if you were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension above and full unreducedCanada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, your accrued pension including any escalation thereof and your related
104
credited service at the date of your retirement. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of your lifetime supplement.
For employees who retired prior to January 1, 2002 under the SER Retirement provisions and who are eligible to have their pensions recalculated upon attaining age 65, the following schedule of pension amounts shall be treated as the minimum pension at normal retirement date:
a)	$2,856	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1,2002;
b)	$2,956	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1, 2003;
c)	$3,056	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1,2004;
d)	$3,156	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1,2005;
e)	$3,256	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1,2006;
f)	$3,306	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1,2007;
g)	$3,356	if	you	attain	age	65	on	or	after
January 1, 2008;
9.	85 Point Retirement
A member retiring on or after January 1, 1991 and after having attained age 55 and whose age plus years of credited service total 85 or more (but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement) is entitled to an immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of accrued vested pension to his credit for service to date of early retirement.
105

Once a member becomes eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65) and in addition to the lifetime supplement, a member who retires under this provision (85 Point Retirement) will be paid a further supplement, if necessary, to produce a total pension from Company Plans equal to the pension that would be payable if the member were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreducedCanada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, they accrued pension including any escalation thereof and his/her related credited service. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of the member's lifetime supplement.

In addition, you will be entitled to receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 65 on the date of your retirement, but using your current'unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension, all determined as at your actual date of retirement.
This lifetime supplement so calculated will also be reduced by 1/3% for each month (i.e. 4% per year) you are under age 65 when your pension commences.
11.	Disability Retirement (Before Age 65)
As long as you are eligible to receive disability benefits under the Group Insurance Plan you will receive service and basic pension credits under the Labatt Retirement Plan and you will not be retired. However, if you become partially disabled and you do not qualify for insurance
107
benefits you may qualify for Disability Retirement. Retirement under this provision requires that:
a)	you are at least age 50 and have completed 10 years of service,
and
b)	you are certified to be partially disabled and thereby prevented from performing any work available with the Company,
and
c)	it is mutually agreed by you and by the Company that you be retired under the Disability Retirement provision.
On retirement under the disability provision you are entitled to an immediate pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of disability retirement without reduction for your earlier age of retirement. In addition, until you qualify for the earlier of receipt of CPP disability benefits or the attainment of age 65, you will receive a monthly disability supplement equal to $14.00 multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to 30 years.

12.	DEATH AFTER RETIREMENT
Your vested accrued basic pension and minimum supplements are payable to you for as long as you live and cease as of the first day of the month in which your death occurs. However, should you die within 36 months
108
of the date you retire and commence receiving your pension, your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement will continue to your beneficiary until a combined total of 36 monthly payments have been made to you and your beneficiary.
A plan member with an eligible spouse who takes Normal, Special Early, 85 Point, Disabilityor Other Early retirementon or after January 1, 1994, shall receive a joint and survivor pension, unless the member delivers to the PlanAdministrator (through your Human Resources Office) a written waiver of such entitlement in the prescribed form within the 12 month period immediately preceding the commencement of the payment of the pension benefit.
Unless the joint and survivor pension is waived, your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be reduced by 10% during your lifetime. Effective for retirements on and after January 1, 2002, this 10% reduction has been revised as follows:
a)	If you are first employed after 2001 (i.e. if all your credited service was accrued in respect of periods of employment after 2001), the reduction does not apply to you, subject to an actuarial reduction if your spouse is more than 10 years younger than yourself.
b)	If you have credited service which was accrued in respect of periods of employment prior to 2002, the reduction will be calculated as 10% multiplied by the ratio of A to B, where:
A. is your credited service (to a maximum of 25 years) minus the lesser of your credited service accrued in respect of employment after December 31,2001 and 25 years; and
109
B,	is your credited service (to a maximum of 25
years),subject to a further actuarial reduction if your spouse is more than 10 years younger than yourself.
Upon your death, your eligible surviving spouse shall receive a pension of 60% of your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any.
13.	Death Before Retirement
Ifyou should die on or after January 1,1996, while inthe service of the Company and after you have reached age 55 and have 10 years of service, your eligible surviving spouse will receive a pension for his/her remaining lifetime. His/her pension will be equal to the amount of pension they would have receivedfrom the Plan had you retired as of your date of death and elected a reduced joint survivorship pension based on your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement (without the actuarial reduction, if any), but their pension will be subject to a reduction if they are more than 10 years younger than you. Pension payments to your eligible surviving spouse are guaranteed to return any required contributions you have made to the Plan with interest to your date of death.
The lifetime supplement will be calculated as if you had attained age 65 on the date of your death, butusingyour current unreduced accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of your actual date of death.
If you die before your pension commences and your spouse is not entitled to a pension as explained in the preceding paragraph, any contributions you have made with interest to your date of death will be paid to the beneficiary you have named or, failing such, to your estate. You may change your beneficiary from time to
110
time as permitted by law by completing a form which is available from your Human Resources office.
The death benefit paid above shall not be less than provided in existing pension legislation.
14.	If You Leave The Company
If your service is terminated on or after January 1, 1996 (other than by retirement or death) and if you have completed at least two (2) years of credited service with the Company, you will be entitled to a deferred monthly pension at age 65 equal to the accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement to your credit.
Instead of this deferred pension entitlement you may elect to transfer the commuted value of your pension to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial Locking-In Requirements.
If you were a member of the Plan before January 1, 1974, when your service is terminated you may either,
leave all of your contributions in the Plan and receive at age 65 a monthly pension equal to the basic pension to your credit December 31, 1973, which is included in the pension referredto above, or
withdraw your contributions plus interest to your date of termination of service in which case you forfeit your credited service to December 31,
1973, and any pension in respect of such service, which is included in the pension referredto above.
Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial locking-in requirements.
15.	Escalation Of Pension After Retirement
If you retired priorto January 1,1996 from the service of the Company pursuantto any of the types of retirement
111
a)
b)
listed above, your pension will be reviewedfrom January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the percentageincrease in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
If you retire on or after January 1, 1996 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension and lifetime supplement will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
Any spousal pension will also be escalated applying the same formula, with the first increase occurring on the January 1st following your death.
16.	Previous Plans (before January 1, 1958)
If you were a member of a previous Company pension plan (Government Annuity and / or Trust Plan) in effect before January 1, 1958, your benefits from that plan are payable in accordance with the provisions of that previous plan and are in addition to the benefit you receive from the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Since your period of membership in the previous plan is included in determining your total credited service, any basic pension to your credit under the previous plan is taken into account in determining the amount of any minimum pension supplement you are entitled to receive. Since your pension from the previous plan will be actuarially reduced if you retire before age 65, your basic LRP pension will include an amount equal to the difference between your actuarially reduced previous plan pension and the amount of basic previous plan pension at age 65 reduced by the same factors as are
112
applicableto your LRP pension as explained in Section 8, 9,10 or 11 as the case may be.
For these purposes your basic previous plan pension has been determined and fixed as that amount of pension payable from age 65 and guaranteed for a minimum of 5 years which would be available in accordance with the terms of the previous plan in effect at December 31, 1957, but excluding any pension purchased by voluntary contributions you may have made to that plan. Any increase in the amount of your Government Annuity which has resulted from an increase in interest rate from 1975 is not considered as a part of your basic previous plan pension and would be payable as an extra benefit over and above your basic pension.
After retirementyour total basic pension which is subject to escalation as explained in Section 15 includes the amount of basic previous plan pension determined as explained above.
17.	Other Information
Annual Statement - You will receive a statement following each calendar year end showing the amount of benefits to your credit under the Plan.
Benefits Not Assignable - The benefits provided under the Plan are not assignable except as is specifically provided with respect to death benefits nor may you borrow against them at any time. Similarly, except as specifically provided at termination of service or in connection with death, no benefit can be surrendered.
Eligible Surviving Spouse - Your spouse is eligible for a surviving spouse's pension under Section 12 cr 13 provided you have been married for at least one year before your retirement or death, whichever is earlier. Under certain
a)
b)
c)
113
circumstancesa common-law spouse may qualify and the Human Resources Department will answer your questions in this respect.
jj)	Income Tax-All pension payments received from
Company pension plans are considered as income for tax purposes in the year in which received. YourCPP andOAS pensions must also be reported as taxable income when you file your annual tax return. Similarly, all monies received in lump sum withdrawals or death benefits must be declared as income for tax purposes in the year in which received and are taxable unless such monies are transferred to a registered retirement savings plan.
18.	Government Pension Plans
Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan(CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits payable under the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Under current legislation your CPP pension is payable when you reach age 65, or as early as age 60 on a reduced basis. The amount of your CPP pension is dependent upon the amount of your earnings on which you have made CPP contributions and the period during which you contributed. To illustrate, an employee who retires at age 65 in 2002 and who is entitled to maximum benefits under the Canada Pension Plan receives a pension of $788.75 per month when he retires. After CPP pension commences it is subject to adjustment each following January 1 st depending upon increases in the Consumer Price Index.
Your OAS pension is also payable from age 65 but if you take up residence outside Canada your OAS pension may be discontinued unless you have been a Canadian resident for a prescribed number of years. If you plan to move out of Canada you should check into these
114
requirements. The amount of OAS pension is subjectto quarterly adjustment upward if the Consumer Price Index increases. In January, 2002 the OAS pensionwas $442.66 per month.
Your spouse will also receive OAS pension benefits payable from age 65 subject to the same residency requirements specified above.
Application must be made to receive benefits from the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security and the applications should be filed six (6) months in advance of your date of eligibility for such pensions to ensure prompt commencement of your benefits. As well as retirement pensions, the Canada Pension Plan provides certain disability, death and survivor benefits and further information can be obtained from your local Canada Pension Plan Office.
19.	Pension Examples
The following examples have been based on the Labatt Retirement Plan provisions as amended January 1, 2002 and assume the employee is credited with at least 1800 hours in each year until retirement. Minimum pension supplements are determined by taking into accountthe actual CPP benefit which a retiree receives at age 65.
115
Example 'A:	Normal Retirement Pension
(65years of age with 25 years of credited service)
This example is based on a member who retires on July 1, 2002 at age 65 with 25.00 years of credited service.
Normal Retirement Pension
This member is entitled to receive a minimum monthly pension of $3,056 from the Company and CPP plans. For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member’s actual CPP entitlement.
From age 65, the member’s monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement CPP (as in 2002)
Total monthly pension from Labatt pension and CPP Add OAS pension (as in 2002)
Total monthly income at age 65
$ 2,267.25 788.75 $ 3,056.00 442.66 $ 3,498.66
The Labatt Normal Retirement Pension and Lifetime Supplement is payable for the life of the member with 36 monthly payments guaranteed.
116
Example‘B’:	Surviving Spouse's Pension
This example is based on a married member who retires as in 'Example A' and dies shortly after retirement.
The pension accrued from January 1, 2002 is subject to improved spousal benefits. For the pension accrued prior to January 1, 2002, the basic pension and lifetime supplement are reduced by 10% to provide the 60% spousal benefit. For the pension accrued from January 1, 2002, the 10% reduction has been eliminated. V\fe have used the basic pension and lifetime supplement from "Example A". We assume that the spouse is less than 10 years younger than the retiree. If the spouse is more than 10 years younger than the retiree, there is a further actuarial reduction in the member's and spouse's pension for pension accrued prior to and after January 1,2002.
Total Surviving Spouse's Pension
The member's monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement $2,267.25
Prior to January 1, 2002, the employee has 24.50 years of credited service
From January 1,2002, the employee has 0.50 years of credited service
Pension accrued to January 1, 2002:
24.50/25 x $2,267.25:
Pension accrued from January 1, 2002:

Inaddition, if the surviving spouse is age 65 or over, theywould qualify for the OAS monthly benefit of $442.66.
*This assumes that the spouse is age 65 or older. The amount of CPP spousal pension depends on the spouse’s age at the time f the member’s death.
118
Example ‘C’:	Normal Retirement Pension with less than
25 Years Credited Service (65 years of age)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1,2002 at age 65 with 20 years of credited service.
Total Normal Retirement Pension with less than 25 Years Credited Service
At age 65, the member is entitled to a supplement to provide a pro-rata minimum pension. Forthe purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member's actual CPP entitlement.
Minimum pension in 2002 for 25 or more years of credited service
Subtract CPP pension (as in 2002)

Example ‘D’:	Special Early Retirement
(60 or more years of age and 25 or more years of credited service)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1, 2002 at age 64 with 25 years of credited service.
Total Special Early Retirement Pension
At age 64, the member’s pension is calculated as follows:
Minimum total Labatt basic pension, lifetime
and temporary supplement (assuming the member
does not elect the 90/60% spousal option)	$2,704.00
One year later, on January 1,2003, the member’s pension is recalculated at age 65 as follows:
Minimum total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement	$2,312.60
Estimated2003 CPP	804.53
Minimumtotal monthly income from Labatt pension
and CPP	$3,117.13
Add estimated2003 OAS pension	451.51
Total monthly income at age 65	$3,568.64
*As in Example 'E', minimum pension determined on retirement date of January 1,2002 (i.e. $2267.25). Estimated pension on January! 2003 calculated assuming maximum escalation of 2% per year from age 64 to age 65. **
**Assumes member elects to start receiving his CPP pension at age 65.
120
Example ‘E’:	85 Point Retirement
(at least age 55, and age plus credited service add up to 85 points or more)
This example is based on a member who retires as of January 1, 2002 at 59 years of age with 27 years of credited service.
Total85 Point Retirement Pension
For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member's actual CPP entitlement. From age 59 to age 65, the member's monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Minimum monthly pension in 2002 for 25 or more
years of credited service	$3,056.00
Subtract 2002 CPP	$788.75
Total monthly company lifetime pension from age
59 to age 65	($2,267.25)
(assuming the member does not elect the 90%/60% spousal option)
In addition, as he has over 25 years of credited service, and has 85 points, he may qualify for the M.F.R.A. through payroll*
Minimum monthly pension to age 65:	$2,704.00
Subtract company pension from Labatt from
age 59 to 65	f$2.267.251

age 65	$ 436.75
(payable to age 65 or death of member, whichever is earlier)
Total monthly company pension from Labatt
from age 59 to age 65	$2,704.00
121
(Example ‘E' continued)
From age 65, in year 2008, the member's monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime
supplement	$2,467.74
Add estimated CPP in year 2008	$888.26
Total from Company plan and CPP	$3,356.00
(equal to the Normal Retirement pension for the year 2008)
At age 65, hisM.F.R.A. will cease, and he will be eligible for an Old Age Security benefit of approximately:
$498.51 monthly
Total monthly incomeat age 65	$3,854.51
*see Letter of Understanding#!8 for conditions **
**Assumes escalation is less than the maximum of 2% per year from age 59 to age 65 (i.e. low inflation). If we assume the pension increases at the maximum escalation of 2% (high inflation), the estimated pension payable in 2008 would be $2553.29.
122
Example‘F’:	Early Retirement
	(age 55 with 20 years of service)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1, 2002 at the age of 55 with 20 years of credited service.
Total Early Retirement Pension
If the member had retired at age 65, he would be entitled to a pro-rata minimum pension. For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member's actual CPP entitlement.
The pro-rata minimum pension would be calculated as follows:
Minimum pension for 25 or more years of credited service in 2002
Subtract2002 CPP
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 25 years of credited service
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 20 years of credited service [20/25 x 2,267.25]
At retirement (age 55) the member is entitled to his/her total basic pension as shown above reduced by 4% for each year before his/her normal retirement age. Inthis example, the pensionwould be reduced by 4% for each of the 10 years prior to age 65. Therefore, his/her pensionwould be reduced by 40%
Total pension from the Company plan	$1,813.80
Reduction of 40% of Company pension at age 65	725.52
Total monthly incomefrom age55	$1,088.28
At age 65, the member's monthly retirement income would be as follows:

‘Estimated pension assumes maximum escalation of 2% per year from age 55 to age 65
**ln order to collect the maximum CPP pension at age 65, a member must have made the maximum CPP contributions for ten years prior to age 65. This example assumes that as the member retired at age 55, no CPP contributions are made for the 10 years prior to age 65. As such, it is estimated that this member would receive the CPP pension as at 2002.

Re: Performance - Based Wage Adjustment (PBWA) Program
1.	Introduction
At negotiations, the Company and Union agreed that all Regularemployeesinthe London bargaining unit should have the opportunity to earn up to as much as $1.00 to be added to the base hourly rates (as described below) duringthe period from date of ratification until October 1, 2003. While the targets for attainment of the PBWA are measured for operations in the Brewing and Packaging Departments, it is recognized that employees in all Departments have both a stake in the results and an opportunity to inf luence the outcome of the PBWA program. Any part of this $1.00 increase which has not been earned (as described below) by October 1, 2003 will be forfeited and no further opportunity to earn any part of this increase will be granted.
2.	Targets
The three (3) targets for each period are described on the attached schedule.
3.	P.B.W.A. Increments and Periods
For each of the 5 periods outlined below, where all 3 set targets are met in a particular period, an increment of 20 cents ($0.20) for that period will be
139
Letterof Understanding No. #10
Cont’d.	Page 2	May 3,2002
added to all Regular employees base hourly rates.
In addition, a further 3 cent per period increment will be added to the hourly rate for employees receiving the Trades " A Differential where the 3 targets are met. If only one of the canning or bottling efficiency targets is missed in any period and the brewing productivity target is met, a blended calculation as described in Section A on the attached Schedule will be performed to determine whether the increment for that period is payable.
The periods to be used for the P.B.W.A. program are as follows:
Period #1 - June 17, 2001 to September 30, 2002. If targets achieved, 20 cents ($0.20) added to base rates on October 1,2002.
Period #2 - October 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002. If targets are achieved, 20 cents ($0.20) added to base rates on January 1, 2003

As stated above, if in any of the 5 periods, the targets for payment of the increment are not met, the PBWA increments for that period will not be paid.
However, in order to enable employees to earn any missed increments, on October 1, 2003 the Company will perform the calculation in Section B of the attached Schedule to determine whether missed increments will be paid.
Multiple missed increments may be added to base rates on October 1,2003.
If, as a result of the Earn-back calculation, no missed increments are payable there will be no further opportunity to earn back such payments after September 30, 2003. There will be no pro-ration of missed P.B.W.A. incrementsas a result of the Earn-back calculation.

Re: Group Leader Program Philosophy and Term
It is the Company's intention to provide opportunities to employees to function as Group Leaders (selection will be based on ability). These positions provide relief for vacation, sickness, training, seasonal line-loading requirements and mutually agreed-upon special projects.

A Group Leader term is defined as four (4) years. Should the position continue to be required, Group Leader positions will be posted upon the expiry of the four (4) year term. A posting will be put up immediately after ratification to replace existing Group Leaders who have been in place more than the four (4) year term if the Company continues to need that Group Leader position filled.
Upon completion of any term, and providing a need exists, a new posting will initiated. Employees with Group Leader experience may re-apply, however, preference will be given to new applicants who possess the required qualifications.
Training
The department will clearly review the position requirements and training needs with the successful candidate.

Re: Manpower Force Reduction Allowance (M.F.R. A.)
The following represents our agreement with respect to the payment of a M.F.R.A. by the Company to certain employees who qualify for and take 85 Point Retirement during the period in which they are in receipt of 85 Point Retirement pension benefits. It is understood that the M.F.R.A. is only available to employees who elect to retire during the term of the Collective Agreement.
The M.F.R.A. will not be paid to any employee who qualifies for and takes his pension at Normal Retirement Date, or an S.E.R, Other Early or Disability Retirement pension. Moreover, an employee who is in receipt of any separation, severance or other periodic payments which are designed to bridge him/her to pension benefits shall not be entitled to receive the Allowance while in receipt of such benefits. If an employee takes his separation pay in a lump sum, he/she shall not be eligible to receive the Allowance for the period represented by the number of weeks of separation pay he/she has received commencing from the date his/her employment is terminated and regardless as to whether he/she is in receipt of 85 Point Retirement Benefits. It is understood and agreed that the payment of this M.F.R.A. is made solely from Company operating revenues and that no part of this Allowance shall be treated as a pension benefit payable out of the pension plan.
156
Letter of Understanding No. 18
Cont’d.	- Page 2 -	January 23,1996
Each year of the Collective Agreement some employees will be eligible for the Allowance based on any of the following combinations of age at retirement and completed years of credited service.
Age at Retirement 		Minimum Completed Years of Credited Service
55	30
56	29
57	28
58	27
59	26
The amount of the M.F.R.A. paid to qualifying employees by the Company shall be determined as at the date of retirement. The initial benefit which an employee is entitled to at date of retirement shall not increase for any reason during the period in which he/she is entitled to receive the Allowance. In no case shall benefits be paid subsequent to the date which an employee commences to receive his/her pension at Normal Retirement Date.
No other combination of age and minimum years of credited service other than those listed above will qualify an employee for a M.F.R.A. However, in the event of a brewery closure the M.F.R.A. will be allowed to those qualifying employees in the closing brewery only who have 85 points composed of a minimum age of fifty-five (55) at the time of closure and may not have the required twenty-five (25) years of minimum service that would normally be required.
The monthly allowance to be paid to qualifying employees shall be calculated as follows:
157
Letter of Understanding No. 18
Cont’d.	-Page 3-	January 23,1996
a)	$2,704 if you	retire on	or after January 1,	2002;

c)	$2,954 if you	retire on	or after January 1,	2007;
d)	$3,004 if you	retire on	or after January 1,	2008;
For greater certainty, the 85 Point Retirement Pension shall be determined as of the employee’s 85 Point Retirement Date in accordance with Section 9, of Appendix B and shall not be adjusted for the 10% reduction pursuant to Section 12 of Appendix B or for any other applicable reduction.
Since the Allowance does not form part of the Pension Plan for Labatt Wage Employees, no payments by the Company on account of the Allowance will be made to the employees surviving spouse in the event that the employee dies while in receipt of the monthly Allowance.
Finally, we agreed that the Company would deduct the total amount of M.F.R.A. benefits paid to employees from any gratuitous general enhancement fund given to the Union for its use by the Company in the event of a plant closure.
This letter and obligations arising hereunder shall expire and cease to have binding effect from and after December 31, 2008, providedthat any employee who commenced to receive benefits hereunder prior to December 31, 2008 shall continue to receive benefits as stipulated herein.

Re: Brewery Closure/Transfer Rights
During negotiationsthere were extensive discussions between the parties concerning the possibility of a plant closure during the life of the Agreement. The parties agreed to the following items in the event that the Company closes the London plant during the term of this Collective Agreement.
1.	The Company will announce a tentative date for the plant closure ("the closure date"). Following this announcement, a determination will be made as to the eligibility of London employees to transfer to vacant jobs in Toronto as follows.
Eligibility for Transfer
All London plant seniority employees will be eligible to transfer to vacant jobs in Toronto or to be added to the Toronto seniority list as recall list employees except for the following groups of employees:
1.	Any employee who, on the closure date, is or who will be sixty-five (65) years of age i.e.: N.R.D. pension age.
2.	In the event that the Company decides to maintain a London-based transport fleet, and/or garage and/or warehouse, any employees who are required by the Company to continue working in Distribution and/or Staging in London.
3.	Any employee who, at the date of the closure announcement is in receipt of L.T.D. benefits or who has
159
Letter of Understanding No. 19,
Cont'd.	-Page 2-	January 1,2002
been continuously in receipt of Workers' Compensation benefits for the six (6) month (or longer) period immediately preceding the date of such announcement until the employee is fully recovered and able to do the normal duties of the plant.
Those employees remainingwho are not disqualified as set out above will have the following options:
1.	Elect to take separation pay under the collective agreement and terminate their employment without any further entitlements:
or
2.	Transferto the Toronto seniority list as an active or recall list employee.
General
An employee who takes separation pay in equal weekly installments may continue to accrue pension credits for the period he is in receipt of weekly severance payments. However, this pension credit accrual shall not be available to an employee who takes the M.F.R.A.
Conditions Upon Transfer
An employee who elects to transfer to Toronto, whether as an active or a recall list employee at the time of transfer shall irrevocably forfeit his/her right to separation pay under the collective agreement based on his/her years of service at the London plant.
Such employee will carry his/her company service to Toronto for the purpose of determining future vacation entitlement and vacation bonus and group insurance, sick leave, GWP credits and pension benefit and eligibility and entitlement;
160
Letter of Understanding No. 19,
Cont’d.	- Page 3 -	January 1,2002
In the year of transfer, such employee will carry his/her unused entitlementto vacation pay, vacation bonus, sick pay and GWP credits to Toronto and shall be paid such accrued entitlements as if he/she had been employed in Torontothroughoutthe year. In no case, however, shall the employee be entitled to receive more than the annual entitlement that he/she would have received had the employee been employed in London for the entire year. An employee who is transferred after the close of the vacation selection period shall be treated as if he/she failed to choose his/her preferred vacation weeks.
In the event that the transferring employee is not immediately actively employed in Toronto or is laid off in Toronto following a period of active employment, he/she shall be permittedto draw GWP benefits to the extent that he/she so qualifies pursuantto the provisions of the GWP.
Establishment of Seniority in Toronto
The parties agree that transferring employees should carry their London seniority to Toronto for layoff, recall and vacation selection purposes as amongst themselves and accordingly, the date that a transferring employee commenced to work in Toronto shall not be relevant for purposes of establishing seniority ranking. Once all of the transferred employees have arrived in Toronto, the Company will publish a seniority list which shall rank the transferred employees in order of their London plant seniority. However, once an employee has transferred to Toronto and has completed any necessary training on his/her newjob, he/she shall not be displaced from such job by a subsequently transferred senior employee unless the subsequent senior transferee must displace the junior employee from that job in order to avoid a layoff. In such case, the senior employee seeking to displace the junior employee may do so in accordance with the layoff language of the collective agreement.
161
Letter of Understanding No. 19,
Cont’d.	- Page 4 -	January 1, 2002
WorkAssianments/Qualifications
With the exception of tradesmen, all transferring employees shall be employed in the Packaging Department unless vacancies in other positions exist at the time of the transfer for which transferees are then qualified.
At the time of the transfer, a qualified transferee shall be permitted to displace a temporary employee who is employed in the same Department as the transferee was in London. Furthermore, a qualified transferee shall be awarded a vacant position in his/her former Department in preference to a senior unqualified transferee.
Selection for skilled trades positions shall be made on the basis of seniority provided the individual has the demonstrated skills, ability and qualifications and the Company will retain the right to evaluate them.
Tradesmen who transfer shall be employed in the appropriate trades function unless no vacancies exist in their trade in which case they shall be employed in the Packaging Department.
Creation of Vacancies
Voluntary Resignation
]n a further attempt to create vacancies for eligible employees who wish to transfer from the closed Ontario plant, the Company will offer a voluntary resignation bonus on or before the tentative date announced for the plant closure.
An employee who elects to accept such voluntary resignation bonus shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equivalent to twenty weeks pay (i.e. 800 hours multiplied by his/her straight time hourly rate). Such employee who elects voluntary resignation pursuant to the Company's offer, shall be terminated on a date determined by the Company and shall have no further rights or entitlements.

Re: Staging Department Manpower
During negotiations,the Company and Union held discussions concerning the operation of the London Staging Department. As a result of those discussions, the following will be implemented.
So long as London Warehousing continues to be operated by Labatt at current levels, the Company will commit to employ a minimum number of thirty-eight (38) seniority employees (including those on Wl, WSIB or LTD). In light of this commitment, the Company shall be entitled to use Temporary employees on a year round basis.
Subjectto the paragraphs above and below this paragraph, the Company will replace seniority employees who attrit out of the bargaining unit with temporary employees during the life of the collective agreement.
The Company's commitments above with respect to the maintenance of a minimum of thirty-eight (38) seniority employees, are based on current volume levels in the packaging, brewing, transportation and warehouse departments at the London Brewery, and the present state of technology in the Departments. In the event that plant or distribution volume levels experience a significant decrease from the present levels, or the Company introduces new or modified equipment or processes, which significantly alters manpower requirements, the above commitments will be modified following discussions between the parties to reflect the changed circumstance. Nothing in this letter is intended to

The parties also held discussions concerning the possibility that, during the life of the collective agreement, the Company might make a decision which would significantly impact our present warehousing method.
We agreed that where the Company was contemplating such an initiative and where the implementationof such an initiative would result in the permanent layoff of seniority employees, the Union would be given at least sixty (60) days notice
prior to the implementationof such a decision. The Company also agreed that, at the Union's request, it will meet with the Union for the purpose of discussing the Union's position with respect to the staffing of such a facility. This meeting will take place prior to the implementationof any final decision made on this subject.

Employees who want to work more than the equivalent of forty (40) hours will be accommodated having regard to the economic consequences to the Company, it being understood that the Company reserves the right to contract out loads.

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company from continuing to employ Temporary Drivers on a year round basis as needs require.
So long as Distribution(Transport) continues to be operated by the Company at current levels the Company will honor the above commitment to employ the minimum number of twenty (20) Regular and ROG Transport Drivers.
The Company's commitments above with respect to the maintenance of a minimum of twenty (20) Regular and ROG Transport Drivers, are based on current volume levels in the packaging, brewing, transportation and warehouse departments at the London Brewery, and the present state of technology in the Departments. In the event that plant or distribution volume levels experience a significant decrease from the present levels, or the Company introduces new or modified equipment or processes, which significantly alters manpower requirements, the above commitments will be modified following discussions between the parties to reflect the changed circumstance. Nothing in this letter is intended to affect the Company's right to contract work out or to transfer work to other Company operations. For greater clarity, the Company may contract work out and reduce the complement of employees below the minimum levels stipulated above.
