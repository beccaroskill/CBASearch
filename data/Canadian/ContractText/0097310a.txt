Section 6: Rate Revision
(a)	The Wage Scale attached hereto, Supplement No. 1, is approved by both Parties and may, subject to the mutual consent of both Parties be revised once annually.

(b)	Where it is found that an over rate is being paid, and the Employer wishes to continue paying the over rate to the individual presently holding the job, it must do so with the understanding that the only time that the over rate can be taken away is when there is a change in personnel on that particular job, at which time the contract rate shall apply.

However, where the provision of a hot meal is considered impractical, Employees will be paid the equivalent of one (1) hour's pay at rate and one-half in lieu of both the hot meal and the time required to consume the meal.
For the purpose of this agreement rate and one-half will be calculated at the regular hourly rate of pay the Employee is receiving for the overtime work being performed.

Section 3: Probationary Period
(a)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it shall be mutually agreed that all Employees are hired on probation; the probationary period to continue for thirty (30) working days during which time they are to be considered temporary workers only and during this same period no seniority rights shall be recognized. Upon completion of thirty (30) working days, they shall be regarded as regular Employees, and shall then be entitled to seniority dating from the day on which they entered the Company's employ, provided however, that the probationary period of thirty (30) working days shall only be cumulative within the three (3) calendar months following the date of entering employment. Days spent fire fighting will not be included as days of probation.
20
It is agreed that probationary Employees will have preference over Casual Employees for any work performed during the normal work week, subject to competency.
It is further agreed that in the application of (i) above, probationary Employees will be called in for work in accordance with their hiring date, unless such call-in is beyond the control of the Employer, and is subject to the Employee being competent to perform the work. This obligation does not apply where the Employee cannot be readily contacted or where the Employee has already worked one shift in the 24-hour period.
Section 4: Hiring Preference
When hiring new Employees, consideration for preference shall, subject to the same conditions as in Section 1, be given to those Employees of the Company having had previous seniority and who have applications on file.

(ii)
(a)	In the event of a reduction of the forces, the last person hired shall be the first released subject to the competency of the person involved and the provisions of Section 1.
(b)	Where a reduction of forces is caused by emergency conditions, the application of seniority as agreed to under Section 2 may be postponed for such periods as may be necessary, but not exceeding three (3) working days. If the Company decides to exercise its rights under this provision, it shall notify the Committee as soon as possible.
(c)	Subject to the provisions of the Job Posting and Seniority Supplement as referred to in Section 2(a) above, during a reduction of forces where an Employee's seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his regular job, he may elect to apply his seniority to obtain a job paying a higher rate subject to the competency of the person involved and the provisions of Section 1.
(d)	During a reduction of forces where an Employee's seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his regular job, he may elect whether or not to apply his seniority to obtain a lower paid job or a job paying the same rate of pay or accept a lay-off until his regular job becomes available, provided however:
(i)	If during the lay-off period the Employee wishes to return to work and so notifies the Company, he shall be called back to work as soon as his seniority entitles him to a job.
(ii)	The application of this provision shall not result in an Employee, in the exercise of his rights, bumping an Employee with less seniority.
21
Section 6: Seniority List
It is agreed that upon request of the Union a list will be supplied by the Company setting out the name and starting date with the Company of each regular Employee. However, such request shall not be granted more than twice during each yearly period September 1st to August 31st. The Company will advise the Union once each month of changes to the said list.

(i)	Delivery of notice either orally or by letter by a Company representative.
(ii)	Local or long-distance telephone communication.
(iii)	Registered letter.
In the case of (i) such oral notice shall be confirmed by a written notice showing date delivered, and the date and time the Employee is to return to work.
In the case of (ii) such telephone communication shall be confirmed the same day by registered letter and shall set out the date and time the Employee is to return to work.
In the case of (iii) which shall be used where it is impossible to use (i) or (ii) above, a period of up to seven (7) days within which the Employee is to return to work will be allowed, provided the Employee replies within ninety-six (96) hours of the sending of the letter in the affirmative.
(b)	The Employee must reply to the call to work within ninety-six (96) hours of the sending of the call to work as in (i) and appear for work at the specified date.

Section 8: Absence Without Leave
22
Any Employee who is absent without leave for a period of more than three (3) consecutive working days, who cannot show just reason for such absence, shall forfeit all seniority rights. This shall not interfere with the Company's right to discharge for proper cause.
Section 9: Supervisor's Return to Bargaining Unit
In any case where an Employee has been transferred by the Company to a supervisory position and at a later date ceases to be a supervisory worker and the Company desires to retain his services, it is hereby agreed that reinstatement can be made within the bargaining unit, provided however, that supervisory workers reinstated in the bargaining unit must return to the job held at the time of their promotion to a supervisory position.
It is understood that the interpretation of this clause made by the Honourable Gordon McGregor Sloan under the Coast Agreement will apply as set out below:
"When an Employee has left, or leaves, the bargaining unit because of promotion to a supervisory position, and who later is reinstated as a member of such bargaining unit because of demotion or reduction in forces, he returns thereto with the seniority he had when an Employee within the bargaining unit. In other words, his seniority is "frozen" at the time he leaves the bargaining unit and ceases to run until his return thereto".
It is agreed, however, that persons transferred out of the bargaining unit for temporary supervisory duty with the Company for a period of not more than four (4) months in each calendar year shall continue to retain their seniority. Employees temporarily transferred out of the bargaining unit will be reinstated in the job they held when they left the bargaining unit without loss of seniority.
Should any special circumstances arise which will require an extension of this provision, same shall be discussed between the Local Union and Management and, if agreement is reached, the period may be extended.
It is agreed that the above understandings shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been written into the actual contract and this Section of Adjustments and Interpretations shall form Supplement No. 2 and be part of the Contract.
Section 10: Retention During Lav-off
Seniority during lay-off shall be retained on the following basis:
(a)	Employees with less than one (1) years' service shall retain their seniority for a period of eight (8) months.
23
(b)	Employees with one (1) or more years' service shall retain their seniority for one (1) year, plus one (1) additional month for each year's service, up to an additional twelve (12) months.
(c)	A laid-off Employee's seniority retention is reinstated on the completion of one day's work.
Section 11: Transfer of Company Seniority
Where Employees of a Company operation covered by the B.C. Southern Interior Master Agreement are offered, and accept, a position in another division of that Company operation covered by the B.C. Southern Interior Master Agreement and successfully complete their probationary period, then their prior Company service date will be applied for annual vacation entitlement and vacation pay and for future severance calculations.
Employees will be entitled to a maximum of one floater per Employee per year in the event of a transfer.

The Employee will be required to furnish proof of Jury Service and Jury Duty pay received.

Supplemental Matters which have been agreed to between the I.F.L.R.A. and United Steelworkers -Negotiating Committee by either a Memorandum of Agreement, Clarification of the Agreement and/or Interpretation of the Agreement.
Interpretation of the Agreement
1.	Clarification of Agreement
Article V - Wages - Section 7 - Shift Differential Clarification
Any Employee who works more than one hour outside of the shift which is recognized as a regular day shift, should be paid night shift differential for all time worked on the overlap shift. This applies to the front end of the shift and/or the back end of the shift.
In other words, if you work a scheduled shift that is more than one hour outside of the regular day shift you should receive night shift differential for the entire hours spent on that shift.
2.	Clarification of Agreement
Article VII - Hours of Work - Double Time on Sunday
There has been considerable discussion in regards to the interpretation of Article VII -Hours of Work, Section 1(b)(ii) and (b)(iv) as it applies to three (3) shift operations where some Employees, who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days, and regularly come in one (1) or two (2) hours early to do preparatory work prior to the start of the first shift on Monday. The pertinent clauses read as follows:
Article VII - Hours of Work
Section 1 (b) - Double straight time shall be paid for the following:
(ii) Hours worked on Sunday by Employees who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days;
(iv)	Item (ii) above shall not apply to Employees who work Sunday as a regularly scheduled day.
Inasmuch as (iv) above was negotiated to apply to Employees who regularly work on a seven (7) day tour, such as Security Guards, Watchmen, Steam Plant Employees, agreement has been reached on the application of Section (iv) above.
85
Where Employees regularly come in late Sunday night to do preparatory work, the Company will pay double straight time rates of pay for those hours worked prior to Sunday midnight. However, the Company reserves the right to either shorten his regular shift to parallel the normal hours of the shift or to require the Employee to work his normal shift at straight time in addition to the time worked prior to Sunday midnight.
For the purpose of this agreement rate and one-half will be calculated at the regular hourly rate of pay the Employee is receiving for the overtime work being performed.
3.	Charge Hands - Negotiated I.F.L.R.A. & United Steelworkers Definition of Charge Hand's Duties
