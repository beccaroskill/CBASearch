ARTICLE 11 DISCIPLINE
11.01	DISCIPLINE DEMERIT
The purpose of the demerit system is to replace the days of suspension without pay with demerit points that can accumulate according to the severity or frequency of the offenses. Those offenses could engender one or the other of the following disciplinary measures; verbal warning, written warning with demerit points, summary procedures, extended suspension and dismissal.
11.02	DEMERIT POINTS EQUIVALENCE
The demerit points will be accumulated according to the disciplinary measures and will have the equivalent values as the following:
Disciplinary measures	Demerit Points	Equivalence
Verbal reprimand	0	Verbal Warning
First written reprimand	2	Written Warning
Second written reprimand	3	8 hour suspension without pay
Third written reprimand	4	16 hour suspension without pay
Fourth written reprimand 5	24 hour suspension without pay
11.03	DEMERIT SYSTEM
Once 14 points of demerit have been accumulated, employees will be subject to dismissal. The Company could, prior to dismissing an employee or in the case of a summary procedure, award an exemplary suspension, such suspension will never be less than three (3) days and will be without pay.
One day of suspension is the equivalent of eight (8) hours of work. In the case of such exemplary measures the days of suspension will be consecutive.
Every month where an employee has effectively worked will be added to the nine (9) months detailed in the following articles.
A copy of all reprimands that resulted in a loss of demerit points will be sent to the Local Union and to the International Office.
When an employee has reached a total of five (5) demerits, nine (9) demerits, and of fourteen (14) demerits, such employee will be met and advise of the status of his file. The Shift Leader will hold the first meeting, the second meeting will be held by the Production Manager, the Human Resources Manager will join the Production Manager for the third meeting. These meetings will be held in the presence of a Union Steward.
.../13
11.04	VERBAL WARNING (NO DEMERIT POINT)
A verbal warning is a note deposited in the employee's file, no copies are distributed. The warning must be pointed out to the employee as soon as possible after the event. The verbal reprimand puts in motion the disciplinary measures. More than one verbal (for different types of offenses) can be handed out, however from the first written reprimand the disciplinary record is progressive.
11.05	FIRST WRITTEN REPRIMAND (TWO (2) DEMERIT POINTS)
Personal reprimand by the Plant Manager, the Production Manager or the Shift Leader where the situation warrants, will be inscribed on the employees record.
Any employee reprimanded and has the reprimand added to their file, may submit their case in accordance with the provisions of the grievance procedures.
11.06	PROGRESSION OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES.
Additional disciplinary measures, in the event of a second offense, provided such offense occurs within a period of nine (9) months from the date of the first written reprimand, will be subject to the provision of article 11.02. In the case where the period exceeds nine (9) months, such reprimand will be considered as a first offense and the total demerits readjusted accordingly.
Additional disciplinary measures in the event of a third or fourth offense up to including dismissal from the employ of the company provided such third or fourth offense occurs within a period of nine (9) months from the date of the second or third offense, such measure will be subject to the provisions of article 11.02 otherwise for the purpose of this article such third or fourth offense shall be deemed to be a first offense and total demerits readjusted accordingly.
11.07	EXEMPLARY SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL
The employee, that accumulates a total of fourteen demerit points within a period of nine (9) months from the date of the first written reprimand, is subject to the disposition of article 11.03. He could be given an exemplary suspension or be dismissed from the company's employ.
11.08	SUMMARY PROCEDURES
In the case of a serious offense at work which severely affects the maintenance of discipline amongst the employees, the company may dispense with the above procedure and the employee be dealt with summarily, including dismissal. It is understood that, considering that both parties shall have equal amount of representation, the company will advise the employee's available steward or union representative(s) who will be given the opportunity of being present to discuss the circumstances of the alleged violation and dismissal at the time such action is taken. Any case dealt with summarily by any official of the company of lower rank than that of the Plant Manager will be subject to revision by the Plant Manager.
11.09	FORMS
The company will give a copy of any disciplinary action inscribed on an employee's record to the department steward in presence and at such time a copy is given to the employee concerned also send a copy to the union. Such notice to the employee, steward and union shall be given not later than six (6) days from the circumstances giving rise to the disciplinary action. Should the employee not be available, the notice will be given to a union representative.
11.10	FORBIDDEN PRACTICE:
1)	The practice by the shift leaders to note personnel records is strictly of the company's and shift leaders' prerogative and will be continued.
2)	No practice, notes, books or files at the floor level dealing with discipline is official and if any, will cease.
3)	No union steward, chief steward, union officer will be called to sign any type of verbal reprimand that could be noted in shift leaders' personnel records.
Since the union receives copies of all official parts of an employee's file and insofar as discipline is concerned, both parties' practices that tend to create misunderstanding are no longer tolerated.

Any employee with twenty-five (25) year's of continuous service with the company is entitled to a fifth week of vacation.
The company will notify the union and the employees as of March 15th of its actual dates of closure for vacation purposes.
The company must advise the union and the employees between January 1st and March 15th each year of its intention of either closing the plant for a two-week period between June 30th and Labour Day for the annual vacation or operate the plant all year long and to schedule the vacations throughout the year. In these circumstances, seniority will be the ruling factor.
The company will then prepare a plan, which will establish the manner to proceed. The vacations will be scheduled throughout the whole year. The vacations will be scheduled as far as possible to coincide with the wishes expressed by the employees taking into consideration the needs of production.
Generally speaking, the employees having more continuous service will have preference over an employee with less continuous service as to the choice of his annual vacations. We will also take the means to suit the married employees who work at the plant and who wish to take their vacations together.
However, an employee who wishes to take his third and fourth vacations consecutive to the annual vacation period, will have to choose whether he will take such weeks before or after the plant vacations.
In order to prepare the vacation schedule and plan, each employee must indicate before March 30th each year his choice for each additional week vacation he is entitled to. The company will post before April 30th the vacation schedule for each employee. The vacation reference year for taking additional week vacation will be from January 1st until the following December 31st.
The vacation pay will be calculated once per year in the month of July. However, any employee who takes a week vacation will receive when leavi ng the equivalent of one week's pay. If he takes two weeks' vacation, he will receive the equivalent of two weeks' pay when leaving. All the adjustments would be made in the month of July. Any employee who takes his vacations after the month of July will have already received all of his vacation pay unless he wishes that the company keeps his money until he takes his vacation.

All changes made by the company concerning measured direct hourly occupations other than those referred to in paragraphs 23.02 and 23.03 are to be settled, if grievances arise, by the following procedure:
Step one:
A review of the grievance is to be made by an industrial engineering representative of the company and a representative of the union. Such review will include an inspection of the job specification and test data which form the basis for the change. The representative of the union may also by arrangement with the industrial engineering representative of the company visit the premises where the grievance arose. Notice of the nature of such change will be given to the union in writing.
If no grievance is made as a result of any change referred to in this paragraph within twenty (20) working days after the change is to be put into effect, the change shall be deemed to be accepted.
Step two:
If the review provided in step one above does not provide an immediate solution to the grievance, joint tests will be made by an industrial engineering representative of the company and a representative of the union to settle the grievance on the change concerned.
Any joint tests shall be of the same nature and to the same extent as the tests upon which the change was originally based. The extent of the joint test called for may be varied by the parties by mutual agreement.
If the results of the joint tests made by the company and the union are such as not to affect the standard time valued by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the said joint tests affect the standard time value by greater than plus or minus 4% the standard time value will be so revised and put into effect.
If the results of the said joint tests call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4% retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change if the resulting assignment exceeds the accepted maximum level.
If the parties, after having completed the joint tests in this Step two, and after having studied their findings cannot agree on the results of the said joint tests, the union may refer the said change to the sole arbitrator mentioned below.
Step three:
The sole arbitrator shall review the change made by the company and shall make tests of the same nature and to the same extent as the tests upon which the change was originally based.
If the results of the test made by the sole arbitrator are such as not to affect the standard time value by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the test made by the sole arbitrator affect the standard time value by greater than plus or minus 4%, the standard time value will be so revised an put into effect.
If the results of the tests made by the sole arbitrator call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change if the resulting assignment exceeds the accepted maximum level.

When one or more element times of a standard time value which have not been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator from the date of the last acceptance by the union, it may request a revision in the said standard time value. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been arbitrated this will not preclude the balance of the element times of the said standard time value not arbitrated, from the application of this paragraph. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator, but if in the opinion
.../36
of the union a change has occurred which had not been covered by the decision of the sole arbitrator (or submitted as a change by the company) and which in their opinion affects the standard time value such contention may be submitted by the union to the sole arbitrator for his decision. In such a case the burden of proof falls on the union.

When such a request is made for arbitration, then all the element times for a standard time value except such element times as have been previously arbitrated shall be referred to the sole arbitrator for decision.
If within the said delay of forty-five (45) days, the union does not submit its request for revision to arbitration, the said request for revision will be deemed to have been abandoned.
3.	Following a request for arbitration made by the union, according to paragraph 1 if the arbitrator finds a difference from the standard time value in effect of 4% or more, then and only then shall the arbitrator decide that a change in the standard time value be put into effect in accordance with his observations. If the results of the review made by the arbitrator call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4% which increases the assignment over the accepted maximum level, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the union's request for revision.
4.	For all requests for revisions which are raised during the first three (3) months following the signature of the collective labour agreement, the retroactivity, if any, will be limited to a four (4) week period following the date the request for revisions was submitted.

d)	Some occupations previously paid as measured direct hourly occupations may be reclassified by the company as measured hourly paid occupations, and paid according to provision in paragraphs 24.02. Also, some occupations previously paid as measured hourly paid or as unmeasured occupations may be reclassified by the company as measured direct hourly occupations, and paid according to 24.01 (a) above.

b)	An individual employee with a physical handicap may request a work assignment lower than one hundred percent (100%) on a measured occupation. The company will consider each such request individually.
If the request is reasonable and the employee is on a measured direct hourly occupation, he will be given a work assignment between 90% and 100%, as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation if practical, and he will be paid according to this assignment.
If the employee is on a measured hourly paid occupation and his request is reasonable, he will be given a work assignment between 80% and 100% as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation and if practical, and he will be paid according to his assignment.
At certain processes, due to the number of productive units, isolation of equipment, etc., it may be impossible or impractical to implement a reduced work assignment for an employee without reducing the volume of production to the next process. Also an employee may not be capable of handling a work assignment between 90% and 100% on a measured direct hourly occupation. In such case an occupational transfer for the employee will be considered in line with article 12.10 (Permanent transfers).
Such requests for a reduction in work assignments are limited to one per year for each employee and to one per occupation per month. If more than one employee is affected the senior employee shall be selected.
c)	In the case of an employee on a measured occupation, who in the opinion of the company, is not capable or willing of handling a 100% work assignment, the same conditions as in paragraph 24.03 (b) above for a reduced assignment or transfer will apply. However, before proceeding in this manner, the company will advise the union giving the reasons for the contemplated change.
24.04	COMBINED OCCUPATION:
An employee who works concurrently on more than one measured occupation, - known as a combined occupation - on any shift will be paid for the entire shift that day at the rate of the highest paid occupation performed by him if he works at least one hour on that occupation.

24.05	MEASURED TIME VALUES:
The measured time value is expressed in minutes and is the time required to perform an operation at a pace and with allowances for rest and personal needs as defined in paragraph 24.01 (b) under standard conditions.
The measured time values will not be changed except if a change in the conditions result in an increase or a decrease in the work content, or if in the opinion of both parties an error has been made that would require an adjustment.
Checks are made to make sure that conditions are maintained in conformity with those used to calculate a measured time value.

A copy of the job specification in force will be made available in the department.
