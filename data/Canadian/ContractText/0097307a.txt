SUPPLEMENT NO. 2 ADJUSTMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
In connection with the interpretation of certain clauses of the 1970-1972 Contract between I.W.A.-Canada and certain Interi-
69
or Operators, the following interpretations of the Contract have been agreed upon;
1.	It is understood that no new upward or downward revision of rates will be established by any operators without mutual agreement with the Local Union. Where applicable the provisions of the Plywood or Sawmill Job Evaluation Programs shall prevail.
2.	Re: Article X - Seniority - Section 9:
It is understood that the interpretation of this clause made by the Honourable Gordon McGregor Sloan under the Coast Agreement will apply as set out below:
“When an Employee has left, or leaves, the bargaining unit because of promotion to a supervisory position, and who later is reinstated as a member of such bargaining unit because of demotion or reduction in forces, he returns thereto with the seniority he had when an Employee within the bargaining unit. In other words, his seniority is “frozen” at the time he leaves the bargaining unit and ceases to run until his return thereto”.
It is agreed, however, that persons transferred out of the bargaining unit for temporary supervisory duty with the Company for a period of not more than four (4) months in each calendar year shall continue to retain their senioritv. Employees temporarily transferred out of the bargaining unit will be reinstated in the job they held when they left the bargaining unit without loss of seniority.
Should any special circumstances arise which will require an extension of this provision, same shall be discussed between the Local Union and Management and, if agreement is reached, the period may be extended.
It is agreed that the above understandings shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been written into the actual contract and this Section of Adjustments and Interpretations shall form Supplement No. 2 and be part of the Contract.

The Parties must mutually agree on the resolution of issues such as:

7.	An Employee’s rest days may vary from week to week under an alternate shift schedule. Employees shall not be paid premium pay for changes in their rest days in these circumstances.
8.	An Employee whose rest days are changed by the Company under an established alternate shift schedule, shall receive rate and one-half for work performed on his rest days unless a change in rest day results from the application of seniority or has been agreed to between the Employee and the Company.
9.	There shall be no premium pay paid to any Employee whose rest days are changed because of the implementation or discontinuance of an alternate shift schedule.

Supplemental Matters which have been agreed to between the I.F.L.R.A. and I.W.A.-Canada -Negotiating, Committee by either a Memorandum of Agreement, Clarification of the Agreement and/or Interpretation of the Agreement.
Interpretation of the Agreement
1.	Clarification of Agreement
Article V - Wages - Section 7 - Shift Differential Clarification
Any Employee who works more than one hour outside of the shift which is recognized as a regular day shift, should be paid night shift differential for all time worked on the overlap shift. This applies to the front end of the shift and/or the back end of the shift.
In other words, if you work a scheduled shift that is more than one hour outside of the regular day shift you should receive night shift differential for the entire hours spent on that shift.
2.	Clarification of Agreement
Article VII - Hours of Work - Double Time on Sunday
There has been considerable discussion in regards to the interpretation of Article VII - Hours of Work, Section l(b)Cii) and (b)(iv) as it applies to three (3) shift operations where some Employees, who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days, and regularly come in one (1) or two (2) hours early to do preparatory work prior to the start of the first shift on Monday. The pertinent clauses read as follows:
Article VII - Hours of Work
Section 1 (b) - Double straight time shall be paid for the following:
“(ii) Hours worked on Sunday by Employees who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6)
days;
(iv) Item (ii) above shall not apply to Employees who work Sunday as a regularly scheduled day.”
106
Inasmuch as (iv) above was negotiated to apply to
Employees who regularly work on a seven (7) day
tour, such as Security Guards, Watchmen, Steam Plant
Employees, agreement has been reached on the application of Section (iv) above.
Where Employees regularly come in late Sunday night to do preparatory work, the Company will pay double straight time rates of pay for those hours worked prior to Sunday midnight. However, the Company reserves the right to either shorten his regular shift to parallel the normal hours of the shift or to require the Employee to work his normal shift at straight time in addition to the time worked prior to Sunday midnight.
3.	Article VII - Hours of Work - Section 9 - Hot Meals
Where Maintenance, Repair or Construction Employees are required to work two (2) hours or more overtime beyond their normal shift, the Company shall provide a hot meal, such hot meal to be consumed by the Employee on Company time before beginning the overtime work.
Negotiated additions to above:
Production Employees working in conjunction with or assisting Maintenance Employees and who work two (2) or more hours of overtime beyond their regular shift will be entitled to a hot meal as provided in Section 9 if the Maintenance Employees with whom they are working become entitled to a hot meal.
The Company will ensure that a hot meal will be provided whenever possible.
However, where the provision of a hot meal is considered impractical, Employ&s will be paid the equivalent of one (1) hour’s pay at rate and one-half in lieu of both the hot meal and the time required to consume the meal.
For the purpose of this agreement rate and one-half will be calculated at the regular hourly rate of pay the Employee is receiving for the overtime work being performed.
