Attention: Gordon Gray Dear Sir:
Re: Agreement on New and Evolving Work
This letter is intended to clarify IWA-Canada's intent with regard to the terms and conditions of the Letter of Understanding in 1994 negotiations on New and Evolving Work.
During discussions on this, the Industry raised concerns that we answer as follows:
1.	It is not the intentions of IWA-Canada to use this agrrement to replace existing logging contractors with IWA members or crews.
2.	It is IWA-Canada's desire to have opportunities to discuss with employers the possibility of either using IWA company crews, or IWA contractors, to perform work under Forest Renewal, hut it is not our intent to cause companies to purchase equipment without having the costs of such equipment considered as pan of the efficiency and cost effectiveness that IWA agrees to address under the New and Evolving Work agreement.
3.	It is IWA-Canada's intentiona that discussion concerning new operations under the agreement may lead to voluntary recognition and certification - it is not our intentions to achieve certification first and enter into discussions later unless certification occurs as a direct result on an IWA organizing drive.
As stated earlier, this letter is to clarify our intentions concerming our agreement. It is not intended to form part of the agreement, as is not arbitrable by either party.
Sincerely,
Harvey Arcand
4th Vice President IWA-Canada
