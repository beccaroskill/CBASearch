The relevant factors which the Company will consider before contracting out such work include, adverse effect on employees, availability of required skills, duration and frequency of the job, urgency of the job, cost of equipment in relation to its use and relative cost comparison.
When work performed on the premises by outside contractors represents a material change in practice and has adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such change of practice, the matter might be the subject of a grievance and may be taken to arbitration.
Should an Arbitration Committee be called on to review the Company’s action, it may consider the relevant factors referred to above, in order to determine the reasonableness of the Company’s action with regard to all circumstances. Should the Arbitration Committee find that the Company’s action was not reasonable, the Committee will direct that the Company choose between having the work performed by its employees or ceasing such operation, and that the Company shall have a reasonable time to effect the decision.
