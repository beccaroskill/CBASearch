•	Encourage the participation of the Union in a proactive and leadership role to achieve results,
•	Communicate/discuss the issues of today with effective problem solving / decision making / resolution for the future. Understanding and learning how to deal with change is one of our opportunities,

The Union shall notify the Company, in writing, of the names of the Union Committee members and of the names and effective date of changes in the Union Committee.
8:02	(a) The President of the Local Union shall upon his request, and subject to the
limitations of 8:02 (b) and (c), be placed by the Company on Day Schedule and be paid the Day Schedule rate for his classification.
(b) In order to be on Day Schedule or to be placed on Day Schedule, the President must occupy any one of the following classifications:
Forming Dept.:	Day Binder Mixer
Alloy Services
Fabrication A:	Packer Textiles
Any Reinforcing Mat classification when these classifications are on 'M', 'S', or 'T' shift schedules
Maintenance:	Any classification except
Continuous Shift Mechanic and Continuous Shift Electrician Materials Distribution:	Storeskeeper
8
(c) If the President requests to be placed on Day Schedule and he does not occupy one of the classifications noted in (b) above, the granting of his request will be delayed until he transfers into one of the classifications noted in (b) through the provisions of Article XII and Article XVI.
8:03 The Company shall recognize a steward body to be allocated to a department or departments as follows:
(a)	Forming Department: 1 Steward per shift. This steward will also represent the Forming Continuous Shift Maintenance employees.
(b)	Fabrication 'A' Department: 1 Steward per shift to a maximum of four in the department. These stewards will also represent the Fabrication 'A' Continuous Shift Maintenance employees.
(c)	Fabrication 'B' Department: 1 steward per shift in Reinforcing Mat. This steward will also represent the Fabrication 'B' Continuous Shift Maintenance employees.
(d)	Materials Distribution Department: 1 Steward.
(e)	Maintenance Mechanical Department: 1 Steward to represent Day Schedule employees.

8:04 Where a new Department is put into operation or one of the current Departments is changed, the matter of changes in the Steward representation shall be the subject of discussion between the parties and changes made, provided agreement is reached.
8:05 In the event a Steward is transferred to a Department other than the Department he represents, he may continue as a Steward for the Department he is leaving for not more than thirty (30) calendar days or until a new Steward is selected, whichever is shorter.
8:06 The Union shall notify the Company in writing of the names of the Stewards and the Department each Steward represents, and of the names and effective dates of any changes of Stewards.
8:07 Employees shall not be eligible to serve as members of the Local Union Committee or as stewards until they have been employed for a period of one (1) year.
8:08 Committeemen and Stewards, as well as other employees, have their regular duties to perform on behalf of the Company and shall not leave their regular duties or their work area without first obtaining the permission of their foremen or supervisor. They shall also not enter another work area without first obtaining the permission of that area's foreman
9
or supervisor. Upon completing their business in another area, they shall check out of the area through the area's foreman or supervisor. The provisions of this section shall also apply to International Union Representatives.
8:09 Committeemen or Stewards or WSIB Reps shall not absent themselves from their regular duties for unreasonable lengths of time to attend to matters pertaining to the Agreement.

8:10 On the occasions when the Local Union Committee meets with the Company or Company representatives, for the purpose of negotiating a renewal of the Collective Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Committee Members their normal earnings to a maximum of twelve (12) hours in any twenty-four hour period, should the deliberations between the parties require said members to be off work for a complete shift during the twenty-four hour period adjacent to the meeting.
It will be the Company's intent to reimburse Committee Members for their normal earnings when they attend a negotiating meeting on the following basis. The rule of thumb to be applied is to ensure that each member has a minimum period of 12 hours rest preceding and following each meeting, therefore any regular scheduled hours of work falling in this time frame will be reimbursed.
Further, in the event the negotiating schedule is such that the Committee Member would attend meetings on all of his regular days of rest, the Company will reimburse him for the first scheduled shift after these meetings. This only applies to Continuous Shift Committee Members.
8:11 At any meeting between the Company and the Local Union Committee, such committee shall be entitled to have present a representative or representatives of the Canada Council.

(a)	The employee will be informed of the purpose of such discussion before entering any office, including the possibility of subsequent disciplinary action.
(b)	If the employee declines such representation the employee must confirm his decision in writing.
8:13 A warning letter will be delivered to the employee concerned while at work under normal circumstances. The Company, however, may direct a warning letter to the employee's residence if circumstances so warrant.

ARTICLE IX
SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES
It is understood that in any work situation, questions, misunderstandings and various problems may arise. Employees are encouraged to discuss any questions or concerns they may have with their Supervisor. Both parties agree that, prior to submitting a grievance an employee must have tried to resolve the problem with Management by dealing with them as they arise. In these situations Management and Union representatives must act responsibly to find a solution that is mutually beneficial and not just assume a representative role without properly acknowledging the facts.
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
9:01 It is the desire of the parties that complaints of employees be adjusted as quickly as possible. If an employee has any complaint or question he wishes to discuss with the Company, he shall first take it up with his immediate Shift Leader who will attempt to solve the problem. It is understood that the Shift Leader’s solution shall not be considered to be precedent setting.
9:02 It shall be optional to the Company to decline to consider any grievance, the alleged circumstance of which occurred more than fourteen (14) calendar days (excluding recognized holidays and vacations) prior to its presentation.
9:03 The following grievance procedure steps shall apply. For the purpose of this Article the term "working day" is defined as a day on which all parties concerned are scheduled to work.
Step 1:	An employee who believes he has a grievance shall first present it to his
Steward, in writing, on the forms supplied by the Union. The Steward and the Grievor shall present the grievance to the Grievor's Shift Leader.
Within four (4) working days after the date the grievance was received, the Department Manager or his designate shall hold a meeting with the Shift Leader, the Grievor and his Steward. Within four (4) working days after the date of the hearing, the Department Manager or his designate shall give his decision in writing.
Step 2: If the decision of the Department Manager or his designate is not satisfactory, an appeal may be lodged by the Union Committee with the Human Resources Manager or his designate within five (5) working days after the date the decision was received.
Within ten (10) working days after the date the appeal was received, the Human Resources Manager or his designate shall arrange a meeting date to discuss the grievance between Management representatives, the Union Committee and the employee's Steward. Within five (5) working days after the date of the meeting, the Company shall give its
11
decision in writing.
Step 3: If the Company's decision is not satisfactory, the Union may, by written notice within thirty (30) calendar days after the date the Company's decision was received, advise the Company of its intent to proceed to arbitration. In said written notice, the Union shall propose its nominees to act as sole arbitrator to hear the grievance.
Should the Union's nominees be unacceptable, the Company shall propose alternate names. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of an arbitrator within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date the Union's written notice was received, either party may request the Ontario Minister of Labour to appoint one. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.
9:04 The time limits specified in the foregoing steps of the grievance procedure may be extended by mutual agreement using the forms provided for this purpose.
9:05 No grievance may be submitted to an arbitrator (other than a policy grievance or a grievance alleging improper discharge) which has not been properly carried through all previous stages of the grievance procedure, and no person may be appointed as an arbitrator who has taken part in an attempt to settle the grievance. The expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared jointly by the Company and the Union.
9:06 In the event a grievance is referred to an arbitrator for arbitration, the arbitrator shall not alter, add to, subtract from, modify or amend any part of the Agreement.
9:07 At any stage of the grievance procedure, including arbitration, the conferring parties may have the assistance of the employee or employees concerned and any witnesses. All reasonable arrangements shall be made to permit the conferring parties to have access to the Plant to view disputed operations or to confer with necessary witnesses.
9:08 A policy grievance arising directly between the Company and the Union may be submitted by either party at Step 2 and failing its satisfactory disposition may then be referred to an arbitrator as provided in this Article.
9:09	(a) A discharged employee shall be allowed to confer with a Committee member before
leaving Company premises and he may present a grievance, in writing, to his Committeeman. The Committeeman may then or within five (5) calendar days after the day of discharge (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, recognized holidays or vacations) present such grievance to the Human Resources Manager or his designate. The grievance shall then be processed in accordance with the procedure outlined in Step 2 of the grievance procedure except that Management shall give its decision in writing within three (3) calendar days (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, recognized holidays or vacations) after the day the meeting was held to discuss the employee's discharge.
(b)	The discharge of an employee who has acquired seniority rights may be settled under
12
the grievance or arbitration procedure by:
(i)	Confirming Management's action in dismissing the employee.
(ii)	Reinstating the employee with full compensation for time lost.
(iii)	By any other arrangement which may be deemed just and equitable.
9:10 Except as provided in section 9:04, any grievance not answered within the time limits defined in this Article shall be considered settled in favour of the Grievor or withdrawn by the Union. Policy grievances are exempted from the application of this article. Individual grievances, where the monetary consequences to the Company of settling the grievance in favour of the grievor would be over $1,000.00 are also exempted.
ARTICLE X MEETINGS
10:01 The Negotiating Committee shall meet with the Company, as provided in Article XXXIV for the purpose of negotiating amendments to or modifications of any provision of the Agreement.
10:02 The Union Committee shall meet with the Company on matters concerning the administration of the Agreement, and to negotiate amendments to, or modifications of any provision of the agreement. Any amendments or modifications will be suitably posted for 30 calendar days.

ARTICLE XXVIII VACATION ALLOCATIONS
28:01 Vacations shall be allocated within the fifty-two (52) week period commencing with the first Sunday in April.
28:02 (a) Except as described in section 28:02 (b), the "Prime Vacation Period" shall normally be twelve (12) weeks in duration, subject to a maximum of seventeen (17) percent of the employees in any one group being allowed off for vacation purposes. The Prime Vacation Period shall end each year on the Saturday immediately preceding Labour Day. Vacation relief during the Prime Vacation Period shall be retained within shifts and on a shift basis except where a wheel relief system is in operation, or where it is mutually agreed to extend such systems to other groups.
(b)	When the complement in the Maintenance Mechanical Group and/or the Maintenance Electrical Group is eighteen (18) or more, the calculation made to determine the maximum number allowed off during the Prime Period will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. At certain complements, this calculation will result in an insufficient number of vacation weeks for all employees in either or both of the above groups to choose two weeks in the Prime Period.
28:03 The following groups shall be considered to be individual and separate units for the purpose of vacation allocations in the Prime Period only:
1.	FORMING GROUP:
All Forming classifications
2.	ALLOY SERVICES GROUP
3.	COMBINED GROUP:
Plant Services*
4.	PACKING GROUP:
Packer - Textiles
47
5.	CSM GROUP
All Reinforcing mat classifications
6.	CFM GROUP
7.	MATERIALS DISTRIBUTION
All Shipping & Stores classifications
8.	MAINTENANCE MECHANICAL GROUP Maintenance Mechanic
Maintenance Mechanic Apprentice Carpenter - Painter
9.	MAINTENANCE ELECTRICAL GROUP Maintenance Electrician Maintenance Electrician Apprentice
10.	MAINTENANCE COMBINED GROUP Maintenance General Labour
When there are six employees in Group 3, two additional weeks in the prime will be provided.
28:04 The maximum number of employees allowed off for vacations outside the Prime Period shall be computed for each group according to the following formula:
(a)	After the Prime Period has been completely allocated, a balance of weeks outside the Prime Period shall remain in the vacation year.
(b)	The total remaining weeks of vacation entitlement for the entire group shall then be computed. In the case of 'continuous shift production groups', this computation shall be made for both the A/B and C/D combinations, (or equivalent designation).
(c)	The total remaining weeks of vacation entitlements shall be divided by the weeks remaining in the vacation year outside the Prime Period.
(d)	The total resulting from the calculations in (c) above, shall then be increased to the nearest whole number and shall be the maximum number of employees in the Group allowed off at any one time outside of the Prime Vacation Period.
Example: In Group X a twelve (12) week Prime Vacation Period has been completely allocated and ninety-five (95) weeks of vacation entitlements are still to be taken in the remaining forty (40) weeks of the vacation year.
95 / 40 = 2.4
48
Therefore, a maximum of three employees in Group X would be allowed off at any one time outside of the Prime Vacation Period.
Notwithstanding the above,
i)	if the calculation generates a number whose decimal fraction is greater than .8 (eg. 3.81), one additional employee shall be allowed off at any one time outside the prime but within April 15th to September 15th, and in the two week period which includes both Christmas and New Years Day.
