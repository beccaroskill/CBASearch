Dear Sir:
It is the intention of the Company that multiple absentees who are unable to provide satisfactory explanation to the Medical Centre or Personnel Department for their absences will be required to report to the Medical Centre or Personnel Department after each subsequent absence prior to commencing work.
In the event of an employee being told to report to the Medical Centre he will be paid from the time he was scheduled to report provided he is ready and willing to return to work.
The purpose of this visit is to provide an adequate follow up and control of absenteeism.
Multiple absentees will be reviewed with the Union. A “Multiple Absentee” is defined as an employee who has four (4) separate unexcused absences during a seven (7) month period. The multiple absentee who does not lose unexcused time over a five (5) month period will have his name removed from this list (Workers Compensation cases will be excluded).
The Arbitration decision of November 12, 1886, becomes part and parcel of this leter.

Dear Sir:
For many years services of a fully equipped Medical Centre have been provided to all employees of this Company. From time to time everyone has utilized these services for themselves or in some cases members of their families. Qualified and experienced personnel are available and ready to assist you. With this in-plant service, illnesses are often detected and arrested in the early stages. Complete medical histories for each employee have been compiled and are referred to when needed. The Medical Centre therefore is provided for your benefit.
Due to your record of frequent absences you are hereby advised that you must report to the Medical Centre for clearance before returning to work following any future absences. Your schedule for the first workday that follows such an absence will begin at the time you are scheduled to report to the Medical Centre and are ready and willing to return to your regular job.
To minimize any lost time it is suggested that you contact and clear the Medical Centre in advance of your return to work. If you have obtained clearance from your own doctor, please bring in the certificate at this time.
This procedure will remain in effect until your absentee record has improved to the extent outlined in the letter to the Union President, dated March 8,1993 at which time you will be notified accordingly. As you are aware the Medical Centre is open from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday.

No transfer shall take place withoutthe Union Bargaining Committee's agreement.
The Company at its sole discretion may institute weekend work shifts. The Company may unilaterally at any time discontinue such week-end workshifts. The normal hours of work for individuals assigned to these shifts would be twelve (12) hours per day and twenty-four (24) hours per week.

(A) Employee Life Insurance.
In addition to the Company-provided Basic Life Insurance, an eligible employee may elect, in writing an additional $13,000 of Life Insurance on his life. Such Life Insurance shall be on a contributory base.
The current rate of weekly contributions, which will be deducted from an employee's
101
earnings is $2.10. Should the rate charged by the Insurance Company for this contributory benefit be altered, the employee's contribution will be altered accordingly. An election to participate must be made within 31 days of becoming eligible or evidence of insurability will be required before coverage can become effective.
Once an election to participate has been made, an employee may cancel his optional coverage at any time, in writing, but evidence of insurability will be required if he subsequently decides to reapply for optional Life Insurance and any insurance would take effect the first of the month following election and acceptance by the insurance company of evidence of insurability.
The cost, if any, of providing evidence of insurability will be the responsibility of the employee.
The details concerning total and permanent disability are the same as those pertaining to the Company's Basic Life Insurance Plan as set out in Article I, Section 1, A-2, of this Insurance Program Agreement.
Eligibility to participate in this Optional Life Insurance Plan ceases upon termination of employment, retirement, or attainment of age 65 whichever occurs first, except that the conversion provisions outlined in Article 1, Section l-C-7 of this Agreement will ap-
The Optional Life Insurancedescribed above shall be provided conditional upon at least 50% of eligible employees applying for such coverage on or before April 1, 1987.
A medical examination at the employee's expense may be required to provide evidence of insurability satisfactory to the car
102
rier: if the employee does not enroll during the enrollment periods described in (A) above; if an employee hired after the effective date does not enroll within thirty-one (31) days after becoming eligible; or if the Optional Contributory Life Insurance previously terminated because an employee revoked the required payroll deduction authorization or failed to make the required contribution.
(B)	Dependent Life Insurance.
Provided that an eligible employee has applied for or maintained the coverage described in (A) above, he may elect in writing Dependent Life Insurance on a contributory basis, in the amount of $5,000 for a spouse and $l,OOO for each dependent child. Spouse and dependent child are as defined in Section Ill, (5) of the Insurance Program Agreement.
The current rate of weekly contribution, which will be deducted from an employee's earnings is $.58. Should the rates charged by the insurance company for this contributory benefit be altered, the employee's weekly contribution rate will be altered accordingly. An election to participate must be made within thirty-one (31) days of becoming eligible, or evidence of insurability at the expense of the employee, will be required before coverage can become effective.
Section II Accident Sickness Benefits for Employees
A.	The Company will provide without cost to the employee:
1.	Weekly Accident and Sickness Benefits at the rate of 66-2/3% of the employee's average hourly earnings times 40 hours to a maximum of
103
$447.00, with a minimum payment of $250.00 a week.
2.	General.
Benefits will be paid to employees for accident or sickness not covered by a Worker's Compensation Act, while under the care of a doctor licensed to practice medicine. For purposes of a preceding sentence, a doctor licensed to practice medicine means either a doctor of medicine (M.D.) or a doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) or a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC.).
Benefits will be payable from the first day of disability due to an accident, or the equivalent where 5 shifts exists (the Company will allow a reasonable minor delay of 48 hrs for seeking medical attention), or the eighth day of disability due to sickness except that the disability results in the confinement to hospital of the employee or out patients surgery performed in a hospital, or for surgery performed by a specialist in a recognized health facility (surgical testing has not and will not be payed for), the benefits will be paid as, from and including the first day of such hospitalization. Benefits will be paid for the duration of the disability but not exceeding fifty-two (52) weeks of any such disability for an employee.
Benefits for disabilities due to pregnancy will be available only if the pregnancy commences while the employee is insured under this program, and are payable from the time the employee ceases work.
An employee shall be deemed to be totally disabled and eligible for benefits if the disability is such that the employee is unable to work. There will be no limit to the number of different periods of disability for which benefits will be paid. Periods of disability due to the same cause will be considered the same period of disability, unless separated by a return to full-time work for
104
at least two (2) weeks. Periods of disability due to different causes will be considered different periods of disability if separated by a return to full-time work. Disabilities giving rise to claims for any accident and sickness benefits may be verified by the Company by medical examination at any time. Benefits may be suspended if the claimant fails to have such examination made. It is understood that benefits shall not be suspended until satisfactory proof that the claimant is not cooperating. Employees who become disabled shall notify the employing Company's insurance department of such disability not later than ten (10) days following the first day of the period for which benefits under this Section II are claimed, and shall give new notice thereof at intervals of no more than thirty (30) days thereafter for the duration of such disability. If any such notice is not timely filed, no benefits will be paid for periods previous to such notice unless the delay shall be shown to have been unavoidable and satisfactory evidence of physician's care and disability is furnished.
In the event an employee's Worker's Compensation claim is delayed for a period greater than six (6) weeks or is rejected and such claim is appealed the employee shall be provided with the weekly Sickness Indemnity Benefits provided for under this Section. If and when the Worker's Compensation claim is allowed for the accident the Worker's Compensation Board will first reimburse the Company to the extent of the payments made before any payment is made to the employee.
3.	Should the earnings index under the Unemployment Insurance Act change the criteria for maximum benefits, the Company will adjust the weekly benefit to the extent of maintaining the minimumqualification requirements of the weekly
105
indemnity plan for premium reductions under the Unemployment Insurance Act.

Employees already covered under the terminated insurance program shall be insured hereunder for benefits in effect under the terminated plan, but there will be no duplication in whole or part in payment of benefits under the terminated insurance program. The foregoing shall not be construed to exclude employees from coverage who are on vacation, or leave of absence for local Union activities.
B.	Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Paragraph B, all insurance coverage, under Section II shall cease on the date of termination of an employee's regular active employment with the Company, regardless of the reason therefor.

Paragraph 3:Ol
(B)	In calculating the supplementary pension payable under the provisions of Paragraph 3:O1 (A) (2) (B) for an employee eligible to receive a statutory benefit from the date of his retirement, the monthly amounts to which he is so entitled from and after retirement (or would be except for an act or a failure to act by him or by another on his behalf) constitute the monthly amounts of his statutory benefit for the purposes of the Plan and are not to be affected by any Pension Index, Earnings Index, or other similar escalation in the statutory benefit after his retirement.
In calculating the supplementary pension pay-

136
be determined as if the pensioner had been in full-time active employment with the Company from and including the first day of January 1966 up to the date of retirement.

(II)	The deferment from the anticipated date to the actual date is not due to
(A)	any act or failure to act by him or by another on his behalf, or
(B)	any change in laws, regulations, rules or practices taking effect after his retirement.

The Company will require at least 30 days written notice in order for the terminated employee to have his deferred vested pension commence earlier than his normal retirement date.
In lieu of taking a deferred vested pension from the plan, a terminating employee may require the Company to transfer the commuted value of his deferred vested pension as of the date of termination of employment to:
(a)	a prescribed registered retirement vehicle;
(b)	another registered pension plan if the administrator of that other pension plan agrees to accept the transfer; or
(c)	a person licensed to carry on an annuities business in Canada for the purchase of a life annuity that will not commence prior to age 55,
provided that the transfer is administered in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act, including the locking-in provisions, and with the Income Tax Act (Canada), and provided further
143
that the terminating employee notifies the Company of his election of one of the above portability options on the prescribed form and within the time period required under the Pension Benefits Act.
Notwithstanding the above, if the amount of the annual deferred vested pension at the date of termination of employment is less than 2% of the YMPE for the year of termination, or such other amount as may be permitted under the Pension Benefits Act, the commuted value of the deferred vested pension may be paid out as a lump sum refund without being locked-in. Such a request for a refund of a small pension will be in lieu of retaining his right to the deferred vested pension from the plan.
(B)	If such employee has retained a deferred vested pension from the plan, and is subsequently reemployed by the Company and subsequently becomes eligible for a pension on retirement the amount of his benefit including deferred vested pension will not exceed the amount he would have been entitled to had his credited service with the Company both before and after reemployment been continuous. In any other circumstance, a terminated employee who is rehired by the Company will be treated as a new employee for all purposes of the plan.
(C)	The provisions dealing with deferred vested pension in each previous Pension Plan and Service Award Agreement between the Company and the Union shall continue to apply to an employee whose employment was terminated during the currency of each such Agreement.
Paragraph 3:06 - Normal Form of Pension
Each pension payable under this plan shall be paid in monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month following or coincident with the date of
144
retirement, and shall continue on the first day of
each month thereafter as follows:
(a)	The basic monthly pension is payable for the life of the employee with the guarantee that 60 such monthly payments shall be made. If the employee dies before the 60 month guaranteed period expires, the remainder of the 60 monthly payments shall be made to the spouse or the eligible dependants each month as they fall due, or if none, the commuted value of the remaining guaranteed payments shall be paid to any other beneficiary or estate in a lump sum.
(b)	The Type A supplementary pension is payable for the life of the employee but not beyond the normal retirement age of 65, and without any guarantee as to the number of payments to be made.
(c)	The Type B supplementary pension is payable from the normal retirement age of 65 for the life of the employee, and without any guarantee as to the number of payments to be made. Notwithstanding the above, the Pension Benefits Act requires that if the retiring employee, or former employee with a deferred vested pension from the plan, has an eligible spouse at the date of commencement of pension payments, and provided that no waivers in the prescribed form exist, the basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above, must be converted and paid as a joint and 60% survivor pension.
For these purposes, the value of the lifetime basic monthly pension with the 60 month guaranteed period will be converted on an actuarially equivalent basis to provide a joint and 60% survivor pension for a different amount without a guaranteed period. Under the joint and 60% survivor pension, the adjusted monthly amount will be paid to the pensioner for as long as he
145
lives, and upon his death 60% of the adjusted amount will be continued to that spouse, if she is then living, for the remainder of her lifetime. The last monthly installment is the one that is due at the beginning of the month in which the pensioner dies or the guaranteed period expires, whichever is applicable. At the discretion of the Pension Board, the last monthly instalment of a pension payable under this Plan may, in the event of death of a pensioner prior to receipt of such instalments, be paid to the surviving spouse or other dependants of such pensioner.
Paragraph 3:07 - Optional Forms of Pension
an employee may, by written application on forms supplied by and submitted to the Company at least 30 days prior to the actual commencement date of pension payments, elect to convert the normal form of his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above to one of the optional forms of pension described below, on an actuarially equivalent basis. The election of an optional form of pension does not apply to any supplementary pensions payable to normal retirement, special early retirement, early retirement or disability retirement. Where the employee has an eligible spouse at the date pension payments are to commence, the right to elect an optional form of pension may only be exercised if the employee and the spouse both sign the prescribed waiver forms as required by the Pension Benefits Act. In addition, in no event may an election of an optional form of pension be made after pension payments have already commenced.
Guaranteed Options
The employee may elect that his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above, before the deductions in Article IV and excluding any supplementary pensions, be paid for
146
his lifetime with the guarantee that payments will be made for 60 months, or 120 months or 180 months as the case may be. For the purposes of this paragraph, the lifetime basic monthly pension will be adjusted on an actuarial equivalent basis and paid in the same or a different amount as the case may be, with the condition that if the pensioner dies before the selected guarantee period had expired, the remaining payments will be made to the spouse or eligible dependants monthly as they fall due, or if none the commuted value of such remaining guaranteed payments will be paid to any other beneficiary or estate in a lump sum. No optional form of pension will be permitted which would result in a guaranteed period exceeding 15 years.
Joint and Survivor Options
The employee may elect that his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above, before the deductions in Article IV and excluding any supplementary pensions, be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis and paid as a joint and survivor pension without any guarantee as to the number of payments to be made. Under this option, the same or a different amount of monthly pension, as the case may be, will be payable during the lifetime of the pensioner and upon his death 50%, or 60%, or 100% as elected of the adjusted monthly pension then payable to him will be continued to the spouse, for as long as that spouse shall
live.
Should the spouse die after the pensioner had elected the option but before his adjusted lifetime basic monthly pension had commenced, the election shall be void and the lifetime basic monthly pension will not be adjusted and will be paid to him as if he had made no election.
Once an election of this option and the designation of a joint annuitant have been made and accepted
147
by the Company, it may be rescinded or changed prior to the actual commencement date of pension payments only with the written consent of the Company in accordance with the rules of uniform application to all persons similarly situated.
The Company may adopt or establish other optional forms of pension in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act and any other applicable legislation from time to time, The amount of any such optional form of pension shall be the actuarial equivalent of the pension payable in the normal form as described in paragraph 3:06.
An election to receive an optional form of pension may be revoked or changed provided written notice of such revocation or change is received by the Company at least 30 days prior to the commencement date of pension payments to the pensioner.
Paragraph 3:08 - Beneficiary
(A)	Subject to the provisions of this Section, an employee or pensioner who has attained the age of twenty-one (21) years, who is domiciled in and ordinarily a resident in the Province of Ontario, may designate a beneficiary or a new beneficiary to receive the payments, if any, to be made under this plan after his death. An employee or pensioner who has designated a beneficiary or a new beneficiary pursuant to this Article may revoke any such designation.
(B)	The right to designate or to revoke a designation of a beneficiary pursuant to Paragraph 3:08 (A) of this Article is to be exercised by the execution by the employee or pensioner and by delivery to the Board of an instrument in writing which expressly provides that the designation or revocation whichever is the case, is made with reference to this Plan.
(C)	Upon delivery to the Board, prior to or on or after the death of the employee or pensioner, of a
148
designation or revocation of a designation of a beneficiary made pursuant to Paragraphs 3:08
(A)	and (B) of this Article, the designation or revocation, even if it is contained in a will or in an instrument purporting to be a will, relates back to and has effect as and from the date of its execution but without prejudice to this Company on account of any payment or payments made under this plan prior to such delivery.
(D)	Where an employee or pensioner is not permitted to make a designation under the provisions of this Article, any payments to be made with respectto him after his death, will be made to his estate. No provision of the Pension Plan is to be construed as taking away any rights of such an employee or pensioner to direct how his monies received by his estate are to be distributed or otherwise dealt with by his personal representatives.
(E)	Notwithstanding the designation or rights of any beneficiary, where the employee has a spouse at the date of death, any benefits payable under the Plan shall be payable to the spouse and the administrator of the Plan shall be fully discharged of all liabilities for benefits paid to that spouse, subject only to any other claims by a former spouse which has been previously recorded with the Plan Administrator.
Paragraph 3:09 - Pensioner Unable to Care for his Affairs
If the Board finds that any pensioner to whom a pension is payable from the Pension Fund is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made, by a duly appointed guardian, committee or other legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a brother or
149
sister, or to any person deemed by the Board to have incurred expense for such pensioner. However, the Board shall endeavour to give effect to the wishes of the pensioner in this respect when such wishes shall have been expressed in writing by the pensioner before he shall have become unable to care for his affairs. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of the pensioner and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan therefore.
Paragraph 3:10 - Pre-Retirement Death Benefit
(A)	If an employee dies before becoming entitled to a deferred vested pension from the plan, no death benefit is payable from the plan. However, if the employee dies after becoming entitled to a deferred vested pension but before becoming eligible for special early retirement, early retirement or disability retirement, his surviving spouse, or if none the beneficiary or estate shall receive a death benefit from the plan equal to the commuted value of the lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above, excluding any supplementary pension, which the employee had accrued to the date of death.
The lifetime basic monthly pension accrued to the date of death is determined as the basic monthly pension accrued by the employee at the date of death, calculated in accordance with Paragraph 3:Ol as if the date of death were his normal retirement date using the provisions of the plan in effect at the date of death, and his years of credited service at that time. The above death benefit shall be paid as a lump sum payment, or the surviving spouse may elect to purchase an immediate or deferred life annuity from an insurance company with the proceeds, whichever the spouse elects. If the spouse does not elect within the time prescribed under the 150
Pension Benefits Act, the spouse will be deemed to have elected to purchase an immediate pension from an insurance company of the Company's choice.
(B)	If the employee dies while accumulating seniority, while eligible to retire under the special early or early retirement rules and prior to the employee's retirement, the spouse may elect to receive a spouse option pension from the plan, in lieu of the lump sum settlement in paragraph 3:lO(A) above. The spouse option pension shall be payable to the said spouse, provided such spouse is then living, commencing with the month following the month of the employee's death and each month thereafter during such spouse's lifetime. The amount of the spouse option pension shall be equal to sixty (60) percent of that lifetime basic monthly pension amount which would have been payable to the employee if the employee had actually retired immediately prior to death and the employee's basic monthly pension had been converted to the joint and survivor (60%) form described in paragraph 3:06.
(C)	If a deferred vested pensioner, who terminated his employment and did not elect a portability transfer under Paragraph 3:05 of this Article Ill but instead retained a deferred vested pension from the plan, dies prior to the actual commencement date of his deferred vested pension, his surviving spouse, or if none, the beneficiary or the estate shall receive a death benefit from the plan equal to the commuted value of his deferred vested pension as described above. Such death benefit shall be paid as a lump sum payment or may be used by the spouse to purchase an immediate or deferred life annuity from an insurance company, whichever the spouse elects. If the spouse does not elect
1.51
within the time prescribed by the pension Benefits Act, the spouse will be deemed to have elected the immediate lifetime pension.
ARTICLE IV Deductions
Paragraph 4:Ol
(A)	There shall be deducted from the amount of pension payable to each pensioner and each recipient of a total and permanent disability pension under the provisions of Articles II and Ill, a sum equal to the full amount of any benefit, annuity, pension or payment of similar kind payable of such person after retirement for any period of service covered by this plan, under any other plan of the Company or its parent or any affiliate or subsidiary of either to which the person is or shall be or, upon application would become entitled; provided that, if such person shall have contributed to the source or fund from which any such benefits, annuity, pension or payment shall be paid or become payable, such full amount of the deduction for such benefit, annuity, pension or payment shall be decreased by the amount which shall be attributable to the contributionswhich such personshall have made to such source or fund.
(B)	The deductions from pensions referred to in Paragraph 4:01 of this Article IV shall not be made from the monthly or lump sum payments to a beneficiary or the estate of a pensioner where an employee has elected an optional form of pension in accordance with Paragraph 3:07 of Article Ill.
(C)	There shall be deducted from the amount of Type A supplementary pension payable to each recipient of a total and permanent disability pension under the provisions of Article Ill or to the recipient of an early retirement pension
152
under the provisions of Article III.
The sum equal to the amount of statutory benefit to which the pensioner shall or could be entitled to receive upon application.
Paragraph 4:02
Each person who retires under the plan shall furnish to the Board proof satisfactory to it of the amount of any such benefit, annuity, pension or payment to which he is or shall be or upon application would become entitled and, upon request of the Board, will authorize the Board to obtain information relating to such benefit, annuity, pension or payment from any government agency. If any applicant for a pension or pensioner shall fail to furnish any such proof or authorization, the Board may compute his pension and deductions on the basis of estimates which in its judgement are reasonable. The deductions which are provided for in this Article Ill shall be made not only with respect to any of the above-mentioned payments which shall actually be received by a pensioner, but also with respect to any such payments to which he would be entitled, except for some act or failure to act by him or on his behalf, such as leaving Canada, failure to make application therefor or failure to notify the proper authority of his address.
Paragraph 4:03
If any of the payments which are deductible from pensions under this Article IV shall be paid in the case of a pension from a pension plan established by the General Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Limited or its parent or otherwise paid or payable to a pensioner in a lump sum, it shall be prorated on a monthly basis from the date on which it shall be paid in the case of a pension from a pension plan established by the General Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Limited or its parent or otherwise paid or payable (at a rate each month equal to the
153
entire amount of pension otherwise payable to such pensioner from the pension fund in such month) and no pension shall be payable to such pensioner under the plan until said payment, as thus prorated shall be exhausted.
ARTICLE V
Application For Retirement
Paragraph 5:Ol
Each application for retirement shall be in writing on the form or forms provided by the pension board and shall be made to the Pension Board and shall be filed in such manner and with such person as the Pension Board may specify. The Pension Board may require that there be furnished to it in connection with any such application for retirement proof of age and any other information as may reasonably be required. If an applicant fails to furnish such information or proof, the Pension Board may compute his pension, if any, on any basis by it deemed reasonable.
ARTICLE VI Administration
Paragraph 6:Ol
The administration of this Plan shall be the responsibility of the Company and shall be carried out by a Pension Board, which shall consist of three (3) or more persons from the management of the employing Company to be appointed annually by the Board of Directors of the employing Company and to serve until their successors shall have been appointed in like manner. At the time of their appointment, the Board of Directors shall designate one (1) of the members of the Pension Board as its Chairman.
Paragraph 6:02 - The Pension Board Shall Have Authority:

Any action approved by the vote of a majority of those present at any meeting, if those present constitute a quorum, shall be the action of the Pension Board, the Pension Board may take action without meeting if approval of the action is in writing by all members at the time in office.
155

ARTICLE VII Payment of Pensions
Paragraph 7:O1
The Company is free to determine the manner and means of making provisions for, and paying, the pension benefits set forth in this Plan; however, the Company agrees to reserve or set aside each year the amount required on a sound actuarial basis to pay the pension benefits provided by the Plan for the life of each pensioner retired under the Plan during such year, in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act and the Income Tax Act (Canada).
Paragraph 7:02
For the purpose of this Plan, the Company may establish, or cause to be established, alone or in conjunction with other employing Companies, a pension trust or trusts. Any employing Company may pay, or cause to be paid, into such trust or trusts such amounts as the Company shall approve.

Paragraph 7:04
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Article, payments to the Fund, the investment and loan of monies constituting said Fund, and the payment of pensions, shall be made in such manner as to comply with legislation that may have been or shall be adopted or promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Fund or Plan. Appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Plan where necessary.
ARTICLE VIII General Provisions
Paragraph 8:01
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give any employee the right to be retained in the service of an employing Company or to interfere with the right of the employing Company by which he shall then be employed to discharge any employee at any time. The foregoing shall not be deemed to modify the provisions of any Agreements which may be made by any of the employing Companies with the recognized Collective Bargaining representative of any of their employees.
157
Paragraph 8:02
Sale, transfer, anticipation, assignment, pledge or any kind of encumbrance of pensions will not be permitted or recognized under any circumstances. Neither pensions, nor any payment on account thereof, shall be subject to attachment or other legal process for or against a pensioner, except with respect to the interests of a Spouse in the event of marriage breakdown as described below.
Subject to the Act, when an order from a court of competent jurisdiction or a valid written domestic contract requiring division of an employee's or former employee’s benefits under the Plan due to marriage breakdown or dissolution of a common-law relationship has been received by the Administrator, such division shall be made in accordance with such order or contract, as determined by the Administrator and subject to any requirements prescribed under the applicable legislation. Any necessary adjustments shall be made to the employee’s or former employee’s benefit entitlement to reflect such division, provided that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefits payable to the employee and the Spouse shall not exceed the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefits payable to the employee had the division not occurred.

Paragraph 8:03
Subject to the provisions of any Agreements which may be made by any of the employing Companies with the recognized Collective Bargaining representatives of any of their employees, the Company reserves the right to modify, amend or terminate this

Paragraph 8:06
The Company may act for and on behalf of any or all of the employing Companies in all matters pertaining to the operation and administration of this Plan.
ARTICLE IX Conditions
Paragraph 9:Ol
The Plan and all of the Company's obligations and employee's rights thereunder are conditioned on
159
and subject to the approval of the relevant governmental tax authorities.
The Company shall contribute to the Fund such amounts, as determined by the Actuary and taking into account the assets of the Fund, as are necessary to maintain the Plan on a sound actuarial basis, provided that those contributions are eligible contributions under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Such contributions shall meet the minimum funding standards prescribed under the Act and shall include any amounts required to amortize any unfunded liability or solvency deficiency. Where applicable, Company Contributions shall be made at a time and in a manner which are in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act.
If on the effective date of the Pension Plan the Company has not all the approvals which it may deem necessary to establish that it is entitled to deduct the amount of its contributions to the Pension Plan as an expense before taxes under the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada), or any other applicable tax laws, as now in effect or as hereafter amended or adopted, the Plan shall not become effective.
Furthermore, employees are not required and are not permitted to make contributions of any kind to the plan.
Paragraph 9:02
In the event of refusal by the Board of Directors or by the relevant authorities, to approve this Agreement on or before the 1st day of December 1996 or in the event of the government tax authorities refusing to approve this Agreement, as defined in Section 9:Ol hereof, after such date or of their withdrawal after such date of approval of this Agreement previously given, either the Union or the Employer may apply to the Ontario Labour Relations Board for permission to terminate any Collective Labour Agreement then in effect, and the other party shall join in 160
such application. If subsequent to notice of termination of such Collective Labour Agreement, or subsequent to termination of this Agreement, the parties settle any difference between them and this Agreement is reinstated or a successor Agreement is made, then such Collective Labour Agreement if terminated, shall be reinstated to continue in full force until subsequently terminated according to its provisions as contained therein.
Paragraph 9:03
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the amount of lifetime basic annual pension, and/or any supplementary pensions provided under the Plan to any employee or to a spouse, if applicable, shall not exceed the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the Regulations thereunder. The following paragraphs provide a simplified summary of the main income tax limitations on pension amounts payable under the Plan, but in the event of any disputes regarding the application these maximum limits, the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations will govern.
A: Maximum Lifetime Pension
The maximum lifetime annual pension amount for the year in which the pension commences to be paid is the lesser of the defined benefit limit for the year (currently $1722) and 2% of the employee's highest indexed average compensation, multiplied by the employee's years of credited service.
For the purposes of calculating the limitation in this paragraph, an employee shall not be considered to have more than 35 years of credited service in respect of periods prior to January 1, 1992, and the terms “defined benefit limit” and “highest average compensation” shall have the meanings ascribed to them under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the Regulations thereunder.
161
B: Maximum Type A Supplementary Pension Where the employee retires early and is entitled under the Plan to a Type A supplementary pension payable for his lifetime but not beyond age 65, the maximum amount under sub-paragraph 8503(2)(b) of the lncome Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations shall be determined as described below.
(i)	If the employee has attained age 60 at the early retirement date, the maximum amount shall be the maximum Old Age Security benefit payable to a person aged 65 on the date that the employee retires, plus a proportion, based on his earnings history, of the maximum Canada/Quebec Pension Plan retirement benefits that would be payable to a person age 65 on the date that the employee retires.
(ii)	If the employee has not attained age 60 at the early retirement date the portion of the maximum benefit in (i) above, attributable to service after January 1, 1992, shall be reduced by 0.25% for each month that the commencement of the Type A supplementary pension precedes age 60. This percentage reduction is waived if the employee retires early as a result of a total and permanent disability under the Plan.
C: Maximum Combined Lifetime and Type A Supplementary Pensions
Where the employee retires early before age 65 and is entitled to receive a Type A supplementary pension at early retirement, the sum of his lifetime pension and his Type A supplementary pension in respect of credited service after December 31, 1991 and payable from the time the benefits commence to be paid to the time the employee attains 65 years of age or death, if earlier, may not exceed in the year of com-
162
mencement the defined benefit limit for the year (currently $1, 722) times his years of credited service, plus 25% of the 3 year average of the YMPE for that year and the preceding two years, pro-rated if the credited service is less than 35 years.
D: Maximum Deemed Credited Service during Temporary Absences
For certain eligible periods of temporary absences, the Plan may be required to continue the accrual of credited service and benefits in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement between the Union and the Company, the Employment Standards Act (Ontario) and/or the Workers Compensation Act (Ontario).
For eligible temporary absences, other than absences when the employee is disabled, credited service may not be deemed for more than the full-time equivalent of 60 months in respect of all such periods of eligible temporary absences, plus an additional full-time equivalent of 36 months during which the employee has taken one or more periods of eligible parental leave, subject to a maximum of the full-time equivalent of 12 months with respect to any one period of eligible parental leave as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations.
ARTICLE X Service Awards
Paragraph 1O:Ol
Under the following terms and conditions, the Company will pay a Service Award:
(A)	an employee must have five (5) or more years of credited service;
(B)	an employee is no longer able to meet the requirements of his job and cannot qualify for transfer, under the terms of the Labour Agreement, to another job within the plant, and is
163
ineligible for any pension under the Pension Plan. The employee's qualifications are to be determined by the Company.
Paragraph l0:02
Any employee who becomes eligible for a Service Award under the conditions as stated in Paragraph 1O:Ol above shall have said Service Award calculated on the basis of a percentage of his aggregate earnings during his period of continuous service determined as follows: for an employee with at least five (5) and less than ten (10) years of continuous service - two percent (2%);
For an employee with at least ten (10) and less than fifteen (15) years of continuous service - two and one-half percent (2-l/2%);

Paragraph l0:05
An employee discharged for cause forfeits all rights to and is not eligible for a Service Award.
164
Paragraph 10:06
In the event that all operations of the employer at the plant covered by this Agreement shall be completely and permanently discontinued, an employee who is not offered like employment and/or a transfer in or to another substituted factory of the employer in Canada, and is released from employment as a result thereof, shall be entitled to early retirement (but no other benefit) without the consent of the Company, if such employee is otherwise eligible for early retirement under the provisions of the Pension Plan. If such employee is ineligible for a pension under such Pension Plan, and is ineligible for a Service Award under the Service Award Plan (but has five (5) or more years of continuous setvice), the Company will pay to such employee the Service Award (but no other benefit) which he would be eligible to receive if he were released from employment because he had become physically or mentally unable to perform the work of his classification or that of anotherclassification to which he might be eligible for transfer.
ARTICLE XI Appeals Procedure

(B)	received an Unemployment Insurance System Benefit not currently under protest by the Company or did not receive an Unemployment Insurance System Benefit for only one or more of the following reasons:
1.	He did not have, prior to layoff a sufficient
period of employment or earnings covered by the Unemployment Insurance System;
2.	Exhaustion of his Unemployment Insurance System Benefit rights;
3.	He was serving an Unemployment Insurance System “waiting week” while temporarily laid off out of line of seniority pending for a maximum period up to six weeks pending placement under the terms of the Collective Labour Agreement provided that the provisions of this Item (3) shall not be applicable to: 1) plant rearrangement, (2) inventory layoff.

5.	He refused a Company work offer which he has an option to refuse under the Collective
172
Labour Agreement or which he could refuse without disqualification.
6.	He was on layoff because he was unable to do work offered by the Company while able to do other work in the plant to which he would have been entitled if he had had sufficient seniority;
7.	He was denied an Employment Insurance Benefit solely because of the U.I. allocation to such week of earnings from a “waiting period”;

9.	He was required to take work under the Unemployment Insurance law paying less than 80% of his “weekly straight time pay”, while temporarily laid-off and waiting recall.
10.	He voluntarily took work paying less than 80% of his “weekly straight time pay”, while temporarily laid-off and waiting recall.

In situations where a number of employees had filed applications for benefits under substantially identical conditions, an appeal may be filed with respect to one of such employees and the decision thereon shall apply to all such employees. If there is no local Union or plant S.U.B. representative at the plant because of discontinuance of such plant, the appeal may be filed directly with the Board of Appeals.
Appeals concerning determination made in connection with Section 1 (B) (11) of Article I (contrary to intent of plan) shall be made directly to the Board. Such written appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days following the date of notice of such determination or denial or reduction of such benefit to such person, or within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing of a cheque of such smaller amount by the trustee to such person. The representative who receives said written appeal will promptly furnish one (1) copy to the representative of the other party. If either the Company representative or the Union representative shall find that such appeal is justified, he shall so notify the other representative and the Company representative and Union representative shall meet within ten (10) days from the date of the appeal (or such extended time as may be agreed upon) to determine the disposition of such appeal.

Such a request shall be in writing, shall specify the respects in which the Plan is claimed to have been violated and shall set forth the facts relied upon as justifying a reversal or modification of the determination appealed from. A copy of said request will be furnished to the Company representative. The Board of Appeals shall have no jurisdiction to act upon an appeal made after the time specified above or upon an appeal which does not otherwise comply with this Subparagraph. Subject to the limitations of Subparagraph (2) set forth below, the handling and disposition of such request to the Board of Appeals shall be in accordance with the regulations and procedures established by the Board.

(Appeal procedures under Unemployment Insurance law being the exclusive remedy therefor). The Board of Appeals shall have no power to determine questions arising under any Collective Labour Agreement, even though relevant to the issues before the Board.

203
close of business on the Friday preceding the first Monday of such month, as certified by the trustee, by the sum of (I) the number of employees on the active payroll and (II) the number of persons laid off from work who are not on the active payroll, but who have credit units, such total number to be that used in determining the maximum funding for such month in accordance with Paragraph (A) of this Section. The trust fund amount for the fund for any particular month commencing with March, 1958, shall be applied in connection with such fund for all purposes under the Plan to each of the pay periods beginning within such month.
(<2) Trust Fund Position
There shall be a trust fund position (stated as a percentage) for the fund for each calendar month commencing with the month of March, 1958.

The trust fund position for the fund for any particular month shall be applied in connection with such fund for all purposes under the Plan to each of the pay periods beginning within such month; provided, however, that after March 1,1958, whenever the trust fund position for the fund for any particular month is less than l0%, such trust fund position shall be applied in connection with such fund for all purposes under the plan only to the first pay period beginning within such month. And thereafter there shall be determined a trust fund position (stated as a percentage) for such fund for each pay period until the trust fund position for a particular pay period equals or exceeds 10%. When the trust fund position for a particular pay period equals or exceeds such percentage such trust position shall be
204
applied in connection with such fund for such purposes to each pay period until a trust fund position for the following calendar month shall be applicable pursuant to this Section. The trust fund position for the fund for a particular pay period shall be determined by dividing the current market value of the total assets in such fund as of the close of business on the Friday preceding such pay period, as certified by the trustee, by the maximum funding of such fund for such pay period.
(D) Finality of Determinations
No adjustment in the maximum funding, trust fund amount, or the trust fund position of the fund shall be made on account of any subsequently discovered error in the computations or the figures used in making the computations, except (I) in the case of an error in bad faith, or (II) in the case where after discovery of an error adjustment is practicable, and then the adjustment shall only be prospective in effect, unless such adjustment would be substantial in the opinion of the Company.

Neither the Company's contribution nor any benefit paid under the Plan shall be considered a part of any employee's wages for any purpose.

(C)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of the plan, the Company, with the consent of the Union, may make such revisions in the Plan not inconsistent with the purpose, structure, and basic provisions thereof as shall be necessary to obtain or maintain any rulings required under the Plan. Any such revision shall adhere as closely as possible to the language and intent of the Plan.
