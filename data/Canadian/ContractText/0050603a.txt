An employee shall have either Saturday or Sunday as one of two (2) consecutive days off.
(b)	In scheduling such regular work week the Company agrees there shall be no split shifts.

day as scheduled by the Company from time to time will be paid at the rate of time and one-half his regular straighttime hourly rate. An employee will be paid at the rate of two times his regular straight-time hourly rate for any hours worked on a day which should have been a day off pursuant to Article 16.01. There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of any premium payment provided for under the terms of this Agreement, nor shall the same hours worked be counted as part of the regular work week and also as hours for which an overtime premium is payable. An employee will be notified of overtime work’ not later than (2) hours before completion of the shift where possible.
(b)(i) Authorized work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in a day will be scheduled on a seniority basis to employees in the respective job classifications of the Distribution Centre concerned of the shift on duty, provided such employees have the physical fitness, skill and ability to do the work.

Every employee who is willing to work overtime in his Distribution Centre must indicate this by signing the D.O.L. opposite his name as soon as possible each day but no later than the end of his lunch period, indicating the amount of overtime he would be willing to work. Employees who do not indicate the length of their availability will be considered available for the full overtime requirement.
Daily overtime requirements will be distributed as evenly-as possible among as many of those employees as possible in accordance with Article 16.02 (b)(i). However, those employees who fail to sign the D.O.L. by the end of their lunch period will not under normal circumstances be considered for the distribution of overtime.
When, for various reasons such as absenteeism, weather conditions, machine breakdowns, business fluctuations etc. the number of employees who have signed the D.O.L. is not sufficient to meet a Distribution Centre’s requirements, or, in situations where the response to the D.O.L. is greater than the overtime requirements, the Company will re-post the D.O.L. at least three (3) hours before the end of the shift concerned where possible, indicating the reason for the overtime and including an estimate of the number of hours of overtime, additional or otherwise, required to finish the day's work.
Those employees who intend to sign the Re-posted List must do so at least two (2) hours before the end of the shift.
Those employees, who did not sign the List prior to the end of their lunch period, who in view of the circumstances reconsider their position, should so signify by sinning, the Re-posted List. In the event that there are still insufficient numbers of volunteers to meet the overtime requirements, then employees may have to be scheduled in accordance with 16.02 (b)(i) in reverse order of
27
seniority. The Company will endeavour to utilize in a Distribution Centre those employees listed on the Daily Overtime Lists of the other Distribution Centres, bv seniority provided such employees have the physical fitness, skill and ability to do the work, before scheduling employees to work overtime.

Where the Company indicates at the time of the re-posting that more employees than are required have signed the D.O.L., then employees who signed the List but who in view of the circumstances reconsider their position and no longer wish to be considered for overtime, should so signify on the re-posted list.
The Company will advise those employees who sign the D.O.L. (or if amicable the Re-posted List) whether or not they will be needed to work overtime not later than two (2) hours before the completion of the shift concerned where possible. An employee having indicated his willingness to work overtime but who subsequently reconsiders, must, one (1) hour in advance of the end of his regular shift where possible, notify his immediate supervisor before leaving the Distribution Centre.

(ii) An extra day overtime list (E.D.O.L.) will be posted in each Distribution Centre by 12:00 noon on Monday (or the following day if Monday is a holiday), and removed by 12 noon on Wednesday of each week. Employees' names will be listed by classification in order of seniority. Each employee shall indicate his willingness to work an extra day by signing the E.D.O.L. in the appropriate space opposite his name in any or all of the columns marked Friday, Saturday and Sunday. An employee who is absent from work when the E.D.O.L. is posted may authorize another employee to co-sign the E.D.O.L. on his behalf, and will be considered for such extra day overtime, if the co-signer signs his own name as well to verify his authorization. The extra day overtime schedule will be posted by 1:00 p.m. on Thursday for Friday, and by 1:00 p.m. on Friday for Saturday/ Sunday, where possible.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union 15 Gervais Drive DON MILLS, Ontario M3C 1Y8
Attention: Mr. D. Garvey Temporary Modified Work Program
Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the understanding reached by the parties with respect to the currency of the Collective Agreement dated the 21st day of February, 1989, relating to the temporary modified work program.
An employee temporarily unable to perform his previous duties due to an injury received in the employ of the Company or due to an illness or injury for which he is in receipt of benefits under the Long Term Disability insurance Plan, who has been authorized to return to work under temporary medical restriction, and once he has provided the Company with twenty-four (24) hours’ advance notification of his pending return to work, may be assigned to a temporary modified work program and given such other work as is available and which he is capable of performing. To be eligible for such modified work the employee must produce appropriate authorization in the form of an authentic Doctor’s Certificate from the attending physician. If sufficient medical statement is not provided, the Company may request, initially and at intervals during the program, further reports from the attending physician or through a Company arranged medical examination.
Assignments under the Temporary Modified Work Program may be of the following nature, provided they do
54
not exceed sixteen (16) worked days and provided no full time employees are displaced from their regular job:
(a)	Temporary assignment, as per 22.01, to a lighter or
more suitable class of work for rehabilitative purposes.
(b)	Temporary transfer as per the Letter of Understanding to another Distribution Centre which provides a work environment or conditions more suitable for rehabilitative purposes.
(c)	Temporary shift change, as par JUT) where the modi-
fied work assignment for rehabilitative purposes requires the shift change. In such instance the employee will not be considered to have exercised his shift preference, and will not bump any employee presently on that shift.
(d)	Temporarily reduced work schedule, with reference to 16.01 (a) for rehabilitative purposes. Such modified schedule may require co-ordination with the Workers’ Compensation Board and therefore must be co-ordinated by the Health and Safety Department.
Since the intent of the program is to provide for the needs of employees who, as a result of injury, are not fully qualified on a temporary basis with respect to physical fitness, in each of the above applications the seniority provision of the relevant articles of the Collective Agreement will not normally prevail. Therefore the Distribution Centre Managers (or their appointees) will review the nonmedical work related aspects of each case or assignment with the representative of the Grievance Committee from the Distribution Centre concerned and the Chief Steward or his appointee, and will waive related seniority provisions, or extend the above time frames, only with the consent of these representatives.
55
In administering a Modified Work Program, both Company and Union will strive to curb or correct any potential abuse of the program. Should it appear that the best interest of the Company or it's employees are not being served, either party may at any time, with written notice, temporarily or permanently withdraw from the aforementioned program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the program is subject to review and evaluation by the parties listed in the preceding paragraph twice annually.

(ii)	An employee shall be allowed payment for one (1) day of sickness in each three (3) month period during a calendar year, up to a maximum of four (4) days in a calendar year, with such days to be applied towards the first two (2) days of an employee’s absence for which there otherwise is no provision for payment. Should such day not be used in the first of subsequent periods, it may be carried over for useage in other periods, but only one such day may be carried over beyond the end of a calendar year for useage in the first
- 57 -
quarter only of the following year. There shall be no payment for unused benefits. In order to qualify for the above provisions, the employee must:
(1)	be eligible for and have outstanding entitlement to sick benefits in accordance with Appendix “B”, from which schedule the above provisions flow.
(2)	notify the Company of his sickness no later than his scheduled starting time.
(b)	The parties agree that should an employee, having taken sick during a leave of absence, advise the Company in writing while at his permanent residence or from an Ontario hospital that he will be unable to return to work at the conclusion of his leave of absence, such employee shall receive sick benefits in accordance with the Sick Benefit Plan dating from the conclusion of his leave of absence, and on the condition that he provides the Company with suitable medical documentation.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union 15 Gervais Drive DON MILLS, Ontario M3C 1Y8
Attention: Mr. D. Garvey
Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the understanding reached by the parties during negotiations with respect to the currency of the Collective Agreement dated the 21st day of February, 1989, relating to the matter of job redundancies:
(a)	Unit:
Consists of all employees covered by the Collective Agreement referred to above.
(b)	Transfer:
Process whereby an employee, surplus at one Distribution Centre, is absorbed elsewhere in the Unit.
(c)	Lay-off:
Process whereby an employee surplus at one Distribution Centre results in the lay-off from full time hours of a full time employee, in most cases of the most junior full time employee in the Unit.
(d)	Plant Closure:
In the event a Distribution Centre closes, employees of that Distribution Centre shall be entitled to displace junior employees elsewhere in the Unit, subject to the requirements of Article 3.03. Any employee so displaced shall be subject to either the transfer procedure or the lay-off procedure as defined above. The foregoing shall not apply in the case of the re-location of a Distribution Centre.
- 63 -
General Procedure:
The first step is to determine if a surplus of employees exists, and if so, in what job classification. The second step is to determine whether employees can be absorbed elsewhere in the Unit. If they can, then the Transfer procedure should be used; if they cannot, then the Lay-off procedure should be used. Depending on the circumstances, it may be possible and necessary to use both procedures at the same time.
Transfer Procedure:
To be employed when a surplus exists in a job classification in a Distribution Centre which as an end result will not cause the lay-off of an employee, such employee being absorbed elsewhere in the Unit.
Example:
A Receiver is surplus at Distribution Centre “A”. A General Warehouseman is required at Distribution Centre “B”.
Objective:
To reclassify employees downward, possibly across the Unit, commencing with the surplus Receiver and culminating with the filling of the General Warehouseman vacancy.
Procedure:
(1)	Most junior Receiver at Distribution Centre ‘A” decides whether he wants tojoump junior Receivers at other locations if such "exist.” '
(2)	If #1 is not possible, or if the Receiver in H\ wishes to remain in Distribution Centre “A", he will determine what other classifications in Distribution Centre “A” have employees junior to himself, and providing he has the requisite qualifications as set out in Article
- 64 -
3.03, will displace the most junior employee in the desired classification.
(3)	The procedure as described in (1) and (2) above will continue for such displaced employee until the employee who has no bumping privileges in his own classification througHountre Unit or other classifications within his Distribution Centre is determined. Such employee shall be placed in the vacancy of General Warehouseman as provided in the above example.
(4)	Should, within three (3) months following the transfer of an employee under this procedure, the position from which the employee was transfer&d be re-introduced, all affected employees will be returned to their former positions.
Lay-off Procedure:
To be employed when a surplus exists in a job classification in a Distribution Centre which as an end result will cause the lay-off of an employee(s) in the Unit.
Example:
Three Receivers are surplus at Distribution Centre “A”. The three most junior employees in the Unit are a General Warehouseman and a Selector at Distribution Centre “B” and a General Warehouseman at Distribution Centre “‘A”.
Objective:
To reclassify employees downward across the Unit commencing with the three surplus Receivers to fill the vacancies created by the lay-off of the three most junior employees.
Procedure:
(1)	The three most junior employees in the Unit as described above are given notice of lay-off as per the
- 65 -
Collective Agreement and the Employment Standards Act.
(2)	Using a hierarchy of job classifications, the three most junior receivers of the Distribution Centre in which the surplus exists should be given an opportunity to be reclassified to the next lower job classification anywhere in the Unit in which there are employees with seniority less than that of the receivers.
(3)	The emDlovees displaced bv the above Receivers (they being the most junior employees in their own job classifications within the Unit) shall be dealt with in the same manner, and so forth,. until the positions vacated by the two General Warehousemen and the Selector, who have been laid off, are filled.
(4)	Should the Company determine at any point of the procedure that an employee to be reclassified does not have the qualifications as set out in Article 3.03 for a position, it shall so advise such employee and reclassify him to the next lower classification for which he is qualified and in which resides a junior employee.
(5)	Should an employee at any point of the procedure refuse to be reclassified to the next lower classification as stipulated and for which he is qualified, that employee shall be the one to be laid-off.
