2.	Fellers and buckers may be required to continue cutting, in which case this may be done on their regular cutting strip until such time as it interferes with their ability to earn bonus.
At this point, they will move to another strip other than the one on which they were working at the time of breakdown. In so doing, all hours worked on the separate strip shall be kept separate and apart from any hours worked on incentive bonus and all wood produced during such time will be considered the Employer’s wood and will not be included with the wood produced on bonus.
With reference to all of the foregoing, the Skidder Operator shall be required to make every reasonable effort to immediately notify the Supervisor.
19
(b)	All other employees shall be governed by the following breakdown clause:
An employee reporting for work as directed shall not be sent home because there is no work available due to a mechanical breakdown. In such cases, the employee will be offered alternate work (which may include cutting under Schedule C) to complete the first day of such reporting, at his regular rate of pay or the prevailing rate for the job performed, whichever is higher.
In 11.08 (a) and 11.08 (b), alternate work shall be offered for the next shift. In such cases, the employee shall be paid at his regular rate for such alternate work. In both of the foregoing clauses, if it becomes necessary to change an employee’s shift, in order to offer such alternate employment, the Employer will not be subject to the penalty provided for in Clause 11.04 (f) 1. of this Agreement.
Furthermore, in both of the foregoing clauses, should an employee refuse to perform the alternate employment, he loses his rights to the provisions contained herein.
If no alternate work is available, the employee shall be paid the shifts referred to above at his regular rate.
With reference to all of the foregoing, the employee must remain available for work.
Where any breakdown continues for more than the shifts referred to above and no other suitable work is available, the employee shall be offered cutting under Schedule C but shall not lose his seniority if he elects not to accept it.
If the breakdown continues for more than one full week beyond the week in which the breakdown occurs, or if, as a result of the breakdown, a decision is made to phase out the broken down machinery, the employee may, if he so desires, exercise his seniority as per Article 12.
Any employee who elects not to exercise his seniority or accept the alternate work will be laid off. Recall will be in accordance with Clause 12.01.
Note - for the purpose of this Article, power saws are not considered to be machines.
Note: In the application of the above an employee can be offered cutting under Schedule “C” if he has seniority days in the cutting classification and he is properly equipped to do the job.

An employee on commuter operations shall be deemed to have reported for work when he arrives at the marshalling point. This Clause does not apply when the reason for non-commencement is due to Acts of God.
11.11	- An employee who, when recalled, reports for work as directed and no work is available, shall be paid for all regular working hours spent waiting to go to work at the rate of the job for which he was recalled. It is understood the employee can be offered alternate employment and, if refused, he is not entitled to any payment.
ARTICLE 12 - Seniority
12.01	-
(i)	The Company recognizes the principle of seniority, so that in promotions, demotions, transfers, layoffs, and recalls from lay-offs, seniority shall govern subject to the employee having the ability to perform the work required. In the application of the above, and where all other conditions of this Article are met, the junior employee shall at all times be the first laid off and the last recalled.
(ii)	(a) There shall be two (2) types of seniority:
(a)	Total Seniority
(b)	Classification Seniority
(b) In 1993 a ranking system was instituted based on the established list of seniority in effect on May 1, 1993.
Effective September 4, 2005, a new ranking list is established. This new list replaces the ranking list established on May 1, 1993.
Any employee hired since May 1, 1993, will have their seniority ranked from the date of hire.
All new employees will have their seniority ranked upon completion of their probationary period to the date of hire.
The rank for employees transferred from PCT to logging will be based on their date of transfer.
21
(c)	Subject to conditions stipulated in 12.02, employees will accumulate seniority for all time worked in a particular classification, it being understood that an employee may have more than one type of Classification Seniority. When an employee is absent as per 12.02, the employee will accrue seniority in the classification he held at the time of departure.
(d)	When considering seniority for promotions and demotions, the first consideration shall be Classification Seniority. Where Classification Seniority is equal, position on the ranking list will be considered. For the purpose of recall and lay-off, the first consideration shall be an employee’s position on the ranking list amongst those with Classification Seniority.
It is recognized in principle that an employee listed in a classification as per 12.01 ii) c) meets the requirements of 12.01 i).
(e)	When a temporary vacancy of less than one (1) month occurs on an operation, it will be filled by transferring, by order of seniority in that classification, an employee not working in the classification.
If the vacancy continues beyond the time limit specified above, or as soon as possible when it is known that the absence will be for more than one (1) month, the position will be filled by the employee with the most classification seniority in the commuting area who is not working in that classification at that time and wishes to accept the position.
(f)	The employee transferred on a temporary basis will continue to accumulate seniority in his previous classification if the placement is temporary in nature. If he remains in the position, he will accumulate seniority in the new classification from the date he was originally transferred.
(g)	The decision on the part of the employee not to accept a position when offered will not affect his seniority in that classification should future opportunities become available.
(h)	If it is known at the beginning of a calendar year that a senior employee on the ranking list will not be recalled while, a junior employee on the ranking list will be because of classification seniority rights, the Company will find alternate work for the senior employee during that year.
i) When it becomes necessary to displace an employee from a classification, the employee with the least amount of classification seniority will be displaced from that classification and that employee will have the right to bump the most junior employee in another classification in which he has classification seniority.
22
If the displaced employee has insufficient classification seniority to exercise his bumping rights, then in lieu of a lay-off he may bump the employee with the least ranking seniority among those employees who have less ranking seniority than him within the classifications where he is classified.
12.02	- Total seniority for the purpose of this Agreement shall mean all days worked plus working days which normally would have been worked but were lost because of vacation, sickness, or injury (certified by a licensed physician, dentist, chiropractor, optometrist, or registered nurse in an outport hospital or clinic) and authorized leaves of absence up to a maximum of thirty (30) days in any calendar year.
An employee who has accrued seniority and is then employed by the Union, or is on authorized leave of absence on Union business, shall accrue seniority for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months. An employee who has accrued seniority and is then employed in a management position shall accrue seniority for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months. In both cases, twelve (12) months dating from when the first such change of employment status took place, unless one (1) year has expired since the last change of employment status.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, sub-foremen shall accrue and retain seniority while working in that capacity, it being understood and agreed that sub-foremen are within the bargaining unit.
12.03	- An employee shall be entered on the seniority list once he has completed his probationary period as per Clause 5.10.
12.04	- When the approximate time of recall is known at the time of lay-off, employees will be informed of such approximate date. An employee will be called by telephone or notice will be sent to his given address with as much notice as is possible before the employee will be required to report for work. Each employee will be required to report for work on the date specified unless other arrangements have been made. It is the employee’s responsibility to notify the Employer of any change in his detailed address and telephone number.
If an employee fails to report for work or does not acknowledge recall, in either case, with satisfactory reasons, he shall be given the right to exercise his seniority after giving the Employer one week’s notice regarding his availability for work.
In recalling employees after a general shut down, the Employer shall be allowed a leeway of ten (10) days during the period of recall. The Employer will only exercise the 10-day leeway when to do otherwise would cause hardship to an employee or seriously hamper the Company operations. It is understood and agreed that the provision of 10 days leeway does not apply to any work that may become available during the period of general shutdown, nor following temporary lay off such as may be caused by weather and the conditions following therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when emergency jobs of
23
short duration have to be done during periods of shutdown, the Company will not be required to recall the most senior employees.
12.05	- An employee who has established seniority shall lose all seniority if he:
1.	Quits the employ of the Company.

At the end of the applicable period, if still disabled, he will cease to accrue seniority and will retain seniority accrued at that time. It is to be understood that a medical certificate of fitness shall be required for purpose of rehiring if eligible.
12.07	- Employees who have to leave the job because of personal injury or sickness shall, when cleared for work in accordance with 12.06, return to the job from which he left if same is continuing, or to a job in which his seniority entitles him. However, should a lay-off occur while the employee is off on accident or sick, he shall then be recalled in the same manner, with the same conditions applying as all other employees.
12.08	- Days referred to in this Article are working days.
12.09	- In the case of a planned general shutdown, a notice will be posted on all bulletin boards in areas where the shutdown applies. In cases of lay-off other than those caused by Acts of God, employees shall be given one (1) week’s written notice of such lay-off or one (1) week’s pay in lieu thereof. For the purpose of this Agreement, an Act of God shall include weather conditions and any other conditions over which the Company does not have control.
12.10	- Lists of names of the employees for whom seniority is established as above shall be submitted to the Union office within thirty (30) days following the end of the quarter, showing accumulated seniority as of the quarter’s end.

If the employee fails to be classified, he will return to work in the position that his seniority entitles him.
12.13	- In cases of lay-off or recall, the Job Steward will be given preference of employment over all other employees . However, the Job Steward will be employed in the classification where there is the most junior classified employee amongst the classifications where the Job Steward has classification seniority. This provision will only apply where a Job Steward is being laid off or recalled on an operation where he was originally elected as Job Steward.
The above provisions will only apply if the Job Steward is a regular employee (thirty (30) days or more of seniority).
12.14	- When lay-offs are required due to the completion of seasonal operations, or a part thereof, each employee so affected will be permitted to exercise his seniority to transfer to another job, if he so desires, subject to the principles of Clause 12.01.

To qualify for a classification, an employee must have worked a minimum of eighty (80) days in that classification.
