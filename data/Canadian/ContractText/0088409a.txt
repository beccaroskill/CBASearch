Dear Wayne:
Re: Collins & Aikman - Port Hope Facility
The future viability of the Collins & Aikman facility in Port Hope (the “Port Hope Facility”), has been subject to ongoing negotiations with the United Steelworkers (the “Negotiations”).
In this regard, we confirm that the Port Facility will continue to supply Brampton Assembly Plant for the duration of the next generation LX product life which is currently scheduled to launch in calendar year 2010 and run to approximately 2015. This timeframe and commitment is based on current market forecast and demand for the product. We acknowledge that you are relying on this letter for the purposes of the Negotiations.
This written agreement shall remain confidential and not be printed with the collective agreement however should there be a dispute to which this letter is relevant then the parties agree that it is incorporated by reference into the collective agreement and may be used at arbitration, before the Ontario Labour Relations Board or in such other litigation as may arise between the United Steelworkers’ members at Port Hope and their employer or the undersigned or its affiliates.
Yours truly CHRYSLER LLC
