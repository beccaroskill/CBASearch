The Company agrees to meet with the Union six (6) months prior to the commencement of the sixth year of this agreement.
The objective of the parties will be to review the ongoing viability of the Company’s operation. The review will include methods of mining, tonnes produced, sales and price of coal.
Upon completion of the review and where sales meet or exceed 4.5 million tonnes annually, the parties agree on October 1, 2000, to review and adjust the sixth year wage increase from three percent (3%) to the Canadian Consumer Price Index (C.P.I.) where the October 1, 2000, annual Canadian Consumer Price Index has exceeded three percent (3%) but in no case will the wage adjustment exceed 4%.
HI. The parties agree to amend the short term disability insurance provision, Article 18.02, as follows:
18.02 Short Term Disability Insurance:
The Company will pay the entire cost of insurance to cover absence from work due to sickness or non occupational accident to the extent that eligible employees will receive a benefit for work time lost equivalent to the Unemployment Insurance Commission’s maximum weekly disability income benefit.
Benefits will be payable for scheduled work days missed up to a maximum of 26 weeks payable from the first work day lost due to accident, the first work day lost due to hospitalization, and from the fourth work day lost due to sickness. For employees on the 12 hour shift schedule, benefit will be payable for the third work day lost due to sickness. For employees on the Underground 32 hourweekend schedule, benefit will be payable from the 2nd work day lost due to sickness. Once an employee qualifies for benefits, as outlined above for sickness, the benefit will be payable from the first work day missed. In no event will retroactivity be considered for more than 3 calendar days prior to the actual date the employee is first seen and personally treated by a physician.
No benefit will be payable for any day on which the employee is performing work of any kind for compensation or profit.
The benefit payable will provide an average of $500 per week in the first, second and third year; and $550 per week in the fourth and fifth year; and $575 per week in the sixth year of this Agreement. As it is the intent to compensate an employee for scheduled days of work lost only, the following will apply:
1.	Those employees on a 5x2 shift will receive $100 per work day lost in the first, second and third year; $110 per work day lost in the fourth and fifth year; and $115 per work day lost in the sixth year.
2.	Those employees on a 4x4 shift will receive $142.47 per work day lost in the first, second and third year; $156.72 per work day lost in the fourth and fifth year; and $163.84 per work day lost in the sixth year.

3.	Those employees on the Underground 32 hour weekend schedule will
receive $187.50 per Saturday lost, $187.50 per Sunday lost and $125 per Monday lost in the first, second and third year; $206.25 per Saturday lost, $206.25 per Sunday lost and $137.50 per Monday lost in the fourth and fifth year; and $215.63 per Saturday lost, $215.63 per Sunday lost and $143.74 per Monday lost in the sixth year.
It is to be understood that in the event of abuse, apart from disciplinary action, the payment set above will not be made. Prior to any benefits being made for absence due to sickness, the employee must produce a doctor’s certificate verifying the illness, and, if required, written authorization permitting access to the doctor’s medical records concerning the specific illness.
The Company shall retain full value of any Unemployment Insurance Commission premium reduction that may be granted.
