FISHERY PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
BARGAINING UNIT PENSION PLAN
INTRODUCTION
Having sufficient income to meet your financial needs when you reach retirement age is increasingly important to all Canadians. Your government benefits, such as the Canada Pension Flan and Old Age Security, will meet part cf your requirements, but in order to face the challenge cf maintaining a comfortable lifestyle after retirement, other sources of income are necessary. One important additional source cf income is your Fishery Products International Limited (FPI) Pension Pian for unionized employees. This Plan, combined with government benefits and your own savings, will go a long way toward ensuring a secure retirement.
HOW DO I BECOME A MEMBER?
Participation in the Pension Pian is mandatory for all employees who are members cf the Fishermen, Food and Allied Workers Union or CAW Canada, who have been employed continuously for twoyears by FPI and have reached age 21. You will be notified by the Human Resources Department when you are eligible to join.
WHAT DOES THE PLAN COST?
FPI pays all costs related to the Pension Flan, including its administration.
WHEN DO PENSION BENEFITS START?
Your normal retirement date is the first day cf the month following your 65th. birthday. If your birthday falls on the first day cf a month, your Pension begins that day.
You can also retire anytime followingyour 55th. birthday, but the monthly amount cf Pension you receive will be reduced by 6% for each full year prior to your normal retirement date. For example, ifyour normal retirement date isJune 1,1998 andyour actual date cf retirement is June 1,1996, your monthly Pension benefit will be reduced by 12%.
HOW IS MY PENSION DETERMINED?
112
Your Pension is based on a system cf units. If you work in a plant each unit is equal to 1,800 hours cf work. If you work on a trawler, 120 sea-days is equal to a unit. You may earn up to 1.5 irdts in any calendar year. If you work less than 1,800 hours in a plant or 120 days at sea, you will receive a portion of a unit.
