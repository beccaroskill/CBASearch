Article 1
PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
1.01	It is the intent and purpose of the Parties to establish, as herein set forth, their full Agreement covering wages, hours of work and other working conditions and to provide procedure for the prompt and equitable adjustment of grievances.
Article 2
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT
2.01	This Agreement covers:
a)	All employees of Wabush Mines, Pickands Mather &Co., Managing Agent, located at Wabush, Labrador Newfoundland except office employees, medical and safety staff, chemists, guards and security personnel, foremen and those above the rank of foreman, students, professional and technical employees, cookery and camp employees, janitors, bakery and laundry workers; and
b)	All employees of Wabush Lake Railway Company, Limited, working on installation, maintenance and operation of the railroad and facilities, except office workers, guards and security personnel, foremen and those above the rank of foreman, students and professional and technical employees.
2.02	As used herein “students” means a person attending a high school, technical school, college or university, who may be employed by the Company during a regular school vacation for temporary work, but who shall attain no rights under this Agreement.
2.03	Supervisory personnel will not perform production or maintenance jobs normally performed by employees in the bargaining unit except under the following circumstances:
a)	For instruction or training,
b)	In experimentation with respect to process or operation,
7
c)	For testing new machinery or new equipment, or assisting employees in testing repaired machinery or equipment.
d)	In case of emergency affecting the safety of employees, damage to equipment or adversely affecting operations, for such time as is necessary to overcome the emergency.
e)	Where the work is incidental to supervisory duties. If a supervisor performs work in violation of this Section and the nature and extent of the work and the employee who would have performed it can be established, that employee will be paid an allowance equal to the standard straight time rate appropriate to the work performed, for the time actually worked or for four (4) hours, whichever is the greater.
A grievance alleging violation of this Section may be filed by the Union directly at Step No. 2 of the Grievance Procedure. In the event such a grievance is appealed to an Arbitrator he shall, if violation of this Section is established, be empowered to order payment of the aforementioned allowance.
2.04	It is general policy of the Company not to contract out production or maintenance work that is normally performed by members of the bargaining unit, However, abnormal circumstances may arise that require such contracting out. When the Company contemplates and decides to contract out production or maintenance work that has not previously been contracted out, it shall give the Union as early written notice as is feasible but no later than twenty (20) days before the contract is awarded, providing details of the work to be contracted out. When the Company cannot give twenty (20) days notice, a verbal notice will be given immediately it becomes feasible to do so. On receipt of such notice, the Union may request a meeting to discuss the possibility of qualified employees and available equipment starting and completing the work within the required time. Such a meeting
8
may be attended by three (3) representatives of the Union and will be held within five (5) days of the notice. The Union Representatives will suffer no loss of pay for the time spent at such a meeting.
In no case will the Company contract out production or maintenance work while employees who normally perform that work are laid off or reduced as a result of a decrease in the work they normally performed or that would result in the reduction or layoff of such employees. No employees of any contractor will displace the regular production and maintenance employees.
Even though notice from the Company will not be required in the case of continuing work which has been contracted out in the past, the Company will notify the Union when a new contract is to be made foe work which has been contracted out in the past and will, upon request, meet the Union concerning such work. Any alleged violation of the provisions of this Section or of an agreement between the Parties reached at a meeting to discuss contracting out shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure. Similarly, in the event the Parties fail to reach an agreement at such meeting, the matter will be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
An employee who has been laid off and not recalled or who is displaced in violation of the provisions of this article may file a grievance for the pay he claims to have lost.
When a contractor performs work on site beyond the scope of work outlined in the aforementioned notice to the Union, an employee may submit a grievance at Step 2 in accordance with the provisions of paragraph!.03 of the Collective Agreement. If the Company has not taken corrective action within twenty-four (24) hours of having been notified of the alleged violation any claim payable will apply from the date the grievance was filed.

On or after the date of execution of this Agreement, employees hired on the same day will be placed on seniority lists in the order of their hiring times during the day,
16

For all jobs of equal classification in a line of promotion, an employee shall have job continuous service he has in any one of these jobs. However, when a new job is placed in a line of promotion, employees in a higher or equal classification in that line will not have greater job continuous service than the date of the first permanent assignment to the new job.
8.03	Lines of promotion have been set up within each Department and one or more of these lines constitutes a Department Job Group, as shown on appendix “C” of this Agreement.

Maintenance Job Group Ore Dressing Job Group Mining Job Group Railroad Job Group
b) All jobs classified in Job Class 3 and below will be in the labour pools.

8.05	The Company shall post new continuous service lists, based upon the records of the Company as of each April 1st and October 1st, setting forth the date of continuous service with the company and the date of continuous service in the lines of promotion for each employee who has attained such continuous service.

8.06	An employee who believes that his continuous service date or his relative position on a continuous service list is incorrect shall notify the Industrial Relations Department in writing within four (4) weeks following the date the list is posted.

8.08	Following settlement of any grievance under the provisions of section 8.06 and 8.07 and where no protest has been made, the continuous service lists shall be considered binding. The posting of subsequent lists shall not serve to open any question as to the validity of any preceding lists.

An employee shall be terminated for any of the following reasons:
a)	Quit;
b)	Discharge; e) Retirement:

pany, of his intention to return from lay-off or, having so notified the Company, failure to return to work within twelve (12) days following receipt by the Company of the notice that he intends to return to work.
8.10	Establishing Lines of Promotion
Promotional lines as referred to in Section 8.03 are intended to provide channels for purposes of promotion and demotion giving consideration to logical work relationships. It is the objective that each job in a line of promotion will provide opportunities for each employee to receive on-the-job training and prepare themselves for the job immediately above in that line of promotion. Where possible, without conflicting with the foregoing objective, the jobs within these lines of promotion shall be in ascending order of standard hourly wage rates.
8.11	If new jobs are established, the Company shall place them in the most appropriate Department Job Group, or if more appropriate, establish a new Department Job Group. In the event the C.W.S. Committee cannot agree on the placement of jobs in the lines of promotion, the Union may file a grievance at Step No. 2 of the Grievance Procedure within fifteen (15) days of the date the C.W.S. Committee declares that it is unable to reach agreement.
8.12	Promotion
For the purposes of promotion, the following factors will be considered:
a)	Length of continuous service,
b)	Physical fitness,
c)	Ability to perform the job concerned.
If two or more employees meet the Company’s requirements in factors b) and c) then a), length of continuous service, shall govern.
20
8.13	a) Vacancies resulting from termination in accordance with Section 8,09, permanent promotion or demotion and the creation of new jobs shall be considered as permanent.
b)	Vacancies resulting from absenteeism, illness, injury, suspension or leave of absence will be considered as permanent if they last longer than (15) fifteen shifts.
c)	Vacancies such as those in b) preceding, which last less than fifteen (15) shifts, vacancies which are caused by annual vacation and those which exist while permanent vacancies are being filled, shall be considered as temporary.
d)	An employee whose absence has created a permanent vacancy shall be placed in his former job on his return.
8.14	When there is a requirement for more employees than have been scheduled on a shift, employees of the classifications, who regularly perform the work involved, will first be given the opportunity to perform the work.
8.15	If the Company decides to fill a permanent vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled, by an employee capable of doing the job, in the following order of priority:
a)	By recall to thejob, in which the vacancy exists, of the employee having the most job continuous service in the job and who was reduced from that job or from any other equal or higher job in that line of promotion, or, if none:
b)	By the employee with the most Company continuous service currently in a job of equal classification in the same line of promotion and who has expressed his desire to fill such vacancy by completion of a form, furnished by the Company, or who is in a job directly below in the same line of promotion, or who has been reduced from a job directly below in the same line of promotion, or if none, by the employee with the most
21
Company continuous service, in the next successively lower job in such line or who has been reduced from it, or if none;
c)	By job posting under the provisions of Section 8.18, except that a vacancy in a labour pool or in a trade or craft job shall not be posted.
When an employee who is selected to fill a permanent vacancy in accordance with b), above is prevented from starting work in his new job, because of personal reasons, the job will be filled temporarily for 45 calendar days by the next eligible employee in the line of promotion. If the employee is still unable to be assigned to the job after 45 days, the employee who has been temporarily assigned will be assigned permanently.
8.16	An employee who is not on Mine Equipment or has not previously been trained on Mine Equipment and who believes he has the capacity and physical fitness to operate Mine Equipment may apply in writing to the Company at any time. Applicants, who meet the Company's qualifications as listed below, will be selected for training on the basis of continuous service when the Company conducts a Mine Equipment 'Training Course. They must;
a)	Elold a valid driver's license for the Province of Newfoundland.
b)	Be at least 19 years of age
c)	Be in all respects physically Tit to perform the work. Upon satisfactory completion of such a course, an employee will be returned to his regular job and he will automatically be considered as having applied to fill a permanent vacancy as a Tractor-Grader Operator or Production Truck Driver in the Mine Department when such vacancies are posted in accordance with Section 8.18. If he is selected to fill the vacancy in accordance with the promotion provisions of this Agreement, he will be assigned to the job.
22
Until he fills a vacancy, he may be assigned to refresher training at intervals of no less than six (6) months. An employee whose performance in such a course is unsatisfactory will be returned to his regular job and will no longer be eligible for the course.
8.17	An employee who believes that he has the requisite qualifications and ability for filling a vacancy in a Trade or Craft job may make application in writing to the Company at any time, setting forth his experience, knowledge and training in relation to the trade or craft. Such applicants will be considered when the Company decides to fill such vacancies and will be selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.12.
8.18	a) When it is necessary to fill a vacancy under 8.15 c), it will be posted for five (5) days. An employee may apply for the job on a form furnished by the Company within this five (5) day period. Within five (5) days following the posting and application period, the Company will post the name of the employee selected. Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays shall be excluded from the time limits referred to in this paragraph.
An employee not in a labour pool shall only be entitled to make application for an equal or higher rated job or for a job which is in a line having a higher rated job than exists in his current line of promotion except that:
1.	Any employee may apply for a Helper job;
2.	An employee may make application for any posted job if he has been permanently assigned in his current line of promotion for at least six (6)months. However, an employee who posts to a lower rated job in his current line of promotion shall then forfeit his job seniority in all jobs which are higher rated than the job to which he has posted. Also, an employee who posts to a job which he has previously held will not be given credit for any previous seniority date he may have held in that job.
23
b)	If an employee, applying for a posted job, has had no opportunity to demonstrate his ability to perform the job, his ability to absorb the training for the job, as demonstrated by his work record with the Company, shall be taken into consideration.
c)	A copy of each job posting and the name of the applicant selected will be given to the Union.
8.19	a) An employee selected on a job posting for a single vacancy but who, solely to meet Company needs, is unable to start work on the new job while it is being filled on a temporary basis shall be paid at the higher of his old rate, or the rate of the new job for work performed after the commencement of the next work schedule following the date of the notice of his selection.
b) If, solely to meet Company needs, an employee selected on a job posting is unable to start work on the new job on the same date as other employees selected on the same posting, while that vacancy is being filled on a temporary basis, he shall be paid retroactively at the higher of his old rate or the rate of the new job for the period between his acquired job continuous service date, as defined in Section 8.02 b), and his actual performance of work on the new job.
8.20	An employee before proceeding on vacation or leave of absence not exceeding thirty-five (35) days, may make application for the job in which he is interested and which may become vacant during his absence. He shall be considered as an applicant for such job should the job be posted during his absence and provided he meets the current qualifications of !he job before leaving on vacation or leave of absence.
8.21	If no employee qualified for promotion makes application for a posted job or trade or craft vacancy the Company shall be free to fill such job by other means.
24
8.22	When the Company fills a temporary vacancy it will use it to provide training for employees in the same line of promotion and fill it in the same manner as in filling permanent vacancies within the lines of promotion (Section8.15 b) ), subject to the following modifications:
a)	A vacancy shall be filled from among employees on the shift in which it occurs.
b)	In the event a vacancy cannot be filled from within the line of promotion, it will be filled by the senior employee from the labour pool of the Department Job Group concerned, who is presently on the shift in which the vacancy occurred,
If it is necessary to hold over or recall an employee, an employee in the classification where the vacancy exists, who is qualified to fill the vacant job will be held over or recalled, taking into consideration the equitable distribution of overtime.
8.23	Reduction and lay-off
a)	A reduction without lay-off will be effected in the following order of priority by applying job continuous service down the lines of promotion in each Department Job Group affected, resulting in each employee being:
1.	Retained in his present job or in a job of equal classification within his line of promotion.
2.	Reduced to a lower job in line of promotion; or
3.	Returned if he so requests, to a job in another line of promotion which he occupied within the past provided his continuous service in the previous job allows him to hold that job and he is then able to perform the full requirements of thejob;
4.	Reduced to the Department Labour Pool. However, an employee in a trade or craft job may elect to be laid off rather than accept reduction to the Department Labour Pool. He will be recalled only to vacancies in his trade or in the event he has not been recalled to his
25
trade or craft job and if he desires to return to work after a one-year period he will advise the Industrial Relations Department in writing as soon as possible but not less than 4 weeks before the date he desires to return to work. He will then be recalled to the Department Labour Pool, provided his seniority allows him to do so. This provision is also subject to the time limits specified in Section 8.09 f).
b)	In the event of reduction with lay-off, the same procedure will be followed as in paragraph a) preceding, except that:
1.	Each employee likely to be affected by layoff, either directly or through the exercising of his seniority by another employee, will receive a minimum of seven (7) days notice of the layoff.
