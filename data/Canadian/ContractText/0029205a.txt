II- Change in Work Methods
When the introduction of new equipment makes a material change which is expected to result in the closing of a department or a substantial reduction in the number of employees in a department,
63
the Company will inform the Union of such change at least ninety days (90) in advance of the contemplated change, and the parties will discuss what is expected to take place and how the matter may best be handled. Employeeswho are eligible for placement in their own Plant will be entitled to the provisions set out in Article 11-4(a). Employees with five (5) or more years of seniority who are affected by such change and who are not eligible for placement in their own Plant will be entitled to the provisions set out in Clause 1, Plant Closing.

In the application of rates or adjustments of bracket values, such an employee will not be paid a rate greater than the rate paid them at the time of the above-mentioned posting except for reasons of a general wage increase after the date of transfer.

(2)	brackets shall take place until the lower rate prevails.
Ill	- Contracting Out
The Company prefers to have work done by its employees, although at times it is necessary to have work performed by outside contractors. The relevant factors which the Company will consider before contracting out such work include adverse effect on employees, availability of required skills, duration and frequency of the job, urgency of the job, cost of equipment in relation to its use and relative cost comparison.
64
The Company shall inform a representative of tho Union prior to bringing contractors into the Plant unless an emergency situation arises in which case the Union shall be immediately notified once the emergency is over. When work performed on the premises by outside contractors represents a material change in practice and has an adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such change of practice, the matter may be the subject of a grievance and may betaken to arbitration.
Should an Arbitration Committee be called on to review the Company's action, it may consider the relevant factors referred to above in order to determine the reasonableness of the Company's action witli regard to all circumstances. Should the Arbitration Coinmittee find the Company's action was not reasonable, the Committee will direct that the Company choose between having the work performed by its employees or ceasing such operation, and the Company shall have a reasonable time to effect the decision.
This provision does not apply to cafeteria operations, to "out of town" deliveries and to installation and construction work. The Company may, at times, experiment to determine if work can be performed effectively and economically by its own employees. When this is done for a trial period, it shall not be considered a change of practice should the Company elect to contract out after the trial period.
