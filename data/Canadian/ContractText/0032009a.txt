•	Employees will be notified by 2pm to 4pm
If the company cannot reach the appropriate employee to come to work for tomorrow’s shifts, the next available Senior Employee will be contacted and scheduled in.
Changes in Shift/Department or job will now be communicated by “schedule change” postings. These changes will be posted in each plant by 2:00pm for the day shift and 4:30pm for the night shift. Any other changes will be communicated to the employee by telephone.
LAST MINUTE CREWING:
Because 24 hour crewing allows the scheduler to complete both day and afternoon shifts the day before, any changes in the scheduling after 2pm the day or on the day of the shift, will be done on a last minute crewing basis.
If production scheduling calls for a decrease/increase in crewing for a shift, the scheduler will call in/call off employees based on plant wide seniority. The schedule will not be revised to move employees in to home departments when last minute crewing is required.
91
If an employee calls in sick at any point before or during a shift, the next most senior qualified and available employee will be notified to come in. Due to the nature of the urgency to replace. the company can only call an employee once, and if not available (This means: if there is no answer, if there is a machine, or if it is busy more than 2x) the next most senior employee will be contacted.
PLANT SHUTDOWNS, PARTIAL SHUTDOWNS, DEPARTMENT SHUTDOWNS:
In the case that a situation resulting in a plant/partial shutdown (i.e.. Fire, breakdown, hydro outage, etc.), the Company will make every effort to notify the appropriate personnel.
In the case ofbad weatherti.e. Snow Stormlthe employees are advised to listen to the Local Radio Station CHYR FM 97 1 for details of possible shift cancellations.
