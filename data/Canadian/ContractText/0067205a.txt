(e)	When an employee has her/his name withdrawn from Union membership. In the event this should occur, the Union will give the Company in writing the reason for such action.

10.01	The following Union Executive Officers: President, Vice-President, Recording Secretary-Treasurer (if employees of the Company) and the B.G.P.W.U. Labatt Representative, shall hold top plant and departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of layoff only.
10.02	Union Stewards shall hold top departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of lay-off only. In the event that more than one employee holds top seniority, then the order of their seniority for the purpose of lay-off only will be interpreted as being the order in which they are mentioned above.
10.03	In the case of lay-off, temporary employees shall be laid off first plant-wide, with the exception of skilled tradespersons whose services are mutually deemed to be essential for the efficient operation of the Company. Thereafter, lay-offs for an anticipated period of one month or more shall occur in reverse order of departmental seniority insofar as employees with less than five (5) years seniority are concerned. If it becomes necessary to lay-off employees with five (5) or more years of seniority, then
6
these employees will be allowed to replace more junior employees in other departments provided that the employee exercising such rights will do so for the period of lay-off only and their seniority in their original Department will not be affected.
10.04	Permanent employees recalled to work in another department will not transfer their seniority rights to the department to which they are recalled.
10.05	Except in the case of extreme emergency, the Company will give permanent employees, who are to be laid off, notice on bulletin boards three (3) working days prior to lay-off. If the employee is on leave of absence, or absent through sickness, or on Workers’ Compensation at the time of lay-off, he/she shall be subject to the lay-off provisions the same as if he/she were on active status.
10.06	Any employee who is laid off or continues to be laid off in violation of seniority must present a claim, in writing, to the Human Resources Department within three (3) working days from the date of notice of such employee’s lay-off, otherwise, it shall be deemed that compensation for time lost arising out of any wrongful lay-off is waived. The Company will promptly determine the merits of written claims and if it is found that the lay-off was unjust, the affected employee will receive her/his straight time lost during such lay-off.
10.07	When rehiring takes place in any Department, the reverse of Section 10.03 will be followed: (i.e. laid off permanent employees will be recalled in the order of their seniority within that Department). In the event that additional employees are required by that Department, then permanent laid off employees holding seniority in another Department will be recalled in the order of their seniority.
10.08	Notification of recall shall be made by registered mail to the last address which the employee shall have recorded with the Company, and the B.G.P.W.U Labatt Representative shall be notified thereof. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Company and
the Union notified of her/his mailing address so that he/
she may be contacted within seventy-two (72) hours as hereinbefore provided.
SECTION 11
TRANSFERS OF SENIORITY
11.01	An employee who has been on a seniority list in any department and is promoted to a position not covered by this Agreement and later returned to the bargaining unit shall be given seniority equivalent to her/his total service with the Company provided he/she maintains her/his Union withdrawal card, but he/she shall have no seniority rights for better jobs or vacation entitlement until after he/she has completed one hundred and thirty-two (132) working days in the Department.

12.01	Employees who are transferred pursuant to the layoff provisions shall immediately take the rate for the job to which they are assigned.
12.02	Employees who are temporarily transferred to a vacant job for the convenience of the Company shall continue to receive their usual rate.
12.03	If any employee is transferred for the efficiency of the Department, he/she will be paid at the lower rate unless the employee has had at least fifteen (15) years service with at least two (2) years continuous employment at the higher rate and in such a case the employee will retain her/his rate until such time as the job rate exceeds the rate being paid. Thereafter, the employee will be paid the contract rate for the job. If an employee is transferred for her/his own good or because of undisputed disability, he/ she will be paid at the job rate for the job to which he/she is transferred.
8
12.04	Employees transferred or assigned temporarily to a job paying a higher rate of pay will be paid at the higher rate for all hours worked in the higher rated job. This section does not include employees while on work stabilization or a defined training program.

Clause “B”: Clause "A" shall not be construed to mean that the staffing of all operations is at present exactly adequate or that all employees are presently assigned exactly a fair day's work and accordingly changes in an employee’s work load may be made so long as the resulting situation is not a violation of Clause "A”.
SECTION 13

17.03	When a written request for arbitration has been submitted by one party, the parties shall meet within three (3) working days and they shall make every reasonable effort to select an impartial arbitrator and if they fail to make such selection, the Minister of Labour for Ontario shall be requested to appoint such impartial arbitrator.

13
decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. The reasonable costs of such arbitrator, including the fees and expenses, stenographic services, etc. of the arbitrator, shall be equally shared by both parties to this Agreement.

The Company Pension will be adjusted to provide a survivor pension unless the spouse who will benefit from that survivor pension waives her/his right to receive it in writing.
You will receive a minimum lifetime pension supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan equal to the amount, if any, required to be added to your accrued basic pension from all Company Plans and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits determined at the date of your retirement to provide the above minimum monthly pension.

To determine what, if any, amount of supplement is
48
needed, your basic pension from Company Plans is the basic amount payable before the amount of the survivorship pension is calculated, and your C.P.P. pension is the amount you are entitled to receive when you first become eligible at Normal Retirement age, whether or not you actually make application for any such benefits, but disregarding any increase in your C.P.P. pension after its date of commencement.

This pension will be supplemented by an amount necessary to provide the minimum monthly pension amounts set out below, until you first become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits:
a)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1996	—	$1,904;
b)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1997	—	$2,004;
c)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1998	—	$2,104;

e)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	2000	—	$2,304;
f)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	2001	—	$2,404.
Once you become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65) the supplement will be recalculated as the amount required to be added to your accrued basic pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, determined as at the actual late of your retirement, to produce the following monthly pensions:
a)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1996	—	$2,256;
b)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1997	—	$2,356;
c)	if you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	1998	—	$2,456;

f)	if	you	retire	on	or	after January	1,	2001 —	$2,756.
(Once again, both sets of figures above do not take account of the reduction required to produce a survivor option for the surviving spouse.)
This recalculated supplement shall become your lifetime supplement.
in addition to this recalculated lifetime supplement, you will be entitled to receive a further supplement, commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following your 65th birthday. This further supplement will represent the amount, if any, necessary to produce a total pension from Company Plans equal to the pension that would be payable if you were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, your accrued pension including any escalation thereof and your related credited service at the date of your retirement. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of your lifetime supplement.
9.	85 POINT RETIREMENT
If you retire on or after January 1, 1994, after having reached age 55 and your combined age and years of credited service total 85 or more (but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement), you are entitled to an immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of your vested accrued basic pension for service to the date of early retirement.

In addition, you will be entitled to receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 65 on the date of your retirement, but using your current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension, all determined as at your actual date of retirement.

If you were a member of the Plan before January 1, 1974, when your service is terminated you may either:
a)	leave all of your contributions in the Plan and feceive at age 65 a monthly pension equal to the basic pension to your credit to December 31, 1973, which is included in the pension referred to above, or
b)	withdraw your contributions plus interest to your date of termination of service in which case you forfeit your credited service to December 31, 1973, and any pension in respect of such service which is included in the pension referred to above, subject to applicable pension legislation.
15.	ESCALATION OF PENSION AFTER RETIREMENT
If you retire on or after January i, 1994 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension and lifetime supplement will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the
54
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%. Any spousal pension will also be escalated applying the same formula, with the first increase occurring on the January 1st following your death.
16.	PREVIOUS PLANS (before January 1, 1958)
If you were a member of a previous Company pension plan (Government Annuity Plan) in effect before January 1, 1958, your benefits from that plan are payable in accordance with the provisions of that previous plan and are in addition to the benefit you receive from the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Since your period of membership in the previous plan is included in determining your total credited service, any basic pension to your credit under the previous plan is taken into account in determining the amount of any minimum pension supplement you are entitled to receive. Since your pension from the previous plan will be actuarially reduced if you retire before age 65, your basic L.R.P. pension will include an amount equal to the difference between your actuarially reduced previous pension plan and the amount of basic previous plan pension at age 65 reduced by the same factors as are applicable to your L.R.P. pension as explained in Sections 8, 9, 10 or 11, as the case may be.
For these purposes your basic previous plan pension has been determined and fixed as that amount of pension payable from age 65 and guaranteed for a maximum of 5 years which would be available in accordance with the terms of the previous plan in effect at December 31, 1957 but excluding any pension purchased by voluntary contributions you may have made to that plan. Any increase in the amount of your Government Annuity which has resulted from an increase in interest rate from 1975 is not considered as a part of your basic previous plan pension and would be payable as an extra benefit over and above your basic pension.
After retirement your total basic pension which is subject to escalation as explained in Section 15 includes the
55
amount of basic previous plan pension determined as explained above.
17.	OTHER INFORMATION

If you plan to move out of Canada you should check Into these requirements. The amount of O.A.S. pension is subject to quarterly adjustment upward if the Consumer Price Index increases.

A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation of the disability unless you have completely recovered and have been back at work for at least fourteen (14) consecutive days or ten (10) scheduled working days.
70
Your weekly indemnity insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your weekly indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	Long Term Disability Benefit
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received weekly indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received Worker's Compensation payments for a continuous period of twenty-six (26) weeks.
During the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, your benefit will be payable weekly at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect during that period. At the end of the first seventy-eight (78) weeks, your LTD benefit will be fixed at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect in the 7Bth week of the LTD benefit period and thereafter your LTD benefit will be payable in an equivalent monthly amount at the end of each month. For example, if your earnings rate in the 78th week is $23.15 per hour:
(a)	your weekly earnings rate is
40 x $23.15	=	$926.00
(b)	your weekly LTD benefit in the
78th week is 66-2/3% of	S926.00	=	617.34
(c)	thereafter your monthly LTD benefit
is4-1/3 x $617.34	=	$2,675.14
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker’s Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
In order to qualify for LTD benefits you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, be unable to perform a regular job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are
71
again disabled due to the same or related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least six (6) months.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefit will continue for up to twenty-four (24) months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $2,675.14 and vou earn $1,500 in
rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD benefit	$2,675.14
Subtract 75% of $1,500	1.125,00
LTD benefit during rehabilitation	1,550.14
Earnings from rehabilitative employment	1.500.00
Monthly income during rehabilitation	$3.050.14
While you are in receipt of LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits. Please refer to the Labatt Retirement Plan section of this booklet for a description of the pension credits which will accrue to you while you are disabled.
Your LTD insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company.

72
than one source (or the same day or part day.
The only exception shall occur where an employee is in receipt of a Worker’s Compensation Board partial disability pension for a totally unrelated condition to that which is the basis for the Weekly Indemnity or Long Term Disability claim.
7.	Semi-Private Hospital Benefit
Your provincial health plan (OHIP) provides basic hospital benefits for you and your family but generally limits benefits for room charges to the amount payable for ward accommodation. Insured benefits are provided under the Company’s plan for you and your covered dependents to supplement the provincial plan benefit and provide payment for room charges up to semi-private accommodation in a licensed hospital. If hospitalized in a private room the benefit will be limited to that which would have been paid for semi-private accommodation. These benefits apply to all confinements approved by a licensed physician except those covered by Worker’s Compensation.
Your semi-private hospital insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company except that:
{a) If you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for up to one year for expenses incurred during the continuance of that disability.
(b)	If one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in hospital.
(c)	If you or your dependent spouse are pregnant on the date insurance coverage is canceled, you/she will be entitled to semi-private hospital benefits up to the date of childbirth or termination of pregnancy as if the insurance were still in force.

—	frames, lenses and the fitting of any type of prescription glasses (including contact lenses;, when prescribed by a physician or optometrist up to a total payment of $90.00 every twenty-four (24) months for each eligible insured person, and $90.00 every twelve months for dependent children under the age of eighteen (18) years.

You are required to pay the first $10 of expenses incurred in each calendar year. This is known as the “deductible” and is applied to each insured person, employee or dependent, except that the total deductible for all members of your family will not be more than $20 in each calendar year, if expenses which are included in the deductible occur within the last three months of the calendar year the same expenses may be applied against the deductible for the next calendar year. If two or more insured members of your family are injured in a common accident only one deductible will be applied against their resulting combined expenses incurred in any one calendar year.
The amount of benefit payable is determined as follows:
(a)	the charges are totaled for all allowable expenses incurred by the employee or dependent during the calendar year
75
(b)	from this total the deductible is subtracted
(c)	the major medical expense benefit then pays 100% of the remainder
The maximum total amount payable for any individual is $25,000 per lifetime. However, after a person has been insured for a full calendar year, up to $5,000 of the original benefit will be reinstated on January 2nd of each year but at no time will the maximum exceed the original amount.
The major medical expense benefit does not cover periodic health check-ups and examinations, eye refractions or fitting of glasses, dental services, travel for health, expenses resulting from an act of war, charges for hospital room and board, hospital and medical expenses for services covered by the provincial plan, expenses for injury or illness covered by Worker's Compensation Act, or any service for which an employee or dependent does not have to pay.
If when you retire you are entitled to group life insurance as explained in Section 3, you and your eligible dependents will continue to be insured for major medical expense benefits. You will continue to be required to pay the first $10 of expenses incurred in each calendar year as a “deductible" applied to each insured person with the total deductible for all members of your family not to exceed $20 in each calendar year.
You will then be reimbursed for 80% of any eligible expenses incurred after the date of your retirement in excess of the deductible. The maximum total amount payable for expenses incurred after your date of retirement is $10,000 for each individual member of your family.
If you terminate service and do not qualify for retired benefits your major medical insurance will be canceled as of the date on which your service is terminated, except that the following extended benefits are provided:
(a)	if you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, major medical benefits will be extended for up to one year, provided such expenses are incurred during the continuance of that disability
76
(b)	if one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in the hospital
(c)	if you or your dependeni spouse are pregnant on the date insurance coverage is canceled, benefits will be payable for treatment as a result of that pregnancy.

Dental Care Benefits are provided for you and your eligible dependents subject to the limitations and exclusions described below.
Eligible services are all reasonable and customary dental services which are recommended as necessary and performed by a qualified dentist or physician and for which a Treatment Plan has been submitted to and approved by the insurer before the services are rendered. The filing of a Treatment Plan is not required if the total cost of the proposed work is less than $500 or if treatment is rendered in emergency conditions. Eligible dental services are classified under three major categories:
(a)	Basic Services — examinations and cleaning of teeth (once in any six-month period), extractions, fillings and other necessary treatment for the relief of dental pain.
(b)	Restorative Services — crowns and inlays, bridge work, dentures, root canal therapy (endodontics), and the treatment of tissues and bones supporting the teeth (periodontics).
(c)	Orthodontia — proper fitting of natural teeth and prevention or correction of irregularities of the teeth.
You will be reimbursed for 100% of the cost of eligible Basic Services incurred by you or your eligible dependents up to a maximum for each insured person of $800 in a calendar year. You will also be reimbursed for 75% of the cost of Restorative Services and 50% of the cost of Orthodontia to a lifetime maximum benefit of $6,000 for each insured person for Restorative Services and Orthodontia combined. An annual reinstatement of up to
T7
$600 will be provided at the beginning of each calendar year, if required, to restore the lifetime maximum to the level of $6,000. At no time will the maximum exceed the original amount. Benefits will be paid on the basis of the lesser of the actual fee charged or the amount stated in the current Dental Association Schedule of Fees in the province in which you reside. If optional procedures are possible, benefits will be payable in accordance with the procedure involving the smallest fee.
Expenses incurred for the replacement of dentures are eligible for benefits, except that if the replacement is for a denture for which benefits were payable under this plan, benefits for the replacement will be payable only if at least three (3) years have elapsed since the placement or replacement for which benefits were paid. In addition, benefits are payable for rebasing, relining or repairing of dentures. Benefits will not be paid for the replacement of dentures which have been lost, misplaced or stolen.
Dental care benefits are not payable for any service eligible for payment from another source such as provincial health insurance plans, Worker's Compensation or government plans, expenses incurred principally for cosmetic purposes, expenses resulting from an act of war, or any service for which an employee or dependent does not have to pay.
Your dental care insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service and claims will not be accepted for any service performed after the date on which your insurance is canceled.
10.	How to Claim
When you or any of your dependents are entitled to receive Insured benefits, you should obtain the necessary claim forms from your line manager, department head, or health services department. When you have completed the employee's portion of the claim form you should have your physician or dentist complete his section. Then send the completed hospital, major medical or dental form to the insurance company and the completed weekly indemnity or LTD forms to the health services department.
78
In order to qualify for payment of benefits, claims must be
submitted within the time limit set out below:
(a)	Weekly Indemnity Benefit — Claim must be filed within ninety (90) days of commencement of disability. In case of illness benefits will be paid as previously described only if you see a licensed physician no later than the fourth day of disability and remain under the doctor's care until you are able to return to work. If you do not see a doctor by the fourth day, your benefits will be payable only from the day on which you first visit a doctor. In case of accident, you must see the doctor no later than the day following the accident in order to qualify for benefits from the first day; otherwise benefits wilt be payable as if the disability is due to illness. Diagnosis and prescription by telephone only does not constitute a “visit* for this purpose.
(b)	Long Term Disability Benefit — Claim must be filed within six (6) months following the date from which LTD benefits become payable but the earlier the better in order to avoid any delay in commencement of your LTD benefit payments.
(c)	Semi-Private Hospital Benefit — Claim must be filed within ninety (90) days of the date of hospitalization. Standard claim forms are available at alt hospitals. Benefits will be paid to you unless you complete the appropriate section of this form to assign benefits to the hospital.
(d)	Major Medical Expense Benefit — Claim must be submitted no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred except that, when your insurance is canceled for any reason, proof of claim must be submitted within ninety (90) days of the date of termination of your insurance. Itemized bills and statements showing the patient’s name, dates of service, prescription numbers for drug expenses and amount of the charges, must accompany the claim form verifying all such expenses including those which you have paid to satisfy the deductible. It is suggested that such claims not be submitted until
79
the total bills exceed the deductible by at least $10.
(e)	Dental Care Benefit — Clam must be submitted by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred except that proof of claim must be submitted within ninety {90) days of the date on which your insurance is canceled for any reason. A separate claim form must be filled out for each member of your family for whom you are making claim. The dentist's statement on this form, or any bills supporting your claim, must show the patient’s name, dates and nature of the treatment and the charge. If the total cost associated with proposed dental work is $500 or more, a Treatment Plan must be submitted to the insurer as explained in Section 9. You should have your dentist complete a claim form setting out details as to the proposed treatment and the cost and send this form to the insurance company for their review. You will then be advised as to the charges, or portion thereof, which the insurer considers eligible for benefits. Upon completion of the dental treatment you again submit a claim to receive payment of the approved benefits.
Failure to see your doctor promptly or to submit your claim together with the doctor's or dentist’s report or other itemized statements within the above time limits will result in the rejection of your claim.

Mr. Cameron Nelson President,
Brewery, General and Professional Worker’s Union Re: Staging Department Manpower Dear Mr. Nelson:
During negotiations, the company and Union held discussions concerning the future viability of the warehousing operation at Metro. As a result of those discussions, the parties agreed to the following:
The Company will post three permanent positions within the Staging Department within one month of the signing of this collective agreement and a further three permanent positions in January 1998, and a further three positions in January 2000. As well, the addition of seniority employees to the Staging Department via these postings will not result in an increase of the number of seniority employees in the bargaining unit over the number of employees as of the date of this letter. The Company will not utilize the provisions of this letter to reduce the number of seniority employees in Staging below 35.
The postings will be for midnight shift pallet make-up and will outline the physical requirements of the job and employees selected for these positions will be required to possess the ability to perform the physical aspects of the job; in accordance with management scheduling rights, these employees, at times, may be scheduled to perform other warehousing work. Employees who post into the Staging Department and subsequently acquire a medical restriction which prevents them from performing pallet make-up work or from working the shift(s) to which she/he Is assigned within two years from the date they commenced working in the position will be returned to
109
another department with their department seniority intact. Upon such transfer, their seniority will immediately be transferred to the department to which they are transferred. The Staging vacancy resulting will then be posted.
Subject to the paragraphs above and below this paragraph, the Company will replace permanent employees who attrit out of the bargaining unit with temporary employees during the life of the collective agreement.
It is recognized that the Staging Department is currently operating with approximately 50% of the Department’s seniority employees having medical restrictions which prevent them from performing the essential duties of the Pallet Make-up job. It is also recognized by the parties that it is difficult in many cases to modify such work in a manner that will permit an employee to perform the essential duties of the job. As well, the parties agree that many different mutually agreed arrangements can be made in order to satisfy the duty to accommodate in the Ontario Human Rights Code respecting employees with bona lide handicaps as defined in the Code. Therefore, we have agreed to the following.
The Company must be in a position to ensure that the number of restricted-duty employees does not exceed the work available which can be performed by such employees. In such cases, the Company and Union shall meet to discuss the appropriate remedy, it being agreed that, as a last resort, if medically restricted employees are to be transferred out of the Department, they will be the junior such employees in terms of departmental service. Employees who are transferred out of Staging will be replaced by temporary employees who are physically capable of performing the full scope of the job. The transferred employee may return to staging if subsequently (a) the transferred employee is fully able to do the work available; or (b) the ratio of restricted to non-restricted employees becomes such that the employee may be returned to the department, even though restricted.
The Company’s commitments above with respect to the posting of 9 seniority jobs, and the maintenance of a minimum of 35 seniority employees, are based on current
110
volume levels in the Toronto plant and warehouse and the present state of technology in the Department. In the event that volume levels experience a significant decrease from the present levels, or the Company introduces new or modified equipment which significantly alters manpower requirements in the Warehouse, the above two commitments shall no longer be binding on the Company.
The Union agrees that it will withdraw Grievance #5-95.
Sincerely,
Workers' Union

The Company and Union agree that those employees currently recognized as "C” mechanics shall be identified as those listed below:
Tony Neglia	Mario Ponte
Lennox Graham	Mel Stubna
Dave Baird	Joe Defreitas	Sr.
Ceasar Reyes
It was agreed to grandfather these employees’ status as “C" mechanics and to pay them the 80 cent premium over the Packaging Machine Operator Rate for “C" mechanic work performed on overhauls, it was also agreed that if one of the above grandfathered “C” Mechanics chooses to decline such an assignment offered to her/him on an overhaul, she/he shall irrevocably forfeit her/his status as a “C” Mechanic.
On overhauls the company will make every reasonable effort to canvas those regular:mechanics present on the shift for unscheduled overtime which is required as a continuation of that shift prior to asking temporary ‘C’ mechanics to work for overtime.
113
Job continuation will apply for temporary ‘C’ mechanics once the above procedure has been followed.

Re: Maternity/Adopuon Leave Benefits
During the recent negotiations, the Company agreed to provide a supplement to Employment Insurance maternity/ adoption leave benefits for female seniority employees as follows.
ELIGIBILITY
All female seniority employees who qualify for Employment Insurance maternity/adoption benefits (E.l. benefits) and who have twelve {12) months of unbroken active service immediately prior to the maternity/adoption leave.
AMOUNT OF BENEFIT (“Top Up of E.l.")
Maternity Leave
For the two week E.l. waiting period:
•	75% of pre-leave weekly base earnings
•	For a maximum of the 15 weeks thereafter:
Assuming an E.l. weekly benefit of $413.00, a top-up equivalent to 75% of pre-leave weekly base earnings.
Adoption Leave
For the two-week E.l. waiting period, benefits will be the same as maternity leave benefits.
For a maximum of the 10 weeks thereafter:
Assuming an E.l. weekly benefit of $413.00, top-up equivalent to 75% of pre-leave weekly base earnings.
In no case will the Company be required to make up the difference should the level of weekly E.l. benefits fall below $413.00. In the event that the level of E.l. benefits should increase, this shall reduce the supplement to be provided by the Company.
115
Normal earnings adjustments occurring during any leave would be deferred until such time as the employee returns to work.
The employee must provide the Human Resources Department, as soon as possible during her leave, with proof of eligibility to receive E.l. benefits i.e. E.l. cheque stub or letter of acceptance. No payments will be issued until such time as documentation establishing the employee’s entitlement to E.l. benefits is received by the Company.
DISQUALIFICATION FOR BENEFITS
An employee will not be eligible for Top-Up of E.l. payments from the Company if she:
(i)	has failed to apply for E.l. benefits or is disqualified from receiving E.l. benefits by any reason other than serving a two (2) week waiting period; or
(ii)	for any period of time in which the employee is eligible to receive a benefit provided by the Company's Weekly Indemnity or Long Term Disability Plans or is eligible to receive Workers Compensation benefits.
The Company is under no obligation to repay any E.l. benefits or other benefit plan payments which are subject to income or other tax or recovery pursuant to a right of offset or clawback.
If you agree that the above accurately reflects our agreement respecting the above please sign and return a copy.

LETTER OF INTENT
Mr. J. Cameron Nelson President, BGPWU January 21, 1996
Re: Manpower Force Reduction Allowance (M.F.R.A.) Dear Mr. Nelson:
The following represents our agreement with respect to the payment of a M.F.R.A. by the Company to certain employees who qualify for and take 85 Point Retirement during the period in which they are in receipt of 85 Point Retirement pension benefits. It is understood that the M.F.R.A. is only available to employees who elect to retire during the term of the collective agreement.
The M.F.R.A. will not be paid to any employee who qualifies for and takes his pension at Normal Retirement Date, or an S.E.R, Other Early or Disability Retirement pension. Moreover, an employee who is in receipt of any separation, severance or other periodic payments which are designed to bridge him/her to pension benefits shall not be entitled to receive the Allowance while in receipt of such benefits. If an employee takes his separation pay in a lump sum, he shall not be eligible lo receive the Allowance for the period represented by the number of weeks of separation pay he has received commencing from the date his employment is terminated and regardless as to whether he is in receipt of 85 Point Retirement Benefits. It is understood and agreed that the payment of this M.F.R.A. is made solely from Company operating revenues and that no part of this Allowance shall be treated as a pension benefit payable out of the pension plan.
Each year of the Collective Agreement some employees will be eligible for the Allowance based on any of the following combinations of age at retirement and completed years of credited service.
117
Age at Retirement Minimum Completed Years
of Credited Service
55	30
56	29
57	28
58	27
59	26
The amount of the M.F.R.A. paid to qualifying employees by the Company shall be determined as at the date of retirement. The initial benefit which an employee is entitled	
to at date of retirement shall not Increase for any reason during the period in which he/she is entitled to receive the Allowance. In no case shall benefits be paid subsequent to the date which an employee commences to receive his pension at Normal Retirement Date.
No other combination of age and minimum years of credited service other than those listed above will qualify an employee for a M.F.R.A. However, in the event of a brewery closure the M.F.R.A. will be allowed to those qualifying employees in the closing brewery only who have 85 points composed of a minimum age of 55 at the time of closure and may not have the required 25 years of minimum service that would normally be required.
The monthly allowance to be paid to qualifying employees shall be as follows:
1.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 1996
—	$375.00
2.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 1997
—	$389.00
3.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 1998
—	$403.00
4.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 1999
—	$417.00
5.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 2000
—	$431.00
6.	Employees retiring on or after January 1 2001
—	$445.00
118
Since the Allowance does not form part of the Pension Plan for Labatt Wage Employees, no payments by the Company on account of the Allowance will be made to the employees surviving spouse in the event that the employee dies while In receipt of the monthly Allowance.
Finally, we agreed that the Company would deduct the total amount of M.F.R.A. benefits paid to employees from any gratuitous general enhancement fund given to the Union for its use by the Company in the event of a plant closure.
This letter and obligations arising hereunder shall expire and cease to have binding effect from and after December 31, 2001, provided that any employee who commenced to receive benefits hereunder prior to December 31, 2001 shall continue to receive benefits as stipulated herein.

LETTER OF INTENT
Brewery Ciosure/Transfer Rights
Mr. J. Cameron Nelson	January 21, 1996
During negotiations there were extensive discussions between the parties concerning the possibility of a plant closure during the life of the Agreement. The parties agreed to the following items in the event that the Company closes the Toronto plant during the term of this collective agreement.
1.	The Company will announce a tentative date for the plant closure (“the closure date"). Following this announcement, a determination will be made as to the eligibility of Toronto employees to transfer to vacant jobs in London as follows.
Eligibility for Transfer
All Toronto plant seniority employees will be eligible to transfer to vacant jobs in London or to be added to the London seniority list as recall list employees except for the following groups of employees:
1.	Any employee who, on the closure date, is or who will be 65 years of age i.e.: N.R.D. pension age.
2.	in the event that the Company decides to maintain a Toronto-based transport fleet and/or garage and/or warehouse, any employees who are required by the Company to continue working in Transportation, Staging or the Garage in Toronto.
3.	Any employee who, at the date of the closure announcement is in receipt of L.T.D. benefits or who has been continuously in receipt of Workers' Compensation benefits for the six month (or longer) period immediately preceding the date of such announcement until the employee is fully recovered and able to do the normal duties of the plant.
120
Those employees remaining who are not disqualified as set out above will have the following options:
1.	Elect to take separation pay under the collective agreement and terminate their employment without any further rights or entitlements;
or
2.	Transfer to the London seniority list as an active or recall list employee.
General
An employee who takes separation pay in equal weekly installments may continue to accrue pension credits for the period he is in receipt of weekly severance payments. However, this pension credit accrual shall not be available to an employee who takes the M.F.R.A.
Conditions Upon Transfer
An employee who elects to transfer to London, whether as an active or recall list employee at the time of transfer shall irrevocably forfeit his/her right to separation pay under the collective agreement based on his years of service at the Toronto plant.
Such employee will carry his company service to London for the purpose of determining future vacation entitlement and vacation bonus and group insurance, sick leave, GWP credits and pension benefit and eligibility and entitlement;
In the year of transfer, such employee will carry his/her unused entitlement to vacation pay, vacation bonus, sick pay and GWP credits to London and shall be paid such accrued entitlements as if he/she had been employed in London throughout the year, in no case, however, shall the employee be entitled to receive more than the annual entitlement that he/she would have received had the employee been employed in Toronto for the entire year. An employee who is transferred after the close of the vacation selection period shall be treated as if he/she failed to choose his/her preferred vacation weeks.
In the event that the transferring employee is not immediately actively employed in London or is laid off in
121
London following a period of active employment, he/she shall be permitted to draw GWP benefits to the extent that he/she so qualifies pursuant to the provisions of the GWP.
Establishment of Seniority in London
The parties agree that transferring employees should carry their Toronto seniority to London for layoff, recall and vacation selection purposes as amongst themselves and accordingly, the date that a transferring employee commenced to work in London shall not be relevant for purposes of establishing seniority ranking. Once all of the transferred employees have arrived in London, the Company will publish a seniority list which shall rank the transferred employees in order of their Toronto plant seniority. However, once an employee has transferred to London and has completed any necessary training on his/ her new job, he/she shall not be displaced from such job by a subsequently transferred senior employee unless the subsequent senior transferee must displace the junior employee from that job in order to avoid a layoff. In such case, the senior employee seeking to displace the junior employee may do so in accordance with the layoff language of the collective agreement.
Work Assignments/Qualificatlons
With the exception of tradesmen, all transferring employees shall be employed in the Packaging Department unless vacancies in other positions exist at the time of the transfer for which transferees are then qualified.
At the time of the transfer, a qualified transferee shall be permitted to displace a temporary employee who is employed in the same Department as the transferee was in Toronto. Furthermore, a qualified transferee shall be awarded a vacant position in his/her former Department in preference to a senior unqualified transferee.
Selection for skilled trades positions shall be made on the basis of seniority provided the individual has the demonstrated skills, ability and qualifications and the Company will retain the right to evaluate them.
Tradesmen who are selected shall be employed In the
122
appropriate trades function unless no vacancies exist in their trade in which case they shall be employed in the Packaging Department.
Creation of Vacancies
Voluntary Resignation
In a further attempt to create vacancies for eligible employees who wish to transfer from the closed Ontario plant, the Company will offer a voluntary resignation bonus on or before the tentative date announced for the plant closure.
An employee who elects to accept such voluntary resignation bonus shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equivalent to twenty weeks pay (i.e. 800 hours multiplied by his/her straight time hourly rate). Such employee who elects voluntary resignation pursuant to the Company's offer, shall be terminated on a date determined by the Company and shall have no further rights or entitlements.
Exercise of Seniority Rights
In the exercise of seniority rights pursuant to Article 10 of the collective agreement, any employee who seeks to displace a more junior employee at the Monogram Warehouse must have the necessary physical ability to perform the work in question.
