HAMILTON/9
In consideration of the agreement of the Company to make payments as provided above, the Union agrees to indemnify the Company and save it harmless from and against any and all claims, payments, and costs of any kind which it may receive, make or suffer, directly or indirectly, through having agreed to make and having made such payments, deductions and contributions or by reason of any imputed employment relationship which might be alleged to exist between such employee and the Company by reason of the making of such payments.

HAMILTON/10
Steward considers that there may be a reasonable basis for the complaint or
grievance, the employee and/or the Steward may refer the matter orally to the appropriate management representative within fifteen (15) working days of the time the grievor became aware, or should have become aware, of the event giving rise to the grievance.

7.04	COLLECTIVE GRIEVANCE
Should a group of two (2) or more employees who have a complaint or grievance based upon the same provision or provisions of this Agreement or upon similar facts, desire to have such matter dealt with collectively rather than as individual complaints or grievances, they may do so within the time limits outlined in 7,03, Step 1 herein.

7.05	COMPANY/UNION GRIEVANCE
Should any grievance or complaint arise directly between the Company and the Union it shall be submitted to the other party within the time limits outlined in 7.03 Step 1 herein. Such grievance or complaint shall commence at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.

(b)	Grievances relating to the suspension or discharge of any employee shall be submitted directly at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure within the time limits outlined in 7.03 Step I herein.

7.9	ARBITRATION
Supervisor
Department Manager or designate General Manager or designate

agreement on the person to be requested to serve as arbitrator but if such agreement cannot be reached within fifteen (15) working days of the date of notice of arbitration, then the parties shall request the Minister of Labour for the Province of Ontario to make the appointment.

These lists will be brought up to date every three (3) months and, at each revision, will be posted on the Union bulletin board for a period of five (5) working days. During that interval, any employee whose name appears on the list for the first time may questionhis seniority ranking if he is in disagreement with it.

During that period, any regular employee in the Inside or Outside seniority group may make written application for the vacant job and all such applications will receive consideration in accordance with the provisions of Clause 8.05.
It is understood and agreed by the parties that an employee wishing to transfer between seniority groups under these arrangements must be capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. In keeping with that understanding, it is agreed that a three (3) month trial period shall apply from the date of transfer during which the transfer may be reversed, if so requested by the employee or by the Company. In such case, the reverting employee may displace the employee who replaced him in his previous position.
The Company will select the successful applicant within five (5) working days of the close of the posting period and will within a further three (3) days, advise the employees in the seniority group concerned of its decision by posting that information on the Union bulletin board.

Any job vacancy (or vacancies) which may be created as a result of the selection of an employee to fill a job vacancy posted under the provisions of 8.06(c) may be filled by the Company in accordance with the provisions cf clause 8.05 hereof but posting of such ensuing vacancy (or vacancies) shalt not be required.
In the event that the Company has no employee in a seniority group who can satisfactorily fulfil the normal requirements of a job vacancy in that seniority group, and if there is, at that time, no qualified employee on layoff firm any other seniority group covered by this Agreement who wishes to exercise the right of temporary transfer provided for in clause 8.09(d) hereof the Company may hire a new employee to fill such vacancy. The Company may till any vacancy, temporarily, pending completion of procedures set out herein.
When an employee has received a change of job or shift assignment under the provisions of this clause 8.06, he shall not be entitled to apply for a posted vacancy during the following six (6) months, unless such job vacancy is in a Wage Bracket higher than his own.
While the intent of this clause is to provide employees with a means of expressing personal preference in the assignment of their regular duties. it is understood and agreed that it shall remain the sole responsibility of the Company to determine the number of experienced personnel required on any job or shift.

However, when there is a temporary vacancy in a seniority group (including vacancies created by the addition of temporary shifts), and the Company expects such work to be available for a period in excess of five (5) working days, the Company shall, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, make such temporary assignment available to qualified employees on a seniority basis. For this purpose, seniority shall be recognized by Job Classification, within the following departmental groupings:
Inside Employees
Shippers & Receivers Warehouse Worker Garage
Sales Equipment Service
On completion of such a temporary assignment, the affected employee will revert to his regular job and/or shift, provided such work is available for him,
Outside Employees
Sales Representatives Delivery Drivers Transport Drivers
or otherwise he shall be re-assigned having regard to his seniority and the provisions of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it is agreed that in making any temporary promotion in the outside seniority group the Company will, whenever practical, endeavour to give due consideration to the relative seniority of the available and qualified employees.
8.07 (b)	When in the judgement of the Company it is practical. appropriate and timely
to do so, the Company will endeavour to make available to employees who are likely to be candidates for a promotion (and who would otherwise be qualified for such promotion) or who are likely to be subject to layoff, the opportunity of receiving such training as may be necessary to enable them to satisfactorily perform the work so made available to them. An employee who has received such training shall not then be entitled to refuse an assignment to the position for which he has been trained.
8.08	DEMOTIONS
If. as the direct result of a reduction in the work force, one or more demotions should become necessary, it is agreed that the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof shall be observed. It is understood, however, that this clause 8.08 shall not apply in the case of an employee who is demoted as a result of his misconduct or his inability to satisfactorily perform the work required; it being further understood, however, that if within three (3) months of receiving a promotion an employee requests to be relieved of his new responsibilities or is demoted due to his inability to satisfactorily perform, such new duties, he shall be permitted to revert to his former position and in so doing may displace the employee who succeeded him in that position.
8.09	LAYOFFS
Whenever layoffs in a seniority group are necessary, they shall be accomplished as follows:
HAMILTON/16
8.09	(a) The Company shall first layoff temporary employees and then probationary employees, if any, in that seniority group. If further reduction of staff is required, the Company shall then lay off regular employees in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05 hereof, it being understood that, in this instance, seniority is reversed (i.e. the most junior man will be the first laid off). If any regular employee is to be laid off for a period of more than five (5) working days, he shall receive five (5) days written notice of such layoff and the Union shall be provided with a copy of same. Layoff notices will expire after three (3) months.
It is mutually agreed that for the purposes of administration of the foregoing paragraph, the term "in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.05" shall mean that the following procedure will be observed:

(ii)	if there are no temporary or probationary employees to be displaced, of displacing the most junior employee in the Inside or Outside seniority group,
provided that such employee submits a written request for such temporary transfer to another Inside or Outside seniority group and is capable of satisfactorily performing the work so made available to him. It is understood that junior employees shall be laid off in sufficient numbers to permit the exercising of this option and that the resulting temporary transfer of more senior employees shall not become effective until the commencement of the next regular day of work scheduled for the employee to be displaced. The transferred employee will receive the rate of pay of the job to which he is assigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Company is able to arrange the transfer between seniority groups without the one (I) day waiting period, it shall do so.
8.09	(c) An employee exercising the option outlined in (b) above, shall not acquire
seniority in the group to which he is transferred, but shall retain his recall rights in his original seniority group. In the event of a layoff, the employee would be able to exercise his seniority for any vacant non-posted positions.
8.09	(d) The Company shall maintain a list of employees (other than probationary or
temporary employees) laid off by it fnom each seniority group within the prior eighteen (18) months and such list shall show the seniority of such employees. A copy of the daily layoff list will be provided to the local Union Plant Chairperson. When workers are required for a seniority group, the layoff list for that seniority group will be examined and, to the extent of the number of jobs available, the employees listed therein will be recalled fian transfer or layoff in accordance with the provisions of clause 8,05 hereof. If, following such recalls, there is still a deficiency of workers in the Inside or Outside seniority groups, then employees on the layoff list from the other (Inside or Outside) seniority group shall be offered, in seniority order, the option of transferring temporarily to the vacant position. Such temporary transfers shall be subject to the provisions of clause 8.09(c) hereof.
8.09	(e) Employees being recalled shall be notified by telephone as soon as is
practical. It shall remain the responsibility of the employee to ensure that the Company has an up to date telephone number. In the event that an employee is unable to be reached by telephone, the Company will move to the next
HAM1LTON/18
name on the recall list, and shall 'then send a registered letter to the employee requesting him to notify the Company if they wish to remain on the seniority list. Failure to respond to the registered letter within five (5) working days of receipt shall result in the employee's name being removed from the seniority list.
8.09	(0	Notwithstanding anything herein contained it is agreed that if an
outside employee has not presented himself for assignment of the day's work prior to the time his shift is scheduled to commence he shall be considered to be unavailable for work on that shift and in such circumstances the layoff provisions set out above shall have no application.
8.09	(g) It is mutually agreed that an employee who would otherwise be on layoff
may request that part or all of such layoff period be regarded as annual vacation time and be paid accordingly. The Company will honour such requests, provided that the employee has sufficient unused vacation entitlement to accommodate the request.
8.10	If, after recovery from an at work accident or illness accepted by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, an employee is unable to perform his former duties, and if there is, at that time, a regular job in his seniority group which is either vacant or held by an employee having less seniority, such employee shall, if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the required duties, be transferred to such position. If there is no regular job within his seniority group which he is capable of satisfactorily performing, the Company will consider a request for transfer to the other seniority group at his Plant if there is, at that time, a regular job which is vacant and if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties required.
8.11	An employee who wishes to transfer to another Company location, may notify the Company in writing of his desire to do so. When, following completion of the job posting procedure, a vacancy exists at the other location, the employee requesting the transfer shall be given consideration in preference to a new hire. Any such transfer will be subject to the terms and conditions of the collective agreement at the new location.
ARTICLE 9 - HOURS OF WORK - OVERTIME

Such work will be performed at regular straight time hourly rates plus any night shift, Saturday or Sunday premium, if applicable.
9.03 (c)
HAM1LTON/20
If the Company has need to use a temporary employee on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, such work will first be offered to regular employees (including probationary employees) in that department who are not scheduled to work on that day. Such offer of work will be made on a seniority basis to such employees who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required and provided such substitute shift is not scheduled to begin or end within 8 hours of the employee’s regular shift. If a regular employee accepts the Sunday, Monday or Tuesday work, he will he paid straight time and his previously scheduled shift for that week will be reduced by an equivalent number of days, starting from the last scheduled day of the week. If any employee hereunder works a combination of 8 and 10 hour shifts in a week and such combination results in work being performed in excess of 40 hours in the week, the employee shall not be paid at the overtime rate for such excess hours worked in the week. Employees who wish to be offered such work will be asked to sign a list maintained by the Department Manager
indicating a desire to be called for such work. Only employees who sign such list will be called. Employees may add or delete their name from such list at their option.

HAMILTON/22
time and one-half (1-1.5) or two (2) times his hourly rate, as the case may be, for work so performed by him and required by the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement, such premiums shall not be considered as forming part of an employee's hourly rate.
REPORTING PAY
Should any employee who reports for work at his scheduled time, not having been previously notified to the contrary, shall be entitled to a minimum of four hours pay at the rate of pay to which he would have been entitled for the work he had been scheduled to perform on that day, but it is agreed that he shall perform any suitable work for this four (4) hour period, if so required. However, it shall remain the responsibility of an employee who has been absent from work to check with the Company to determine if work is available before returning for work on that shift. If any employee is absent from work with approval on a Friday, it will be presumed that he will be available for work on the following Monday, unless he advises the Company to the contrary. Therefore, should such an employee be unable to report by Monday, he must notify the Company to that effect prior to his scheduled start time.
BREAKS
(a)	Every employee will be allowed one (1) paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes during each one-half ('A) shift. Rest periods will be arranged as near the mid-point of each one-half {'A) shift as possible.

HAMILTON/23
scheduled at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance) to employees who are not scheduled to work on that day on the following basis:
|(i)	Such opportunity will first be made available on a seniority basis to
those regular employees who normally perform the work on which such overtime is required; and
(ii) in the event that the Company’s needs cannot be entirely satisfied in that manner, the overtime opportunity will then be made available on a seniority basis to other regular hourly rated employees in the same seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required;
(iii) in the event that the Company’s needs are still not satisfied, the overtime opportunity may be offered to probationary and temporary employees in the seniority group.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Company firm using temporary employees, properly employed under Article 2.06, to perform the work in order to avoid the necessity of pre-scheduled overtime, provided the temporary employee has worked fewer than 5 days in that week (or four days if employed on a 10 hour shift).
Un-Schcdnled Overtime
In the case of unscheduled overtime, other than overtime to be performed as a continuation of work in process, the Company will endeavour, in so far as the requirements and efficiency of operations will permit, to make such overtime available on a seniority basis to regular employees on the following basis:
(i) in the appropriate department;
(ii) then to regular employees in the appropriate seniority group; in the event that the Company’s needs are still not satisfied, the overtime opportunity may be offered to probationary and temporary employees in the seniority group;
who are available on the Company’s premises at the time such overtime is to commence and who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
If the unscheduled overtime work is for a pre-shift period, the overtime shall be offered and assigned in the same manner as above to employees on that incoming shift.

9.10
It is understood that to facilitate the distribution of overtime work, employees may be required to indicate their desire for such assignments by signing an "employees available for overtime" list. Employees who sign the list for overtime and refuse to work the overtime on three occasions within a three month period shall be excluded for overtime for three consecutive months from the last date of refusal. It is further understood that in the event that all overtime requirements cannot be filled on a voluntary basis, such work may then be assigned (subject to applicable law) on a reverse-seniority basis to those employees in the appropriate seniority group who are capable of satisfactorily performing the work required.
It is agreed that the Company will not normally offer opportunities for overtime work if doing so may reasonably be expected to result in an employee working more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours. However, in the event that an employee should work for more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours (excluding unpaid meal breaks), he shall not be considered available for any assignment until eight (8) hours have elapsed firm the completion of the overtime assignment. In such an event, the Company will make every reasonable effort to reschedule, by up to two (2) hours, the start time of the employee's next regularly scheduled shift so that he will still have the opportunity to work a regular eight (8) hour shift or regular ten (10) hour shift.
All overtime to be worked by employees must be approved, in advance, by the Company.

If.on any day the sales volume of a Sales Area is such that not all regularly assigned Delivery Driver's are required, the mostjunior of the employees in that Area will be temporarily reassigned to another Sales Area in which there is a vacant route that day. In the event that there should be no vacant route, then such employee shall displace the most junior of all regularly assigned Delivery Driver's who, in turn, shall become a Delivery Salesman for that day.
8.	Any routes which remain vacant after the assignment of all available regularly assigned Delivery Driver's shall then be assigned to spare Delivery Driver's.
9.	Should an additional Sales Area be required on a temporary basis, the Delivery Driver's required in such Area will be assigned on a temporary basis. Similarly. should a Sales Area be temporarily discontinued, the affected Delivery Driver's will be temporarily re-assigned elsewhere.
10.	When it is determined that an additional Sales Area will be required on a "permanent" basis, the basic complement of Delivery Driver's for that Area will be filled by the job posting procedure.
HAMILTON/48
11.	When it is determined that a Sales Area is to be "permanently" discontinued and if there are no corresponding additions to complement in other Sales Areas, then the Delivery Driver's who were so displaced shall in turn displace the most junior of all regularly assigned Delivery Driver's.
12.	It is understood that the expression "job posting" as used herein refers to the procedure set out in clause 8,06 of the Collective Agreement (i.e. the initial vacancy and the vacancy created as a result of the filling of the initial vacancy shall both be posted).
GENERAL
13.	Effective on execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees to identify the service districts into which Hamilton's service territory is divided (District 1, District 2, District3, Other).
This identification will permit existing Sales Equipment Servicemen to identify by seniority the general or predominant nature of the work assignments in a particular service area.
Work assignments will include both service and installation work and will be posted on a yearly (twelve (12) month) basis.
It is understood and agreed that , employees may be assigned service or installation work which are of a location other than those associated with the general or predominant nature of the service area.
14.	Notwithstanding anything herein contained, it is mutually understood and agreed that inculpable inability to meet satisfactory standards of performance may be grounds for a non-disciplinary change of assignment within the Job Classification of Warehouseman or Delivery Driver.
This expression of intent to provide further recognition of individual preferences, on an experimental basis, shall not be construed as a contractual obligation nor shall it in any way diminish existing management rights and prerogatives with respect to conduct of the business or deployment of the workforce.

3.	Members of the E.R.P. shall, subject to the Plan provisions, retain their right to benefits accrued for service up to December 31, 1988, Such accrued benefit shall not be subject to increase by reason of future service or increases in earnings after December 31, 1988, However, service rendered with the Company after December 31, 1988 will be counted towards eligibility for vesting and early retirement under E.R.P,, based on benefits accrued at December 31, 1988,
4.	On retirement, death or termination of service after December 31, 1988, benefits payable to former E.R.P. members will be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of that Plan.
5.	In order to address the issue of a past service unfunded liability in the amount of $246,670,00 of this Pension Plan and a higher than normal future service contribution rate, the Company has accepted the Union's proposal (during the negotiations to renew the collective agreement which expired on December 31, 2000) to fund these amounts from wage rate increases.
Accordingly,
HAMILTON/55
1)	Effective July 1, 2001, and for the life of the renewed Collective Agreement, the Company shall contribute $1.05 per hour for all hours paid by the Company (hours paid shall include hours worked, vacation, observed holidays, sick days, jury duty, bereavement leave, paid time off for negotiations, etc.), to seniority holding members of the bargaining unit to CCWIPP (previously 46 cents per hour).
2)	Effective July 1, 2001, the sum of 23 cents per hour currently paid by employees of the bargaining unit to CCWIPP shall be paid to the Company who will fund the past service liability as hereinafter provided. Such employee deductions shall cease effective December 31,2003.
3)	The Company shall pay to CCWIPP a monthly lump sum payment in the amount of $7,255.00, commencing March 1, 2001 and ceasing with the last payment to be made on December 1, 2003.

However, when a regular, full-time employee completes his probationary period and achieves seniority standing, the Company will retroactively calculate the contributions (as set out in paragraph #5 hereof) with respect to such employee for the period firm his last date of continuous employment to the completion of his probationary period and shall then remit such contributions in accordance with paragraph #8 hereof.
7.	Contributions, along with a list of employees for whom they have been made, the amount of the weekly contributions for each employee, and the number of hours worked or paid according to the above paragraphs #5 or tt6, shall be remitted to the trustees of the C.C.W.I,P.P.

In the event of receipt of such a notice by the Company either delivered by the Union or the Trustees or direct receipt itself, the Company shall be entitled to direct the Trustees as to the allocation of the contributions made by it.
HAMILTON/56
The Union hereby agrees to indemnify and save the Company harmless from any additional taxes or penalties (including any interest charges) which the Company may suffer or incur as a result of the allocation of contributions by the Trustees at the direction of the Union such that the tax deduction claimed by the Company in the ordinary course of its business for the contributions to the C.C.W.I.P.P. as a registered plan is denied by the applicable taxing authorities. Such indemnity will not be applicable if the denial of the deduction results from the Company seeking a ruling from Revenue Canada, Taxation as to the allocations.
It is agreed that the responsibilities of the Company under this Agreement are discharged by making such remittances within the period stipulated above. It is further acknowledged and agreed that the Company is not responsible for the administration of the C.C.W.I.P.P. or the payment of any benefits under the C.C.W.I.P.P,	'	'
9.

Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Hamilton Re:	Movement of work to Brampton
On April 30, 2001, the Company moved work from the Hamilton bargaining unit to the new Company Brampton location and specifically the work formerly associated with the sales territories of Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga and parts of Etobicoke.
During the negotiations leading to the renewal of the collective agreement expiring on December 31, 2000, the Union contended that the number of employees who moved to Brampton, as a result of the movement of the sales territories, was insufficient and, as a result, significant layoffs could occur in Hamilton. Conversely, the Company maintained that it moved a sufficient number of employees so that only minimal layoffs would occur related to the normal seasonality of the business.
In order to provide the Union with certain assurances with regard to this matter for the duration of this collective agreement i.e. to December 31, 2003, for all regular full-time employees who were employed at the Hamilton location as of the date of the movement of the territory on April 30, 2001, the Company agrees to provide the following, effective from the date of ratification of the collective agreement:
1.	A one-time training opportunity will be offered and paid for by the Company for all eligible employees as defined above, who currently do not have an AZ license to obtain such, provided that they already possess a minimum Ontario "Class GM license. The Company will ensure that such training opportunities do not conflict with employee's scheduled vacation periods. In order to accommodate such training, employees will be required to complete the training outside of their working hours, The purpose of this training is to provide these employees with the necessary qualifications for alternative work at the Company should a layoff occur in their regular occupation. Employees who have received such training shall not then be entitled to refuse an assignment to the position for which they have been trained. The Company will provide the Union with a list of employees who refuse
HAMILTON/67
such an offer of training; and,
2.	The Company further commits that up to ten (10) of the mostjunior Drivers will be offered training in the warehouse department in order to gain the necessary qualifications to work in the warehouse should work in their normal classification not be available. An employee who has received such training shall not then be entitled to refuse an assignment to the position for which he has been trained; and,
3.	Where an employee accepts the offer to be trained, as described herein, it shall be agreed and understood that in order to accommodate such training, that employee’s regular shift assignment may be changed for the duration of this training.
4.	Having regard for the anticipated business of the Hamilton Sales Centre, the Company commits that 90% of the employees who were regular full time as at April 30 , 2001 will not be laid off for the duration of the collective agreement which expires on December 31, 2003. This commitment will NOT apply in the following circumstances:
In the event that the Company experiences a downturn in its business as a result of circumstances beyond its control.
For periods of layoff of an employee for less than five consecutive days unless the total number of days of layoff for that employee in any calendar year exceeds ten (IO).
Where a permanent movement of work from Hamilton to another Company location has occurred and employees refuse to transfer, at the Company’s request, with such work to the new location.
Where an employee has refused to be trained for alternative work and such work is available which he would have been otherwise able to take to avoid layoff.
Until all options available under the collective agreement for work have been exhausted Including, but not limited to, working on a scheduled day off to obtain 40 hours in the week, moving a scheduled day off, bumping, etc.
5.	With regard to those employees to whom the commitment described in paragraph (4) above does not apply, the Parties acknowledge that these employees will nonetheless be offered training as outlined in paragraphs (1) and (2) above as well as the options provided in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement.
6.	Notwithstanding the provisions contained in paragraph (4) above, an employee shall be laid off in the event that he has refused a training opportunity and there is insufficient work available in his own classification. Such layoff shall occur only after the layoff considerations as otherwise provided in the collective agreement have been exhausted.
