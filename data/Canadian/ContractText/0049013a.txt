8.02	Employeeswhose annual vacation entitlements are 3 weeks and over may use up the week(s) in excess of 2 by taking vacation time in any number of fraction of days (i.e. a day here, day there). A maximum of 2 weeks vacation (depending on employee eligibility) per year may be divided up and taken in this manner. Employees making such requests will give reasonable notice where practicable. It is understood that the existing policies apply, i.e. no more than four (4) employees absent on vacation at one time.
8.03	The vacation list will be posted no later than December 1st of the previous calendar year to have employees state their preferred choice of vacation dates for the coming year. Such notice will be removed by the Company on January 1 st and a schedule will be completed by the second Friday in January. The Company will schedule vacations by seniority providing there is a limit of no more than four (4) on vacation and the required number of qualified or trained people are available to perform the work during such vacations.
Note: The Company and the Union shall meet, after determining the two (2) weeks maximum vacation period (i.e. summer) for each employee, for the purposes of reviewing the shifts that employees will be working in an attempt to distributethe off-shifts in an equitable manner.
Note: It is understood that, in the process of completing the vacation schedule in accordance with Article 8.03, an employee, who has sufficient skill, ability, and physical fitness to fulfil the job requirements, may make a request at the time of the preparation of the vacation schedule to fill a job vacancy created by another employee’s taking time off for vacation. The Company will attempt to distribute the requests in an equitable manner recognizing seniority, fairness, the Job Training Program and the Company’s operational requirements.

In order for these persons to be considered for regular full time status, they must commence a probationary period** pursuant to this Collective Agreement.

(e)	fails to return to work from an authorized leave of absence on the date he is to

return without supplying an acceptable reason to the Company;

ARTICLE XIII - LAYOFF AND RECALL
13.01	a) When it becomes necessary to reduce the working force of employees, seniority
will prevail so long as it does not prevent tie Company from maintaining a working force of employees who possess the skill, ability, and physical fitness to capably perform the work which is available and are willing to do such work at the scheduled rate for the job. In such cases where an employee with seniority accepts a lower ratedjob rather than be laid off, his regular rate will be protected for a period of thirty working days. Short time operations are not considered layoff for purposes of this article. Short time operation shall be defined as any day of work of less than 8 hours. Employeeswho have not had the opportunity to qualify for anotherjob, in accordance with 14.05, will be given up to 2 weeks to qualify for a junior employee's job to avoid a layoff.
b)	For the purpose of this clause, it is understood that all senior employees possess the skill and ability to perform the packer/piler job.
c)	i) When it becomes necessary to change shifts, the Shift Schedule -
Appendix A will be used.
ii)	For purposes of this Article and when a third (3rd) shift is cancelled, it is understood that one of the employees in the classification, under normal circumstances, will move in accordance with his seniority and in accordance with the attached Shift Schedule Appendix A.
For purposes of clarification, if there is an employee on a three shift operation and a reduction occurs in which employees are required for two shifts then the remaining employee(s) in the classification with the least seniority will go back to his former posted job (if there was one) in accordance with Appendix A. Furthermore, when the third shift becomes operational then the one employee will revert back to his position on the third shift in accordance with Appendix A. If there is no such employee, the vacancy will be posted (e.g. batch mix operator, rotating shifts).
iii)	It is understood that a job posting(s), under a three shift arrangement that has not been reinstated within eighteen (18) months of being cancelled when it went to a one or two shift arrangement, will be deemed void and require a new posting.
13.02	A more senior employee may choose to take a layoff instead of a junior employee, if the senior employee so requests. The agreement to go out of seniority by this employee must be by mutual agreement between the Company and the employee.
- 16 -
The employee shall have normal recall rights but may not bump another employee even if the layoff is extended.
13.03	The Company shall notify the Union and those employees affected by any layoff, of such layoff, at least 5 working days in advance of such layoff or pay to those employees an amount in lieu thereof. This section shall not apply to layoffs of less than 5 working days duration.
13.04	Laid off personnel will be recalled from layoff on the basis of seniority provided those recalled possess the skill, ability, experience and physical fitness to capably perform the work which is available.

Re: 1995 Negotiations
During the negotiations for the renewal of the Collective Agreement expiring March 31, 1999, the issue of maintenance staffing arose. As a result of these discussions, the following was agreed upon:
“It is recognized that the Company has the sole discretion to seek, appoint, and retain a person for the position of Maintenance Man (Senior), whether such a person is acquired from inside or outside the bargaining unit, and to determine what duties are or are not required in that position. Payment shall be in accordance with Schedule 1 in the Collective Agreement.”

Re: Article VIII - Vacation
In order to clarify the interpretation of Article 8.03, the following is understood:
At the beginning of week one of the scheduling, the first four (4) senior employees will be approached in the first three days of this week regarding their vacation preference and they must indicate their preference by seniority in the remaining two days (Thursday, Friday) of the same week or be placed at the end of the list. In week two of the scheduling, the next four (4) senior employees will be approached in the first three days of this week regarding their vacation preference and they must indicate their preference in the remaining two days (Thursday, Friday) of the same week or be placed at the end of the list. The process continues until all employees have had the opportunity to make a selection. If any employee is absent, unavailable and/or cannot be contacted, he will be placed at the end of the list as if he did not make a selection in his applicable week. After all employees have had the opportunity to make a selection, the relevant articles will apply.
Employees, who have not exercised their right during their week, may exercise their right at any time as long as they do not interfere with anyone who has exercised their preference.
The parties agree that they may jointly waive this letter during the life of the agreement in the event that the parties cannot accept its application.

The Company and the Union both acknowledge the safe and early return to work provisions pursuant to the occupational health and safety regulations, and WSIB directives.
It is understood that all workplace parties are to cooperate with Modified Duties/Transitional Return to Work under WSIB and the Human Rights Code. It should be noted that in addition to legal compliance, early return to work has been proven to benefit the employee’s rehabilitation process. Therefore, modified or transitional work plans for disabled or injured workers are not subject to the posting process with respect to training opportunities or job postings. The Company will provide suitable modified work, including training, to disabled employees as it is required to do, and there will be not complaint or grievance on behalf of other employees in the bargaining unit regarding posting of this work and/or training.
