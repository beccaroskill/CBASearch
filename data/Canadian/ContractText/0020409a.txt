18
to both the employee and the supervisor, not more than forty-five (45) calendar days after the original overtime assignment
giving rise to the claim or the date such original assignment was determined to be in violation, whichever is later. In the event the employee and the supervisor are unable to reach agreement to satisfy this forty-five (45) day limitation, the matter will be deemed to be settled and the employee will be recorded refused overtime for the number of hours in question. This forty-five (45) day period will be extended by the number of shifts an employee is absent from regular duties on an approved leave of four (4) or more consecutive days.
Such overtime assignment will not result in another employee

PROMOTION. SENIORITY. TRANSFERS. TRAINING AND PROGRESSION CHARTS
11.01a) i) Permanent progression within any area shall be in
31
accordance with progression charts and notes, Appendix “B”. Qualification is based on the employee’s knowledge of the theories, procedures and equipment related to the job in question. The Company undertakes to evaluate the qualifications of employees in a fair and just manner. The Company agrees that all employees will be given every opportunity to qualify for the next higher jobs within the minimum time periods, as set out in the progression charts, Employees shall be provided with special instruction, instructional material and/or any other advice or means for self-improvement. If an employee has not qualified for the next higher job because the Company has not given him the opportunity to train within the minimum time period, the Company agrees that within a further ninety (90) day period the employee shall receive the opportunity to train and qualify. Providing the employee qualifies during this ninety (90) day period he shall receive his wage increment retroactive to the date of completion of the minimum time period as outlined in Appendix “B”.
ii) When a permanent vacancy occurs the most senior man in the next lower classification or phase will be given the job provided he is qualified for move up or phase progression. In the event that it is found that an employee has not sufficient qualification for move up or phase progression he will be informed as to the areas in which he is expected to improve and will be given extra assistance in those areas. If time is such that it would not be practical for re-evaluation of said employee before the vacant job must be filled, the next most senior employee will be given the job, subject to the same conditions. It is agreed that the senior employee will be given the same opportunity for all subsequent vacancies in the next higher classification or phase. However, if the senior employee, providing he meets the certification requirements where required as outlined in Appendix “B”, has not been given the opportunity to train for the job, the position will be filled on a temporary basis for up to thirty (30) working days, during which time the senior employee will be given the opportunity to train and qualify.
32
iii) Pay classification seniority will be the governing factor to determine move up, however if pay classification seniority is the same, the qualified employee with the most area seniority will be given the job. If the area seniority is the same, then the qualified employee with the most Company seniority will be given the job. Pay classification or area seniority begins on the date an employee is given a permanent assignment in the pay classification, phase or area. If there is no one qualified in the given pay classification, phase or area, then persons in the next lower pay classification or phase will become eligible. An employee may, with the approval of the Area Superintendent, decline a permanent move up. In such case his rate of pay will be fixed at his currently assigned position rate in accordance with Appendix “B”. This agreement will remain in effect until cancelled by either party with 30 days written notice. The date of cancellation will determine the employees pay classification seniority for subsequent progression.
b)	Move-ups caused by temporary vacancies as well as training for the next job shall be in accordance with the Progression Charts and Notes for each area.
c)	Temporary shift vacancies will be filled by the next most senior employee on the shift concerned, or as outlined in Appendix “B”, provided the employee has sufficient training.

i)	When filling job vacancies on a temporary basis, resulting from vacations, injury, sickness, leave of absence, training or emergency, the temporary procedure may apply beyond thirty (30) days.

project.

Badge numbers will be assigned to new hires in the order of the lowest number representing the most seniority. If required, a similar draw shall be held to determine the order of Company seniority for any employees whose order of Company seniority has not been previously determined.
e)	It is the Company’s intent that, when the equipment or plant area is in operation, all shift positions will be manned. It is also the intent that when the equipment or plant area is not in operation, but is ready and available for operation, and it is evident that it may be required to operate during a shift, then in the event any employee is absent, move-up will be made to man each position.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2
This letter outlines the intentions of the parties with respect to Article 6.08 (a). It is not intended to affect the operation of existing
chit systems.
It is understood and accepted that this provision is a “best efforts” overtime opportunity and not an absolute equalisation clause. It is not intended that a Supervisor endeavour to equalize overtime on a day-to-day or a week-to-week basis, nor is it intended that he always offer overtime to the employee with the least hours in the pay classification.
Overtime lists are zero at the beginning of each calendar year. The list published mid-year is used as check point to determine where the emphasis should be to have the overtime opportunity distribution reasonably equalized by the end of the year.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #7
HARASSMENT
The Company and the Union recognize the right of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual or workplace harassment, and to be treated fairly and with respect in the workplace. The purpose of this letter is to outline activities for both the Company and the Union to provide a workplace environment that is productive and promotes both the dignity and self-esteem of all employees.
For the purpose of this joint initiative, Sexual Harassment means any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that causes offence or humiliation to any employee or that might be perceived by the employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on any employment relationship.
Workplace harassment means any unwelcome behaviour, which creates an intimidating, threatening or hostile work environment such that an employee’s performance is impaired, the employment relationship is adversely affected or the employee’s dignity or
respect is denied.
For the purpose of administering this joint initiative, two (2) harassment Co-ordinators shall be jointly responsible but not
limited to:
-	Review existing Company/Union Harassment Policies and Procedures for effectiveness and recommend improvements
-	Assist in communicating/educating all employees on these procedures and policies
-	Act as contact/resource people for harassment complaints and
investigation.
These co-ordinators (preferably one of each gender with one selected from the Company and one by the Union) will be trained to carry out their duties. Every attempt will be made throughout any investigation procedure to maintain complete confidentiality.
105
knowledge and awareness is a critical part of combating harassment. The co-ordinators will recommend programs to inform and encourage fellow workers to recognize the problem and take control of their own situation through exercising their rights.
It is both the right and the responsibility of all employees who believe that they have been subjected to unacceptable behaviour to first ask the instigator to stop the unwelcome behaviour. If the harassment continues, the individual should then go to a Coordinator to discuss the concern. The Co-ordinators will investigate the employee’s concern, and if substantiated, will take any necessary steps within their mandate, to reach a decision, which attempts to bring an informal resolution.
If the matter is not resolved, any person may proceed to the next step within ten (10) working days of the Co-ordinators’ decision. The individual advancing the matter to the next step shall send a formal written submission to the senior management person on site and to the local union president. The senior management person and the local union president or their designate(s) should meet with all affected persons within five (5) working days. They will investigate the matter and will take any necessary steps to reach a decision. Management will be responsible for any corrective action resulting from the decision.
Any person not satisfied with the decision, will have the option of
either filing a grievance and/or a human rights complaint; or utilizing Suncor’s Complaint Resolution Procedure for a final and binding
decision.

MATERNITY LEAVE
“REPRINTED FOR INFORMATION ONLY - NOT SUBJECT TO GRIEVANCE OR ARBITRATION”
Suncor’s policy will grant permanent employees maternity leave, without pay, equal to or exceeding the provincial legislation for the province of employment (Alberta - 27 weeks) provided the employee has completed the required period of employment
(Alberta - 12 months).
A “Request for Leave” form must be completed with the appropriate signatures at least four (4) weeks prior to your leaving work. This completed form should then be brought to the Benefits Department who will discuss your options, as to which benefit coverages you wish to continue during your leave, and which you wish to decline.
Your maternity leave begins on the date you elect to leave work,
if not for medical reasons, or on the date of delivery if you leave work for medical reasons, and runs to a maximum of 27 weeks. The 27 weeks referred to is a total amount of leave and is to be combined with your spouse’s paternity leave, if applicable.
Although the overall condition of pregnancy in itself is not a ground for entitlement to sick leave, it is acknowledged that during the time before date of delivery, you may be physically incapacitated for work and are therefore eligible for short term disability (STD) benefits, payable by Suncor under it’s normal sick leave plan schedule. You must submit a medical certificate for this period to the HEALTH CENTRE who will advise your Supervisor to start keying in your time as sick.
STD benefits will continue for you until the date of delivery. You must IMMEDIATELY notify your Supervisor and the Benefits Department of the birth of your child. In turn your Supervisor will
prepare the “Temporary Removal from Payroll” slip and forward it to the Compensation & Benefits Department.
You will be removed from the payroll system and the Payroll

“Record of Employment” papers required to claim Employment insurance. ***PLEASE NOTE - WITHOUT THESE NECESSARY PAPERS, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR U.I.C., SO ENSURE THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS.** You
will file for Employment insurance during the week that you are no longer being paid by Suncor on STD - or the week of the date of
delivery.
You are also eligible for a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit (SUB) for the six (6) weeks immediately following the birth of your child. This benefit payment provided you with coverage during the time you are considered medically disabled due to childbirth. Benefits will be provided beyond the six (6) week period only when you continue to be disabled and it is supported by a medical certificate. l-he need for an extension beyond the six (6) week period is a rare occurrence.
The SUB plan is administered consistent with the rules for shortterm disability. These rules include such things as the benefits to be calculated on base earnings, benefits to be based on the salary in effect on the date the disability commenced, etc. You will receive benefits under the SUB plan based on either 95% or 66 2/3% of your basic earnings in accordance with the STD schedule of payments, offset by the amount of the UI benefit you receive.
During the period that you are paid by the SUB plan, you may elect to continue to contribute to the Savings Plan. Contributions to the Savings Plan will be based on either 100% or 66 2/3% of your basic earnings in accordance with the STD schedule of payments. If it is your intention to contribute to the Savings Plan during this period, you must sign the necessary authorization on the SUB application, so the payroll department can reduce your SUB payment accordingly.
You must apply for Employment Insurance and be in receipt of the El benefit before SUB becomes payable. You must provide proof of the El payment by providing copies of the El cheque stubs and the application form to the Payroll Department.
109
If you wish to return to work prior to the end or the six-week postnatal period, as per provincial legislation, you must provide the company with a medical certificate of good health. For return to work, you will provide the company with two (2) weeks advance notice of your intent to return. The company will make arrangements to reinstate you to your former position or one of comparable responsibility at the same salary range and benefits.
