3.02	The Company agrees that these functions will be subject to, and exercised in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the rights of the Union.
ARTICLE 4

4.01	There will be no discrimination, intimidation or coercion by the Company, their officers or representatives, or by the Union, its officers or members, against any employee for any reason.
4.02	No Union activities shall be pursued on the Company’ premises except as permitted by this Agreement, or with prior approval of the Company.
ARTICLE 5 STEWARDS
5.01	The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise select stewards, who shall be permanent regular employees with seniority, and employed in the department or departments they represent.
The number of stewards, and the zones each represents shall be determined to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. Each steward shall represent only those employees in his agreed zone except as he may be acting as a member of the grievance committee.
The Union will supply the Company with a list of stewards showing the zone for which each is
— 3 —
responsible. The Company will be notified in writing each time a steward resigns or is appointed and will not be required to recognize, as a steward, any employee whose name does not appear on the list.
In the event of the resignation of a zone steward, the Union will insure that the vacancy is filled within two (2) calendar weeks thereafter, and the name of the new steward delivered to the Company. The above time limit may be extended by mutual agreement.

— 4 —

5.05	MEETINGS WITH MANAGEMENT
Where it is necessary for Union representatives, grievers or witnesses to meet with Management representatives, permission for time off will not be unreasonably withheld.
5.06	UNION COMMITTEE

For purposes of this provision, the term “Union representative” shall not be restricted to regional representatives of the Joint Board, or other employees of the International Union, nor shall the provision be construed as limiting the calling of such witness as may be required.
The Company agrees to pay the individual members of the Union committee for all time lost by them as a result of their involvement in negotiations for a renewal of the collective agreement.
When meetings take place between the Company and the Union for purposes other than for the renewal of the collective agreement, grievance meetings, and arbitration hearings, the Company reserves the right to limit participation by bargaining unit members to a reasonable number from each affected classification for a particular committee or subcommittee
— 5 —

9. 16 ADDRESS CHANGES

13.05	SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 13.04 above, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company agrees:
(a)	to pay an employee who is absent from work while receiving sick benefits under the group insurance, or benefits under the Workers’ Con-pensation Act at a time a plant holiday occurs, the plant holiday pay to which he would otherwise be entitled under the provisions of this Agreement;

because of personal sickness verified by a certificate signed by a licensed medical practitioner
— 29 —
