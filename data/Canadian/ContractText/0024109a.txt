COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
between
SIFTO CANADA INC., a Corporation under the laws of Canada, herein acting with respect only to the Goderich Mine located at Goderich, Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the “Company”.
and
THE COMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND PAPERWORKERS UNION, Local 16-0, located at Goderich, Ontario, hereinafter referred to as the “Union”.
1
ARTICLE 1 PURPOSE
1.01	The Company and the Union have entered into this Agreement at Goderich, Ontario, for the purpose of recording terms and conditions of employment, resulting from collective bargaining which are to be observed by the parties hereto. It is their desire to maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees, to settle all differences in an amicable manner as herein provided, and to work together to achieve the most efficient operation of the plant and to promote the safety and health of the employees.
102 There shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint, coercion, harassment, or intimidation by the company or the union against any hourly or salaried employee because of membership in the union, age, race, religion, colour, sex, sexual preference, marital status, ancestry, or nationality.
ARTICLE 2 SCOPE
2.01	The company recognizes the CEP Local 16-O and its properly appointed executive as
2
10
1.01-2.02
the sole Bargaining Agent of the employees covered by this Agreement. The rights, terms and conditions of this Agreement apply to Bargaining Unit employees unless stipulated otherwise.
2.02	The following employees are excluded from the bargaining unit:
•	All office staff including executive, managerial, sales, engineering, laboratory, accounting, and clerical.
•	Supervisory employees above and including the rank of acting foreman.
•	Security guards to protect the property of the company.
•	All parttime and any temporary employees who have not completed the probationary period described in clause 6.01. Such employees shall be subject to equivalent provisions to those provided by article 5 (check-off) article 13 (hours of work and overtime) article 14 (rates of pay) and article 18 (bereavement leave). It is understood that such employees shall be released before any regular employees are laid off and no new employees will be hired
3
under this section if any regular employee is on layoff.
2.03	Supervisory employees shall not do work which is customarily performed by members of the bargaining unit. This does not apply when the supervisor is engaged in any of the following:
•	Training an employee in a manner, which does not supersede or preclude established training.
•	Conducting work of a research and development nature.
•	In emergencies, for the safety and health of employees or the protection of company property.
2.04	Security guards shall not do work which is customarily performed by members of the bargaining unit.
2.05	Except as provided in 2.02 above, this agreement shall not apply to probationary employees. It is understood and agreed that the termination of any such employee shall be deemed to be for just cause.
4
2.03 - 2.07
2.06	The following departments are recognised:
•	Mining
•	Surface Operations
•	Surface Maintenance
•	Underground Maintenance
•	Hoisting
2.07	So far as practicable with the work force available, normal maintenance, repair and production work which has been done regularly by the Company’s own employees will continue to be done by such employees.
New construction, installation or modification of equipment, major repairs, major maintenance, major overhaul work, warranty work or other work not regularly done by the Company’s own employees may be done by outside contractors.
This clause is not intended to restrict the Company to let contracts when it feels it necessary, economical, or expedient to do so, such as not having the necessary equipment, supervision or employees immediately available with the necessary skills or when peaks of work would require a temporary increase of the Company’s forces with subsequent layoff of such forces.
5
If it becomes necessary to contract out work as provided for above, the Company agrees to give a written notification of the reasons for such contracting out to a designated representative of the Union, prior to the work being performed. The Company will normally provide 3 days notice for major contracts involving more than 10 outside workers. If time does not permit, the Company shall notify a Union official and follow with a written notice. In the notification, the Company will give the name of the contractor, the approximate number of personnel involved, the approximate duration and the job to be performed.
The Company will not cause an employee to be laid off, demoted, terminated or transferred by bringing in outside contractors to perform normal maintenance repair or production work on the plant premises.
ARTICLE 3 COMPANY RIGHTS
3.01	The Union acknowledges that it is the exclusive function and right of the Company to:
a)	Operate and manage its business in all 6
respects, except where any right to do so has been specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement;

c)	make and alter from time to time rules and regulations to be observed by the employees, provided such rules and regulations are not inconsistent with this Agreement;
d)	schedule the production;

g)	subject to 3.02 below, incorporate all manner of technical and process improvements.
7
3.02	Technological change is defined as the introduction of new technology into the operation or the automation of an activity, which results in a significant change in the method of operating the business. It does not include such things as a change in the volume or timing of business or the routine replacement of equipment.
The company agrees to notify the union of pending technological change, at the earliest practical date which will permit a meaningful discussion of the impact of the change on the operation and the workforce. Such discussion shall include the following:
•	the probable effective date;
•	the approximate number and classification of employees to be affected, if any;
•	the approximate number of jobs to be abolished and/or created, if any;
•	any change in the terms, conditions or security of employment.
It is understood and agreed that any new or significantly changed job created by the technological change will be posted in accordance with clause 6.05.
a
If the technological change creates a permanent reduction in the number of employees at the operation, the reduction shall be effected in accordance with the terms of Letter of Understanding#6.
ARTICLE 4
UNION RECOGNITION
4.01	The Company recognises the Union, during the term of this Agreement or any renewal thereof, as the exclusive representatives of the employees for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to hours of work, rates of pay and other conditions of employment, as set forth in this Agreement.

9
employee problems arising out of their employment with the Company.
4.04	The company will advise the union in advance, whenever a member of the bargaining unit is requested to participate in the evaluation of new equipment or methods. No bargaining unit employee will participate in any activity or function which is reserved to the union under clause 4.01 or current employment legislation without the express permission of the union.
4.05	The company will provide the union with up to one hour to meet new employees during their orientation process.
4.06	The Company agrees that if the Local Union President, Vice President, Treasurer, Chief Stewards (3), Recording Secretary, Sergeant at Arms, Occupational Health and Safety Certified Representative, WSIB Representative, or Shift Stewards (4) wishes to trade shifts with himself to attend the monthly Union General Meeting, they shall be accommodated.
4.07	Should the Company decide to sell or merge in part or in full, any part of the Sifto Goderich Salt Mine with any other Company or entity,
10
4.04 - 5.03
the parties agree that the expressed rights contained in this Collective Agreement shall remain in full force until this Agreement expires as in Clause 22.01 and shall not be altered in any manner until the parties negotiate a new Agreement as in Clause
22.02.
ARTICLE 5 CHECK-OFF
5.01	The Company recognises the right of the Union to levy initiation fees and dues.

5.03	The Company shall remit to the Union biweekly, the initiation fees and regular monthly dues deducted together with a written statement of the names of the employees for whom the deductions were made and the amount of each deduction.
11
ARTICLE 6 SENIORITY
6.01	Seniority shall be determined by an employee's length of service in the bargaining unit. A new employee shall be considered probationary, without seniority until he has accumulated 90 working days of employment. Thereafter, his seniority shall date back to his first date of hire within the previous 12 months. After 30 working days of employment, a new employee shall receive a performance review.
6.02	When an employee accepts a position outside the bargaining unit, he shall cease to accrue seniority. Such an employee shall retain his existing seniority for 12 months, provided he continues to pay union dues during this period. Failure to pay such dues shall be considered a waiver of the employee's seniority rights. On returning to the bargaining unit, the employee will be placed in the labour pool.
6.03	In all cases of promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and recall, the Company shall give preference to the senior employees, provided the senior employee has the physical capabilities and the ability to perform the
12
6.01 - 6.04
job in accordance with Company standards. With respect to the issue of an employee’s qualifications, where there is a difference between the provisions of this clause and those of any other clause or letter of understanding, the terms of the other clause or letter shall prevail.
6.04	a) Permanent job vacancies, including a vacancy on a new classification shall be posted in accordance with Clause
6.05	and shall be awarded to the senior applicant who will be provided with a reasonable amount of time to complete the required classroom training and on the job instruction with a qualified employee.
b)	Thereafter, the employee shall have fifteen (15) working days of actual on the job experience to develop the methods, practices and skills required to be effective on thejob and to demonstratea level ofjob competency satisfactory to the Company.

c)	During the 15 day period referred to above, the employee shall be regularly
13
reviewed and shall receive a written progress report after 10 days. The Chief Steward shall receive a copy of this report. If after fifteen (15) working days the successful applicant proves unsatisfactory, the Company and the Union shall promptly meet and agree to an appropriate course of action. In the absence of an agreement the employee shall be returned to his former position. All employee(s) promoted, demoted or transferred because of the rearrangement of positions shall be returned to their former position.
d)	Only candidates with an up to date license or equivalent skills recognised by the Company in the appropriate trade will be considered for posted positions which require a recognised trade certificate.
NOTE: The Company recognises that all current Maintenance employees included on the current Seniority List, attached to this Agreement, are either certified with an up-to-date license or considered grandfathered by the Company within their equivalent trade.
6.05	Job vacancies, including a vacancy in a new 14
classification as outlined below in Clause
a)	will be considered permanent when the vacancy is to exceed forty-five (45) calendar days. Exceptions to this stipulation are outlined below in Clause 6.06 and 6.07.
a)	Except as specified in Schedule A, Note 3, permanent job vacancies, including a vacancy in a new classification, which are above the Labour Rate shall be posted on the Notice Board for five (5) calendar days in order to give all employees who are interested an opportunity to bid for the job.

d)	The posting will include a statement indicating the shift schedule, crew on

The Company reserves the right to reassign the least senior employee to another shift if required in the future. No prerequisite qualifications or experience gained by an employee prior to awarding of the posting will be considered in the awarding of the posting.
e)	If Classroom training is required, it will normally begin within 10 calendar days, subject to the availability of the employee’s successor.
f)	Whenever there is a substantial change in the duties of an existing job, the job shall be re-posted unless the parties agree to a different course of action.
g)	Job vacancies will be considered temporary when the vacancy is of a duration of forty-five (45) calendar days or less. Unless otherwise stipulated, such vacancies will be filled as per Letters of Understanding #5 and #8.
16
h)	A vacancy in a new classification, Special Assignment or a Project will be considered a Temporary Vacancy when the vacancy is of a duration of forty-five (45) calendar days or less. The Company will meet with the Union and determine the appropriate method for filling the vacancy. The duration of the Temporary Vacancies may be extended upon mutual agreement of the Company and the Union. In such a case, the resulting vacancy will also be extended and not posted.

c) An employee returning to regular duty after his job has been re-posted will be given the option to exercise
17
his seniority rights in all jobs, on all shifts, in all departments provided the employee exercising this option has the qualifications, the physical capabilities and the ability to perform the job in accordance with company standards. If the employee is unable to exercise his seniority rights in this fashion, he will then be offered training on a job, of his choice, to which his seniority and physical capabilities apply. If the employee is still unable to exercise his seniority rights in this fashion, the employee will be returned to the posting he held prior to his absence if the employee still maintains the physical capabilities. Any employee promoted, demoted or transferred because of the rearrangement of positions shall exercise his seniority rights in the same order as stated in clause 6.16 (b) and (c).
6.07	Vacancies generated by normal vacation periods as per Article 16 will not be reposted and shall be filled as per Letters of Understanding #5 and #8. Vacancies generated by the special paid retirement leave in Clause 20.03 may be posted as per Clause 6.05 above after the retiree has exercised this option.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #13 INTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM
The IRS (Internal Responsibility System) is a commitment of all employees to ensure a healthy and safe workplace. The commitment is internal, not relying on third party involvement for the resolution of safety concerns or compliance to regulations and standards. The IRS requires all employees at all levels of the organization to take personal ownership for their own safety, the safe performance of their assigned tasks and the resolution of safety concerns. Employees taking ownership for their own safety does not absolve management, of their legislated and moral obligation to provide a safe working environment for all employees. Creating an organizational framework for safety and promoting awareness of individual safety responsibilities can be as simple as a discussion between employees to remind themselves of a hazard or reviewing a procedure.
Keys to a successful IRS - all employees must:
. have a sincere wish to prevent incidents
•	understand safety is an essential part of their job
•	believe causes and risks can be eliminated
•	avoid conflicts when trying to reduce risk
145
•	not be fearful of reprisals when using the IRS
•	understand their responsibilities under the act
•	take steps to make it effective
•	co-operate with others and strive to improve the process
The IRS is divided into
Direct Responsibility: All employees working along with their supervisor should deal with issues at the lowest level of the organization possible. This process starts with the worker and goes up the line to include immediate supervisors, second line supervisors, department heads, and manager.
Indirect Responsibility:	It provides
assistance to the operations in making the appropriate decision. This includes occupational health and safety committee members, human resources, engineering, and safety department. The “Direct” and “Indirect” responsibility will be reviewed yearly with employees.
