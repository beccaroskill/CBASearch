Dear Mr. Gilbert:
The parties agree that if the Company starts up a crumb line, the rate of pay for work on that line will be $10.00/hour for new employees (not subject to progression) and 70% of the General Production Help rate for current employees (75% effective January 1,	1992) .
The parties will meet to discuss schedules, however, it is understood that it is not the intent of the Company to place employees on this line who would otherwise have a full week of work in the plant.
Yours truly,

Dear Mr. Gilbert:
Should an employees' Weekly Indemnity claim be held up due to unforeseen circumstances, the employee may request to use his or her vacation monies owing to substitute for the W.I. payment until such time the payment is received.
The monies will then be returned to the vacation bank. Should the employee exhaust all vacation monies, the Company and Union will meet to discuss the claim.
