102
record as to the cancellation of the applicable job description and classification shall be established.
(e)	If an employee is temporarily transferred at the request of the Company he shall retain his existing rate or receive the rate for the new job, whichever is higher. On return to his regular job the said employee shall regain his red circle rate.

exists.
12.	REFERRAL PROCEDURE

The statement should not go into great detail, but should indicate the criteria used in sufficient depth to show the applicant that the request was given adequate attention.
(c)	An evaluation done by the Plywood Evaluation
Committee shall be final and binding on the Parties but, at any time after five (5) years since the last evaluation or re-evaluation of a job, management or an individual employee may submit a request for re-evaluation of that job and no other reason than the elapsed time shall be necessary.

September 13,1994 Dear Ross Stryvoke:
Forest Renewal BC (FRBC) has approved the expenditure of approximately $52 million during 1994/95. Those funds are divided between the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks (MELP) and the Ministry of Forests (MoF) with a split of $20 million and $30 million respectively. Contracts are awarded according to criteria established by these agencies. Forest Companies can obtain information from MoF district offices.
The Forest Sector Strategy Committee reviewed the proposed spending program and was advised by FRBC that it was our intention that, where possible, tenure holders should complete this work. We have also stated this intention to MELP and MoF. In addition, we advised both groups that we expect tenure holders to use their own employees and/or regular contractors where possible, and companies from outside the area would agree to hire locally when not possible. These preferences are for 1994/95 work and FRBC will develop criteria for future work with the understanding that the promotion of community stability is a major concern.
123
In addition, the issue of employment adjustment is one which FRBC will be addressing.
In order to accomplish our goals as they will be determined by our Board of Directors, we will require input from a variety of industry stakeholders, labour/management. Therefore 1 propose we plan on meeting at the conclusion of your negotiations.
Sincerely,
“ROGER STANYER”
Roger Stanyer Chief Executive Officer
