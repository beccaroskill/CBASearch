The Committeeman may then or within five (5) calendar days after the day of discharge (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, recognized holidays or vacations) present such grievance to the Human Resources Manager or his designate. The grievance shall then be processed in accordance with the procedure outlined in Step 2 of the grievance procedure except that Management shall give its decision in writing, within three (3) calendar days (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday, recognized holidays or vacations) after the day the meeting was held to discuss the employee's discharge.
