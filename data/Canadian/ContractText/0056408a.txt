(jj) Ifthere is up to and	including 2 hours overtime for an individual position,	it will
offered by seniority to employees at work.
(iii) However, if the entire line is required for up to and including two hours, the overtime will be performed by the employees performingthe jobs.
c.	if an “emergency” as defined in article 8.05, then the employee performingthe job will be required to perform the overtime.
For additional clarity, when calling in employees by seniority for an overtime shift, the following guidelines will be followed:
1.	First choice is to find someone at regular time.
2.	If overtime is necessary, then	offered by seniority if able to do the work and available.
3.	We will make every effort to	schedule a full shift before considering splitting the shift.	We
will first attempt to find someone with at least 12 hours between shifts, then if necessary at least 11 hours between shifts, then if necessary! at least 10 hours between shifts.
4.	If unableto schedule the full shift as described in (3) above, then split the shift into two 4-hour segments.
5.	When scheduling a full or split overtime shift, "time alignment” will bear consideration.
6.	We will only consider someone who is on vacation or stat holiday once all other options have been exhausted.
