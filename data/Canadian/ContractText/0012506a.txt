15.3	It is the intention of both parties that all grievances shall be processed as quickly as possible at all steps. Where discipline is to be applied, it shall be applied within a period of fourteen (14) calendar days of either the occurrence(s) of circumstances giving rise to the discipline or the conclusion of the Company’s investigation relative to the matter. In the event that the employee is not on site during the fourteen (14) calendar day period, the disciplinary form report will be given to an executive member of the Union.
15.4	All grievances to be processed hereunder shall be filed in writing signed by the employee and shall set forth the essential facts of the grievance, with reference to how the employee feels aggrieved, the provision or provisions under which the grievance is filed, and the redress claimed. Such written grievance shall then form the basis of the grievance through all the steps of the grievance procedure and arbitration procedure.
15.5	Grievances meeting the above requirements shall be processed in the manner stated below:
Step 1: An employee who feels he/she has a grievance as defined above, shall continue on the employee's assigned duties. Should the employee wish to submit a grievance, a written grievance shall be prepared and presented to the employee's immediate supervisor by the employee or by the Union. Where the employee is presenting the grievance he/she may be accompanied by a shop steward. The grievance shall be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor within nine (9) scheduled working days (of the employee) following the
27
date of occurrence of the incident giving rise to the grievance. The immediate supervisor shall within nine (9) scheduled working days (of the supervisor) following receipt of the submission of the grievance, give written reply to the employee with a copy to the Union.
Step 2: If a settlement is not reached at Step 1, the employee, along with the employee's shop steward, may within five (5) scheduled working days (of the employee) of the completion of Step 1 present the written grievance to the General Supervisor of the employee's Department. The General Supervisor shall reply to the grievance, in writing, within five (5) scheduled working days (of the General Supervisor) following the date on which the grievance was received by the General Supervisor.

The Superintendent shall reply to the grievance in writing within five (5) working days (of the superintendent) following the date on which the grievance was received by the Superintendent.
Step 4: A fourth step grievance meeting may be held at a place to be agreed upon by both parties to discuss an outstanding grievance, provided however such meeting shall occur and a reply shall be given not later than thirty (30) days after the completion of Step 3.
15.6	If a grievance as defined in Section 15.1 above involved a group or groups of employees, the grievance procedure may be commenced at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. The same shall be to a group grievance. Such grievance must be submitted in writing within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the grievance.
28
15.7	If a grievance occurs as defined in Section 15.1 and concerns the Union as a whole, and would not be handled by the provisions of Section 15.5, the executive of the Union may within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the grievance, present a written grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure, except that such grievance shall be presented to the mine manager or his/her designate and not to a department superintendent.
15.8	If an employee believes that he/she has been suspended or discharged without just cause, the matter shall be presented at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure within eight (8) days after written notice of such discharge has been sent by double registered mail to the employee's last known address or after written notice of such discharge has been personally given to the employee. The Union will be given a copy of such written notice.
Where it is not convenient for the suspended or discharged employee to do so, an Executive member of the Union may present the grievance signed by the employee to the appropriate Superintendent at Step 3.
Where an employee is suspended or discharged and such action results in the employee being removed from the site, a Union Executive member or a shop steward will be notified without unreasonable delay. The employee affected will be permitted a reasonable amount of time to review the suspension or discharge with an Executive member or shop steward of the Union. The Union will be advised in writing of any discharge of a non-probationary employee.
Where an employee is required to attend a meeting with the Company in respect of a reprimand, suspension or discharge, the employee shall be informed that he/she has the right to have an Executive member or shop steward of the Union in attendance at any such meeting. If the employee wishes an Executive member or shop steward to be in attendance, the meeting shall proceed with the Executive member or shop
29
steward in attendance. If an Executive member or shop steward is not available, the meeting nonetheless shall proceed.
15.9	The remedy for adjusting a suspension or discharge grievance, if it is determined that any is justified, may consist of reinstatement with or without back pay or with partial back pay, or may consist of pay or partial back payment without reinstatement, or may consist of any other redress appropriate to the circumstances.
15.10	If settlement is not reached at Step 3 or Step 4, the grievance may be referred to Arbitration as set forth in Article 16. The Union shall notify the Company of its intent to seek arbitration by written notice, served by double registered mail within forty-five (45) days, after the completion of Step 3 or Step 4, whichever is applicable in the circumstances.
15.11	All time limits for the filing and processing of grievances are mandatory and any non-compliance with such time limits shall result in the grievance being deemed abandoned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Union may, by agreement in writing, extend or waive any time limit.
15.12	Where a Disciplinary Form Report is to become part of an employee’s personnel file, the employee shall be provided with two (2) copies of the same. One copy shall be for the employee’s personal record, and the second shall be for the Union's files.
15.13	Where an employee has been disciplined and adisciplinary report has become part of his/her personnel file, if the employee does not commit another similar act for which the employee has been disciplined, within a period of four (4) years, the earlier disciplinary report shall be removed permanently from the employee’s file and shall not be valid for consideration in any future discipline.

RE
ARTICLE 21.4 - COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
During negotiations for the new Collective Agreement, the parties agreed to amend Article 21.4 of the Collective Agreement to read as follows:

RE: Articles 34 and 35 of:
Collective Agreement
During negotiations for a new collective agreement the parties engaged in discussions relative to Articles 34 and 35 of the collective agreement.
During those discussions the Company representative made certain observations relative to those Articles. Those observations are as follows:
Article 34 - Contracting-out
The company re-affirms its comments that before contracting-out work cf a significant nature, that its representatives will advise the Union as to the nature of the work it contemplates contracting-out.
The foregoing shall apply only where there are bargaining unit employees on lay-off (retaining recall rights), sufficient in number and qualifications, such that there would be a reasonable expectation they could perform the work economically and expeditiously if afforded an opportunity to do so.
This undertaking does not limit the company rights as set forth in this Article or otherwise.
Article 35 - Work by Supervisors
The company re-affirms that the duties of supervisor are primarily supervisory in nature.
The intention is that Supervisors perform bargaining unit work only in cases where the circumstances are such that the supervisor deems it is necessary to do so.
The company undertakes to remind supervisors as to the provisions and limitations set forth in Article 35.
We believe the foregoing summarizes the essentials of our discussions relative to those Articles. Yours truly,
B. Hickie
Manager, Human Resources

The parties agreed that they will form a joint union - management committee to identify bargaining unit work currently being performed by supervisors, in an effort to find ways to minimize such work. The committee shall be charged with the responsibility of crafting an agreement covering such work and identifying when it may be appropriate to have Supervisors perform it.
It is recognized that the duties of a Supervisor are primarily supervisory in nature, therefore, as a show of good faith, in the intervening period it is agreed that a Supervisor shall not perform bargaining unit work except in cases of emergency*.
For the Company:
B. Hickie
Director, Human Resources
For the Union:
G. Hunter
National Representative
*Emergency includes any situation that has the potential to cause injury to an employee, physical damage to the plant or to equipment, environmental damage, or continuation of operations.
Unavailability of qualified bargaining unit employees due to plane delays or by reasons of absence shall be considered as an emergency.
