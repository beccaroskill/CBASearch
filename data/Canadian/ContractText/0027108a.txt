It is agreed that there shall be no loss of bargaining unit jobs as a result of out-of-scope positions being created.

The Employer shall at all times be advised of the name and address of the individual to whom the said dues are to be remitted.
ARTICLE 5 - SENIORITY
5.01	(a) Seniority for all in-scope employees shall be defined and determined from the
first (I s’) day an employee enters the service of the Employer. Effective the date of ratification (May 25, 200 1) of this Agreement, the seniority date for each current employee, as shown on the seniority list on the date of ratification, shall continue to be the seniority date for such employee and shall not be changed unless and until the seniority is lost pursuant to 5.01(c).
(b)	New employees shall be on probation for a period of ninety (90) days’ worked during which time they may be dismissed without reference to seniority. “Days worked” refers to days when the employee is present at work performing their duties (a day of classroom training shall not be a working day). The Employer shall be under no obligation to rehire such employee and such dismissal shall be deemed just cause. Such probationary employees shall not have access to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Collective Agreement except where, in the sole opinion of the Union Grievance Committee, the following criteria has
Page 3
been alleged to have been violated by the Company in assessing the dismissal of a probationary employee as to whether or not the Company has met its onus of just cause.
In assessing the just cause test of a probationary employee dismissal, the parties shall take into account whether the employee was given a fair opportunity to demonstrate his/her ability and whether the employee was notified of deficiencies in his/her performance and given an opportunity to correct them.
(c)	An employee shall only lose seniority in the event:
(i)	he is discharged for cause and is not reinstated;
(ii)	voluntarily terminates;
(iii)	is laid off for a period of longer than twelve (12) months.
(d)	For the purpose of determining seniority of two (2) or more employees who have the same seniority dates, their entire social insurance numbers will be used. The employee with the lowest social insurance number will be considered the senior.
5.02	(a)	(i)
In all layoff, recalls after layoffs, vacancies and promotions, ability being sufficient, seniority shall govern. An employee has the right to bump a junior employee for shortage of work on a day-to-day basis regardless of his/her classification and/or department provided that they have the same starting time, ability being sufficient and it is being done prior to the last coffee break in the day. Should an employee elect not to bump a junior employee prior to the last coffee break, an employee will work at any job assigned by management or, at his option, go home for the remainder of that shift, in which case, such employee shall waive his/her rights to his/her guarantee of hours.
(ii)	Rules of Bumping for layoff and a permanent elimination of positions,
Employees exercising their rights to bump under Article 5.02(a)(i) shall
do so subject to the following rules:

(2)	An employee who exercises his/her rights to bump shall bump a junior employee and the permanent position only. Relief positions shall not be affected unless the relief position is in conflict with the
Page 4
terms of this Agreement.
All employees who were affected by the bumping procedures shall have the first right of a permanent recall to their former positions.
Any employee who accepts recall to his/her former position shall only vacate the permanent position he/she was in but will continue to hold any relief position provided the recalled position does not bar the holding of a relief position.
Any employee who refuses to accept recall to his/her former position shall then vacate all permanent positions and be reclassified to a Floater position. In such a case, the Company will post and fill the vacancies created by such a decision.
(b) When a short kill is scheduled which causes a transfer of employees from another area of the plant to the packaging department in order to make up the guarantee of hours then the parties agree that employees shall indicate their willingness to transfer by placing their name on a Department Transfer List posted by the Company on a day-to-day basis as required by the Company. The Company shall then select the appropriate number of employees as needed based on their seniority from the list. Should an employee not wish to place his name on the list then such employee or employees shall waive their right to their guarantee of hours. All employees shall make their preference known no later than the first meal break each day of the posting and all affected employees shall be notified by 12:00 noon of each day.
However, if the Company requires an employee or employees to leave the plant and go home then the guarantee of hours shall apply. NOTE: List to be posted by the kill board.
The Company has agreed to establish a transfer list every six (6) months. The Company may, at any time, require employees to transfer between shifts. Such transfers will be requested of employees in order of seniority.
Once every three (3) months, the Company will choose from the list an equal number of male and female employees by seniority to a maximum of three (3) for each gender to a maximum of six (6) employees total to transfer from the 2nd Shift to the Day Shift or visa versa.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1

ABSENTEEISM
It is recognized by the Union and Management that Employee absenteeism is disruptive to the
Employer’s business and to the Employee’s co-workers who are required to fill in for the absent
Employee.
It is agreed that the following policy shall be in effect during the term of this Collective Agreement.
1. Subject to paragraph 2. below, Employees who are absent from work for more than twelve
(12) separate periods of one (1) day or more during any twelve (12) month period, regardless of the reason for such absence except for absences under Workers’ Compensation and with an approved leave of absence, shall be subject to the following discipline:
(a)	first occurrence - five (5) day suspension;
(b)	second occurrence within two (2) years but not less than six (6) months after the first occurrence - dismissal.
I. Where, in the opinion of a medical doctor who is approved by the Employer, the Employee is suffering from an illness or injury such that it is unreasonable to expect that the Employee will be able to avoid chronic absenteeism, the Employer will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the Employee in the workplace before resorting to the measures set out in paragraph 1. above.
3.	Where an Employee suffers from illness or injury as set out in paragraph 2. above, the onus is on the Employee to obtain the medical opinion and to notify the Employer at the earliest opportunity that he or she may be chronically absent from work due to such condition.
4.	Employees who will be unavoidably absent from work for reasons of sickness, accident, etc., should notify the Personnel Office of this fact as early as possible. This information should normally be given to the Employer prior to the start of the Employee’s shift. If this should prove impossible then not later than one (1) hour of their scheduled start time.

5. For the purpose of this Letter of Understanding, a day shall mean a period of two (2) continuous hours.
