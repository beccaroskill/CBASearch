LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING_________________________________
October 26,1990
Reference: Foremen and Leadhands The parties recognize that a Lead Hand is essentially a working foreman. They also recognize that the restrictions on foreman working have caused a number of grievances and operating difficulties that the parties wish to avoid.
Therefore, it is agreed that:
-	the “foreman” classification will no longer be used
and all references to foremen will be deleted from the collective agreement;
-	the following named employees who currently hold the classification of foreman will become leadhands in their respective departments and work in accordance with Article 26.04
*	Boris Baran
. Robert Gagnon
*	Chris Vanderkamp
58
-	the named individuals will continue to earn their current wage rates until such time as the wage rates for lead hands exceed the current foreman's rate (ie. they will have their current wage rate “red circled”) and under no circumstances will these individuals earn less than their current rate as a result of the elimination of the foreman classification;
-	the designation of these individuals as lead hands
rather than foreman will not be used to reduce the number of employees in these departments; and
-	other than the named individuals, all other lead hands will be appointed in accordance with Article 26.04.
While it is not the Company's intention to reduce the number of positions in these departments now or in the future as a result of the elimination of the foreman classification, the parties recognize that any special benefits or guarantees that apply to the three named individuals to compensate them for this change shall not continue for any other individuals after these individuals terminate employment or cease to hold their current positions.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING________________________________
December 22,1989
Reference:	Article 6.03 (b) Contracting Out
It is agreed between the parties that for the purposes of Article 6.03 (b) the definition of “work” means the regular and normal maintenance function and any construction work that in the past has been performed by the Tradesmen and which is work normally done by the Tradesmen which in all the circumstances would be reasonable for the Tradesmen with seniority to perform.
It is further agreed that this is the interpretation of Article 6.03 (b) for the purpose of the “work” defined above; there shall be deemed to be added to the sixth (6th) line
59
of the Article, after the word “lay-off”, the phrase “who would normally perform the work..? This interpretation shall not change the language of Article 6.03 (b). It is for the purposes of interpretation only.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
August 16, 1993 Reference: Article 10.02
The parties agree to delete Article 10.02 - Regular Employee List -from the collective agreement and re-number the remaining clauses of the article appropriately as the Regular Employee List no longer exists.
However, the following named employees, who held “regular employee” status prior to February 28, 1975, shall retain all of the rights to which they were entitled under Article 10.02 - Regular Employees List. This means that, for as long as they remain Sun-Rype employees, they will have the equivalent of DE status, whether they continue to hold a DE position or not. Employees covered by this letter of understanding are: William Zarikoff	Michael Pereverzoff
Gordon Hamm	Jerome Veller
Rodney Rath Jose Amorim Richard Hawley George Hermanson
Armand Vermette Umberto Cagnoni Jiri Mikolasek
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING___________________________
August 16, 1993
Reference:	Article 20 - Hours of Work
The Company and the Union recognize that the Company will have to implement alternative shift schedules that incorporate Saturday and/or Sunday work in order to remain competitive and attract new business to the
60
company's operations in the future. Further, the parties recognize that many of the details of such schedules are not known at this time and must be defined at the time new business is attracted which requires the implementation of such schedules.
Therefore the parties agree that, as the need arises in the future, such alternative schedules will be developed and implemented in accordance with the following.
1.	A joint union/management committee will be established to investigate and report on all matters relating to the implementation of non-standard work schedules, The committee will be comprised of three (3) representatives of the Company and three (3) of the Union and will present its findings and recommendations to the Vice President, Production and the Chief Shop Steward or the Business Agent as soon as possible.
If the parties are in agreement regarding the recommendations of the committee, a Letter of Understanding will be prepared and signed to govern the implementation of alternative work week schedules. If agreement cannot be reached regarding the method of implementation of new schedules by the union/management committee, the parties agree to submit those implementation issues that remain in dispute between the parties to a grievance panel or arbitrator for resolution.
2.	Any work weekschedule that involves Saturday and/ or Sunday work will attract a premium of 10% of the employee's base wage rate for all hours worked on Saturday and/or Sunday.
3.	Prior to implementation of any alternative work week schedules, the Company will meet with the employees in the affected departments and explain the issues and its ideas on such schedules to them.
4.	In determining schedules for non-standard work weeks seniority will be a governing factor. This will
61
not preclude the implementation of rotational shift schedules.
5.	Employees working on alternative shift schedules will not receive additional wages, benefits or other entitlements other than those specified in 2 above or as specifically agreed by the parties.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING____________________________
16 August 1993 Reference: New
The parties agree to prepare a Letter of Understanding dealing with the issue of harassment in the workplace.
LETTER OF INTENT FORK LIFT OPERATOR
The Union and the Company agree to the following: The Company will train all classified Fork Lift Operators in all aspects of driving forklift in all areas of the plant. To be successful in the classification of Fork Lift Operator an employee must become competent in all aspects of forklift driving in all areas of the plant.
The above conditions will not result in the removal of any incumbent Fork Lift Operators from their positions. Whenever possible, for temporary or regular placement in forklift positions that pay a premium, classified Fork Lift Operators will be used first.
