New rates of pay established will be effective the date an acceptable degree of proficiency is attained by the worker. If a lower rate of pay has been established, the employee shall retain his rate of pay until the next contractual wage increase (or until he transfers to another job) at which time the adjustment will be made.
If a new or changed rate of pay is in dispute, a qualified Industrial Engineer, who is a member of the Association, shall review the process by which the rate of pay was set in accordance with the established procedure agreed to by both parties for determining rates of pay.
Should the rate of pay for a new or changed job remain in dispute after all relevant factors used in the determination of the rate of pay have been examined, it may be introduced as a grievance entered at the third step of the grievance procedure.
(9.6)	Probationary Rates
New employees shall be hired at 5% below the base rate. They will be moved to their job rate at the end of their probationary period or when qualified, whichever comes first.

Subject to the provisions otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Officers of the Association be provided with information regarding the pay rate and progress of any individual employee.
Where the Company has established a new rate of pay and job classification under Article 9.5, and the rate of pay is in dispute, the Association's Industrial Engineer will be granted access to the Company studies (including job descriptions where they exist) pertaining to the review.
(9.8)	Work Measurement and Job Standards
The following procedures will apply during all work studies performed by‘Company and Association representatives.
a)	Only qualified full time employees with appropriate skills and ability will be studied for the purpose of establishing permanent work standards. Whenever possible, this will be an employee(s) who normally performs the work.
b)	A reasonable number of cycles and a majority of the total will be taken during a work study in order to ensure that all elements of the job(s) are included and to improve statistical accuracy.
14
c)	Start and stop times will be recorded along with the name of the individual studied.
d)	All strike-outs on a time study must have a recorded reason.
(9.9)	Job Standards Disputes

If after the fair and just trial period, the Association is still not satisfied that an average qualified worker, working conscientiously can maintain a performance of 1 00%, a recheck study will be made by the Company when requested.
If the standard is still in dispute after the Company audit, a qualified member of the Association may conduct a study using established Company work measurement techniques.
Should the new job rate remain in dispute after a comparison of the Company and the Association studies, it may be introduced as a grievance starting at the second step of the grievance procedure.
It is further agreed that where the new job rate remains in dispute at the third step of the grievance procedure, the Company and the Association may, by mutual agreement, appoint a qualified independent industrial engineer to conduct a separate study. The expense of such study shall be shared by the Company and the Association.

A job elimination occurs in the following circumstances:
- the job is permanently transferred to a different shift

Job Combination Procedure
A job combination occurs when two (2) jobs or more on the same shift are combined, and in such case the employee(s) with the least seniority will be bumped.
The bumped employee(s) will proceed through the bumping procedure under job elimination.
Bumping Procedure
1)	The employee must fill any job vacancy in the Plant that has not been filled under Article 18. If the job vacancy is on a different shift, the employee may displace the most junior employee on his shift, in his department. If he is unable to perform the vacant job or the job of the most junior employee, he may displace the second least senior employee on his shift and so on until he reaches a job he can perform consistent with his seniority rights in his department. This paragraph will also apply to the bumped employee.

This process will continue in order of seniority until all employees are assigned job ownership. If one of the displaced employees is unable to perform the job to which his seniority entitles him, he may move up the seniority list until he reaches a job he can perform consistent with his own seniority rights.
5)	If the employee is unable to bump in accordance with the above steps, he/she will be laid off.
