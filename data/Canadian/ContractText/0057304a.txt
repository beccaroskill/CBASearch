a)	Credit(s) will be deducted from any employee’s rating for equipment that has been re-designed or has not been in production for one (1) year. The employee will have an opportunity to train in another category in order to maintain his credit levels.
b)	In the event an employee does not:
i)	accept training in another machine category; or
ii)	successfully meet the established criteria as set out in the training requirements.
he shall revert back to the wage rate associated to the number of earned credits.
49
8.	Other than for the purpose of experimentation, or testing a piece of equipment which has not been in production for one (1) year, an employee will regain all lost credits once the equipment is fully in production again and the employee has demonstrated that he fully meets all of the established criteria as set out in the training requirements.
9.	A redesigned piece of equipment means extensive design changes which would result in an employee losing the credits assigned to that machine. Maintenance employees would then have to meet the established criteria as set out in the training requirements of the redesigned piece of equipment to qualify for the credits assigned to that machine.

Dear Mr. Erskinc:
Re: The definition of a re-designed piece of equipment
This letter will serve to clarify the understanding reached between the parties with regard to the definition of a redesigned piece of equipment as provided for in Schedule “B” Terms, Definitions and Conditions Number 9, of the Collective Agreement.
An example of arc-designed piece of equipment is the U.F.O. machine. Originally a plastic bottom half was inserted into the machine manually. The plastic bottom half was then filled automatically with candy. The lop half was placed over the bottom half manually and both pushed together by art air cylinder. A label is then placed on the top of the U.F.O. automatically, and then packed into a display box. This machine operated at a speed of seventy-two (72) strokes per minute.
The product U.F.O. has been discontinued and the machine n-designed to produce a combination of .products which are Giant DinaSour Eggs, which have one (I) egg per box, Giant DinaSour Eggs, which have two (2) eggs per box and the Juice flavoured products.
These products arc all small cartons of approximately the same size, which automatically feed into the machine, glued automatically on the bottom, filled automatically, glued automatically on the top and discharged from the machine to be packed into a display box at a speed of one hundred and forty (140) strokes per minute.
Each of the small cartons requires a certain amount of change-over time each time a different product is required.
The re-design was very extensive, ultimately changing the machine Completely to produce different products.

Definition of a Re-designed Piece of Equipment Page 2
Often we will introduce auxiliary pieces of equipment to the main packaging machine, such as a packing aid for the packer. Although this is a change, it becomes part of the packaging machine requiring a certain amount of time to learn. The change is not extensive enough to be considered a re-design.
Other examples of changes that have occurred in the past, which would not be considered as a re-design change are:
weight changes or size changes or count changes, such as 3 cent Bazooka. 5 cent Bazooka, 10 cent Bazooka, 15 cent SwecTarts, and 30 cent Bottlecaps
Changes to equipment that are of a minor nature that do not affect the basic operation, will not be considered as a re-design change.

PRODUCTION INCENTIVE BONUS
June 14,1990
The "Production Incentive Bonus” is a method of supplementing the hourly wage payment of production employees involved in packing operations and all employees in the Maintenance Department.
Production employees when performing “fill-in” or temporary jobs such as special promotions or prepacks (deals) and bulk packs, or other packing operations which are designated as such, do not participate in the bonus scheme.
The details of the Production Incentive Bonus system arc its follows: PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES
For every packaging machine operation in the plant, the Union and Management had mutually agreed on the speed of the machine in packages per minute, the amount of downtime required on the machine (ic. lunch, breaks, changing paper, mechanical adjustments, personal fatigue, etc.) and the resulting output of the machine operating at 100% efficiency in an 8 hour shift.
From the above data, a bonus structure is developed which pays the employee 20 cent per hour for all hours worked on the bonus job, when the machine operates at 70% efficiency, increasing to 50 cents per hour for all hours worked on the bonus job, when the machine operates at 100% efficiency.
For efficiencies between 70% and 100%, bonus payments rise accordingly:
ic. at 80% efficiency, the bonus payment is 30 cents per hour for all hours worked on the bonus job and at 90% efficiency, the bonus payment is 40 cents per hour for all hours worked on the bonus job. In summary, for each 1% increase in efficiency above 70%, the bonus rate increases by I cent per hour.
For efficiencies over 100%, bonus payments are paid accordingly:
ie. at 101% efficiency, the bonus payment is 5 I cents per hour for all hours worked on the bonus job and I 10% efficiency, the bonus payment is 60 cents per hour for all hours worked on the bonus Job
61
When employees are assigned to a specific packaging machine operation for less than a whole shift, the bonus structure is adjusted accordingly:
ic. an employee operates a machine for 4 hours of a shift and is then
transferred to another operation. If in the 4 hour period, the machine operates at 100% efficiency, the employee will be paid 50 cents per hour for the four hours.
A “pre-production” bonus shall apply for a 6-weck period to new packaging operations or to existing packaging operations that have undergone a major change. This is to compensate employees while they are learning a new machine or operation. The “pre-production” Bonus operates at a level of efficiency of 70% of the final incentive schedule,
ie. If the final 100% efficiency is to be 1000 boxes per shift, the 100%
w-production efficiency will be .70 x 1000 = 700 boxes and the 70% prc-production efficiency will be .70 x 700 = 490 boxes. The hourly bonus rates are then adjusted to this efficiency schedule.
A minimum incentive bonus on production machines of 20 cents per hour on established bonus jobs, shall apply where production is reduced by more then one (1) hour, due to lack of supplies.
The Union, through its Union Committee, and/or the Company, has had the right to request a review of any bonus rate. Any such request to be in writing giving reason for review.
A review shall consist of 2 Work Studies to be completed within 30 days. Any adjustment up or down to an incentive bonus rate has then been discussed between the Union Committee, the employee involved, and the Company.
Bonus rates may also be reviewed by the Company because of the introduction of new material and/or new equipment, the simplification to present equipment and/or manufacturing methods of procedures and if errors have been made in the initial standards have changed by at least 5% as a result of the changes mentioned above.
Bonus rates for new products and/or operations (where feasible) are established between the Company and the Union Committee after the necessary work studies have been completed.
A manual outlining the schedules of the Production Incentive Bonus for each packaging machine operation in our plant is available on request.
62-
All employees in the Maintenance Department receive a Promotion Incentive Bonus baaed on the weekly operating efficiency of all packaging machine operations as posted weekly by the Production Department. Based on a 40 hour week, all Maintenance employees receive an hourly incentive rate based on the following schedule:
PLANT OPERATING EFFICIENCY	INCENTIVE	RATE
Below 70%	0	cents per houi
At 70%	35	cents per hour
At 71%	35.5	cents per hour
At 72%	36	cents per hour
At 73%	36.5	cents per hour
At 74%	37	cents per hour
etc., etc., etc.		
At 100%	SO	cents per hour
At 101%	50.5	cents per hour

Re:Machine Categories and Credits Associated to Each
This letter will serve to clarify the understanding reached between the parties with regard to machine categories and credits associated to each, as provided for in Schedule “B” - Terms, Definitions and Conditions Number 2, of the Collective Agreement.
Similar or like machines have been grouped together to create one (I ) machine category. This normally occurs when the mechanical function of the machine is considered to be the same or similar or combined in an operation. Usually training is only required on one piece of equipment and the rest of the equipment in the same category may require no more than a few days of orientation.
ie. We currently have five (5) box machines:
I Tart ‘N’ Tiny, 35 cent Nerds
I • Gobstoppers, DinaSour Eggs, Ball Gums. Freckled Eggs I • Punkys, Flip Flops, Heart Breakers, Candy Coated Sweetarts I Runts. 10 cent Nerds, 35 cent Nerds, 10 cent Gobstoppers 1 Nerds, Bumbles and Guppie Containers 5 Total
Although there are five (5) separate machines, they are only considered to be one (I ) category.
continued

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Machine Categories and Credits Assigned to Each
Page 2
Each machine category has been assigned a specific number of credits. based on the degree of difficulty for each piece of equipment.
A rating of five (5) would be a machine that requires fewer skills and less experience lo maintain in an efficient manner, where a higher rating of fifteen (15) would be a machine that requires a much higher degree of skill and a lot of experience to maintain in an efficient manner.
Therefore each category has been weighed based upon their degree of difficulty.
