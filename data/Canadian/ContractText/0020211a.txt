b.	For an indefinite period, two weeks written notice being required.
c.	There may be circumstances where Union leave of an emergent nature may require a leave of absence where the union is not able to provide one (1) weeks written notice. In this circumstance the Local Union President (or designate) will contact the Mine’s General Manager and advise as to the nature and request for the leave. Requests will not be unreasonably denied.
6.02
a.	The Company agrees that a leave of absence without pay to a maximum of one year shall be granted to employees for good and sufficient reason. Such request for a leave of absence will be in writing and the response will also be in writing and no such leave will affect any employee's seniority rights when used for the purpose granted. During a leave of absence of 30 calendar days or less all benefits will be maintained. Seniority will be maintained and accumulated on leaves of 30 calendar days or less, and maintained for that portion of a leave that is in excess of 30 calendar days. During a military leave of absence of 60 calendar days or less all benefits will be maintained. Seniority will be maintained and accumulated on military leaves of 60 calendar days or less, and maintained for that portion of a leave that is in excess of 60 calendar days. If an employee works elsewhere, except for military leave, while on leave of absence, he will lose all seniority and drop to the bottom of the seniority list unless he has written permission from the Company to do so. Such leave shall be granted without discrimination, and in cases of leaves for periods in excess of three months, approval must be obtained from the Company and the Union.
An employee on approved leaves of 30 or more calendar days may continue benefit coverage for up to one year beyond the timelines set out above, by paying the full amount of the medical, dental, vision care and basic group insurances (excluding Short Term and Long Term disability coverage) premiums. The Company agrees to remit the same with its regular group billing returns. In order for an employee to be eligible for the provisions of the benefit plan, an employee must apply and remit payment to the Company prior to the billing date.
b.	In the event that an employee requests and is eligible for Maternity and/or Parental leave under the appropriate legislation in effect, the period of such leave shall be considered as Company service for seniority, pension and vacation entitlement (excluding vacation pay) purposes. An employee on approved Maternity and/or Parental leave may continue benefit coverage beyond the time limits as set out in 6.02 a. by paying the full amount of the medical, extended health, dental, vision care and basic group insurances (excluding Short Term and Long Term disability
12
coverage) premiums. The Company agrees to remit the same with its regular group billing returns. In order for an employee to be eligible for the provisions of the benefit plans, an employee must apply and remit payment to the Company prior to the billing date. Upon the employee’s return to work from the approved leave, the Company will reimburse the employee for the full cost of the premiums paid by the employee while on leave. If an employee works elsewhere while on leave of absence, he will lose all seniority and drop to the bottom of the seniority list unless he has written permission from the Company to do so.
6.03
Special leave of absence with pay and with maintenance of seniority rights, shall be granted in cases of death in the employee's immediate family. Immediate family shall mean an employee's mother, father, brothers, sisters, spouse, children, mother-in-law, father-in-law and grandchildren. Such leave shall not exceed 24 scheduled working hours.
Spouse, as defined by Canadian Legislation shall include a common-law spouse who has cohabitated in a spousal relationship for a minimum of twelve months. Children shall include the natural or adopted children of a qualified common-law spouse.
In the event of the death of brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, grandparents, or grandparents-in-law, 8 hours of leave shall be granted with pay and maintenance of seniority.
ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.01
Complaints
It is the mutual desire of the parties that any issue shall be dealt with as quickly as practicable, with full discussion and disclosure in an attempt to avoid the need for a formal grievance. All employees are encouraged to discuss issues with management on an on-going basis, but if an employee feels they have a complaint, they shall discuss the matter with their foreman with the assistance of their Union representative, if requested. This shall be done before a formal grievance is issued.
All grievances, except as provided for elsewhere in this agreement, and those relating to an employee who has acquired seniority and has been discharged, shall be dealt with by following Steps 1, 2, and 3 of this procedure. The grievance of a discharged employee as noted above shall be taken up at Step 3 within fourteen (14) days after the day the employee has been terminated from the Company.
Step 1
In the event of any grievance arising during the currency of this Agreement, the employee or employees concerned shall within fourteen (14) days after the employee knew or ought to have known of the matter giving rise to the grievance, refer the matter in writing signed by the employee or employees, as the case may be, to his crew Shop Steward (failing his availability, another shop steward or executive member may be substituted) who, if the Shop Steward considers the grievance to be a legitimate one, shall promptly take the matter up with the designated Foreman of the employee or employees. The designated Foreman and another Company representative shall discuss the grievance with the Shop Steward and another Union representative (with the employee or employees concerned encouraged to attend), and shall render a decision within seven (7) days of being notified of the grievance.
Step 2
In the event that the designated Foreman does not give a decision satisfactory to the Union, or does not render a decision within the period prescribed above, the Grievance Committee may, within seven (7) days,
13
refer the written grievance to the Department Head. The Department Head and other Company representatives shall discuss the grievance with the Grievance Committee and the Shop Steward who signed the grievance (with the employee or employees concerned encouraged to attend), and shall render a decision within seven (7) days of being notified of the grievance, provided however, that if circumstances warrant, this time prescribed may be extended by mutual agreement.
Step 3
In the event that the Department Head does not give a decision satisfactory to the Union or does not render a decision within the time prescribed above, the Grievance Committee may within seven (7) days refer the written grievance to the General Manager of the Company. The General Manager, accompanied by other Company representatives, shall meet with the Grievance Committee and the Shop Steward who signed the grievance (with the employee or employees concerned encouraged to attend) and render his decision within seven (7) days of referral of the grievance, provided however, the time may be extended by mutual consent.
ARBITRATION
In the event that any grievance has not been settled through the procedure outlined above, either party may, within fourteen (14) days after the General Manager's decision in Step 3, submit the grievance to an Arbitrator. The selection of an arbitrator shall be by alphabetical order from the following panel, if available to act. The selection of an arbitrator for the next arbitration shall commence with the next name.
1.	Timothy Christian
2.	Glen Power
3.	Andrew Simms
4.	Chris Sullivan
5.	Colin Taylor
The arbitrator shall convene a hearing and hear the evidence of both parties and render a written decision after the completion of taking evidence deciding the matter at issue within the existing provisions of the Agreement. In no event shall the arbitrator have the power to add to, subtract from, alter or amend this Agreement in any respect.
The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.
The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be shared equally between the parties. Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses including the fees and expenses of its own witnesses and of its own representative.
7.02
For the purpose of Clause 1 hereof, the person duly authorized to act for and on behalf of the officials mentioned herein, during their absence, shall similarly be authorized to act in respect to the procedure outlined herein.
7.03
The Union shall promptly notify the Company of the personnel of its Grievance Committee and the Shop Stewards and of any change in personnel, and the Company shall notify the Union of the names of the designated supervisory personnel with whom grievances shall be discussed as set forth in Clause 1 of this Article.
14
7.04
In the discussions of grievances with representatives of the Company, the Grievance Committee may be accompanied by a representative of the United Steelworkers.
7.05
As far as practicable, all grievances shall be dealt with during working hours, and no employee or members of the Grievance Committee or Shop Steward will suffer loss of pay by reason of time spent in discussing grievances with representatives of the Company.
In the event the Company requests the Shop Steward and/or Grievance Committee to meet outside regular working hours to discuss a grievance, he will be paid at his straight time regular rate for the time spent at the meeting. Such meetings shall only be in conjunction with regular working hours.
7.06
The Grievance Committee shall consist of two employees only. The Union Local President or designate may also attend grievance meetings.
7.07
Grievances alleging violations which directly involve more than one employee and which are sufficiently common in nature that they may be conveniently dealt with together, by mutual agreement, may be submitted as one grievance at either Step 1 or 2. Policy grievances will be filed at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. The time frames for submission and progression, and the representation at the meetings, will be the same as in the steps set out preceding, except that normally not more than two of the employees will attend.
7.08
There shall be a maximum of twelve Shop Stewards at the Highvale Mine covered under the scope of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 8 - SENIORITY
8.01

9.01
When reducing employees, senior employees, ability being sufficient to perform the duties required for the position to be filled, shall be retained. A reduction of employees due to emergency conditions arising in the plant for periods not in excess of two days may be made without reference to seniority. However, every effort shall be made to provide work for employees who would otherwise be laid off.
9.02
a.	The Company shall give employees written notice of permanent layoff of at least:
One week after three months;
Two weeks after two years;
Four weeks after four years;
Five weeks after six years;
Six weeks after eight years; or Eight weeks after ten years.

9.03
a.	In the event of reduction of work in a classification, the employee affected shall be given up to 24 consecutive hours to displace any other employee in any pay classification provided the employee has more seniority than the employee displaced. Circumstances may arise where an employee may require more time to displace another employee. In this event, the employee may request a time extension from the Company and an additional 24 consecutive hours may be granted. Such requests will not be unreasonably withheld, provided they were submitted for good and sufficient reasons. The employee displacing must have the ability to perform the work of the classification which such employee is going into and the trial period shall not apply when the anticipated time period for layoff is less than six months. Should the employee be unsuccessful in completing the trial period or fail to exercise his right to displace another employee within 48 consecutive hours of receiving written notification of his right to displace, he will be assigned to the classification of labourer, but will not be restricted in bidding out of the labourer position by Article 11.06.

c.	The Union and the Company agree that during the bumping procedure, when an individual bumps into a position that requires a trial period, and the individual either is unsuccessful in passing the trial, or discontinues the trial, they will revert to a Labourer’s position. The position that the employee vacates will then be filled by using the bidding procedure outlined in Article 11.
d.	Once an employee is enrolled in the Apprenticeship Program outlined in this collective agreement, and there is a reduction in the workforce, the apprenticeship position can only be displaced by a bargaining unit person who has more seniority and equal or better qualifications.
ARTICLE 10 - INCREASE IN BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES
10.01
When increasing employees, consideration will be given, wherever possible and practical, to local area people being employed.

Notification of rehiring shall be by registered mail addressed to the last address which the employee shall have recorded with the Company, and a copy of such notice shall be given to the "Recording Secretary" of the Union.

RE: Alternative Training
1.	The Company and the Union Executive shall meet monthly to discuss and review the training requirements on the mine site.
2.	It is in the best interests of the Company and the Union to have a sufficient number of trained and qualified employees to provide coverage due to illness or for vacation relief. The Company reserves the right to train as manpower and equipment are available.
3.	Crew requirements will be monitored to ensure that there is sufficient coverage during regular employee absences. All training records will be kept current.
4.	An alternative training program for out of classification training for each mine operations crew will be set up for that crew’s employees. Each classification of equipment where training is required will be posted on a separate bulletin board.
5.	All mine department employees will be eligible to apply for the alternative training on their crew. A list of three employees eligible for alternative training will initially be identified for each classification from the applicants on the basis of seniority; most senior first then second and third. Once the most senior employee has completed his/her training the other two employees will move to the first and second positions and the third position will again be filled from the crew by seniority. Standard bid sheets will be used for this process. Active alternative training will only occur with the listed senior employee.
6.	Training time may not be continuous. Once 480 hours has been achieved within a twelve month period a field assessment will be done by the regular shift foreman or the training department foreman. The results of this field assessment will determine if the employee fails, is given a time extension, or is allowed to write the final exam. Upon successfully completing the final exam and 480 hours in a twelve month period the employee will be considered qualified.
7.	Employees who are currently being trained on a permanent bid as outlined in article 11 are ineligible to apply for alternative training until they have successfully completed the final exam, and operated their bid unit for 4 months after their 480 hour training. Employees may train in only one (1) classification at any given time. Employees are only eligible to train on two (2) different classifications of equipment per year.
8.	The only other restriction from being eligible to apply for alternative training would be if an employee has a 18 month bid restriction resulting from the application of article 11.05 for a particular classification.
57
9.	Refresher training will be required for employees who have previously been in a classification but have not operated equipment in that classification for three (3) years, or have been in another department out of classification for one (1) year. New employees who have previous mining experience may be Highvale refreshed without participating in the alternate training, however priority will be to train the senior employee who’s alternate training is already under way.
10.	The Union and the Company will jointly monitor this alternative training program for fairness and consistency.

RE: Union Executive Position
The Company and the Union (the Parties) agree to the following:

2.	The Elected Executive of Local 1595 have a need to fulfill the responsibilities of their elected positions within the Union, and this responsibility requires their absence from the mine on a periodic basis in accordance with the provisions for Union Leave in the Collective Agreement. Depending on the position within the Executive of the Local, this Union Leave may be more or less frequent.
3.	In order to provide the necessary coverage at the mine site in bid positions, it may be necessary to amend the scheduled shift of a mutually agreed member of the Elected Executive of Local 1595 to allow the necessary time off for Union Leave, and still meet the operational requirements of the Mine.
4.	The determination of when the provisions of this Letter of Understanding need to be enacted will be subject to mutual agreement of the Parties.
5.	When the Parties have determined to enact the provisions of this Letter of Understanding, the Local Union Executive and the Company will mutually agree on the individual that the Local Union Executive will appoint from the current Elected Executive of the Local to fill a shift consisting of an eight (8) hour day, five (5) days per week Monday to Friday schedule.
6.	The selected individual’s bid position will be bid on an indefinite-term temporary basis for the remainder of the appointment. All resulting vacancies required by the Company to be filled will also be bid on an indefinite-term temporary basis for the remainder of the appointment.
7.	The selected individual will normally continue with the duties of their current bid position, within their classification, while on the indefinite-term assignment. If the duties of their current bid are not required on the new shift, the Company will ensure that the individual is provided with alternate work consistent with their qualifications, and the individual shall not suffer a loss in their regular hourly rate.
59
8.	The selected individual will be utilized as an integral part of the harmonious working relationship between the Union and the Company.
9.	Once the appointment is completed the individual will revert back to their previously scheduled shift, bid position/equipment and all subsequently bid indefinite-term temporary bids will also revert back to their previously held shifts and bid positions/equipment.
10. Should the appointed individual’s bid position be reduced during the appointment the process identified in Article 9 Reduction of Work will be followed once the appointment is completed.
11.	Either the Company or the Union can withdraw this Letter of Understanding with sixty (60) days written notice to the other Party.
