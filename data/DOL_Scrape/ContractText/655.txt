said employee. Such transfers to new or remodeled stores are subject to the mutual  
agreement of the Employer. If two (2) or more employees request a transfer to a

store. Once the shift choice is made, neither the employee nor the Employer will  
arbitrarily change the shift. Such employees must advise the Employer and the  
Union, in writing, of their desire for day hours. Where two (2) or more employees  
in the store make this request, seniority shall prevail. Such transfer requests shall  
be implemented within two (2) weeks of the date of request.

### Limited Assortment Stores Initiative  
1. The Company will open limited assortment stores to be operated under the  
banner of Food Basics, Inc., subsidiary of A&P, (or another proven discount  
banner).  
2. Limited assortment stores are characterized by the principles of a fast in and  
fast out merchandising system, using only the minimums of storage and shelving  
facilities and avoiding any unnecessary services interfering with the simple system  
of transferring merchandise from the supplier to the customer. In addition:  
¢ Limited assortment stores will be limited in size to approximately 40,000  
square feet (sales area). Stores in excess of this size may utilize this  
Addendum only by mutual written consent of the parties.  
The products carried in each category will be the best selling products  
normally in a conventional supermarket with a limited number of brands  
and sizes.  
* Stock Keeping Units (SKU’s) will be limited to 20,000. The parties agree  
to meet and discuss excluding certain categories of general merchandise  
products from this SKU fimit.  
° The sales-area layout of each store will normally follow the same basic  
pattern.  
¢ Customer services such as free bags, bagging orders, special preparation  
departments (i.e. meat, deli, bakeoff and produce) will not be provided.  
3. Employees covered by the Main Grocery Agreement who work in a store  
designated for closure that meets the Company standards for a limited assortment  
store, will have the following options:  
a. Exercise their seniority and bump into another Farmer Jack store as per  
### the Main Grocery Agreement.

the conditions set forth in the Addendum that applies to limited  
assortment stores.  
d. Employees shall make their election within fourteen (14) days from  
notification of store closure.  
4. The specific terms of employment at limited assortment stores are different in  
several respects from the terms of employment at stores under the Main Grocery  
Agreement and the Midstate/Northem Agreement. When fifteen (15) limited  
assortment stores have become fully operational, the provisions for economics and  
employment conditions applicable to limited assortment stores will be incorporated  
in a separate, stand-alone collective bargaining agreement for such stores per the
