(h)	RE-EVALUATION
(j) When a job is moved to another grade as a result of re-evaluation, the wage rate for the new grade shall be effective on the date that management or the employee has applied to the Review Committee for re-evaluation.

(k)	SENIORITY
(i)	Subject to the provisions herein set out, Article XX (Seniority) shall continue to apply.
(ii)	Promotions shall be made only where a vacancy exists.
(l)	REFERRAL PROCEDURE
(i)	When the Plywood Evaluation Committee has decided the outcome of a Request for Job Evaluation, it shall transmit its decision to the appropriate Plant Job Review Committee.
(ii)	When an employee’s request for re-evaluation results in no change being made in the job grade, or in a reduction, or when a management request results in no change or in an increase, the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall give to the appropriate Review Committee a short statement of the reasons for the decision. The statement should not go into great detail, but should indicate the criteria used in
26
sufficient depth to show the applicant that the request was given adequate attention.
(iii)	An evaluation done by the Plywood Evaluation Committee shall be final and binding on the Parties but, at any time after five (5) years since the last evaluation or re-evaluation of a job, management or an individual employee may submit a request for reevaluation of that job and no other reason than the elapsed time shall be necessary.

In these circumstances, the employees who were employees of record at the commencement of the temporary closure, and had 5 years continuous service with the Company as of that date, are entitled to severance pay. Severance pay is calculated on the basis of the employee’s seniority at the date of the layoff, not the permanent partial closure.
(c)	Employees with 5 years seniority or greater who are terminated by the Company because of a permanent partial closure shall be entitled to severance pay equal to ten (10) days for each year of continuous service and thereafter in increments of completed months of service with the Company.

overtime or other premiums or add-ons as in the past, as
applicable. However, where alternate shifts are in effect

(e)	Severance pay is not payable if an employee affected by a permanent partial closure is offered a position within the same operation of the company.

SUPPLEMENT NO. 8 ALTERNATE SHIFT SCHEDULING
As referred to in Article V of the Coast Master Agreement
The following are the general principles for the establishment,
implementation or discontinuance of alternate shift schedules.
1.	FLEXIBILTY OF HOURS OF WORK
The parties recognize the need for flexibility of hours other than those outlined in Article V - Hours of Work, Section 1, for the express purpose of better utilization of manpower and equipment, and to increase business efficiency.
2.	SHIFT SCHEDULING
(a)	Any shift schedule that falls outside the regular hours of work set out in Article V, Section 1 is, by definition, an alternate shift schedule.
(b)	In accordance with Article V, Section 2, the Company may implement alternate shift schedules without overtime penalty, provided the principle of the forty (40) hour week is maintained over an averaging period and
(i)	Except by agreement with the Local Union and subject to (ii), maximum scheduled daily hours of work will be 12 hours;
(ii)	In logging the maximum scheduled daily hours of work for physically demanding or dangerous occupations will be 10 hours.
3.	IMPLEMENTATION
(a)	Any implementation of an alternative shift must be done with bona fide business rationale. The Company will provide the business rationale demonstrating the need for an alternative shift, complete with the nature and details of the proposed alternative shift.
(b)	The business rationale will be reviewed by the Local
119
Union and Plant/Camp Committee. The Company will provide information to the Union respecting how the shift schedule provided in Article V is not meeting the Company’s business purposes.
(c)	The company agrees to work cooperatively with the Local Union and Plant/Camp Committee and will ensure that all relevant information is provided. The Local Union and Camp Committee will have the opportunity to review the business rationale and within a two (2) week period propose alternatives.
(d)	If the Union’s alternative proposal is not accepted, the Company will detail the reason(s) why, and may implement the alternative shift proposed by the Company upon 72 hours’ notice, or sooner in cases of other circumstances not in the control of the Company.
(e)	If the Company accepts the alternative proposal, there will be a three (3) month trial period to evaluate that alternative.
(f)	There will be a review of the alternative that was implemented and if the review demonstrates that the business rationale is not being achieved, the Company may implement the alternate shift schedule as proposed by the Company upon 72 hours’ notice.
(g)	Any dispute arising from this implementation process that the Company and the Local Union and Plant/Camp Committee are not able to resolve may be referred to the Shift Dispute Resolution procedure.
4.	GENERAL PRINCIPLES
When an alternate shift schedule is in effect, hourly-based
benefits (LTD, Pension, Education Trust Fund, SAFER),
under the Collective Agreement will be administered on
the basis of hours paid.
(a) The Company agrees that alternate shift schedules 120
will not be introduced where the intention is to increase the use of casual employees in place of regular employees.
1(b) Different parts of an operation may be scheduled on different shifts.
(c)	The principle of the forty (40) hour week is to be maintained over an averaging period. The averaging period will be the period of one shift cycle for any alternate shift schedule implemented in accordance with this Supplement No. 8 taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Prior to the introduction of the alternative shift the shortest possible averaging period will be determined
(d)	Overtime will not be scheduled as part of an alternate shift schedule. When alternate shift schedules are in place, the overtime provisions in Article V, Section 2 will apply, except as referenced in (g) below.
(e)	All existing alternate shift agreements shall not be superseded by Article V, Section 2, except by agreement between the Company and the Local Union.
(f)	Earned vacations will be scheduled on the same basis as days and hours worked under the alternate shift schedule.
(g)	Other Articles of the Collective Agreement, which provide benefits after eight (8) hours, are extended by the amount the regular hours of work have been increased beyond the eight (8) hours per day.
(h)	Employees who are scheduled to work an alternate shift schedule of less than 40 hours per week over an averaging period will nevertheless be paid 40 hours' pay. When an alternate shift schedule is used, each individual shift must be at least eight (8) hours long.
(i)	An employee’s rest days may vary from week to week under an alternate shift schedule. Employees
121
shall not be paid premium pay for changes in their rest days in these circumstances.
q An employee whose rest days are changed by the Company under an established alternate shift schedule, shall receive rate and one-half for work performed on his rest days unless a change in rest day results from the application of seniority or has been agreed to between the employee and the Company.
(k)	There shall be no premium pay paid to any employee whose rest days are changed because of the implementation or discontinuance of an alternate shift schedule.
(l)	Where the Company does not provide to the employee seventy two (72) hours’ notice of a change to an employee’s work schedule, the employee will be paid at rate and one-half for his first shift on the new schedule. The Company will not change an employee’s work schedule to avoid a statutory holiday.
(m)	For ten (10) hour shifts, rest periods will be one (1) ten (10) minute break and one (1) fifteen (15) minute break plus a one-half (A) hour unpaid meal break.
(n)	For twelve (12) hour shifts, rest periods will be two (2) fifteen (15) minute breaks plus a one-half (A) hour unpaid meal break. On a continuous twelve (12) hour shift schedule, the meal break will be paid at straight time rates. “Continuous twelve (12) hour shift schedule” means that there are two 12-hour shifts in a 12-hour period.
(o)	Statutory Holidays
(i)	Immoveable Statutory Holidays (five in manufacturing, four in logging): Labour Day, Remembrance Day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day are “immoveable” statutory holidays. The Company will not, ex-
122
cept in cases of operational emergency, compel employees to work “immoveable” statutory holidays.
(ii)	Moveable Statutory Holidays: Notwithstanding Article XII, Section 10, the Company, with the exception of the immoveable statutory holidays, shall have the right after consulting with the Local Union to require an employee to observe a Statutory Holiday on a day that is not the day on which the Statutory Holiday is normally observed. In all events, an employee will be entitled to a compensating day off, which shall be scheduled by mutual agreement within a 90-day period. In the event the company and the
union are unable to agree on the scheduling of a
substitute holiday within the 90-day period, the parties may agree to schedule it outside the 90-day period.
(iii)	Where a statutory holiday falls on an employee’s rest day, the holiday is to be rescheduled on a work day to occur within a 90-day period by mutual agreement.
(iv)	Identification of Moveable Statutory Holidays: Where an alternate shift equally bridges a holiday and a non-holiday (such as a shift from 1800h to 0600h), absent agreement between the company and the union, the Company determines which shift is to be observed as the Statutory Holiday.
(v)	Payment for Working Statutory and Substituted Statutory Holidays: Employees whose Statutory Holiday is rescheduled under this paragraph will be paid consistent with Article XII, Sections 1 and 2 if they work the substituted Statutory Holiday. Specifically, an employee who works a moveable Statutory Holiday is paid at
123
straight time rates. Where the company and union agree that the employee will not take a compensating day off and will work the “substituted” statutory holiday, the rate to be paid is double rate and one-half.
(p)	Statutory and Floating Holidays will be paid as per the employee’s regular schedule.
(q)	Bereavement Leave and Jury Duty shall be paid consistent with Article XXI. These days will be paid at the regular daily wage consistent with the work schedule.
(r)	Shift Differential shall be paid only for those hours worked outside the recognized dayshift for those employees working the alternate schedule in effect for that crew working in that part of the operation.
(s)	For those employees working an alternate shift schedule with shifts over eight (8) hours the sixty (60) working days referenced in Article XX -Seniority, Section 6: Probationary Period - will be changed to four hundred and eighty (480) working hours in a six-month floating period.
(t)	The Company will provide notice of two weeks of discontinuance of any alternate shift implemented, except where a change in shift schedule is due to other circumstances not in the control of the Company. This discontinuance will not result in any overtime payments provided the full averaging period has been completed.
5.	SHIFT DISPUTE COMMITTEE
(a) The Parties agree that if the objectives sought in alternative scheduling are misunderstood the potential for disputes and disruption is assured. Therefore, it is further agreed that a proper dispute resolution procedure is necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of the industry.
124
(b) The Parties agree to appoint high level representatives to a Shift Resolution Committee that will endeavour to resolve disputes through a problem solving approach.
The Shift Resolution Committee may assist with the implementation of shifts contemplated to meet an operational need or resolve implementation issues the Company and Local Union have been unable to resolve.
(d)	The Shift Resolution Committee will rely on the negotiated language and any other practical approaches that may assist.
(e)	In general, the terms of reference will be as follows:
(i)	Emphasis on resolving alternate shifting disputes at the operational level between the parties in the event they have reached an impasse.
(ii)	Defined timelines for advancing and investigating unresolved disputes.
(iii)	Written statement of facts provided by the local union and the Company to clarify the issues in dispute.
(iv)	No lawyers involved to allow the parties to explore practical solutions to the dispute.
(v)	The use of a Facilitator to assist the parties in a non-binding manner.
(vi)	The Shift Resolution Committee may refer any unresolved issues respecting implementation of an alternate shift schedule to expedited arbitration pursuant to Article XXXVIII, Section 3 of the Collective Agreement. The jurisdiction of an arbitrator appointed under this section is limited to examining whether or not the implementation process in Supplement No. 8 has been followed.
125

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN:
FOREST INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LIMITED AND:
UNITED STEELWORKERS
Re: Alternate Shift Scheduling - Physically Demanding and Dangerous Occupations
The parties agree to establish a high level committee process to interpret and clarify the meaning of Physically Demanding and Dangerous Occupations and how this is applied to alternate shifting. What has caused this to come into questions is schedules in logging which exceed 10 hours per day.
Great concern around working safely and accidents are under scrutiny and the parties want to ensure that all facets are identified and considered.
The parties have agreed there is not a precise explanation to which jobs in logging fit within the terminology. There is recognition that the workplace is influenced by circumstances, such as weather, distance from residence and/or marshalling point, fatigue, terrain, and lighting condition. These items and others all play a factor.
The conclusion is that there are a variety of circumstances that affect each operation and the decisions regarding the length of the workday.
In order to provide some guidance and recommendation for the parties we have agreed to undertake a review of the issue using external professional expertise to examine the situation at an operational(s) level. The external resources will be persons with logging knowledge and a full understanding of Safety and workplace practices.
Those persons will be provided with access to operation management, local unions and experienced employees. It is further agreed that the reviews will begin with the examination of workplaces scheduled to work ten (10) hours or more per day, or where requested by either party.
130
The expectation of this project will be that a set of guidelines, procedures and recommendations will be provided back to the parties.
The parties further agree to explore further funding options for this project with the Ministry of Labour and other agencies.
The parties finally agree that this project will commence within thirty (30) days of ratification of this Collective Agreement.
