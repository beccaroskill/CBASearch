Inter-department transfers will be allowed only in case there is a vacancy in one department which must be filled by hiring. In such case, employees of the other department will be given preference over new hires.
An employee transferring from one department to the other, under the aforementioned circumstances, will, for purposes of fringe benefits, retain all his seniority already accrued.

An employee transferring in the manner described herein shall be allowed five (5) work days in which to qualify and failing to qualify or requesting to be returned within five (5) days shall be returned to his former job without loss of seniority or benefits.

Re: 6-Day Work Schedule (Waferweid)
The changing market profile for Waferboard products requires that the Company seeks greater flexibility to harmonize market variations so as to provide good customer service, reduce costs while delivering a better employment security.
To this effect during the 1996 collective labour negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the merit of introducing a six (6) day operation per week (12-hour shifts) for the Waferweid Department.
The parties agreed to meet during the life of the labour agreement to negotiate a six (6) day operation schedule based on the following guiding principles:
A)	The schedule based on thirty-six (36) hours per work for production employees has to deliver forty (40) hours pay to the regular employees covered by this new schedule.
B)	All terms and conditions negotiated will be subject to a written contractual agreement between the Union and the Company.
C)	The parties agree to support the effective implementation of the change so as to optimize production while ensuring the best interests for the employees.
