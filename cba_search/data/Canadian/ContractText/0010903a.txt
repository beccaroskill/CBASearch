Dear Sir:
It is understood, that subsequent to ratification — 47 —
of the agreement, an active employee who becomes absent from work due to illness or nonoccupational accident for a period equal to his Plant Seniority or for twenty-four (24) months, whichever is the greater of the two, or until he reaches the retirement age of 65 years, will receive health benefits as outlined in Article 12 of the Collective Agreement.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
May 15th, 1982.
RE:	12 Hour Workday
On December 1st, 1980, at our Union-
Management meeting the employees made a formal request for beginning a 12 hour workday. The people affected with the 12 hour day are the ball mill and solution operators who normally work an 8 hour shift on around the clock basis - seven day week operation (operators and alternates).
Terms:
The basic understanding of entering into this agreement is that the 12 hour workday does not cost the Company any more than it would under the normal 8 hour arrangement and also that the employees would earn no less than they would under the 8 hour workday.
Since both Company and Employees agree, then additional language will not be necessary, if questions should arise concerning work schedules, overtime, vacations, etc. all questions would be answered by referring to our Collective Agreement and applying the basic understanding.
(8.16)	Eligibility for bereavement pay would be on the basis of 12 hours for each scheduled day of work while on bereavement leave, but in no event more than the amount that they would have been eligible for under the 8 hour provision for the duration of the bereavement leave.
(8.17)	Jury duty for those employees called to serve as a juror or crown witness (witness for the state) would be paid for all hours lost from scheduled
53
work, less any amounts that they received from the court for their appearance.
(9.02)	Floating holidays will be based on actual hours, example 3 floaters on 8 hour day would represent 2 floaters on 12 hour day.
(9.03)	& (11.05) Holiday premium would be paid at the rate of time and one half for all hours worked except for Christmas, Boxing Day, and New Year’s where the holiday premium would be paid at two times the hourly rate for all hours worked.
(9-04) A holiday not worked but which the employee was entitled to holiday allowance would be paid at 8 times the employee’s normal hourly rate.
(9.07) & (11.04) & (11.05) The work schedule, a copy of which is attached, provides for an average of 42 hours of work per week in a four week scheduling cycle. Our labour agreement provides for overtime to be paid after 40 hours in a work week or 8 hours in a workday. Our arrangement with the 12 hour workday is that the employees will be paid the premium rate for work in excess of 12 hours in a scheduled workday and for work in excess of 36 hours in a work week in which they are scheduled to work 36 hours and in excess of 44 hours in a work week in which they are scheduled to work 48 hours.
It is agreed that an employee would not be required to work more than 16 consecutive hours before being excused to go home. To handle the problem of the “No Show” and other absentee or late reporting problems the patties agree to arrange where an employee is off shift would be available to be called into work by a supervisor in the event that an employee failed to report for the regularly
— 54 —
scheduled shift or give the Company notification of his absence. Alternates who generally work steady day shift on 8 hour workday will be available for holiday replacement, sick leave, floaters. etc.
The foregoing arrangement is subject to withdrawal or cancellation by either the Union or the Company following a 30 day notice to the other party.
