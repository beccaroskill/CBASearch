4.	EXTRA SHIFTS
Definition - an “extra shift” is any shift or split shift scheduled for a department on a Friday night shift, Saturday, Sunday, or Holiday.
67
A “split shift” is normally for a minimum of four (4) hours at the start or prior to the end of the shift unless it is a start up shift, which is of a shorter period depending on the job and department.
A)	Book On
a)	Employees are required to book on their assigned shifts only - “Shifts” and “Core”.
b)	Employees will be considered as volunteers for other shifts, or core assignments if they indicate their availability.
c)	Employees who wish to work an extra shift assignment must ‘book on” the extra shift availability list by 10:00 a.m. Wednesday of each week. If a holiday falls on Friday, the “book on” form must be completed by 10:00 a.m. Tuesday of that week
Extra shift schedules will be posted on the bulletin boards by 2:00 p.m. Thursday of each week for Friday night shift, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, except for Good Friday at which time it will be posted Wednesday 2:00 p.m.
d)	Maintenance Department Extra Shift Scheduling
Employees would be considered unavailable for extra shifts unless they explicitly Book On for extra shifts.
Employees must sign their names and initial appropriate spaces on the Book On lists.
Employees would be able to Book On for their normal bid shift, as well as specify any additional shifts they would be interested in working should they be excess to their normal bid shift in their department.
In order to book on for shifts other than your normal bid shift you must Book On for your normal bid shift first.
68
Out of department book ons will be utilized after all available openings have been filled by department employees who have booked on (Section 6:04).
B)	Scheduling Process:
The scheduling of employees to meet production shift needs and core needs would be done in the following manner:
1.	Weekend workers will fill their normal shift positions first.
2.	Assign by senior employee lowest in hours, employees normally scheduled to the Shift or Core and Booked on by Wednesday 10:00 am.
3.	Assign by Seniority rotation, Core and Shift, to employees excess to their normal shift and booked on.
Assignment would be based on their indicated shift on the Book On form and by seniority rotation to Days, Afternoons and Nights in that order.
The only exception would be where the extra shift would conflict with their normal weekday shift (e.g.: could not be scheduled onto days Saturday if they are scheduled Friday night shift or scheduled nights on extra shifts when the employee is scheduled to work days the following day).
4.	To fill available openings in the schedule by utilizing a twelve (12) hour shift, assignment would be made by seniority rotation.
The twelve (12) hour volunteers would be shown as available for the twelve (12) hours, and would only be utilized after all eight (8) hour extra shift opportunities have been scheduled.
When a Book On for twelve (12) hour extra shift opportunity is used, it is understood that the twelve (12) hours will be continuous extra shift hours. Not broken into an eight (8) hour
69
opportunity, then return for a four (4) hour opportunity at a later time.
The four (4) hour attached opportunity must be part of an extra shift.
Extra shift hours are from Friday night shift 12:00 a.m. to Sunday 12:00 a.m. except when paid Holidays are in effect, then it will extend to accommodate the paid Holidays.
5.	Available openings for non-skilled trade job functions not filled within department will be filled by utilizing out-of-department book ons if available (e.g.: Wall washing and Maintenance helper).
6.	Openings on Schedule
After the schedule is posted and “shift openings” are shown, these openings are available to shift employees within their own classification only until 8:00 a.m. Friday. (Eight (8) or Four (4) Hour)
After the schedule is posted and “Core openings” are shown, these openings are available to Core Employees within their own classification only until 8:00 a.m. Friday. (Eight (8) or Four (4) Hour)
These openings are for an eight (8) hour opportunity; or a four (4) hour opportunity attached to a scheduled eight (8) hour shift (before or after the shift).
After the above time frames and openings still exist, any appropriate trade person(s) willing to come in and fill the open spot(s) will do so on a first come first serve basis.
Split shifts of a four (4) hour opportunity do not have to be at the start or prior to the end of a shift, but may be part of a Day, Afternoon, or Night shift, (e.g.: the front half of a shift, 8:00 a.m.
70
to 12:00 noon, 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., 12:00 midnight to 4:00 a.m., or the back half of a shift, 12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.).
7.	When no employees are available and openings still exist, these postings will be shown on the posted schedule, thus indicating that a Call-in may be used to fill the opening should production warrant it.
Openings would only be shown and scheduled to the maximum of a normal full shift complement of employees.
If a Call-in is utilized to fill the opening within one (1) hour of the beginning of the shift for shift support, the rate of pay would be the same as replacing for absenteeism.
Call-ins for shift support after the start of the shift will not be considered as absenteeism and will be paid at double the rate.
8.	Employees will not be able to voluntarily trade extra shift assignments unless the trade is for a complete week (seven (7) days, Sunday through to Saturday afternoon shift, Saturday night shift to Friday night shift).
9.	To accommodate the situations where Junior Non-Rotating employees are scheduled the next week on shift due to vacation, training or known illness, the following will apply:
a)	A notice will be posted, each Monday, outlining known shift coverage needs for Junior Non-Rotating for the upcoming weekend. This will provide information showing how many employees will be off shift and allow time so that the Junior Non-Rotating employees can book on to the appropriate shifts.
b)	Should any unforeseen issues arise prior to Friday 4:00 p.m. that may require additional Junior Non-Rotating employees to go to shift, those employees affected would be asked if they wish to be scheduled for the Saturday night extra
shift/Sunday extra shifts. If they agree, they would be scheduled in as if they had booked on by Wednesday.
Any changes that may be required after Friday 4:00 p.m. that require Junior Non-Rotating employees go to shift, would be filled without opportunity for them to become available, except if openings are shown and not yet filled by the first come first serve basis.
After Friday 4:00 p.m. Junior Non-Rotating employees will not be obligated to accept the afternoon or night shift if the employee is scheduled on core Sunday.
Note: This process will advance one day on a holiday Friday.
c)	Junior Non-Rotating employee(s) who are required to be on shift, will be considered as shit? personnel for Saturday night extra shifts/Sunday extra shifts. Once the employee is asked or notified, before the schedule is posted, that he/she is being placed on shift the next week, this becomes his normal shift. This means the employee will not be entitled to a core shift unless all the criteria to go off shift is met.
Note: Weekend workers who have booked on are scheduled first on paid Holidays before utilizing out-of-department employees.
C)	Staffing of Extra Shifts
a)	‘Shift” and “Core” - “Shift” employees and “Core” employees are considered as separate groups in administering extra shift overtime. The extra shift list will group employees assigned as “shift” - by each shift and “core”.
i)	“Shift” employees have first opportunity for extra shifts for their given shifts of the week only. (Note: “Shift’
72
employees who do not work their shifts as scheduled -time of day - for at least three (3) weekdays are considered as “Core”).
ii)	“Shift” employees surplus from their given shifts are generally not eligible for extra shifts of other production support shifts, and are only considered for “Core” extra shifts after all “Core” employees have had an opportunity, and if they indicate their availability.
iii)	Core employees scheduled for extra shifts “on core” have all rights and responsibilities to an extended or additional assignment that may develop.
iv)	Shift employees scheduled for extra shifts “on shift”, have all rights and responsibilities to an extended or additional shift that may develop.
b)	i) Any employee who trades during the week, Monday through Friday, will maintain all rights and responsibilities for their normal extra shifts during that week.
ii) Employees who have switched shifts for the week assume the rights, responsibilities, extra shift hours, location on lists’, and extra shift rights of the person they have switched with. They, in essence, own the shift they work for the week. As such, when they Book On for extra shifts, they MUST sign for those extra shifts that align with the weekday shifts they actually work during the week, as per section 4.B)9.
d)	In cases of temporary replacements for shift vacancies, the employee normally assigned retains the rights and responsibilities for extra shifts, if available, and if not absent for all regular shifts. Junior non-rotating temporary replacements will be considered as core employees, when relieved of temporary shift assignments.
73
d)	Employees scheduled for extra shifts may decline a portion of the shift, without charge, if they worked a “stay-over” or “call-in” during the six hours preceding the scheduled extra shift.
Employees declining a portion of an extra shift are required to leave notice of their intentions for Group Leaders, and must report to work not later than 8 hours out of the plant, provided this allows them to report not later than the mid-point of the extra shift. Elours worked of the extra shift will be hours charged.
e)	For any schedule change for extra shifts, identified forty (40) hours or more in advance of the start of the extra shift, the book on list would be used first in attempting to secure replacements.
For any schedule change for extra shifts, identified less then forty (40) hours in advance of the start of the extra shift, the call in list would be used first in attempting to secure replacements.
D)	Extra Shift Daily Opportunity Stay-over
When employees are unable to complete their planned work assignment within the scheduled extra shifts, or should completion of additional unplanned work assignments be required and extended beyond the scheduled extra shifts employees selection will be by senior employee lowest in hours presently on the shift.
E)	Charged Hours and Overtime Policy
a)	The extra shift list will be divided to indicate “shift” employees by shift, and “core” employees. Employees will be charged either as “shift” or “core” employees - not both - based on their assignments.
Surplus shift employees who volunteer to work core assignments -■ will not be charged; and surplus core employees who volunteer to work shift assignments will not be charged.
Extra shift hours would not be charged for employees who were scheduled on a shift other than their normal bid shift.
As assignments change, employees’ names will be moved on the list, and accumulated hours will be based on those of the next senior employee to him/her on that “shift” or in the “core”.
When a junior non-rotating employee replaces a “shift” employee, they will assume the shift employee’s hours. If an extra shift is worked, the “shift” employee being replaced will also be charged the extra shift hours worked.
A voluntary trade for an individual’s personal reasons is not considered as a change in assignment; hence, names will not be moved on the list, and accumulated hours will not change. Individuals will be charged as if no trade had taken place. Hence, any employee receiving the opportunity will only be charged for any opportunity traded away, and not the opportunity received.
b)	Extra shifts on Saturday will be scheduled for a specific length of time.
The Company will guarantee hours of work at least as scheduled. Should an employee request to go home early after having completed his/her assignment(s), he/she will be charged based on scheduled hours. Charged hours will be 1 1/2 times hours scheduled, or 1 1/2 hours worked (to a maximum charge of 12 hours) if hours worked exceed hours scheduled.
Hours worked beyond the scheduled extra shift hours will be considered daily opportunity stay over and will be paid at double time.
c)	Extra shifts on Sundays and Holidays will be scheduled for length of time as required to, complete the assignment. Charged hours will be at double time based on hours worked to a maximum charge of 16 hours per day.
d)	Any employee absent for any reason from the first extra shift which results in his/her missing subsequent extra shifts will be charged for all extra shifts missed, as outlined in section 6:04 N.
e)	When the lowest employee(s) extra shift hours reach one thousand (1000), then one thousand (1000) hours will be deducted from everyone on the list.

Except as modified hereafter, senior employees on the shift will be given first preference for vacation dates within the
schedule, provided they have indicated their preference to their
department scheduler.
Preference will be indicated in advance, in writing, and separated into two time frames of January 1st to the 2nd Sunday in June, and the 2nd Sunday in June to December 3 1 st.
The following procedure will be utilized:
1.	The minimum allotment allowed will be 15% for vacation, The allotment will be applied on a departmental basis so that the total number of employees absent from the department on vacation at any given time will equal the total allotment and will not be less than two (2) employees per week.
2.	When the departmental allotment is allocated, it will be applied so that there are an equal number of employees who may be off on vacation on each shift, by seniority. The vacation openings that are left to be tilled, will be filled by the senior employee(s) who has/have requested the opening from another shift in the department, except as outlined in (c) i) and ii) below.
3.	In the event that the allotment per shift that results from this process is not filled by the employee(s) on shift it is understood that the vacation opening that then results will be offered to senior employee(s) on other shifts within the department who had already requested vacation for this time, subject to the Company reserving its rights to reassign qualified employees on the basis of seniority to balance the shift equally for its operational needs.
Employees moved off shift to fill such vacancies will not exceed the number of vacation openings granted.
4.	It is understood that there will be no artificial creation of overtime due to the process of shift balancing under item 3 above.
123
5.	In the event that there is a vacation opening that becomes
available after the vacation scheduling process is complete because of the cancellation of scheduled vacation, the senior employee(s) on the shift involved who are on the vacation waiting list will be offered such openings first, then to the other employee(s) by seniority on the waiting list in the department.
6.	As operational needs permit additional openings, the senior
employee(s) on the waiting list will be offered such openings, within the department.
7.	(a) Vacation scheduling for Weekend Workers will be as per
Section 6:12.
(b)	Vacation lists will be posted prior to October 1st for the first time frame, and prior to April 1 st for the second time frame.
Protest of assignment of vacation dates must be made within two weeks following the posting of the lists. Otherwise, allotted dates will be assumed as correct.
(c)	Guidelines for Scheduling
i)	Maintenance by seniority within each primary and
secondary trade. Those trade employee(s) who did not get at least one week between July and August will be afforded one-week vacation on their day shift in July or August.
ii)	Storeskeepers by seniority within their classification.
iii)	Packing by seniority within their classifications and shifts.
iv)	All other departments by seniority and shifts.
(d)	Employees who are not eligible for three or more weeks
vacation will be given preference in selecting their
124
vacations as against the second portion of the vacation of those entitled to three weeks vacation who wish to split such vacation period.
Senior employees who split their vacation but take one portion outside the holiday season (2nd Sunday in June to the year end) will still have preference over junior employees in obtaining one vacation period between the above dates.
Vacation cancellation will only be accepted one week in advance of the posted schedule (Thursday). Unscheduled vacation requests will only be accepted one week in advance of the posted schedule (Thursday). In the event that additional people can be permitted on vacation at any period upon short notice, first consideration will be given to those who did not have sufficient seniority to get a scheduled vacation in either July or August.
Vacation will be completed each calendar year with the exception as outlined in 9:03.
(g)	Employees with more than three weeks vacation must take that excess vacation outside of the prime period (2nd Sunday in June to September 1st), unless there are additional openings after all other employees have scheduled their vacation.

A variety of circumstances will affect which Plan is considered as the “Primary Carrier” (i.e. Responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense), and which Plan is considered as the "Secondary Carrier” (i.e. responsible for making the payment to cover the remaining eligible expense).
If the other Plan does not provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, it will be considered as the Primary Carrier, and will be responsible for making the initial payment toward the eligible expense.
If the other Plan does provide for Co-ordination of Benefits, the following rules are applied to determine which Plan is the Primary Carrier.
170
a)	For claims incurred by you or your Dependent Spouse:
1.	The plan insuring you or your Dependent Spouse as an employee/member pays benefits before the Plan insuring you or your Spouse as a dependent.
2.	In situations where you or your Spouse have coverage as an employee/member under more than one Plan, the order of benefit payment will be determined as follows:
i.	The Plan where the person is covered as an active full-time employee, then
ii.	The Plan where the person is covered as an active part-time employee, then
iii.	The Plan where the person is covered as a retiree.
b)	For Claims incurred by your Dependent Child:
1. The Plan covering the parent whose birthday (month/day) is earlier in the calendar year pays benefits first. If both parents have the same birth date, the Plan covering the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet pays first.
2. However, if you and your Spouse are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
a)	The Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
b)	The Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child (i.e. if the parent with custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse’s Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child), then
c)	The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then,
17)
d)	The Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child (i.e. if the parent without custody of the child remarries or has a common-law spouse, the new spouse’s Plan will pay benefits for the Dependent Child).
3.	A claim for accidental injury to natural teeth will be determined under Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage before it is considered under Dental Plans.
4.	If the order of benefit payment cannot be determined from the above, the benefits payable under each Plan will be in proportion to the amount that would have been payable if Co-ordination of Benefits did not exist.
2)	SUBMITTING A CLAIM FOR CO-ORDINATION OF BENEFITS:
a)To submit a claim when Co-ordination of Benefits applies, refer to the following guidelines:
1.	As per the Order of Benefit Payments section, determine which Plan is the Primary Carrier and which is the Secondary Carrier.
2.	Submit all necessary claim forms and original receipts to the Primary Carrier.
3.	Keep a photocopy of each receipt once your claim has been settled by the Primary Carrier.
4.	Once your claim has been settled by the Primary Carrier, you will receive a statement outlining how your claim has been handled. Submit the statement along with all necessary claim forms to the Secondary Carrier for further consideration or payment, if applicable.
172
N.	EXPENSES NOT COVERED

1)	Self-inflicted injuries or illness while sane or insane.
2)	Any injury or illness for which the insured person is entitled to indemnity or compensation under any workers’ compensation act.

RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN (PENSION)
A.	RETIREMENT INCOME PLANS
The Company retirement plan is based on your service after January 1, 1980. You will also receive any pension benefits you may have earned under the former pension plans such as the Profit Sharing. The Company pays the full cost of the Kellogg Retirement Income Plan.
B.	ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP
Regular full-time employees are automatically included in the retirement plan after completing one year of continuous service.
C.	NORMAL RETIREMENT PENSION
Normal retirement is on the last day of the month immediately following your 65th birthday.
This plan provides a pension income at age 65, based on your credited or length of service in any year as follows:
Hoi KS WORKl-'.l) ClO Dl l ] Il Sl IiVK li
0-349 350 - 749 750- 1,124 1,125 - 1,499 1,500 or more
0	year 1/4 year 1/2 year
3/4 year
1	year
For employees suffering from long term illness (over 30 days), up to 1500 banked hours may be withdrawn over a three year period, in order to supplement credited service for pension purposes.
202
At age 65, your monthly retirement income benefit will be equal to the monthly pension amount in effect for your Pension Group multiplied
by your years of credited service since January 1st, 1980.
Pension Group	April 16, 2000	April 15, 2001	April 14, 2002
Group 1			
Ins. Codes I, II, III	$48.00	$50.00	$52.00
Group 2			
Ins. Codes IV, V	$50.00	$52.00	$54.00
This plan covers only your service with the Company from January lsl, 1980. Your pension is calculated by multiplying your years of service by the appropriate amount shown in the table above, which will equal your monthly amount. Any pension benefits you may have earned from former plans are in addition to the pension from this Retirement Income Plan.
D.	ANNUAL BENEFITS STATEMENT
Your annual benefits statement shows your pension earned to date and estimates your pension for future service based on your current earnings. These levels may change each year and your estimated total pension will change accordingly. The nearer you get to age 65, the more accurate the total estimated pension on your benefits statement will be.
E.	EARLY RETIREMENT
You may retire and receive a pension any time after reaching age 55. Certain subsidies may apply according to your years of service and your age:
203
1.	If age 55 or over and age plus years of service total 85 or more: your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retifemenl pension with no reduction.
2.	Furthermore you receive a Bridge Benefit of $12.00 a month for each year of service to a maximum of $360.00 a month. This Bridge Benefit is paid until age 65 at which time the government pensions begin.
3.	With 20 years of service, but age plus years of service are less than 85, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced. The reduction is 2% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age 62, down to age 60 and then 4% for each year that your early retirement date precedes age 60.
4.	If you do not qualify for any of the subsidies, your pension is calculated in the same way as a normal retirement pension, but is then reduced by 6% for each year by which your early retirement date precedes age 62. There are no adjustments to the calculation after age 62.
F.	PENSION PAYMENT OPTIONS ESPOUSAL
If you have a spouse when you retire, the Pension Benefits Act states that your pension must be paid on a joint and survivor basis with at least 60% of the pension payable to you continuing to your spouse after your death, should your spouse survive you.
The normal pension fund distribution if you take the spousal option is 90/60%. The retiree will collect 90% of his/her pension until death and then their spouse will collect 60% of the pension until death.
204
If you have a spouse but wish to select a form other than the Joint and 60% Survivor form then you and your spouse must sign a Spousal Waiver form.
1.	LIFE ONLY
If you do not have a spouse when you retire, the normal form of pension is “Life Only” which means that payments stop when you die.
3.	GUARANTEED 5, 10 OR 15 YEARS
Under each of these options, the pension is payable for as long as you live. If you should die before the guaranteed period ends, pension payments are continued to your beneficiary for the balance of the guaranteed period.
G.	TERMINATION BENEFITS
If you leave the Company after completing 3 or more years of service you will be entitled to a deferred pension payable at age 65.
You may elect to transfer the commuted present value of the earned pension to a “locked-in” vehicle. Locked-in pension amounts must be used to purchase a life annuity at retirement unless paid as a death benefit prior to retirement.
You will be 100% vested for all earned benefits in this Plan as well as any benefits you may have earned from former plans, after 3 years of service for full-time employees.
You earn one year of service for each year you have worked 1500 hours in a calendar year.
I. IF YOU DIE BEFORE RETIREMENT
1)	If you have less than 2 years of participation in the plan, there is no death benefit. If you should die after completing 2 or
205
more years of participation in the Plan, your beneficiary or estate will receive the value of your pension accrued at date of death.
2)	In addition, any death benefits from previous plans would be payable.
I.	SPECIAL DISABILITY PROVISION
If you become disabled, you may be entitled to receive a disability retirement benefit provided you have at least 10 years of continuous service. This will be based on your accrued pension at the time you become disabled. The Plan will pay a monthly pension as though you had retired at the time you become disabled.
J.	IF YOU DIE DURING RETIREMENT
If you elected at the time of retirement to provide a continuing payment to your spouse or beneficiary in the event of your death and the conditions of that payment are still applicable, payment will be made to them as you directed. If you retired prior to age 65 and were receiving a bridge benefit at the time of your death this payment would not continue to your spouse or beneficiary.
K.	WEEKLY INDEMNITY
Suspension of pension credit accrual except for absences in excess of 30 consecutive days - may draw “banked” hours to a maximum of 1500 hours every three years.
L.	LONG TERM DISABILITY

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
.. FEATURES OF THE PLAN
iKellogg Company is the parent Company and sole shareholder of Kellogg Canada Inc. Its shares are listed on and traded through the New York Stock Exchange. They are bought and sold only in U.S. dollars. The amount of your purchase can range from a minimum of $25 US. per month to a maximum of $25,000 U.S. during any calendar year. For ease of administration when you use the payroll deduction method of payment, deductions are made in Canadian dollars, which will be sufficient, at current and anticipated interest rates, to qualify under the U.S. plan. Shares will be purchased by Harris Bank for employees on the open market. Dividends are
215
reinvested automatically for you in additional whole and fractional shares of Kellogg Company stock.
2)	Participation is free. Kellogg Canada Inc. pays all service charges and brokerage commissions for:
a)	Purchase of shares through payroll deduction, cash purchase of shares, and reinvestment of dividends. (Payment for these fees on your behalf must be reported for income tax purposes.)
b)	However, any interest earned on employee funds for the short period of time between payroll or employee contribution and payment to the Harris Bank will be used to contribute to the payments of these expenses. At the end of each calendar quarter, you will receive from Harris Bank a statement of your account showing the details of the transactions.
c)	Harris Bank will hold for your convenience all shares purchased under the plan and any other Kellogg Company stock you wish to surrender for safekeeping. Custody of those shares by Harris Bank protects them from loss, theft, or inadvertent destruction.
B.	HOW THE PLAN WORKS
1)	You may sign up to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan by completing the payroll deduction form (see your Human Resources office). The following guidelines apply:
a)Minimum payroll deduction is $9.00 (Canadian) per pay period for hourly employees. This amount has been established to equate to the minimum required $25 U.S. under the dividend reinvestment plan to which this stock purchase plan is attached. To allow for fluctuation in exchange rates and the possibility that the U.S. dollar could appreciate against the Canadian dollar, a margin has been provided which should mean that the minimum payroll deduction will not have to be changed. In the unlikely event that the U.S. dollar changes significantly in
216
foreign exchange markets against the Canadian dollar this
. minimum amount may have to be changed.
b)	Maximum contributions are $25,000 U.S. (in total) per year.
c)	A new or changed deduction is effective the first pay period of the following month.
d)	The amount of your payroll deduction can be changed only once every six (6) months.
e)	Payroll deductions for purchase of Kellogg Company stock will not be withheld from vacation or sick pay.
f)	You may cancel your payroll deduction at any time. Any amount that has not been forwarded to Harris Bank will be refunded to you.
2)	Your dividends are conveniently reinvested in additional Kellogg Company stock at the time of each dividend payment. Since dividends are seldom in an amount that will purchase an exact number of full shares, you will be credited with fractional shares computed to three decimal places.
3)	Quarterly statements issued will provide you with the necessary investment and tax information including the amount of dividends reinvested, the number and price per share of shares purchased by investment of dividends and cash, and the total number of full and fractional Kellogg Company stock in your account as of the statement date.
4)	At year-end, Harris Bank will provide you with information on the payment of brokerage charges and bank service charges. Payment of these charges on your behalf must be reported as income for tax purposes.

Benefits are payable from the end of the Qualifying Period. Benefits are not payable for or during the Qualifying Period. The Employee must be receiving regular, ongoing care and treatment from a Physician during the Qualifying Period in order for benefits to be payable at the end of the Qualifying Period. Otherwise, benefits will not be payable until the date the Employee is first treated by his Physician.

Manulife Financial will apply the following criteria in determining an Employee's entitlement to Disability Benefits:
a)	the Employee has been continuously Totally Disabled throughout the Qualifying
Period.
b)	Manulife Financial receives medical evidence documenting how the Employee’s
illness or injury causes restrictions or lack of ability, such that the Employee is prevented from performing the essential duties of his own occupation.

Disability benefit payments will be made weekly in,arrears. Any payment for a period of
less than one week will be made at a daily rate of one-seventh of the Employee's weekly benefit amount.

All such recurrences will be considered a continuation of the same Disability. The benefit payable will be based on the Employee's Earnings as at the original date of Disability. Benefits for all recurrences will not be paid for a combined period longer than the Maximum Benefit Period shown in the Benefit Schedule.
If the same Disability recurs more than one week after the end of the period for which benefits were paid, such Disability will be considered a separate Disability.
Two Disabilities which are due to unrelated causes are considered separate Disabilities if they are separated by a return to work of at least one day.

If an Employee’s insurance terminates for reasons other than retirement, Manulife Financial will continue insurance under this Benefit if the Employee is Totally Disabled and:
a)	entitled to receive benefits; or
b)	fulfilling the Qualifying Period.
The Employee must satisfy Manulife Financial’s Entitlement Criteria in order for the Disability Benefit to be payable.

How C/aims are Co-ordinated
Order of Benefit Payment
56 Payment of Claims
Manulife Financial will co-ordinate its Extended Health Care and Dental Care Benefits payable under this Policy with other Plans which also cover an insured person for similar Benefits.
Plans Co-Ordinated with this Policy
For the purposes of the Co-ordination of Benefits, Plan means:
a)	other group insurance programs;
b)	any other arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis, including any pre-payment coverage, capitation plan, franchise plan or services plan; and
c)	individual travel insurance plans.
Plan does not include school insurance or Provincial Plans
How C/aims are Co-ordinated
Benefits payable under this Policy will be reduced, when necessary, so that no more than 100% of eligible expenses incurred during a calendar year are jointly paid by this Policy and all Plans which come before it in the Order of Benefit Payment.
For the purposes of this provision, eligible expenses are as defined in each Policy or Plan document, before any applicable payment limitations, such as deductible, benefit percentage and maximums, are applied. An expense is eligible only to the extent that it is Reasonable and Customary
Order of Benefit Payment
The Order of Benefit Payment is established by applying the following rules to the various Plans which cover eligible expenses. The rules are applied from first to last until an order is established.
a)	The Plan with no Co-ordination of Benefits provision in the Policy or Plan document is deemed to pay its benefits first (primary carrier).’
b)	If all Plans have a Co-ordination of Benefits provision, the following rules are applied to determine the Order of Benefit Payment. The rules depend on the basis on which the person is covered in the Plan.
i) Employee/Member
The Plan which covers the person as an employee/member is deemed to pay its benefits before a Plan which covers that person as a dependent.
If the person is an employee/member under more than one Plan, the following order applies:
1) the Plan where the person is an active full-time employee, then
Kellogg Canada Inc.
Payment of Claims 57
2) the Plan where the person is an active part-time employee, then
3) the Plan where the person is a retiree. ii) Dependent - Spouse
If a dependent spouse is also covered as an employee/member under another Plan, the Plan which covers the spouse as an employee/member is deemed to pay its benefits before the Plan which covers the spouse as a dependent.
If the spouse is an employee/member under more than one Plan, the order of benefit payment is as outlined under “Employee/Member” above.
iii)	Dependent - Child
If a dependent child is covered under more than one Plan, benefits are deemed to be paid first under the Plan of the parent with the earlier birthdate (month/day) in the calendar year. If both parents have the same birthdate, the Plan of the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet is deemed to pay benefits first.
However, in situations where the parents of the dependent child are separated or divorced, the following order applies:
1)	the Plan of the parent with custody of the child, then
2)	the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child, then
3)	the Plan of the parent not having custody of the child, then
4)	the Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child.
Where divorced or separated parents share joint custody of the dependent child, benefits are deemed to be paid first under the Plan of the parent with the earlier birthdate (month/day) in the calendar year. If both parents have the same birthdate, the Plan of the parent whose first name begins with the earlier letter in the alphabet is deemed to pay benefits first.
c)	For dental accidents, Extended Health Care Plans with accidental dental coverage determine benefits before Dental Plans.
d)	If the Order of Benefit Payment cannot be established by the preceding rules,
benefits will be pro-rated between or among the Plans in proportion to the amounts that would have been paid under each Plan had there been coverage by only that
Plan.
Special Rules Applied

Policy:

considered a separate Plan from the part which does not provide for co-ordination;
c) this Policy is considered to be a Plan in applying the rules which establish an Order of Benefit Payment;
d)	when a Plan provides benefits in the form of service rather than cash payments, the Reasonable and Customary value of the service rendered is deemed to be both an eligible expense and a benefit paid; and
e)	if a person is also covered under an individual travel insurance plan, benefits will be co-ordinated in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association.

However, if the change is not the direct result of a request by the Policyholder, a period of 31 days will be given before the date when such amendment is to take effect. If no objection is made during the 31 day period, the amendment will still take effect on the specified effective date of such change unless the Company agrees in writing before the specified effective date to change or to withdraw such amendment.
