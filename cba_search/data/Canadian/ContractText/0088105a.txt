The parties recognize that the success of the Corporation and the job security of the employees depends upon the Corporation’s success in building a quality product and its ability to sell such product.

The Corporation and the Union, in their respective fields,
(b) Workplace Harassment Policy and Procedure
(i)	Every employee has the right to work in an environment free of discrimination and harassment. This right includes the responsibility to eliminate harassment in our workplace, either as a participant or as an observer.
This policy and procedure outlines the commitment of Chrysler Canada Ltd. to ensure a harassment-freeworkplace as required under the Ontario Human Rights Code and will act as a guide to employees in adhering to legal and social guidelines regarding the recognition and prevention of harassment.
This policy exists to underline the seriousness of workplace harassment and to establish that there is no acceptable level of harassment at Chrysler Canada Ltd. Employees who feel that they are being harassed are encouraged to seek protection under this policy.
(ii)	Workplace Harassment Defined
Harassment is defined as a “course of vexatious comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably be know to be unwelcome”, that. denies individual dignity and respect on the basis of the grounds such as: sex, disability, race, colour, sexual orientation or other prohibited grounds At Chrysler Canada Ltd. all employees are expected to treat others with courtesy and consideration and to discourage harassment.
The workplace is delined as any Company facility and includes areas such as offices, shop floors, restrooms, cafeterias, lockers, conference rooms, and parking lots.
5
Workplace harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:
Unwelcome remarks, jokes, innuendoes or taunting about another's body, attire, sex, disability, racial or ethnic background, isexual orientation, etc., which cause awkwardness or embarrassment.
Displaying visuals of a sexual, racial or otherwise offensive nature such as pornographic pictures, posters, cartoons or simulation of body parts.
Leering (suggestive staring) or other gestures.
Unnecessary physical contact such as touching, patting or pinching.
- Sexual solicitation or advance made with implied reprisals if rejected.
Refusing to work or share facilities with another employee because of the other’s sex, disability, sexual orientation, racial, religious or ethnic background.
Backlash or retaliation for the lodging of a complaint or participation in an investigation.
(iii)	What Harassment Is Not
Properly discharged supervisory responsibilities including disciplinary action, or conduct that does not interfere with a climate of understanding and respect for the dignity and worth of Chrysler Canada Ltd. employees are not considered harassment, Neither is this policy meant to inhibit free speech or interfere with the normal social relations that are a part of life in this organization.
6
(iv)	Filing A Complaint
If an employee believes that the employee has been harassed, that employee should:
-	tell the alleged harasser(s) to stop;
-	document the event(s), complete with the time, date, location, names of witnesses and details For each event.
If the harassment does not stop at this ;point, or if the harassed employee does not feel able to approach the alleged harasser directly, that employee should:
-	immediately report the harassment to the employee’s Union Representative and/or Supervisor, or if this is not appropriate, to the local Equity Representative, Personnel Manager, or designate of the Vice President - Human Resources..
(v)	‘The Investigation
In minor cases, the Union may try to resolve a harassment complaint informally without a full investigation when so requested by the complainant, However, the following procedure will apply to all complaints requiring investigation:
The person receiving the complaint will .advise the local Personnel Manager, or such higher authority as may be appropriate,, who will arrange an interview with the complaint as soon as possible. This interview and the subsequent investigation will be carried out jointly by the Union and the Company. The investigation team, if possible, will be comprised of at least one woman, whenever the complaint is sexual in nature.
7
The investigation will include interviews of the complainant, the alleged harasser(a) and any witnesses. The Union representative of the employeebeing interviewed will be present with Union members during the interview. Interview timing and location will recognize the need to maintain confidentiality.
The investigation team will inform the complainant promptly as to the results of the: investigation and the appropriate actions that have been or will be taken. The complainant will also be encouraged to report any further incidents .
The identity of the complainant, the alleged harasser(s), and the nature of the complaint will be kept confidential and only other persons with a need to know will be informed.
Confidential records of the investigation including interviews, evidence and the outcome of the complaint will be maintained in the office of the Vice President - Human Resources.
(vi)	Resolution Of The Complaint
If a harassment complaint is proven valid, appropriate corrective action, will be taken against the offending employee.
If, after completion of a thorough investigation, a harassment complaint can neither be proved nor disproved in the view of the investigators, the local Personnel Manager, in consultation with the local Plant Chairperson, will attempt to resolve the conflict in a manner that is agreeable to all parties.
If it is determined that the complaint has no validity, and
8
was, in fact, lodged with malicious intent, the initiator of the complaint may be subject to action under the misconduct rules outlined in the Safety and Conduct Guide.
(vii)
Right to Refuse
A bargaining unit employee alleging harassment in the workplace is encouraged to use the above pro<5edure to resolve a complaint. However, it is agreed, in principle, that in serious cases or when the safety of an employee is being threatened, it may be necessary for that employee to \y* leave the job.	^
^ A '*>
Furthermore, the parties agree that details with respect to the procedure regarding the ability of employees to leave their jobs as outlined above will be developed by the Master Employment Equity Committee and will be implemented as a part of this procedure following the Union leadership and Management representative training, to be completed no later than June 30, 1994.
(viii)	‘ The Union and Chrysler Canada Ltd.
will endeavour to resolve all harassment complaints at the local level. However, if the complaint cannot be satisfactorily resolved locally or is of an extremely serious nature, then other steps may be required including the intervention of the National Union and/or Chrysler Canada Ltd. Staff.
This policy and procedure in no way precludes the complainant’s right to seek action under the Ontario Human Rights Code. However, both the Union and Chrysler Canada Ltd, urge employees to use the internal mechanisms as outlined above before seeking alternative recourse.

WORK STANDARDS
(38)	Work Standards
(a) — Establishing Work Standards
1.	When the Corporation establishes work standards, by whatever method it may select, it shall do so on the basis of fairness and equity in that such standards shall be based on the reasonable working capacities of normal experienced employees working at a normal pace to produce quality work in the manner that the Company prescribes.
2.	When a work standard is established and is not disputed, or is disputed and settled, such standard shall remain unchanged and not subject to dispute unless and until the operation is changed as a result of change in method, layout, tools, equipment, materials or product design. When a change
32
is made in a work standard for any of the above reasons, only the elements of the operations that are affected by such change will be adjusted.
‘The Corporation agrees it is desirable to establish work standards on a new operation as early as is feasible. ‘Where a standard is not established, the Steward, upon request, will be given management’s reasons for not establishing the standard.
‘When a standard is not established, an employee, who is following the prescribed method and using the tools provided in the proper manner and performing at a normal pace, will not be disciplined for failure to obtain an expected amount ofproduction.
When imposing discipline for failure to follow a prescribed method or for failure to use the tools provided in a proper manner, an employee will be informed in writing in what respect the employee failed to follow the method or use the tools. Upon request, the Steward will also be given the reason.
3.	When a work study is to be made for the purpose of establishing a standard, advance notice will be given to any normal experienced employee to be studied and to the employee's Steward. When a work standard is established, notice will be given to the employee and to said Steward advising them of the established work standard. When a study is made for purposes other than establishing a standard, the purpose of the study will be made known to a Union representative if so requested.
4.	Circumstances affecting the time of performance of a particular job that were not taken into account in establishing a work standard are known as non-standard conditions. When such non-standard conditions exist and are brought to the attention of management, the employee concerned shall be advised of the rate ofproduction at which said employee will be required to perform the job under such non-standard conditions.
(b) — Relief Time and Other Allowances
33
1.	All employees on a regular eight-hour shift shall have a relief period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate twelve (12) minutes before lunch and twelve (12) minutes after lunch. Such relief periods represent five per cent of the shift time or three (3) minutes per hour. The amount of such relief time shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular ‘eight-hour shift. This: shall not be: deemed to affect the environmental relief allowance now included in the work standard of certain operations nor the allowance applicable to certain other operations as expressly set forth in letters from the Corporation to the Union.
Such relief time, except in emergencies, shall not be provided during the fist hour of the shift or the first hour after the lunch period, or during such other periods, not exceeding in the aggregate two (2) hours per shift, as may be mutually satisfactory in the local plants.
2.	When a time study is made, the employee’s performance will be rated as to normal at the time such study is made. In addition to the regular relief allowance, allowances will be made for such elements as standard tool changes, material handling, and fatigue where these are a factor.
(e) — Special Provisions Regarding Breakdowns, Ratio of Body Types, and Controlling Operations.
1.	An employee will not be required lo make up a loss in production on the employee’s operation solely as a result of
machine or equipment break-or shortage of stock or other @/conditions ifthe condition is beyond the employee’s control, but p- the employee may be directed while the condition exists, to perform other work or, if the condition exists during a period when the employee rnay be required to do so, to take regular relief time.
2,	Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the
34
expected normal ratio of body types, optional equipment or other product types. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled ratio of body types including optional equipment or other product types on conveyor lines and more or less work is required because of the change in mix, compensating adjustments in work assignment, manpower, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. Arrangements will be made locally to establish procedures which will provide advance knowledge of mix changes that require compensating adjustments so that such adjustments will be made in a timely manner. On conveyor line operations, management will designate specific offline operations from which employees will be made available to compensate for such mix changes when one of the compensating adjustments selected is an increase in employees. The compensating adjustments will be made known to the affected employee in the employee’s ordinary work ares in time to accommodate the mix change. Upon request, Management ‘will advise the Union of the arrangements made. If the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee does not equal the available time of the employee’s work station, additional elements of work may be assigned to the employee, not to exceed the available time of the employee’s work station. If work assignments on such lines are changed, the Supervisor will advise the employee what elements have been added to or removed from the operation.
3.	On some press, machine or conveyor lines the operations are limited by the controlling operation on the line with the result that on such lines either the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee is less than the employee’s available time or the rate of production required of an employee is less than standard. In such circumstances the employee will be advised of the standard and available time for the operation whether or not the employee is required to produce to the standard. When the work standard on the controlling operation is adjusted, the other operations that were so limited will be adjusted accordingly within their standards.
35
(d.) — Dispute Procedure
1.	If an employee or group of employees believes that any paragraph or paragraphs of this Work Standards Section has been violated, and the employee (or they) is aggrieved as the result thereof, the employee, or a designated member of the group, may take the matter up with the Supervisor, or ask the Supervisor to send for their Steward. On request the Supervisor will obtain for the Steward in writing an elemental breakdown of the operation in question. Such elemental breakdown shall consist of all the elements of the: operation in the order of their performance with the time for each element and the total time for the operation as these appear on the study or supporting data. On conveyor assembly lines each elemental breakdown will reflect the scheduled rate of production and available time, either by the hour or the day as requested.
The best efforts of the employee, the Supervisor concerned and the Steward shall be directed toward settling the matter. Among other things, it shall be determined that the employee’s work method, the job layout, the tools and equipment are those on which the standard is based. Machine cycle times, feeds and speeds, stock locations and line speed are among other items that should be checked to determine that these are as contemplated in the standard.
By receiving the elemental breakdown and other information regarding an operation, the Union will not thereby waive its right later to dispute the time values of the elements of the operation.
2.	(i) If after the above procedure is followed the matter is not resolved, a written grievance may be filed with the Supervisor, signed by the aggrieved employee or aggrieved employees. The Supervisor shall reply to the grievance within two (2) regular working days.

In this event, the Industrial Engineers shall give their prompt attention to the matter. In the presence of a Local Union representative or representatives they will compare and exchange their studies and computations without undue delay to determine the areas of difference, if any, in order to expedite resolving the grievance. The ‘National Union and the Labour Relations Department will arrange for the participation of the Union’s Industrial Engineer.
The requirements of this procedure for the making available of elemental breakdowns, back-up data, for the taking of a new time study by the Corporation at the request of the Chairperson of the Plant Shop Committee, and for the participation of the Union’s Industrial Engineer shall apply only to grievances alleging that the aggrieved employee cannot perform the work required in the time allowed because the standard was not established in conformity with Section (38) (a) (1) hereof.
4.	Within two (2) regular working days of the special step meeting, higher supervision will give a written answer. If the grievance is not settled at this step, it may within five (5) regular

If the parties cannot agree on the normal experienced operator to be studied, the Special Arbitrator shall make the selection.
8.	In submitting a ruling, the Special Arbitrator shall also submit to both parties copies of all the facts of the study and computations thereto.
9.	If pursuant to the above the Special Arbitrator rules
39
that Paragraph (a) 1, has been violated, the Corporation will be obligated to establish a new standard within two (2) regular working days following receipt of such ruling.

STATEMENT OF POLICY NO. 1 ABLE TO SATISFACTORILY PERFORM
The purpose of this phrase is tied in with seniority to assure the Corporation of a satisfactory performance just as seniority is designed to give an employee an equitable degree of security. The Corporation does feel that a reasonable application of this phrase throughout the Collective Bargaining Agreement would involve careful consideration of the following basic principles:
1.	The complexity and nature of the job.
2.	The experience of the employee on the type of work involved.
3.	The amount of instruction and/or break-in required.
4.	The length of time that the employee would be working at the job involved.
In applying these principles generally, this would mean that the shorter the period of time an employee would be assigned to a particular job (e.g., overtime, short-term layoff) the less time the Corporation could be expected to spend on instruction or break-in even to the extent that present ability could be a requirement. Likewise, the longer period of time (in indefinite layoff or job opportunity situations) the longer time the Corporation could be expected to spend, up to reasonable limits, on instruction and/or bleak-in. Members of supervision in making such decisions should give thorough consideration to theability of the employees.
It would mean that as jobs increase in complexity, etc., the greater the experience on the type of work involved would be required in order to be able to satisfactorily perform.
In its application, particularly in indefinite layoff and job opportunity situations, it would be advantageous to the employee and the Corporation and it would help to eliminate problems if employees would place on record with the Corporation by supplemental application for employment, qualifications which they did not make known at the time of hire or which they have
92
since acquired so that the Corporation would be in at least as good a position to qualify applicants in these situations as it is in assessing the qualification of new hires.

For the purpose of this Section, Leader classifications shall be regarded as being the same as the classification led.
The Corporation, and the National Union may from time to time, agree to amend, delete, add to, or otherwise modify the foregoing List of Classifications.
Where there is a decrease or increase in the skilled trades the applicable procedure set out below shall be followed.
(a)	-- In the event of a seasonal layoff for model change, skilled trades employees shall be laid off, retained or recalled to work on the basis of their seniority in their classification within the department or on the basis of their seniority in their trade group within the department as the case may be, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. During such layoff, classification or trade group seniority within the department shall continue to be the basis upon which employees are laid off, retained or recalled until such time as the layoff has been converted to a plantwide basis. At such time and thereafter skilled trades employees shall be retained in or recalled to the plant in accordance with their seniority in their classification or trade group within the plant, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(b)	-- Temporary Adjustment
In the case of temporary adjustments due to material short-
(6)	Lay-Off - Recall
96
ages, machinery breakdowns, power failure, fire, flood or similar causes, or due to temporary reduction of production in some departments only, layoffs shall take place as follows: for the fist two days including the day of the layoff; the Corporation may reduce the shift within the department according to the seniority of the employees within their classification or trade group on that shift, provided the employees to be retained are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done, or if the Corporation so elects, for the balance of the shift and one day the Corporation may retain the employees on the shift who normally perform the work to be done (the senior employee being given preference in cases where more than one normal operator performs the work). Thereafter the reduction in the working force for each department so affected shall be adjusted and proceed according to the relative seniority of the employees in the department within their classification or trade group provided that the employees to be retained are able and willing to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. Recall to work following such a layoff shall be by department seniority within their classification or trade group provided the employee is able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done. The Corporation shall convert such layoff and recall from a departmental basis to a plant-wide seniority basis within fourteen (14) calendar days (unless otherwise mutually agreed) so that employees are thereafter, retained in or recalled to the plant in accordance with their classification or trade group seniority within the plant, provided however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work: to be done.
(c)	— Temporary Layoffs
When there is a temporary layoff that is a reduction in force; for a definite period of time which is not a temporary adjustment or seasonal layoff for model change, employees within their classification or trade group within the department will be laid off as follows: 1
1. Probationary employees will be laid off,
97
2.	Employees with less than one year of seniority within their classification or trade group will be laid off according to seniority.
3.	Employees with one year or more of seniority within their classification or trade group will be laid off in the inverse or descending order of their seniority with the most senior employee being laid off first. They will be advised of the expected duration of the layoff and their scheduled return date. However, such employees may elect to remain at work and if able to perform the available work will be permitted to do so in the same seniority Order up to the number of employees required. The arrangement described above must result in maintaining an experienced, qualified ‘work force capable of assuring the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the plant.
4.	If the expected duration of the temporary layoff is subsequently extended to a later but definite date, employees laid off pursuant to Subsection (c) 3 above will be afforded the option of returning to work on the date originally scheduled or remaining
M-on layoff for the duration of the extended period. An employee y who elects to return on the original scheduled date will displace jfj the junior employee within their classification or tradegroup in the department.
5.	(i) If it becomes necessary to recall employees laid off under Subsection (c) 3 above prior to the date originally planned, they will be recalled in the ascending order of their seniority within their classification or trade group with the most junior such employee in each department being recalled first.
(ii) If, after employees are temporarily laid off under Subsection (c) 3, it is determined in a department or group of departments that the temporary layoff will be extended for an indefinite period of time, the work force in the department or group of departments including those employees on temporary layoff will be adjusted within ten (10) working days in accordance with (d) below.
98
6.	If the duration of a temporary layoff is expected to exceed ten (10) working days, the Local Union will be so notified. In a temporary layoff of such expected duration, the Local Union may request the Management to waive the Temporary Layoff provisions set forth in this Section (c) and Management will reduce the working force according to the layoff provisions as set forth in Section (d) below. Such requests shall be made in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the Union is notified of the layoff.
7.	The inverse seniority provisions as set forth in Section (6) (c) Temporary Layoffs, shall apply to employees on skilled trades classifications. For purposes of clarification, classification shall be deemed to mean skilled trades classification.
8.	It is understood that past practices with respect to Section 6 (a), (b) and (c) of the above provisions shall remain unchanged at the Etobicoke Casting Plant.
(d)	-- Plant Layoff or Departmental Reduction due to Permanent Discontinuance of Operations, etc. and Recall.
In the event of a layoff or a departmental reduction due to the permanent discontinuance of a specific operation or department or due to an indefinite reduction in production or work to be performed, skilled trades employees shall be retained or recalled to work on the basis of their seniority in their classification within the plant or on the basis of their seniority in the trade group within the plant as the case may be, provided, however, they are able to satisfactorily perform the work to be done.
(7) List of Apprenticeable Classifications
Appendix I, which includes a list of the current approved Apprenticeable Skilled ‘Trades and Schedules of Work Processes for certain of these classifications, has been agreed upon and signed by the parties hereto.

A Journeyman/woman shall not exercise seniority in a nonskilled classification.
A laid-off Journeyman/woman may be hired as a new employee on an open job in a non-skilled classification. When recalled to employment in the skilled trades, the Journeyman/woman shall return and the seniority acquired as a non-skilled employee shall terminate.
(d)	-- An employee in a Production classification may file in the Employment Department a single application for work in a skilled trades classification or trade group. To be considered, the application must be accompanied by proof that the employee is a journeyman/woman with experience in the work of the kind performed at Chrysler in the employee’s classification. When a vacancy occurs in a skilled trades classification or trade group in a plant other than the employee’s own, which is to be filed by a new hire, consideration will be given to such applications. The vacancy created in Production by the transfer of an employee pursuant to the provisions of this application procedure shall be
100
filled in accordance with the job posting paragraphs of the appropriate Plant Special Provisions. On the written request ofthe Union, but not more often than two (2) times in a calendar year, notices will be posted in the plant to advise qualified employees that they may submit such application in writing.
(e)	— Seniority of a Qualified Journeyman/woman Entering a Skilled Trades Classification
Consistent with the intent of the Agreement, a non-skilled trades employee covered by this agreement who is a qualified journeyman/woman, and who enters a skilled trades classification, shall have seniority as of the date of entry into such skilled trades classification.

(f)	— In the event that a qualified journeyman/woman having seniority in a production classification accepts work in a skilled trades classification or trade group and within ninety (90) days thereafter is laid off or disqualified by reason of inability to perform the work in said classification, the employee shall be returned to production with the seniority date the employee had immediately prior to transfer into the skilled trades classification or trade group.
(g)	— Replacement of Tools
The Company shall, where reasonably practical, continueits past practice regarding the replacement of worn, stolen, broken and lost tools provided the employee’s carelessness or abuse has not caused the problem.
The Company agrees to use its best endeavours to speed up the replacement of tools under this sub-section.
(h)	— Testing of Welders
The Corporation will arrange testing of high-pressure welders consistent with governmental regulation.
101
(i)	-- Foul Weather Gear
The Company agrees that it will make available where required foul weather gear for those employees required to perform their duties in winter or inclement weather.
(j)	— Canadian Skilled Trades Council Dues
The Corporation will deduct from the pay of an employee hired, rehired, reinstated or transferred to a skilled trades classification the sum of an amount equal to one-half (1/2) hours pay as dues for the Canadian Skilled Trades Council. Such deductions will be made from the same pay period as the deduction of the Union initiation fee, and thereafter, on an annual basis, from the second pay period in January. Further, from a list supplied by the Union, dues will be deducted from the pay of employees who were not deducted in January and be remitted to the appropriate Local Union together with a list of the employees so deducted in conjunction with regular membership dues.
The Union shall Indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation against any and all liability which may arise by reason of the check-off by the Corporation of the Canadian Skilled Trades Council dues in accordance with this Agreement.
(k)	— Apprentices

(m)	— Painting of Floor Lines
Skilled Trades painters will, upon ratification of the Agreement, be assigned to paint floor lines as required.
102
(n)	— Purchase of New Equipment
During the course of the 1990 negotiations the parties discussed the propriety of purchasing new equipment at the Corporation’s plants. Management advised that when necessary, obsolete equipment will be replaced and new equipment will be purchased, both on a progressive basis.
(o)	— In-Plant Training
In response to your inquiry, Chrysler Canada Ltd. conducts training in electronics, hydraulics, mathematics, etc., from time to time in plants where there is an apparent need to perform work for which the employees' past, experience and training in their trades has been inadequate. Chrysler is cognizant of the continuing need for such training arising from the introduction of new tools:, equipment, procedures and processes and plans to continue to conduct training to an increasing extent to meet such needs.
(p) — Training Bonus Temporary Layoff
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (19), Related Training of the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Apprentices with respect to afftscted employees while on temporary layoff, it is agreed that effective October 29, 1979 a temporarily laid off apprentice, journeyman/woman or temporary employee in the skilled trades will be paid a training bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses required pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees, or such other courses that may be designated by the Corporation such as the Industrial Electronics Training Program, for each week the employee attends class while on temporary layoff as specified below.
An employee earns the training bonus by attending the specified training courses while on temporary layoff and
103
satisfactorily completing the applicable training courses in which the: employee was enrolled at the time of temporary layoff.
The amount of each week’s bonus is calculated by multiplying the employee’s straight-time hourly rate on the last day worked exclusive of shift and overtime premiums but including cost-of-living allowance then in effect by:
(1)	The number of hours, not to exceed four (4), the employee attends class during a week for which an employee receives a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit; or
(2)	The actual number of hours the employee attends class during a week for which an employee does not receive a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit.
The total training bonus will be an amount equal to the sum of the training bonus for each week the employee may earn it. It will be paid to the employee within a reasonable period of time after the employee has been. recalled and reported back to work or within a reasonable period of time after the employee has satisfactorily completed theapplicabletraining courses, whichever is later.
Section (19) of the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Apprentices will continue to be applied as in the past with respect to affected employees while on the active roll.
(q) — Metric Tools
During negotiations of the Collective Bargaining Agreement dated today, the parties discussed the subject of conversion to the metric system and its effect on certain employee owned tools.
During these discussions the Corporation indicated its intention to make available during the transition period necessary metric tools and calibrated measuring instruments to skilled trades
104
employees when required in the performance of their work. Such tools will be available in the tool cribs and charged out to skilled trades employees when they have need for them.
This policy does not preclude the use of conversion tables or any other alternate means of changing to the metric system in place of utilizing such tools or calibrated measuring instruments, nor does it alter the present requirement that skilled trades employees provide their own tools necessary to perform their duties, except as provided in the second paragraph hereof.
(r)	— Training New Technology, Methods or Processes
In addition to the familiarization normally provided when they are assigned different types of work, skilled trades employees will be provided the necessary training due to the introduction of new technology, methods or processes, as it affects their classifications.
(s)	- Annual Fee for Special Licenses
The Company will pay, upon satisfactory proof, the annual fee for special licenses required by the Company which are over and above the basic trade licenses required.
(9)	Slkilled Trades Representatives
(a)	-On any shift in a plant where there are fifteen (15) or more employees in skilled trades classifications and there is no skilled trades Steward, the Local Union may designate in writing a skilled trades employee from among those working on that shift as the Skilled Trades Representative (as distinguished from a Steward) for such employees.
(b)	— The function of the Skilled Trades Representative shall be limited to dealing with such matters as may arise on the Skilled Trades Representative’s shift alleging violation of the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees and letters relating thereto.
105
(c)	— Except as provided in this section the Skilled Trades Representative shall not be treated as a Steward for any purpose under any Section of the Production and Maintenance Agreement.
(10)	Temporary Employees in Skilled Trades Classifications
(a)	— The parties recognize that it is more desirable to secure journeymen/women by hiring and by training through established apprentice training programs, and while these sources are thepreferred means of securing qualified journeymen/women, they do not at all times meet the needs of the Corporation. Until such time as the preferred sources meet the Corporation’s needs, it will be necessary to transfer and promote employees into skied trades classifications who do not, at the time of transfer or promotion, have the experience and qualifications of a joumeyman/woman but have worked in an appropriate skiUed trade.
(b)	— Temporary employees shall be listed by classification in the order of their transfer or promotion into the department on a list of temporary skilled trades employees and shall be laid off, or returned to their regular departments, and returned or recalled to their skilled trades classification in the departments according to their position on the: list of temporary employees. At such time as it is determined that a temporary employee is unable to perform satisfactorily the work required in the skilled trade classification, the temporary employee shall be so advised and the temporary employee’s name shall be removed from the list of temporary employees. While in the status of a temporary employee, the employee shall retain and accumulate seniority in the employee’s regular department. Temporary employees shall not be retained or recalled in line with their position on the list of temporary employees if they are unable to perform satisfactorily the work. that is available.
<e) — A temporary employee in the skilled trades transferred or promoted after the effective date of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the following provisions. The
106
employee shall be paid a starting rate equal to nine percent (9%) less than the minimum rate of the classification and shalt receive an in-crease equal to one and one half percent(l-l/2%)of the minimum rate of the classification on the completion of six
(6),twelve (12),eighteen (18),twenty-four (24) and thirty (30) months served in the classification. Upon the completion of thirty-six (36)months served in the classification, the employee shall be paid the mini-mum rate of the classification. These increases shall be effective the beginning of the first pay period following the completion ‘of each of the specified six (6) month periods served in the classification. Temporary employees shalt not receive a rate above the mid-point of the rate range of their classifications.
(d)	— In the event the Company is unable to fill vacancies from either within the plant or by hiring, the matter may be reviewed with the Union.
(e)	— During model change or major plant rearrangement, production employees may be temporarily assigned to assist skilled trades employees. Such production employees will not be listed as temporary employees in the skilled trades department and will not be credited with skilled trades seniority for any purpose. Rather, they shall retain and accumulate seniority in their production department. If such a production employee is later promoted or transferred to the same skilled trades classification which the production employee was temporarily assigned to assist the production employee shah. receive credit for the time worked white so assigned for the purpose of acquiring the right to exercise seniority in that skilled trades classification.
(11)	Outside Contractors
(a)	- It is the policy of the Corporation to fully utilize its own employees in maintenance skilled trades classifications in the performance of maintenance and construction work, as set forth in the: Agreement.
In all cases, except where time and circumstances prevent it, the Corporation will notify the Union in writing prior to letting a contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work in order to afford the Union an opportunity to hold advance
107
discussion of the matter before the contract is let. In this discussion, the Corporation is expected to review its plans or prospects for letting a particular contract. The ‘Union should be advised of the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be Performed and the reasons (equipment, employment level, etc.) why the Corporation is contemplating contracting out the work. At such times, the Corporation ix expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Corporation's plans and to give weight to those comments in the Light of all attendant circumstances.
(b)	-- Discussion of Outside Contract
When discussions are held, in accordance with the provisions of Section (II) (a) Supplemental Agreement Skilled Trades and Section (12) Supplemental Agreement Skilled Trades, the Supervisor of Plant Engineering may be accompanied by the Superintendent of Maintenance or other personnel familiar with the work involved.
(c)	-- Notice of Outside Contract
The following memo wilt be distributed to all Plant Engineering personnel issuing notices of outside contracting work:
“During our recent negotiations there were lengthy discussions in the quality and detail disclosed on the notice of outside contracting form.
To resolve the matter we agreed to advise the responsible areas in the plants, of these complaints and suggest that more definite information be included so that the Union Representatives would be able to identify the work to be Performed. The above would be beneficial to both parties as some meetings presently requested could be avoided because the additional information would meet the Union's needs.”
The Company will reissue the Letter contained in this Section (ll)(c) within two weeks of the date of ratification.
(d)	-- Service Contracts and Warranty Arrangements
108
Advance written notification for the letting of skilled trades service contracts, and vendor warranty arrangements will be given to the Union.
The parties will meet periodically to discuss such service contracts and warranty arrangements.
(e)	— Use of Outside Contractors While Employees are
on Layoff
During recent negotiations the Union expressed concern regarding the use: of contractors while Skilled Trades Employees are on layoff.
As indicated in those sections of the Production Maintenance Agreement dealing with the subject of outside contracting, the Corporation will endeavour to maximize work opportunities for its Skilled Trades Employees.
Discussions on contracting, prior to any layoff or contemplated layoffs, will give lull consideration to maintaining future work in house.
(12]| Maintenance Contracting
This Section is intended to clarify the intent of Section (11) (a) of the Supplemental Agreement pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees.
(a)	It is the policy of Chrysler Canada Ltd. to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the employees, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This Section is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
(b)	The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no
109
plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
(c)	The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of Chrysler personnel in mind.
(d)	In applying the provisions of Section (11) of the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees it is our intention that, except where time and circumstances prevent it, any “advance discussion” held in accordance with those provisions take place before any final decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out.
(e)	In those cases when the work to be performed is not started by the contractor within ninety (90) days following the approximate starting date given to the Union pursuant to Section (11) (a), and the Union believes the circumstances in the plant have changed sufficiently to warrant review of the initial decision to let the contract, the Union, upon request, will be given an opportunity to comment on the changed circumstances. To the extent practicable, the Corporation will give weight to such comments.
It is important that the Corporation advise the Union of any or all of the factors mentioned in the above provisions which it will take into consideration in determining whether a particular contract should be let out or not. Such advice will be given in the course of the ' ‘advance discussion” so that the Union will be given a better opportunity to make its comments and the Corporation will also be given an opportunity “to give weight to those comments in the tight of all attendant circumstances.”
110
(13)	Consideration and Advance Discussions
When a stamping or assembly plant is contemplating a decision to let to an outside source die or major jig and fixture work., the Plant Management will hold advance discussions with the Local Union concerning the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and, based upon the considerations set forth in Section (14) Supplemental Agreement -- Skilled Trades, as well as the magnitude of the construction program, the timing of each phase of the program, theavailability of facilities, specialized equipment and necessary skills; within the work force, the complicating effect of design modifications and bottleneck operations such as machining limitations and the unavailability of presses to perform necessary tryout work, the efficiencies and economics involved, and the need to maintain a reliable supply base in view of the fluctuations and uncertainties of the die, jig and fixture construction business, will review with the Union why the decision to let the work is contemplated. The Plant Management will take into consideration and afford due weight to any relevant information furnished by the Union before making its final decision.
A Plant Management decision to utilize an outside source for such work should consider, in addition to all the above relevant considerations, any adverse employment impact on the plant’s journeymen/women in the affected skilled trades classifications who are laid off or would be laid off as a direct result of the decision. In making a final decision, the Corporation will not act arbitrarily or capriciously in disregard of the legitimate interests of Chrysler employees.
(14)	Tool and Die Contracting
You have discussed with us at grieat length the possible effect on our skilled tool and die and model employees of decisions of the Corporation to buy some of its tools, dies, and models, rather than make them.
As we have pointed out to you in current negotiations, there
111
are many and varied factors that may influence any particular decision to make or buy. We do not believe it is feasible to list general criteria. However, the: Union has stated in our discussions that it recognizes a number of them, such as the need, among other things, to contract work that requires specialized tools and equipment and special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model changes and rearrangement deadlines.
In view of the foregoing, we have: advised you that the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right. and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies, and models, or to buy them. However, we wish to make it clear to you that it is our policy, in making such decisions, to give proper consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economics involved and all other relevant considerations, including the effect of the decisions on work opportunities of tool, die and model employees.
Where the Corporation considers that work practices or provisions of local agreements in its Tool, Die and Model Departments may be: having an adverse effect on the Corporation’s ability to compete in-this field effectively, it will discuss such matters on a timely basis with the Local Union and explore with it fully the possibilities of taking practical steps with respect to such matters to the end of improving the employment opportunities of such employees. The Skilled Trades Representative of the Corporation is also willing to meet from timeto-time with the Skilled Trades Representative of the National Union to discuss, and provide information relative to plans: the Corporation is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool and die contracting on a corporatewide basis. A representative of an affected plant is willing to meet from time-to-time with the Skilled Trades Committeeperson at the plant to discuss, and provide information relative to plans the plant is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool and die contracting by the plant.
112
(15)	Tool and Die Contracting in (General Manufacturing Division and Engine and Casting Division Plants
In our negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated December 1 1, 1982 we discussed in great detail tool and die contracting by the Corporation, some aspects of which are the subject of Section (14) Supplemental
Agreement------Skilled Trades, Tool and Die Contracting. In the
course of these discussions we reiterated that the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies, models, jigs or fixtures or to buy them,
We assure you, however, that when Journeymen/women skilled trades employees in the toolmaking trades, including machine repair where applicable, of a plant of the General Manufacturing and Engine and Casting Divisions are on layoff for any reason or become laid off as a result of the plant’s contracting out work involving the fabrication, maintenance or repair of tools and dies, and of the kind normally performed by such skilled trades employees in the plant, the Skilled Trades Representative of the Corporation, on request, will meet with the Skilled Trades Representative of the ‘National Union to discuss, and provide information relative to, plans the Corporation is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning such contracting. A good faith effort will be extended by the parties to find solution to the problems discussed in these meetings.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SPECIAL CONTINGENCY FUND
ENTERED into this 15th day of September, 1993
BETWEEN:
Chrysler Canada Ltd., referred to hereinafter as “Corporation”
AND
CAW Canada and its Locals No. 444, 1090, 1459 and 1285
(Bramalea), said CAW Canada and said Local Unions being
referred to jointly hereinafter as “Union”.
The Company and Union agree that:
1.	The Sjtecial Contingency (SC) Fund will be continued during the term of the 1993 Collective Agreement,
2.	Such SC Fund will equal. an accrual by the Company of $1.00 per overtime hour worked by all covered employees in excess of five percent (5%) of straight time hours worked by such covered employees for all pay periods commencing prior to October 1, 1993 and $2.00 per overtime hour worked by all covered employees in excess of five percent (5%) of straight time hours worked for all pay periods commencing alter October 1, 1993.
3.	During the term of the 1993 Collective Agreement, the SC Fund will be utilized only in support of the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) Plan, the Legal Services Plan and to finance the negotiated Child Care Programs, and then only if needed. At any point in time the Special Contingency Fund Balance shall be equal to the cumulative accrual calculated :in Section 2 above, less the cumulative utilization calculated in this Section 3. The cumulative accrual and utilization sha ll includebalances carried forward
1.51
from prior Agreements.
4.	The use of the SC Fund would be determined solely by the amount of the Credit Unit Cancellation Base (CUCB) as determined from time to time under the SUB Plan for the purpose of determining the cancellation rate of Credit Units on the payment of Regular Benefits under the SUB Plan.

For example, it would be appropriate for the Health and Safety Representative to be offered the opportunity to be at work during the plant rearrangements involving new equipment installations. Similarly, it would be appropriate for the Benefits Representative to be at work during the periods of temporary layoffs or indefinite layoffs involving a significant number of employees to permit him/her to work with plant administrators to ensure the expeditious processing of benefit-related matters, and similarly, it would be appropriate for the Employee Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative to be at work to attend to employee assistance and substance abuse problems.
In response the Company has agreed that where the overtime is required to meet the responsibilities and duties of the full time Benefits Representative, full time Substance Abuse Representative, or full time Health & Safety Representative such Representatives may be retained at work provided they have the prior approval of the Personnel Manager.
206
Where the respective Representative believes that there is no reasonable justification for the Personnel Manager withholding prior approval, the matter may be referred to Staff Labour Relations and the: CAW National Office.
(56) Payment of Union Repreiientatives During Local Negotiations
During the course ofcurrent negotiations, the Corporation and the ‘Union had discussions concerning the payment of Union Representatives during Local Negotiations.
This letter is intended to clarify the understandings agreed to during the course of negotiations, pertaining to the payment of such Representatives during such negotiations.
The parties agreed that the following principles would be applicable to the payment of Union Representatives only during the negotiations of the Local Negotiations and would not be used as grounds or basis for claiming that such principles should be extended to other negotiations.
1,	Plant Chairpersons of the Plant Shop Committees would be paid for time spent during Local Negotiations meetings and time spent in Union caucus relevant to such negotiations.
In the event such time would involve overtime hours, and the Plant Shop Chairperson would otherwise be entitled to overtime if said Plant Chairperson had been in the plant, the Corporation agrees to pay overtime up to this entitlement as long as the Plant Chairperson continued in such meetings or caucus.
In the event overtime became available in the plant and the Plant Chairperson was not involved in such meetings and caucus, the Plant Chairperson would be paid for such overtime only for time spent in the plant to the extent of this overtime entitlement.
The Skilled Trades Chairperson would be treated the same as 207
a Plant Chairperson.
2.	The Corporation agreed that alternate Representatives would be recognized only to the extent that additional cost relative to the representation in a given jurisdiction was not incurred. For purposes of example, the Plant Shop Chairperson’s alternate and the Committeeperson’s alternate would be allowed to function whereas the alternate steward would not DS recognized.
3.	The Corporation agreed that Union Representatives on the Local Negotiation Bargaining Committees would not be required to punch their time cards in their respective plants.
The Corporation further agreed that suitable arrangements would be made to administer the recording of hours and payment for such Representatives during the course of Local Negotiations.
4.	The Union agreed that the continuation of such arrangements was contingent upon the mutual satisfaction of the parties and that upon notice to the Union that such procedure had been abused, the Corporation could dissociate itself from such arrangements.
(57)	Grievance Procedure
Both parties to the Production and Maintenance Agreement signed today acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt and fair resolution of employee grievances. The parties also acknowledge the importance of the requirements set forth in Sections (34) Notice of Suspension, Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge and (35) Union Representation. Theattached flow chart illustrates the proper sequence of procedural steps to be used in processing employee grievances.
The Corporation assures the Union that it is interested in seeing that all grievances receive prompt and objective consideration on their merits. The Union assures the Corporation that it will make a sincere and determined effort to keep the
208
procedure free of unmeritorious grievances.
Also, during our recent contract negotiations the Corporation pointed out that Special Conferences, as provided for in Section (15)(b), are in some instances being used to circumvent The Grievance Procedure. Such action hinders the expeditious handling of grievances. The patties agree Section (15)(b) was not intended to provide the means for circumvention and abuse of the Grievance Procedure and will put forth their best efforts to eliminate any such abuse.
To further assist in expediting the handling of a grievance, it is understood if a grievance has not been resolved in Step 2 or Step 3 of the grievance procedure within forty-five (45) days after its appeal from the previous Step, unless held over by mutual agreement between the parties for further discussion, the representative of Management at that Step may answer the grievance in writing without a meeting,
The parties also discussed problems created as a result of the submission of written grievances containing insufficient information. It is agreed that each grievance submitted in writing shall set forth in reasonable detail the date and nature of the grievance, identity of the employee or employees involved by name, seniority date, classification or location, insofar as diligent effort will allow, and the provisions of the applicable agreement, if any, that the: Union claims the Corporation has violated. Management’s answers will set forth facts taken into account in answering the grievance.

(58)	Reinstated Grievances
During negotiations of the Production and Maintenance Agreement, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the National Union (CAW-Canada), by either its (i) Executive Board, (ii) Public Review Board or (iii) Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the National Union may inform the Manager Staff Labour Relations in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for arty claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising Ollt of the grievance that either (i) are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or (ii) that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Corporation in the grievance procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, provincial, or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Impartial Chaiiperson of the Appeal Board or any other arbitrator on any
211
grievance: shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the patties under the terms of the aforementioned Agreement except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any Appeal Board decisions or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter agreement and the Corporation's obligations to reinstate grievances as providisd herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
(59)	Time Limit on Claims
In the past .there have been limited situations in which the Corporation and the National Union have mutually agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section (25), Time Limit on Claims, equity and fairness dictated that the time limits be waived regarding (a) claims by an employee or by the Union, including claims for back wages, and (b) deductions from an ‘employee’s wages to recover overpayments.
This letter will confirm that in such instances of mutual agreement between the Staff Labour Relations Department and the National Union, the limitations set forth in Section (25) may continue to be waived in order to provide equitable and fair resolution. of such matters.
212
(60) Grievance Disciplinary Action
In response to your demand made during the current negotiations, we have agreed that during discussions as early as Step 2 of the grievance procedure of grievances over discipline, discharge and other terminations from employment, each party will present a statement of position reciting facts then known on which it relies, and a copy of a document or statement on which the party relies to support its position.
In the case of a document covering, or statement by, an employee who is not the grievant, the patty relying on it may excise, block out, or otherwise remove, information on it that is not relevant or that would disclose the identity of the person who made the statement or concerning whom the document refers.
In cases where a prior disciplinary record is involved, the Corporation may present a written summary of the grievant’s disciplinary record.
The statement of position and other statements and documents that a patty has provided the other shall become part of the grievance file and may be referred to in subsequent steps of the grievance procedure, including the Appeal Board.
The failure or refusal of the Union to present a full oral explanation of its position shall relieve the Corporation from presenting any statement or document on which it relies. The failure or refusal of a party to make available to the other a copy of a document or statement which it has in its possession and on which the party relies shall preclude the party from using it before the Appeal Board.
The Corporation expressed its concern that its providing to Local Union representatives involved in processing grievances copies of employee statements and corporate documents relating to employees may lead to abuses unless the statements and documents (i) are used solely in connection with the proper processing ofa grievance, (ii) are otherwise kept confidential, and
213
(iii) are not in any way used by any member of the bargaining unit to attempt to harass or intimidate an employee giving a statement or providing a document. The Union assured the Corporation that it will instruct its Local and National Representatives of these restrictions on the use of such material and the need to maintain confidentiality. The Union further represents that if a copy of a statement or document provided it in accordance with this Letter Agreement is used by its representatives or those under their control for any purpose other than the proper processing of a grievance or is publicized outside of the grievance procedure, the Corporation would be relieved of any obligation under this Letter Agreement at the plant where the abuse occurred.
(61) Application of Section (34)
This is to confirm our understanding concerning the application of Section (34) Notice of Suspension, Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge of the 1993 Production and Maintenance Agreement as it relates to employees who are terminated for inability to perform assigned work.
When an employee, including a probationary employee, is terminated for inability to perform assigned work, plant management will provide written notice pursuant to Section (34).
(62) Discipline on Afternoon and Midnight Shifts
During these negotiations the Union raised the issue of the disciplinary procedure as applied to the afternoon and midnight shifts in certain plants.
Any such problems may be brought to the Plant Personnel Manager for discussion.
214
(63) Discipline On Standards
In Appeal Board Case No. 1664 the Impartial Chairman said that “the mere presence of proof of failure to meet a rate of production requires the Chairman to approve the propriety of discipline unless, by some means other than a showing of noncompliance with Sections (46)-(48) (now Section (44)) it is established that the fault did not lie with the employer,.” Nevertheless, the undersigned agree that the provisions of Section (44) (c) of the National Production and Maintenance Agreement dated November 2, 1961, give the Appeal Board power and authority to determine the propriety of the penalty imposed by management in disciplinary discharges and layoffs for violation of Section (59), Work Standards, of said Agreement, and that the mere presence of proof of an employee’s failure to meet a disputed work standard does not require the Appeal Board or the Chairman to approve the propriety of the discipline assessed to an employee.
The disposition of any such case shall be on the merits but shall not involve the propriety of any disputed work standard or work load assignment performed by the glievant or grievants.
In any such determination, the Appeal Board will take into consideration any relevant facts occurring prior and subsequent to the time the: penalty in question was imposed.
This letter shall not be construed to limit or otherwise impair any right Section (2) reserves to the Corporation, including the right to establish and maintain work standards or rates of production and to discipline employees.
(64)	Work Standards
In making employee assignments in its plants, management makes a sincere effort to assign work to employees in such a manner that they may perform it in the time and space required by using the prescribed method, tools and materials and by
215
working at a normal pace.
It is recognized, however, that disputes may arise regarding such assignments, Section (38) of the Agreement provides an orderly method of resolving such disputes. In implementing the provisions of Section (38) in its plants, the following points confirm the understandings reached in our recent meetings on the subject:
1.	The Local Union Time Study Representative may attend meetings to discuss disputed work assignments, in the Windsor area only.
2.	Providing the number of requests is not unreasonable, Elemental Breakdowns will be promptly furnished theUnion upon request. It is understood that if it is necessary to time study an operation prior to furnishing the Elemental Breakdown, a slight delay may result.
3.	When an Elemental Breakdown has been requested, employees on the disputed operation, if a work standard has not been established, will not be disciplined in connection with the dispute until the Union has been furnished the Elemental Breakdown. Once a standard has been established and the Union has been furnished the Elemental Breakdown, employees may be disciplined for failure to obtain the standard notwithstanding the fact the standard may be in dispute.
It is agreed that the foregoing understandings are made in a good faith effort by the parties to resolve employee assignment disputes on a timely and equitable basis. If experience indicates that this end is not being served, the understandings may be terminated by either party upon two (2) weeks notice.
(65)	Work Allocation ■■ Assembly Operations
During the 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the subject of work allocations in the Windsor Assembly, Pillette Road Truck Assembly and Bramalea Assembly Plants.
216
The Company emphasized the numerous factors that influence its ability to make unchangeable work allocations early in the model run in its vehicle assembly plants, among which include the overmanning that sometimes occurs early in the model, in connection with launching and the normal difficulties ausocialed with the production of new models, the engineering changes which occur throughout the model run, the frequent variations in body mix and option scheduling rates, the continual changes in processing and tooling, and the persistent efforts which the Company makes to achieve a satisfactory level; of manpower efficiency and workload balance.
The Company also appreciates the interest which employees in vehicle assembly plants have in securing a reasonably certain level of work assignment at some point in time in the model run. Bearing this in mind, the factors noted above are particularly critical in assembly plants in the model years in which there is a new or major change to the car or truck lines, and somewhat less critical where the vehicle lines receive minor changes. In either case, these changes are not unimportant.
In addition, the Company expressed its objective to be fully competitive in the industry and marketplace, and its coinciding inclination to approach this matter cautiously.
As such, the Company assured, in the 1993 negotiations, that by the end of four months, exclusive of the plant vacation shutdown period, after the first new model vehicle reaches the end of the Final Assembly line, suitable employee work allocations will have been made and will remain unchanged for the balance of that year’s model run, excepting if a change in work allocation is occasioned by changes in line speed, schedule mix, option installation rates, tooling, processing, engineering or design specifications, methods or layouts. This arrangement applies only in those circumstances where minor changes are made to the respective models at either the Windsor Assembly, or the Pillette Road Truck Assembly or Bramulea Assembly Plants. Where major changes are contemplated in any one or all of its models at these assembly plants, extensions to the four-month
217
time period may be necessary to accomplish its work allocation objective!!, at which time the matter will be explained to the respective in-plant CAW Committee. Implementation of this arrangement at the Bramalca Assembly Plant will be effective with 1996 model year production and apply to direct labour operations only.
This arrangement does not constitute any kind of acknowledgement that the workload or work allocation as of the time it becomes unchanged will represent a full workload, nor does it include any assurance or implication that the work allocation in the: succeeding model year will remain unchanged regardless of the degree of vehicle change.
(66)	Student Hires - Seniority
The Corporation agrees that student hires will not be required to serve a double probationary period. Accumulation of seniority will be as provided under the Section dealing with being placed on the seniority lists after ninety (90) calendar days intermittent employment within any period of twelve (12) consecutive months.
(67)	Hiring Practice
In hiring new production and maintenance employees it will be our practice to give serious consideration to the employment applications of qualified persons who have lost their seniority by reason of layoffs at plants of the Corporation.
(68) Preferential Hires
During the recently concluded negotiations, the Union expressed great concern regarding seniority employees who are indefinitely laid off as a result of a permanent discontinuance of operations or other reduction in force without reasonable likelihood of recall.
218
The Corporation stated it shared the Union’s concern and advised the Union that during the term of the Agreement such employees may apply for preferential hiring opportunities at other Company plants covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement during the term of the new agreement.
Seniority employees who wish to apply shall file application for placement within six (6) months of layoff at their local Employment Office. Exceptions will be reviewed by the Manager, Labour Relations and Safety upon request of the National Union.
Such employees shall be given preference for placement in seniority order, available work Permitting, or if none is available, the opportunity to displace probationary ‘employees on jobs for which they are qualified in other plants covered by the P&M Agreement
Any employee hired pursuant to this provision shall enter the new plant with date of entry seniority and shall not while so employed be subject to recall to the plant from which said employee was laid off. When permanently laid off from such new plant the employee shall elect to (a) retain seniority in the new plant, or (b) return to the former plant with full accumulated seniority, in which case the employee’s seniority at all other plants shall terminate. Any employee who upon layoff fails or refuses to make the election set forth above shall be deemed to have elected to retain seniority in the plant from which the employee was last laid off.
An employee accepting work under the provisions of this letter shall retain rights accrued for purposes of holiday pay, payment in lieu of vacation, pensions, insurance, and the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
It is understood that the separation of an employee from the new plant for a reason other than ability to perform the assigned work shall result in the termination of the employee’s seniority at all plants.
219
Employees who refuse an initial offer to work pursuant to these preferential placement arrangements shall be ineligible for further coverage under these provisions except for a onetime opportunity to reapply within thirty (30) days following a six-month period after the offer.
The preferential hiring arrangements covered by this letter contain potentially complex administrative implications and there may be times the: Corporation may not be able to fully conform with these provisions. Accordingly, the Corporation shall not be liable for any back pay on any claims arising from the administration of this letter.
(69} Preferential Hires - Plant Closure
During the 1993 negotiations, in conjunction with discussions regarding the Job and Income Security Program, the parties discussed the application of the preferential placement guidelines contained in Letter (68).
The parties agree that in circumstances involving a plant closure exceptions will be made to the arrangements specified in the Preferential Hires Letter (68) such that employees who transfer to another location will receive an adjusted seniority date at the new location which will be the date that notice of closure was given to the Union. Employees would be canvassed for Preferential Hire considerations and offered the opportunity to exercise hiring rights at any plant covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement. As job opportunities occur at a receiving plant, employees will be contacted in seniority order and offered employment. Employment offers may be made prior to the actual plant closing:. If an employee declines the employment opportunity, such employee shall be removed from the list for that plant after which the employee shall become eligible for normal preferential hire rights as specified in the Preferential Hires Letter. Such employees, when transferred to an opening at the new location, may displace employees hired at that location after the date the notice of closure ‘was provided to the Union.
220
(70) Rights Under Job & Income Protection
During the recently concluded negotiations the Union expressed ‘concern regarding seniority employees who are laid off as a result of an action described in Letter (127) - Restructuring -Job and Income protection who secure employment through the Preferential Hire opportunities at another corporate facility and within five: years of the; original layoff date are again indefinitely laid off without expectation of recall.
The Corporation agrees that under these circumstances the employee will be given the option to remain on layoff from the last facility where they were employed or to exercise their rights under Letter (127), Job and Income Protection available to them at the time of the original layoff.
(71)	Placement of Disabled Employees Discussions
During these negotiations the Union and the Company initiated discussions intended to provide disabled employees the opportunity to be placed on jobs consistent with their medical restrictions or to modify jobs to accommodate the employee’s disability. Discussion also focused on the treatment of certain disabled employees who are rehabilitated by the Workers’ Compensation Board for other employment.
However there was insufficient time for the parties to address all the issues associated with this matter.
Therefore the. parties agree to resume these discussions within 60 days o f the' ratification of this Agreement.
Thesediscussions will involve the President, CAW Local 444, the CAW Plant Chairpersons of the Windaor/Pillette complex and
221
appropriate Management representatives. These discussions will include among other items, the following topics:
•	a trial aimed at modifying jobs to accommodate disabled employees, Since this may involve the moving of elements among jobs all attendant contractual and operational circumstances will ‘be reviewed *,
•	an evaluation of the special placement process in terms of identifying additional opportunities for accommodation;
The parties recognize these discussions are consistent with the provision of P&M sections (41) Loss of Seniority and (42) Exceptions to Seniority and Job opportunity Provisions - Disabled Employees.
(72)	Transfer Between Plants at Employee Request
With reference to requests for transfer under P&M Section (51) (b) employees with one (I:) or more years seniority, desirous of a transfer, will make application at the Personnel Department of the plant to which they wish to be transferred.
Such employees shall be given preference for placement on available work for which the are qualified in ceases ‘where the Plant. Chairperson ofthe employee’s current plant has been served with Notice of Permanent Job Loss as outlined in the Job and income Security provisions of the Collective Agreement.
The parties agree that requests for transfers as outlined above will be subordinate to and not take precedence over applications submitted under Letters 68 and 69 of the Production and Maintenance Agreement.
The parties further agree employees who have applications on file under Section (51) (b) will be made available to the plant to which they have applied provided such action does not impact plant operational efficiency in either plant. In no case will the
222
number of employees made available to such other plants exceed the number of jobs estimated to be lost ail outlined in the Notice of Permanent Job Loss referred to above.
E'.mployees transferred under this letter agreement will have all other applications for transfer under P&M Section (51) (b) cancelled as of the date of their transfer. Further, an employee upon being transferred: shall not be eligible, to apply for further transfer for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of transfer unless the employee is indefinitely laid off at which point eligibility to make application will resume.
The number of employees transferred pursuant to this arrangement will offset the permanent job loss referenced in the Notice of Permanent Job Loss for purposes of Letters (126), (127) and (128).
(73)	Temporary Part-Time Employees
We had several discussions concerning the Supplemental Agreement — Temporary Part-Time Employees.
The parties signed the Supplemental Agreement — Temporary Part-Time Employees and further agreed that the National Union, may cancel such Agreement because of abuses by giving the Corporation thirty (30) days advance notice.
(74)	Supervisors Working
It is the express policy of the Corporation that supervisory personnel are For the purpose of carrying out supervisory functions and are not expected to displace employees covered by this Agreement.
However, a supervisory employee may perform operations where an emergency arises out ofunforeseen circumstances which calls for immediate action to avoid interruption of operations and
223
the supervisor may also perform operations for purposes of instruction or training as may be necessary in the discharge of supervisory duties, provided that the act of performing the aforementioned operations in itself does not reduce or affect the hours of work or pay of any employee covered by this Agreement,
(75)	Leave for Union Business - Benefit Level Eligibility
During the course of negotiations the Union expressed concern about the disparity with respect to the benefit level eligibility of those full time Local Union officers granted a leave for Union Business. After reviewing the matter, the Corporation agreed that those employees, of a plant within the Production and Maintenance Agreement, who have been granted a Leave for Union Business to hold the position of a full-time Local Union Officer will be deemed to hold the higher rated of the last regularly held classification or classification No. 5629 -Electrician.
(76)	Pay Practices
In the negotiations of the Production and Maintenance Agreement between Chrysler Canada Ltd. and the CAW dated today certain interpretations were developed. The Corporation’s interpretation of the applicable sections of the Agreement will be as follows:
1. Saturday work. Section (63) provides:
“Time and one-half will be paid as follows, except as provided in Section (65):
"(b) — For time worked on Saturday, except when a shift starts on Friday and continues into Saturday; provided that hours in excess of eight (8) per day or forty (40) per week on such shift will be paid at time and onehalf.”
224
In interpreting Section (63) (b), it is understood that employees who work: a shift on Saturday or Friday into Saturday that normally would be their sixth day worked but have not yet worked five (5) straight time shifts in the workweek due to an absence during the workweek will receive time and one-half for the hours worked on Saturday. This interpretation is intended to cover the third shift Sunday Night Start employee who works a sixth scheduled shift, and the fist or second shift employee in the situation covered by Appeal Board Case No. 3855.
2.	Saturday following a holiday. Except as specified in Paragraph 1 above, employees whose shift begins on Friday and who work into a Saturday do not receive time and one half for work on Saturday. A holiday falling during a workweek has no effect on the payment of premium for Saturday work.
3.	Work into a new workweek. The workweek is defined in Section (70).
“The regularly scheduled workweek starts at 12:01 a.m., Monday, and ends 168 hours thereafter, except those employees on third shift operations starting Sunday night in which case their regularly scheduled workweek starts with the beginning of their shift Sunday night and ends 168 hours thereafter.” It is understood that this includes those employees on seven-day operations.
Accordingly, (1) a third shift employee who begins a shift on Sunday and works into Monday will receive double time for hours worked on Sunday and straight time for the hours worked on Monday; (2) a siscond shift employee who works a shift that starts Sunday and continues into Monday will be paid double time for hours worked on Sunday and time and one-half for hours worked on Monday, provided such hours on Monday are in excess of 40 straight-time hours worked during the week in which the Sunday falls. If such hours on Monday are not in excess of 40, such hours will. be paid at straight time until the employee accumulates 40 straight-time hours, and then hours in excess of 40 will be paid
225
at time and one-half. If Monday is a holiday, such hours will be paid at double time.
The above paragraph does not apply to employees on seven-day operations.
The chart attached to this letter illustrates the interpretations set forth above.
4.	Seven-Day Operations. Section (65) of the Agreement now provides:
"Employees working on what are normally classified as seven-day operations will not be paid overtime or premium pay in accordance with Sections (63) and (64) above, but will be paid as follows:
“(a) — Time and one^half for hours worked in excess of eight
(8)	hours in any continuous twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the starting time of the employee’s shift or in excess of forty (40) hours per week.
"(b) — Time and one-half for tune worked on the sixth (6th) day of the employee’s scheduled workweek.,
"(c) — Double time for time worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive scheduled day whether or not the seven consecutive scheduled days fall in the same workweek.
"(d) — For the purposes of Subsections (b) and (c), a holiday specified in Section (73) for which an employee receives holiday pay or on which the employee performs work will be considered as a day worked. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (67), a holiday counted in determining an employee’s eligibility for payment pursuant to Subsection (b) may also be counted in determining the same employee’s eligibility for payment pursuant to Subsection (c).
"(c) — Double time and one-half for time worked on any of the days on which any of the designated full holidays is
226
observed unless the holiday falls on one of the employee’s regularly scheduled days off in which event the employee, in addition to holiday pay under Section (84), will be paid double time for time worked.
"(f) — ‘Time and one-quarter for time worked on a Sunday that is not compensable at a higher overtime rate under any other provision of this Agreement.”
An employee who performs maintenance duties in the powerhouse and who is normally scheduled to work Monday through Friday, and an employee, who is assigned to attend or maintain an auxiliary equipment installation that operates in conjunction with five-day operations, shall not be deemed to be working on an operation covered by Section (65).
5.	The provisions of Sections (63) and (64) shall not preclude mutually satisfactory local arrangements to theeffect that when an employee is transferred to a different shift as the result of a reduction in the working force the employee’s previous twenty-four (24) hour period shall terminate for purposes of computing overtime, and the shift to which the employee is transferred shall be regarded as the beginning of a new twenty-four (24) hour period. This provision shall not require a change in any existing local arrangement on this matter.
6.	Section (62), Shift Premium and Hours, provides:
“(a) — Employees regularly employed on the second or third shift shall receive in addition to their regular pay for the pay period five (5) per cent and ten (10) per cent, respectively, additional compensation.
"(b) — The first shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 4:00 a.m. but before 11:00 a.m. The second shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 11:00 a.m. but before 7:00 p.m. The third shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 7:00 p.m. but before 4:00 a.m.”
227
Hourly employees who are scheduled to work and work a shift other than their regularly scheduled shift, will receive the premium provided in Section (62).
For example, an employee is normally scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On Friday the employee is scheduled to work and works a shift from 3:30 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. The employee will receive second shift premium for those hours on Friday.
First shift employees who are scheduled to work and who do work additional hours in advance of their regular shift starting time will receive the shift premium applicable to their advanced starting time for all hours worked on such shift.
For example, a first shift employee is normally scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On Friday the employee is scheduled to work and works a shift from 3:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The employee will receive third shift premium for those hours on Friday.
7. These interpretations shall be effective with the effective date ofthe Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today and shall apply during the term of said Agreement.

This will confirm our understanding that in applying Section (68) (b) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement, the Corporation intends to do the following:
When production employees are assigned full time on a regular basis to all three shifts in a production department and the number of production employees on the least populated shift exceeds 50% of the number of employees on the most populated shift in that production department, all the production employees in that department shall be scheduled to work 7 3/4 hours on each shift and shall have a lunch period of onequarter hour and shall receive eight (8) hours pay.
It is understood that this arrangement does not apply to repair departments in assembly plants or employees in nonproductive or indirect labour departments such as inspection, material, maintenance, janitors, etc., except for those employees assigned exclusively on a full-time and regular basis to the production department working 7 3/4 hours, in which case the nonproductive or indirect employees will also be scheduled to work 7 3/4 hours and a one-quarter hour lunch period.
This application is not intended to interfere with any local agreement in effect on September 15, 1993 or to limit management’s right to apply the provision of Section (68) (a) under any circumstances.
If it is necessary to deviate from this application at any plant, the local union will be advised of the reasons and should any disputes arise as to the application of this Agreement and cannot be resolved at the local level, it will be immediately referred to the National Union and Chrysler Canada Ltd. for resolution.
(78)	3rd Shift Opr». Sumday Night Start
During negotiations leading to the new collective bargaining
230
agreement signed today, the parties discussed the feasibility of converting all third shift operations to a Sunday night start.
The parties recognize that in certain plants it is essential that third shift operations continue to start the work week on Monday night due to operating requirements.
Under certain conditions which are acceptable to both the Local Union and the Management of a particular plant, arrangements may be made whereby third shift operations which start on Monday night may, by mutual agreement, be changed to start on Sunday night subject to the approval of the National Union and the Staff Labour Relations Department of the Corporation.
(79)	Starling Times in Plants
In the negotiations leading to the current collective bargaining agreement, the Union acknowledged that business considerations in the Corporation Plants often require a change of shift starting times.
It is the policy of the Corporation to advise the Union of the need to change shift starting times prior to implementing such change as well as to advise the Union of the reasons for such change.
(80)	Shiift Schedule
The Corporation reserves the right to change the current shift schedules where circumstances so warrant. Such changes will be discussed with the Union prior to implementation.
(81)	Probationary P & M Employees Formerly On Salary
In the past the Union has expressed its concern regarding long service salaried employees of the Corporation who do not qualify
231
for holiday pay after being hired into an hourly Production and Maintenance bargaining unit because they had not acquired seniority in such unit on the date of the holiday.
In the event such situation should occur, a Representative of the National Union may discuss the matter with the Manager of Labour Relations of Chrysler Canada Ltd.
(82) T.P.T. Employees - Holiday Pay
During these negotiations the parties have discussed the eligibility of temporary part-time employees for holiday pay.
The Company has indicated that should the Union identify specific cases where a TPT can show a history of being scheduled to work on a particular day on which a holiday has fallen but has not qualified for holiday pay because the employee did not work the required day in the previous workweek, the Company would review these cases with a view to providing payment.
The Company and the Union have agreed to meet during the course of the new Agreement to review the holiday qualifications provisions of the TPT program.
Also, with respect to the holidays in the Christmas holiday week, a TPT employee will be deemed to have met the requirement of working within the scheduled workweek if said TPT employee works the employee’s next scheduled working day in the workweek following the Christmas holiday week.
(83) Holiday Pay & Disciplinary Layoff
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the situation where the duration of an impending disciplinary layoff would encompass or abut a specified holiday. It was mutually recognized that a wide variety of local practices exist on whether loss of holiday pay is appropriately included in the layoff penalty.
232
To insure uniformity between plant locations in the administration of discipline in such situations, the Company advised the Union that, as a matter of policy as of the effective date of the new Agreement,, loss of holiday pay would not be included as part of disciplinary layoff penalty assessed.
(84) Advance Christmas Pay
In the course of the current negotiations the Company and the Union had discussions regarding the practice of providing employees with advance paycheques prior to the Christmas Holiday Period.

Employees who qualify for only a portion of their payment-in-lieu of vacation under Section (86) will receive the same proportion of this payment.
Employees not on the active roll of the Company on the first Sunday in December but who are subsequently reinstated to the active roll during the current vacation year will be paid the special payment either at the time they take their vacation or at the end of the vacation year.
233
(86)	Christmas Bonus - 1993
During 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the eligibility for and payment of the Christmas Bonus in the first ysar of the Agreement, Notwithstanding the provision for Christmas Bonus in Letter (85) of the Agreement, for the Christmas Bonus in 1993, the parties agreed that all seniority employees on the active roll on the first Sunday in December will be paid the $500 vacation bonus in the last regular pay cheque prior to the Christmas Holiday period.
(87)	Vacation and PAA-Encouragement‘toTake Time OW
During the 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the Payment in Lieu of Vacation and Paid Absence Allowance Plan and its purpose of providing employees with paid time away from work during the course of the year.
While the parties recognize that circumstances may arise that prevent full utilization of such paid time off, they agreed that employees should be encouraged to take their vacation time, rather than pay in lieu. In this regard, the Company agreed that it would conduct its business in a manner consistent with such encouragement.
(88)	Vacation Pay Advance
During 1993 negotiations, the Company and the Union had discussions regarding the practice ofproviding employees with the ability of receiving their vacation pay once full entitlement has been earned.
The Company agrees that once full entitlement lias been earned, the employees may submit a Vacation Pay Request alter January 1st of the vacation year which will generate a pay for liill entitlement, less two weeks, as soon as practicable after the
234
request is made. This provision is not applicable to stalled trades since these employees may receive full payment with no reduction of the two weeks as they are required to work the scheduled shutdown.
(80) Administrative Procedures of the SPA Program & PAA
iDuring these negotiations, the parties developed a new program entitled Scheduled Paid Absences (SIPA). The parties have met and agreed to the following interpretations:
L. The Company and the Union are mindful of and do not desire to impact the efficiency of the operations which must be protected at all times. Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of Section (88), in the event that there are significant employee transfers into or out of a department which because of the scheduled SPA time would, adversely impact the operations, the Personnel Manager and the Shop Chairperson will modify the designated weeks off in order to protect skill levels and quality.
2.	The table contained within Section (8(5) relating to the number of hours of eligibility for PAA are applicable to employees hired on or after the effective date of the 1993 Agreement. Employees hired on or before September 14, 1993 shall beeligible for fifty-two (52) hours ofPAA provided they are otherwise eligible for that amount as specified in the Agreement.
3.	Any discipline assessed which would be scheduled during the SPA weeks shall not otherwise disqualify the employee for payment of the day in ‘which the discipline was scheduled. As an example, if an eimployiee was assessed a three (3) day disciplinary layoff, scheduled to be on Friday, Monday and Tuesday . . and Monday and Tuesday were days the employee was designated off as SPA week, the discipline would reflect a three (3) day disciplinary layoff, however the employee would receive SPA payments for those two (2) days.
235
4.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of Section (88), the Company and Union have agreed to waive this provision in the first year of the Agreement. After the first year, the Company will invoke the provisions of paragraph (e) unless agreed otherwise by both parties.
(90)	Accumulation of Time—Higher Classifications
The Corporation's practices on accumulating time on higher classifications are as follows:
1.	It is recognized that under certain circumstances it is necessary for employees to be regularly assigned to do work that falls within two or more hourly classifications with different rates of pay. The employee so assigned will be classified on the higher classification provided the employee spends 50% or more of the employee’s time on the work of the higher classification. In such cases no reduction in rate will be made for the time worked on the lower classification.
2.	An employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification for one or more hours of a shift shall be paid at the rate of the higher classification for all hours worked on that shift. The Corporation has instructed its supervisors to maintain accurate records of time accumulated on higher classifications, and to process for payment any accumulation of such time on a pay period basis. Whenever requested to do so by an employee and, in any event, before submitting the request for payment of accumulated time, Idle Supervisor will show to the employee the: copy of the Hourly Rate Adjustment Notice retained by the Supervisor and permit the employee to copy any information from it.
An employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification for
236
less than one hour on a shift shall receive the rate of the lower classification for all hours worked on that shift.
3.	A seniority employee assigned, whether temporarily or on a regular and recurring basis, to a job with a higher classification who receives the rate of a higher classification shall be paid the full base: rate of the higher classification.
4.	This letter regarding accumulation of time will not be applicable to local plant agreements regarding division of overtime covering classifications paying different rates, or to the assignment ofUnion representatives where such assignment is made for representation.
(91)	Reclassification
Where an employee has held a particular hourly classification and rate while performing the same job for a period of one (1) or more years, and Management determines that the classification is improper for the job in question, Management may reclassify the job to the: appropriate hourly classification, but the employee’s rate of pay while assigned or reassigned to that job will not be changed. The proper classification and rate of pay shall apply to any future employee on the job so reclassified. This shall not preclude the Union from protesting the propriety of such reclassifications through the grievance procedure.
(92) Wage Progression/COLA Fold-In
For the purposes of administering the: new hire provisions of the new Collective Agreement, it was agreed that employees hired prior to the effective date of the new Agreement who are
237
governed by the provisions of Section (96) shall have the calculation of their base rate determined on the basis of 85 % or 92.5%, as the case may be, of the maximum base rate under the 1993 Agreement, except that the cost-of-living allowance fold-in effective the beginning of the pay period commencing on or after the receipt of notice of ratification will not be subject to the reduction to 85% or 92.5%, as the case may be, but shall be transferred to base rate without reduction.
Tuiliion Refund
The Corporation offers and administers a tuition refund program under which employees will, under such terms and conditions as the Corporation may from time to time establish, receive a tuition refund not to exceed $1,500 a calendar year ($2,000 for the calendar year for approved courses taken at an accredited college or university) upon completion of an approved job-related course at an approved educational or training institution during non-working hours while on the active rolls of the Company.

(94) CAW Leadership Training Program
During these negotiations the parties have discussed the labour education program developed by the Union for the purpose of upgrading the skills which employees utilize in all aspects of trade union functions and the matter of Company financial support of this program. This program, entitled the CAW Leadership Training Program, has received contributions from the Company since September of 1983.
In recognition, therefore, of the contributions this program can make to the improvement of the Union/Management relationship and toward a more effective administration of the Collective Agreement, the Company agrees as hereinafter set forth to make a grant to the CAW Leadership Training Program (P.E.L. Trust).
Past Company contributions to the Leadership Training Program (P.E.L.) Trust have been deductible.

Following the passing of Bill 79, the Master Employment Equity Committee will develop a one (1) day Employment Equity program for the: individuals detailed above.
(99) Statistical Process Control - Awareness Training
Pursuant to Letter (130) Quality Initiatives of the P&M Agreement dated September 15, 1993, the parties mutually acknowledged Statistical Process Control as a process leading to greater employee participation in our collective efforts to improve the quality of our products.
The CAW has adopted an important role in promoting quality improvement as evidenced by its success in delivering the Chrysler Quality Awareness Workshop. The parties look forward to similar success in terms of Statistical Process Control Awareness training.
Chrysler believes Statistical Process Control will be most effective if employees use it voluntarily. Therefore, in consideration of the Union encouraging employee participation in training seminars scheduled to begin September 20, 1993, and allowing the application of such training, Chrysler hereby agrees that use of Statistical Process Control will not be mandatory during the term of this letter agreement. Either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice.
244
(100) Alcoholism! and Drug Abuse
During negotiations the parties reaffirmed their continuing conviction that it is important to provide assistance to employees afflicted with alcohol and drug dependence and to find ways to motivate them to recognize their problem and seek treatment where appropriate. Accordingly, the parties have expressed their mutual wish. to continue their progress toward the common goal of achieving an effective alcohol and drug abuse program at Chrysler-CAW locations.
While the current Chrysler-CAW program has continued to develop and mature, it has become apparent that the most successful local programs are those that have enjoyed the full support of the respective plant managements and Local. Unions. That support has led to different approaches to similar problems at the various locations. Difficulties of implementation that exist at one location may not exist at others. Solutions, in part at least, therefore, have to be tailor-made for the location. For example, the proximity or availability of approved treatment facilities, the suitability of places utilized for employee contact, and the prior existence of a union or government-sponsored program are all factors bearing on the success of an alcohol and drug abuse program at the local level.
The foregoing leads us to conclude that our joint endeavor should be to continue to assist local programs in developing methods that will more effectively encourage afflicted employees to seek assistance under the program and that will convince them of the: privacy and confidentiality of such assistance. To this end, the National Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Committee, pursuant to the principles and guidelines previously established, will (i) analyze those causes that inhibit and those that foster employee utilization of the program at each location, (ii) establish procedures for the confidential maintenance at each location of records of employees using the program, and (iii) communicate to all locations, when appropriate, those techniques that have proved successful at one or more locations, (iv) coordinate and oversee a pilot training program for certification of the Employee
245
Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative and develop an evaluation procedure to measure improved performanceas a result of the training, (v) recommend and coordinate an in-plant awareness campaign on substance abuse information handouts, posters, etc., and (vi) initiate a four (4) hour drag/alcohol awareness training for union representatives and supervisors conducted by the inplant Employee Assistance/Substance Abuse Representative.
Representation on the National Committee shall be two (2) Management and two (2) Union members and shall meet twice each year. The National Committee will also continue to periodically review local programs to assist local management and local shop committees concerned with alcohol, and drug abuse problems who believe they are experiencing difficulty in attaining program effectiveness.
Our experience under this program thus far shows that an effective company-wide program requires the full cooperation of management and Union alike. The joint efforts necessary to provide assistance to afflicted employees may, however, be complicated by many factors such as multi-shift operations, plant location and population, in-plant facility available for employee contact, plant layout, and the need for privacy. We mutually endorse reasonable and practical resolution to these problems where they exist..
Finally, the success that already has been achieved under the program indicates the commitment that both Chrysler and the CAW have toward helping employees with problems of alcohol and drug dependence. We will continue to monitor and assist with local program activities to assure the continued success and improvement of this Chrysler-CAW program.

247
SCP, to the extent available. An equal amount will be deducted from the accrued balance in the applicable SCF.
‘In the event there is a conflict between the use of the accrual in the SCF to support SUB or Legal Services benefits, the parties agree that available funds, exclusive of the additional $150,000 designated for the exclusive use for Bramalca Legal Services benefits 'will be used first to support SUiB benefits.

256
(116)	Merger of Main CAW and Brarnalea Pension Plans
During the 1993 negotiations the parties agresed to postponethe merger of the main CAW and Brarnalea non-contributory pension plans until SUCh time as the merger did not create any additional legal or financial liabilities for the Corporation. The Corporation and the Union shall determine a mutually agreed upon dale for such merger.
The merger will be subject to the provisions of the letter signed by both parties dated October 25, 1990 which proposed such merger. The merger will also be subject to approval by the Pension Commission of Ontario and Revenue Canada.
(117)	Pension Benefit Reduction
‘The parties agree that if any employee’s or surviving spouse’s total pension benefit is reduced because of the application of Section 3 of Article IV ("Maximum allowable lifetime pension for employees retiring after December 31,1991") or of Section 5 of Article VII (“Maximum allowable supplementary pension for employees retiring after December 31, 1991"), then, the Corporation agrees to pay to such employee or surviving spouse in one lump sum payment the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount of the required reductions. The payment could be treated as a retiring allowance and rolled tax free into a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (R.RSP), subject to Revenue Canada regulations.
The determination of the Actuarial Equivalent of the reductions shall be made at the time the employee’s seniority ceases (or at the earliest of the date of death or age 65 for an employee who is occupationally disabled as defined in Section (l)(c) or Article V) using the calculation basis specified in the Canadian Institute of Actuaries Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans (effective September 1, 1993).
257

This will confirm our understanding first reached during the 1990 negotiations concerning the sharing of the Unemployment Insurance premium reduction allowed employer!! with qualified wage loss replacement plans.
The parties recognize that the Unemployment Insurance premium reduction may be passed on to employees as a group either in the form of a cash rebate or in the form of employee benefits.
It was agreed that effective with the first, pay period ending in January 1991, and continuing through the term of the 1993 Agreement, the Corporation will cease sharing the premium
or to provide new benefits.
(119)	Employees’ Copies of Agreements
Agreements will be printed and made available to employees on a request basis.
(120)	New Hire Orientation
The Corporation and the National Union, CAW agree to implement a joint orientation program for hourly employees.
The orientation program will be implemented in all plants and locations of the Corporation where the number of new hourly employees being hired warrants such a program.
The orientation will be conducted prior to the enrollment of a prospective employee except when the number of new hires makes administering the program impractical or unduly
258
burdensome for the representatives of the parties hereinafter described or would delay the commencement of operations for which the new employees are hired. The orientation will consist of information presented in accordance with guidelines established by the Corporation and the National Union, CAW. The information will acquaint the employee with work areas, and inform individuals of the benefits, opportunities and responsibilities they will have as employees of the Corporation and as members of the Union. The program shall be: conducted, in part, by a representative of the Plant Personnel Department and, in part, by an elected or appointed Local Union representative, officer or Benefit Representative designated by the National Union whose other duties at the time of election, appointment or designation shall already permit said individual, if said individual is working on the job, to take time: away from work without loss of pay. The orientation shall be conducted during normal plant working hours at times and places determined by Local Plant Management.
In the event that either party believes the program does not meet the provisions of this letter, notification may be given; if by the: Union to the Corporate Labour Relations Staff, or if by the Corporalion to the National Union, CAW.
The program will not be subject to the grievance procedure and may be terminated at any plant by either the National Union or the Corporation, upon written notice to the other party.
(121)	Training Committee
In the: negotiations leading to the new collective bargaining agreement that Chrysler Canada Ltd. and the CAW signed today, it was evident that both the Corporation and the Union are vitally interested in developing the skills, talents and potentiality for advancement of employees in their own and other CAW bargaining units, and in enabling them to keep pace with the
259
rapidly changing technology, methods and processes in our plants and offices. It was equally evident that both the Corporation and the Union are urgently interested in recruiting and training employees to take the places of those who qualify for higher rated and more responsible positions, and to make themselves eligible later for similar positions.
This is not, by any means, a new development. Chrysler has introduced a number of new training programs for its employees and has expanded others to help employees take full advantage of their capabilities. In addition, the Tuition Refund Program that Chrysler instituted in October, 1964, for which all Chrysler employees are eligible, has provided them with the opportunity to obtain job-related instruction in educational and training institutions, and many have taken advantage of it. The success of the Apprenticeship Training Program under an agreementbetween Chrysler and the Union has been outstanding.
Recognizing the continuing and expanding need for employee training to enable Chrysler to continue to improve its competitive position and to assist then current employees to take advantage of promotional opportunities in the future, the parties will establish a National Training Committee, consisting of five representatives of the National Union and live representatives of the Corporation, to be appointed respectively by the CAW President of the National Union and the Vice-President - Human Resources of the Corporation. The members of this Committee shall include at least one person who is familiar with the training needs and related problems of employees in each of the following areas: (i) office and clerical employees, (ii) engineering employees, (iii) skilled trades employees, k including upgraders, but excluding apprentices covered by the Supplemental Agreement relating to apprentices, and (iv) all production and maintenance employees.
The National Training Committee shall have responsibility for 2.60
investigating, developing and recommending, on a uniform basis, for all plants and offices:
(1)	New and/or expanded training programs that will be in the best interest of both the employees and the Corporation;
(2)	Standards for the implementation of the various training programs the Corporation has instituted or may institute, and particularly for encouraging qualified employees to participate therein.
(3)	Methods and techniques for selecting candidates for training on the basis of aptitude, interest and other qualifications; and
(4)	The instructional methods to be used in such training programs.
Bach Local Union shall (i) encourage its members to enroll and to continue to participate in training programs; (ii) counsel and advise them on the availability of training programs and as to the appropriateness for them of thevarious programs, having in mind their experience, aptitudes, education and other qualifications; (iii) advise the National Training Committee as to the needs among its members for training programs.
‘The National Training Committee will submit whatever recommendations it may make to the Corporation and the National Union, but may not commit either party to a training program or any aspect thereof.
(122)	Employment Equity Committees
During current negotiations, the parties reaffirmed the policy of the Company and the CAW as outlined in Section (4) of the
261
Agreement.
The Company reaffirmed its Policy to extend opportunities for employment and advancement within the Company to all qualified applicants and employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.
While recognizing that it is the right of Management to hire, assign and promote qualified candidates subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the parties agree to undertake certain joint activities to further implement these nondiscriminatory Policies following ratification of this Agreement.
Locall Committees:
There will be a Local Employment Equity Committee established at each plant location. The two members of each Local Employment Equity Committee shaU be selected by the CAW President from within the existing representation structure. The local President will also act as an ex-officio member of the Committee. If there are no women in the existing representation structure, the CAW President shall select one committee member from among the women actively employed in the bargaining unit at the location at which selected. Women selected by the CAW President for this purpose will be permitted to leave work when required during straight time hours to function as a committee member and will be paid by the Company at their regular straight time rate up to the number of hours listed in the following schedule:
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STRAIGHT NUMBER OF	TIME HOURS PAID PER
EMPLOYMENT EqUITY WEEK WHEN EXCUSED FROM LOCAL	COMMITTEE________ REGULAR WORK ASSICWHENT
Windsor Local 444	1	40
Bramalea Local 1258	2	6
Windsor Office Local 1498	1	6
262
Ajax Local 1090 and Etobicoke Local 1459 will incorporate Equity matters within their representation structure.
The above listed hours are available on either Monday and/or Friday and the committee member when utilizing such hours may be replaced by a Temporary Part-Time Employee in areas where the TPT Program is in place, if a replacement is required.
.A comparable number of Management representatives will be appointed. These Local Employment Equity Committees! will have the task of assessing each location’s needs to further enhance the policy of Employment Equity. Attention is to be devoted to women, visible minorities, aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities. The local committees shall develop and present to local Management, a proposal for their initiatives annually. Subject to approval of this plan, the committees will then work within the following frame work of guidelines:
(a)	- Community Outreach:
1.	Members of the Employment Equity Committee should visit community schools and organizations to meet with placement counsellors and students to discuss the types of and requirements for jobs available at Chrysler Canada Ltd. and the procedure for submitting an application. Leaflets and video presentations may be ‘developed for use by schools in their education programs.
2.	Employment Equity Committees should establish and maintain a liaison with local organizations representing target groups.
(b)	- Training for Current Employees:
To further the advancement of employees into technical skilled positions, the Local Committees will take the following actions:
l. A communications program will be developed and promoted by the Local Committees to encourage the designated group members to apply for technical and skilled positions.
263
2.	Each Local Committee should assess the types of jobs for which training would appropriate and make recommendations to the local parties after giving consideration, to the availability of community resources.
3.	The Local Committees will, in consultation with the Master Employment Equity Committee and the local apprenticeship committee, develop and implement, a preapprenticeship training program for designated group members.
(c)	- Communications:
Local Committees would develop overall communications programs utilizing Company newspapers, localUnion newspapers and other specific: communication formats which could convey the message to employees and the community about the CAW and Chrysler Canada commitment to employment equity and that there are opportunities for all qualified members of society within Chrysler Canada Ltd.
(d)	- Employment Equity Plan:
In addition, the Local Committees may play a role in the development and implementation of the joint Employment Equity Plan. This role could include information gathering, barrier identification, the development of goals and timetables, and other elements of the plan that require local input.
(e)	- Anti-Harassment Activities:
Members of the Local Employment Equity Committee may play a role in the investigation of harassment complaints as outlined in the workplace harassment policy and procedure in Section 4 of the Collective Agreement.
(f)	- Master Employment Equity Committee
It is recognized that Local Committees will require ongoing assistance and direction. Accordingly, a Master Employment
264
Equity Committee will be established consisting of two representatives of the National Union, the Chair of the CAW Chrysler Master Bargaining Committee, and three staff members of the Company. This committee will meet quarterly, at rotating plant and office locations, and may be supplemented, by mutual agreement, by Local Committee representatives from that or other locations as required.
'rhe Master and Local Employment lEquity Committees will meet annually for up to 3 days, including travel time, to attend to such matters as the training of committee members, local committee reports, and Company-wide initiatives.
The Company will be responsible for wages and meal expenses to a maximum of $35 per day, if meals are not provided. The Union will be responsible for transportation and lodging expenses.
(123)	Annual Benefits Meeting
This will extend our understanding reached during the 1990 negotiations concerning an annual benefits meeting for Union and Company Benefit Representatives.
It was agree that the masting will be mainly for educational purposes to improve the knowledge and proficiency of the Benefit Representatives.
Topics to be covered will include, but will not be limited to, new legislation and new or updated procedures as they affect the negotiated benefits.
The National Union will be given the opportunity to review the agenda, and make necessary recommendations, as well as attend and participate :in the proceedings.
In this connection, the Company has agreed to provide pay for lost time (eight hours base pay rate plus COLA) to Union Benefit Rqiresentatives who attend the annual meeting. The employee
265
who has been designated as the regular replacement for the Union Benefit Representative may be activated for the day the Benefit Representative attends the annual benefit meeting.
(124)	Content
During the course of the 1993 negotiations the Company and the Union held extensive discussions concerning the business and social consequences appendant to the issue of marketplace accessibility, content and sourcing within the context of a global automobile industry.
Consistent with our mutual desire to utilize the full range of employees' abilities to contribute ta these objectives, the Company agrees to work with the Union in the exploration of measures to maintain employment opportunities equivalent to those now encompassed by the total of all plants covered by the Production and Maintenance Agreement. This would include, where feasible, replacement of jobs lost by outsourcing.
In addition, Chrysler Canada Ltd. joins the CAWin supporting the principle that manufacturers who participate in the Canadian market should provide jobs, pay taxes and support the economy of the market in which they sell. As you know, Chrysler Corporation, has for decades barred its operations throughout North America on this very principle. We believe that, over the long run, no alternative; policy can prevail if there is to be fairness and balance among the major trading nations of the world. As evidence of its commitment to these principles, the Company's Canadian value added gross purchases in 1992 exceeded seventy-five percent (75%) of its gross Canadian sales. Given Ihe scope of its current operations in Canada, the Company affirms its expectation these principles will be maintained.
Chrysler Canada Ltd. commits to support acceptance of this principle, so that foreign producers will be: encouraged to make their fair contribution to actions that will restore jobs to Canadian automotive and parts manufacturing workers.
266
It is believed that the principles expressed in this letter will contribute significantly to our co-operatively working together to provide employees in Canada with improved job security.
(1125) New Technology
It is recognized that the principle set forth in Section (91), paragraph (c) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today, will continue to create changes in the scope and work, content of job classifications of represented employees. When the Corporation anticipates that a technological improvement it is 2^ making in its tools, methods, processes, equipment or materials h may have a major impact on the work performed by Union represented employees, the Corporation will, as early as practicable, so advise the National Union, and at that time describe thelocation and nature of such technological changes and the extent to which they may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant or plants involved.
The Corporation and the Union may submit to the National Training Committee their recommendations for any training^!' programs intended to assist present employees to perform work \) within the bargaining unit which is new or changed as a result of technological improvement.
In the event the National Union Representative considers it appropriate, he may arrange a meeting with the Manager of Labour Relations of the Corporation to discuss the impact of such technological changes and any proposed responses to such changes.
Any problems not resolved in such discussions may be submitted to the grievance procedure or to the deliberations of the National Training Committee, or to any other procedure on which the parties may agree.
267
(126)	Understanding Re: Permanent Job Losses
During 1993 negotiations the parties discussed the extensive structural change that has already, and will continue to take place, in the North American automotive industry. Our discussions focused on two key aspects of this complicated issue: the need to maintain each Chrysler Canada Ltd. location as a productive manufacturer of world class quality products in the North American automotive market and to ensure that Chrysler Canada Ltd. employees, who contribute to the success ofthe Corporation, have their jobs and incomes protected as restructuring actions are taken. In addition, we have recognized the importance of the parties at both the local and national level continuing an ongoing dialogue about all the aspects of the business to ensure that the important goals are achieved.
With these objectives in mind, we have agreed that the understanding listed below will govern the parties in the event that restructuring or productivity-related actions may result in permanent job losses. These permanent job losses ate those occasioned by specific actions taken by the Coiporation. For example, outsourcing, the introduction of new technology, sale of part of the Corporation, and consolidation of operations would be actions contemplated by this understanding. The understanding would not apply to normal cyclical fluctuations in demand or the reduction of employees on “temporary” assignments. It is also understood that this program does not replace the ongoing discussions which continually take place at the local level regarding production standards and manpower requirements.
1. Where such permanent loss of jobs is considered, one year notice will be provided to the Union in the case of plant closure and six months notice will be provided to the Union in the case of a potential permanent job loss related to a restructuring as referred above. The information supplied to the Union will include the number of employees who could potentially be impacted and the rationale for the: decision. It is understood that the information will be used for discussions between the parties and the workforce, and will be considered
268
confidential. The Union will have the opportunity to make proposals which could alter or modify the decision.
2.	During the course of these discussions, the objectives of the parties will be the retention of the jobs in question. To that end, the paities will discuss opportunities to retain or replace the jobs which are being discontinued. The Union will have thirty days from the date of notice to make proposals which could make it feasible to retain or replace the jobs in question.
3.	If job losses become unavoidable and management decides to reduce the size of the workforce, every effort will be made to use attrition to manage the required reductions. The use of attrition is the subject of a separate letter between the parties.
(127)	Restructuring — Job and Income Protection
During the 1993 negotiations, in a separate letter between the parties, we described the process that would be followed in the event that restructuring actions may result in permanent job losses. In that letter we agreed that the objective of the parties will be the retention of the jobs in question. We also agreed that if job losses become unavoidable, every effort will be made to use attrition to manage the required reductions.
The instant letter describes the process that will be implemented, and the benefit entitlements that will be provided to employees under three separate scenarios: (1) closure of standalone plants, (2) closure of a plant(s) at a multi-plant site, and (3) restructuring actions resulting in permanent job losses at any plant. The scenarios are detailed below as follows:
PLANT CLOSING Stand-Alone Plants
As closure approaches and operations begin to wind down, employees who (1) are any age and have 28.1 or more years of
269
Credited Service; (2) are age 54 or older but less than age 60 and within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service to equal 85 or more; and (3) are age 60 or older but less than age 65 and have ten or mope years of Credited Service or are age 61 or older but less than age 65 and have 9.1 but less than 10 years of Credited Service, will be contacted regarding retirement under the Regular Early Retirement provisions of the applicable Non-Contributory Pension Plan and, if eligible, for Regular Early Retirement, may retire immediately and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111, Retirement Allowance Option - Job and Income Protection Plan. Employees who are: age 55 or older but less than age 65 and who have ten or more years of Credited Service (including any such employees who are also eligible for Regular Early Retirement) will be offered Special Early Retirement commencing on or before the announced closing date and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111 upon retirement. Employees who are age SO or older but less than age 55 and who have 10 or more years of credited service at the date of closure and are not eligible for Regular Early Retirement will be offered benefits under the Pre-Retirement income Maintenance Program (PRIMP) and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111 upon commencement of PRIMP benefits.
At time of closure, remaining employees, including eligible employees who declined to elect immediate Regular Early Retirement or who declined the offer of Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will be placed on layoff. AU such employees with 5 or more years of Seniority, except those who meet the age and service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan (VTEP). Any laid off employee who elects not to apply immediately for VTEP or who is ineligible for VTEP because the employee has less than 5 years of Seniority at layoff or because the employee meets , at the date of layoff, the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement or PRIMP will:
270
—	be eligible for Eiegulair Benefits under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) Plan provided the employee has at least one year of Seniority as of the employee's last day worked prior to layoff;
—	be offered employment, at other Corporation facilities in accordance with the parties’ understanding on preferential placement; and
—	provided the: employee had 5 or more years of Seniority as of the employee’s last day worked prior to layoff and does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement upon exhausting the employee's eligibility for Regular SUBenefits and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement or PRIMP at time of ‘layoff, be eligible for IMP Benefits under the Income Maintenance Benefit Plan.
An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who elects not to apply for VTEP at time of layoff will be eligible to make subsequent application for such a payment, reduced by the sum of any IMP Benefits the employee had received while on layoffprior to ultimately making application for VTEP, provided that the employee does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement at the time application is made and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement or PRIMP at time of layoff and provided further that such application is filed within the maximum time limits set forth in the Voluntary Termination of Employment Plan.
Multi-Plant Sites
On a site-wide basis, separately for skilled trades and nonskilled employees for skilled employees, by trade, before closing layoffs are effected, the number of employees in the workforce will be reduced by:
271
(1)	Laying off employees with hire or rehire dates on or after the date closing was announced;
(2)	Offering the opportunity to employees at any age who have
28.1	or more years of Credited Service to:
(a)	retire immediately, if eligible for Regular Early Retirement, and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111; or
(b)	if not eligible to retire, or if option 2(a) not chosen, to be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits;
(3)	Offering the opportunity to employees (excluding those who also may be in (2) above) who are age 54 or older but less than age 65 and who within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service to equal 85 or more to;
(a)	retire immediately, of eligible for Regular Early Retirement, and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111; or
(b)	if not eligible to retire, or if option 3(a) not chosen, to be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits:;
(4)	Offering Special Early Retirement to employees (including those who also may be in (2) or (3) above but excluding those in 2(a) or 3(a) who are age 55 or more but less than age 65 and who have 10 or more years of Credited Service and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111 upon retirement;
(5)	Offering the opportunity to be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits, to employees who are age (50 or older but less than age 65 and have 10 more years of Credited
272
Service or are age 61 or older but less than age 65 and have 9.1 but less than 10 years of Credited Service; and
(6)	Offering employees who have 5 or more years of Seniority (excluding those in (2), (3), (4) and (5) above) an opportunity to apply for VTEP.
If the total number of employees who accept an offer under (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) above exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost due to the closing, individual elections will be effected in Seniority order until the resulting number of separations equals the expected job loss.
At time of closure, the reduction in force provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be implemented. An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who is laid off as a result of the reduction in force and who at time of layoff does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under VTEP. Any laid off employee who elects not to apply immediately for VTEP or who is ineligible for VTEP because the employee has less than 5 years of Seniority at layoff or because the employee meets the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will:
—	be eligible for Regular Benefits under the SUB Plan;
—	be offered employment at other Corporation facilities in accordance with the parties’ understanding on preferential placement or be eligible for recall to work at a plant in the same unit, whichever may occur first; and
—	provided the employee had 5 or more years of Seniority as of the employee’s last day worked prior to layoff and does not meet the age and Credited Service requirement for Regular
273
Early Retirement upon exhausting the employee’s eligibility for Regular SUBenefits and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement at time of layoff, be eligible for IMP Benefits under the Income Maintenance Benefit Plan,
An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who elects not to apply for VTEP at time of layoff will be eligible to make subsequent application for such. a payment, reduced by the sum of any IMP Benefits the employee had received while on layoff prior to ultimately making application for VTEP, provided that the employee does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular Early Retirement at the time application is made and did not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Special Early Retirement at the time of layoff and provided farther that SUCh application is filed within (he maximum time limits set forth in the Voluntary ‘Termination of Employment Plan.
PERMANENT JOB LOSS
In the event management decides that workforce reductions resulting in permanent job loss as a consequence of restructuring actions cannot be accomplished in a timely and efficient manner through normal attrition, the following steps will be taken, separately for skilled trades and non-skilled employees and for skilled employees, by trade:
(1)	employees with less than one year of Seniority will be placed on layoff;
(2)	If the number of separations that can be accomplished through implementation of (1) above is less than the number of jobs that will be lost, employees at any age who have 28.1 or more years of Credited Service will be offered the opportunity to:
274
(a)	retire immediately, if eligible for Regular Early Retirement, and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111; or
(b)	if not eligible to retire, or if option 2(a) not chosen, be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits;
If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under (1) above, exceeds the number of jobi! that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order for accepting employees until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
(3)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees (excluding those who may also be in (2) above) who are age 54 or older but less than age 65 and who within two years would have sufficient combined years of age and Credited Service equal to i!5 or more will be offered the opportunity to:
(a)	retire immediately, if eligible for Regular Early Retirement, and receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111; or
(b)	if not eligible to retire, or if option 3(a) not chosen, be placed on layoff, with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits;
If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under the two preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order for accepting employees until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
275
(4)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees (including those who also may be in (2) or (3) above but excluding those in 2(a) or 3(a) who are age 55 or more but less than age 65 and who have 10 or more years of Credited Service will be offered Special Early Retirement and be eligible to receive the retirement allowance described in Letter 111 upon retirement. Ifthe number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under the three preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, Special Early Retirements will be approved in Seniority order until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
(5)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees who are age 60 or older but less than age 65 and have 10 or more years of Credited Service or are age 61 or older but less than age 65 and have 9.1 or more but less than 10 years of Credited Service will be offered the opportunity to be placed on layoff with eligibility for Regular SUBenefits. If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of employees separated or scheduled for separation under the four preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will be implemented in Seniority order for accepting employees until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost;
(6)	If the combined number of separations pursuant to the preceding steps is less than the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, employees who have 5 or more years of Seniority (excluding those in (2), (3), (4) and (5) above) will be offered an. opportunity to apply for VTEP. If the number of employees who accept this offer, combined with the number of
276
employees separated or scheduled for separation under the five preceding steps, exceeds the number of jobs that will be permanently lost, this offer will, be implemented in Seniority order until the combined number of actual and scheduled separations equals the number of jobs lost.
These actions will be taken and administered on a site-wide basis at multi-plant sites.
if these measures fail to stimulate sufficient additional attrition to accomplish the necessary workforce reductions, the reduction in force provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be implemented. An employee with 5 or more years of Seniority who is laid off as a result of the reduction in force and who at time of layoff does not meet the age and Credited Service requirements for Regular or Special Early Retirement will be eligible to apply immediately upon layoff for a lump sum payment under VTEP.

The above commitments) were executed in a spirit that recognize!) the need to ensure that Chrysler Canada operations produce world-class quality products as efficiently as possible. That recognition, coupled with the commitments we have negotiated to protect the jobs and incomes of our employees, should help to assure that both parties achieve our shared objective of maintaining Chrysler Canada as a viable entity in the North American automotive market.
(128)	Skilled Trades Permanent Job Losses
During these negotiations the parties agreed to several arrangements which will govern the parties in the event of permanent job losses resulting from productivity-related actions or restructuring.
In response to concerns raised by the Union regarding productivity-related actions or restructuring and their potential
278
impact on maintenance and construction work, the Company reaffirmed the principle.'! and procedures with respect to the letting of outside contracts for maintenance and construction work specified in Sections (11), (12), (13), (14) and (15) of the Supplemental Agreement Special Provisions Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees.
(120) Vendor Support
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the issue of supplier employees performing rework and/or sorting operations within the plant. The Company explained the necessity for occasionally having vendors perform rework upon their supplied components. To that extent, the Company advised the Union it is not, under normal and ordinary circumstances, the intent of Chrysler Canada Ltd. to have vendor employees perform “rework”, to the detriment of CAW represented employees except as it pertains to the below statement on specific techniques or skills.
Nevertheless, the parties recognize that circumstances can and do arise where vendors must have their employees perform such rework within our facilities in cases such as where it is required for the vendor to obtain more knowledge about the quality delect, where specific techniques or skills are required and/or where warranty agreements and vehicle safety items could be impacted. Furthermore, the Company advised the Union that under normal and ordinary circumstances, non-corporate supplier employees would only be allowed to perform continuing rework and/or sorting operations within our facilities for up to a maximum of three (3) consecutive working days to correct a specific problem. After such time, the rework for that specific problem would be assigned either to plant employees or the nonconforming material will be returned to the supplier for rework. This agreement would not be in effect for a maximum of six (6) weeks following the
279
introduction of any new part.
In applying the above understanding, the Plant assures the Union that, vendor rework will not be performed on the assembly line. Further, in the case of finished vehicles, vendor rework will be performed only in those instances where the vendor's expertise is required due to the criteria referenced in the aforementioned paragraph.

In this regard, the Corporation reviewed with the Union quality initiatives that are being introduced to ensure that the best possible quality standards are achieved. The programs reviewed included the Quality Improvement Process, Statistical Process Control methods, Performance Feedback Systems, training of employees to enhance operator skills, and other measures to measure and improve quality levels.
The parties agreed the application of these programs and processes is important for achievement of the quality objectives essential to the ongoing viability of each facility of Chrysler Canada Ltd.

One of the concepts discussed that would enable Chrysler to work: toward meeting theseimportant objectives and providing job security pertains to basic employee responsibilities. The Company believes setting forth an understanding of the duties that constitute basic responsibilities of all employees will encourage employee growth and cooperation, thereby improving productivity and increasing the flexibility of the Company’s human resources.
As such, the Company and the Union agree that all employees are expected to take pride in their workmanship; have respect for other employees, union and salaried alike; be orderly and neat in their own workplace and otherwise respect the rights of others to work in an orderly, clean and safe environment.
AH employees, are expected to perform the various duties and basic responsibilities assigned to them.

for the affected plant.
Step 3:	For each full month of AWS operation, a plant
specific excess hour amount will be calculated.
Step 4:	For months in which the excess hours calculated in
Step 3 exceeds the average penalty calculated in Step 2, the P&M SCF accrual will be reduced by the difference between the amount calculated in Steps 2 and 3 multiplied by the current SCF penalty.
