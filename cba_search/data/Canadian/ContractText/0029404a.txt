Maple Leaf Pork,
A Division of Maple Leaf Meats Inc.,
Lethbridge, Alberta (hereinafter called “the Company”)
AND
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 401 affiliated with the A.F.L. - C.I.O. and the Canadian Labour Congress (C.L.C.) on behalf of its Local Unions (hereinafter called “the Union”)
RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency. The Company will not bargain collectively with any other labour organization affecting employees in the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE 1 - PURPOSE
The purpose of this Agreement is to maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees; to provide an amicable method of settling any grievances or differences which might possibly arise; to promote the mutual interests of the employer and the employees. The Company and the employees jointly recognize the continuing need for maintaining efficient production in the packinghouse industry at all times and the necessity of rendering efficient service to the producers and consumers and realizing their mutual responsibility pledge full cooperation to that end.
ARTICLE 2 - BARGAINING UNIT
2.1	The bargaining unit is comprised of all the employees on the plant payroll, as distinguished from the office payroll, with the exception of:
(a)	W atchmen.
(b)	Assistant forepersons and those above the rank of assistant foreperson.
(c)	Employees represented by any certified bargaining agent other than the Union.
2.2	It is generally the practice of the Company to have work within the plant performed by employees of the Company. However, because of reasons such as the availability of skilled employees, complexity of the work, the cost of equipment required to do the work in relation to its use, the scope of the work, the duration and frequency of the work, the cost to have the work performed by employees as compared to other alternatives, it may become necessary to have the work within the plant performed by outside contractors,
-2-
Where outside contractors perform work within the plant and such work represents a material change in practice creating an adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such material change in practice, the matter may be processed as a grievance under Article 4 of this Agreement. Should the grievance be referred to an Arbitration Board as provided under Article 5, the Arbitration Board will consider the reasons mentioned in the first paragraph of this section in its determination of the use by the Company of such outside contractors and where the Arbitration Board determines that the use of such outside contractors does create such an adverse effect, the Company will, within a reasonable period, either discontinue the work or have it performed by employees.
The foregoing shall not apply to the cafeteria and to construction and installation work.
The Company may introduce work utilizing Company employees on a trial or test basis. If the result of such an experiment indicates that, for reasons set out in the first paragraph of this section, the work should be transferred to an outside contractor, this shall not be construed as being a change in general practice.
2.3	The Company agrees that forepersons and those above the rank of foreperson and, unless otherwise mutually agreed, an assistant foreperson, appointed to a newly created assistant foreperson position on or after October 28, 1966, shall not assume duties that are normally performed by employees except where such duties are limited to occasional work, negligible in amount, but such foreperson or assistant foreperson shall in no way be restricted from work which:
(a)	is of a confidential clerical nature.
(b)	is for the purpose of instruction, experimentation, demonstration, investigation, replacement of an employee absent from his/her job during the day, sharpening knives or coping with an emergency. An emergency as herein contained shall not be construed as including work resulting from additional volume.
(c)	is to overcome production difficulties caused by the absence of an employee. In such cases, the Company will advise the Union as to the absence of the employee and will obtain a suitable replacement within one-half (1/2) day.
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT
The Union recognizes the sole right of the Company to manage the plant and direct the work of the employees including the right to hire, promote, demote, suspend, discharge for cause, lay off, assign to jobs and shifts, transfer employees from department to department, increase or decrease the working forces, determine the products to be handled, processed or manufactured, the schedule of production and the methods, processes and means of production and the handling of same. The Company shall not discriminate against present and prospective employees whether or not they are members of the Union. This Article shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the other provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 4 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
3
4.1	Should any difference arise under this Agreement between the Company and the employee members of the Union, it shall be settled by the following method, each step to be taken progressively without delay unless the difference has been settled in an earlier step:
FIRST STEP
The employee or the steward of the department or both, shall take the question up with his/her foreperson. In respect to any settlement effected by the employee without the steward, the steward may reopen the question by discussing same with the employee and the foreperson. Grievances may be submitted in writing if either party considers it necessary. If the question is not settled by the end of the next work day; then
SECOND STEP
The Chief Steward, or his/her designated representative, both of whom shall be employees of the Company and members of the bargaining unit as defined under Article 2, with or without the steward of the department, shall present the question in writing to the Plant Superintendent, or in his/her absence, the Company’s designated representative. If the question is not settled by the end of the next two (2) working days; then
THIRD STEP
Within five (5) working days, the question shall be presented in writing to the plant management by the Grievance Committee of the Union which may be accompanied by a full-time staff member of the Union (not necessarily an employee), a decision to be rendered within five (5) working days of the date of discussion.
The wording of grievances may be changed or amended for the purpose of clarification at any time up to and including the third step of the grievance procedure.
FOURTH STEP
If the difference remains unresolved, then within one (1) calendar month of the date of the decision under the third step of the grievance procedure, and the grievance remaining outstanding, measures shall be taken under the procedure outlined in Article 5.
For the purpose of this section, the term "working days” shall not include Saturday, Sunday or any paid holiday referred to in Schedule “B”.
4.2	The Grievance Committee, comprised of regular employees of the Company who have attained seniority, shall be elected by the Union and the Company shall be kept informed of the employees on that committee. The number of employees on the Grievance Committee at the plant shall not exceed three (3).

4.4	The employee may be present if he/she so desires in any of the steps outlined in Section 4.1. Where the grievor is on a shift differing from that in which the grievance meeting is held, he/she will be paid, along with the Grievance Committee, at his/her regular job rate for time spent with plant management at such grievance meeting.
4.5	When a decision is reached under any one of the methods outlined in Section 4.1, such decision shall be final and binding and shall be retroactive to the date of the original submission in writing unless otherwise directed in such decision. If the grievance affects a rate of pay it shall be retroactive to the date it was first submitted in writing or if the cause of such grievance arose prior thereto, then the adjustment will be made retroactively to the date the error was made or such other period as may be agreed upon.
4.6	Except as provided under the first paragraph of Article 10, section 1, if an employee deems he/she has been unjustly suspended, unjustly discharged or unjustly laid off from the service of the Company, he/she shall submit his/her difference in writing through the Grievance Committee of the Union, within five (5) working days after date of separation, and the difference will be considered commencing at the second step of Section 1 of this Article, In the event of such employee being reinstated, he/she shall be paid for the period during which he/she has not worked as if he/she had not been suspended, discharged or laid off, subject to such adjustment as the settlement may determine.
4.7	Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union as to the meaning and application of the provisions of the Agreement, the question shall be taken up commencing at the third step of Section 4.1.
4.8	Pending settlement of a difference as outlined in Section 1 and 7 hereof, an aggrieved employee shall perform the duties assigned to him/her by the person in charge of the department, provided, however, where such duties ‘involve a transfer, reasonable consideration shall be given to ability and in the case of an immediate transfer, extreme changes in temperature. Where an employee has a question concerning his/her transfer and the department steward is not available for consultation, he/she will register the question with the foreperson. The foreperson will arrange to have the department steward discuss the matter with the employee within one (1) hour of such transfer.
4.9	Shop stewards and assistant shop stewards, all of whom shall be regular employees of the Company who have attained seniority, the number to be decided by negotiation between the Union and the Company, shall be elected by the Union and recognized by the Company. A list of all such stewards stating the department or groups each represents shall be supplied to the Company. The Company shall be advised immediately by the Union in writing of any change in this list. The assistant shop steward will act only when the shop steward is absent from the plant.
-5-
4.10	Before a steward, or an executive officer, (or a member of the Grievance Committee in case the grievance has reached the third step) leaves his/her job or his/her department, he/she shall first notify the person in charge of that department of the difference he/she wishes to investigate or process and shall then, within one (1) hour, be granted permission to leave. Should the Steward or executive officer of the Union go into any department, he/she shall first report to the person in charge of that department, provided that he/she is available, giving the difference he/she wishes to investigate or process.
4.11	If an employee is being interviewed privately by his/her foreperson about a matter that could result in his/her discharge or suspension, he/she may, if he/she desires, request that his/her department steward be present as a witness. If such interview is conducted by the Superintendent, or in his/her absence the Company’s designated representative, the employee may request the presence of the Chief Steward, or his/her designated representative, or the Assistant Chief Steward, or his/her department Steward as a witness. If the employee in question is the department steward, then he/she may request the presence of the Chief Steward or the President of the Local Union as the witness.
If an employee is discharged, suspended or issued a written reprimand, the Company shall notify the Union in writing within two (2) working days stating the reason for such discharge, suspension or reprimand.	.
4.12	No Cessation of Work
There shall be no strikes or lockouts during the term of this Agreement and thereafter while negotiations are under way for a renewal or extension thereof, and the Union and its members shall not during the aforementioned period authorize, call, encourage, support or take part in any strike, walkout, stoppage, slowing down or other cessation of work in or on the Company’s plant or property which shall in any way affect the operations of the Company.
The Union agrees that no strike vote of the members of the Local Union will be taken during the term of this Agreement.
The Union agrees that no strike vote of the members will be taken during the course of negotiations with the Company for renewal or extension of the Agreement until an attempt has been made in good faith to settle any differences arising in such negotiations by conciliation or some other form of mediation.
4.13	Employees who have developed a disciplinary record may have that record removed providing they are able to maintain a discipline free performance period of four (4) years from the point of their last disciplinary infraction. During this four (4) year period, the employee must have an eighty (80) percent attendance record in each of the years to qualify for amnesty.
ARTICLE 5 - ARBITRATION
5.1	Any disagreement, grievance or dispute arising under this Agreement which is not settled to the satisfaction of either the Union or the Company under the provisions of Article 4 shall, upon the written notice of either party, be submitted to an Arbitration Board, provided the grievance involves the interpretation or alleged violation of any
-6-
provision of this Agreement. The Arbitration Board shall consist of three (3) members, one of whom shall be nominated by the grieving party who will name its nominee to the Board no later than one (1) calendar week from the date of written notice of its intent to arbitrate the grievance, and one by the other party who will name its nominee within another calendar week, and a Chairperson to be selected by the two nominees no later than two (2) calendar weeks thereafter.

5.2	The matters and things to be considered and the decision rendered by such Board shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement.
5.3	It is agreed that neither the Company nor the Union will prevent the other party from referring a difference to arbitration to determine if the difference is arbitrable.

Changes contemplated in a gang schedule will be discussed with the Union before they are made and, where feasible, contemplated changes in the schedule for any individual will also be discussed.
8.3	The Company and the Union recognize that it may be necessary for employees to work in excess of their regular number of hours due to fluctuating livestock receipts and variable volume but the Company will limit the hours of work beyond such regular number of hours to what is reasonable.

When a meal is not furnished by the Company, a meal allowance of $5.00 will be paid in lieu.
8.8	Sunday Work
Double the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees for work performed on Sunday except where the work regularly falls on Sunday, in which latter case the employee shall be paid double the regular hourly rate if he/she works on his/her day off in lieu of Sunday. In the case of employees starting a night shift prior to midnight Sunday, the hours worked before midnight will not be considered as Sunday work as these hours are part of their Monday shift.
Where an employee’s scheduled days off do not include an actual Sunday. then the second day off shall be deemed to be his/her Sunday.
8.9	Employees, when called for work, shall be guaranteed four (4) hours pay for that day at the regular hourly rate. Employees who leave of their own accord when work is available will not receive this guaranteed minimum four (4) hours pay. Where less than four (4) hours work are regularly scheduled, such scheduled hours shall constitute the guarantee.
8.10	An employee shall not be required to work more than five (5) hours after the scheduled starting time without a lunch period, or more than two and one half (2/4) hours after the scheduled starting time without a fifteen (15) minute rest period, nor more than two and one half (214) hours after a lunch period without such rest period. An employee who works more than five (5) hours after the lunch period will be granted a further fifteen (15) minute rest period except where the Company furnishes a meal as provided under Section 7 of this Article.

8.11	During a mechanical breakdown, time shall continue to accumulate to an employee transferred temporarily to other work or instructed by his/her foreperson to wait on the premises of the Company.
8.12	The payment of overtime, holiday or Sunday rates in this Article 8 shall not be construed to require duplication of overtime, holiday or Sunday pay involving the same hours of work. More particularly, it is understood that no unforeseen or unexpected costs, above and beyond the actual premium rate provided for herein because of conflicting provisions elsewhere in the Collective Agreement will be incurred to the Company.
ARTICLE 9 - 37 HOURS PAY GUARANTEE
9.1	Based upon the present prevailing hours of work, as outlined in Article 8 hereof, if a regular employee’s weekly earnings, excluding overtime and night premium. do not amount to the equivalent of thirty-seven (37) hours pay at his/her job rate, hereinafter called the “guaranteed payment”, the Company shall make up the difference subject to the following provisions:
(a)	The provisions of Article 9 shall not apply to:
(i)	employees hired on a casual basis for such work as snow shovellers, wreckers, and
(ii)	employees discharged for cause, suspended, or voluntarily leaving the service of the Company.

11
(d)	For purposes of the 37 hours pay guarantee, if an employee does not perform the work assigned to him/her, the guaranteed payment for the payroll week in which such absence occurs shall be reduced by the number of hours he/she missed.
(e)	An employee who is employed after the first of the payroll week shall be guaranteed, for such week, that fraction of the guaranteed payment which the normal hours remaining of the payroll week are of forty (40) hours.
(f)	Employees on lay-off notice shall be entitled to their guaranteed payment for the week in which notice is given and should the notice extend into a subsequent week, then the guaranteed payment for such week shall be that fraction of thirty-seven (37) hours pay which the normal hours for those days of the notice occurring in such week are of forty (40).
(g)	Where the observance of a holiday other than any of the stipulated Paid Holidays, leaves less than thirty-seven (37) scheduled hours in the payroll week, the guaranteed payment shall be the number of scheduled hours available for work.
(h)	If only part of the employees in any gang receiving guarantee pay can be used on other work, they shall be entitled to any guarantee pay due their gang, plus whatever they earn on the other work, provided they have been present each work day and worked all hours as ordered.

Hours set out in Schedule “C” less three (3) hours for days apart from recognized Paid Holidays plus eight (8) hours for each such holiday in that week.
ARTICLE 10 - SENIORITY
10.1	Seniority is defined as the length of an employee’s service with the Company determined by inclusion on the plant payroll, referred to herein as "plant work”, provided however, that an employee will be on probation and not subject to the seniority provisions contained herein, until he/she has completed sixty-five (65) scheduled days of employment, on plant work, within a consecutive nine (9) month period and has received pay for each such day at least equal to the minimum provided under Article 8, section 9. Until a probationary employee has acquired seniority, he/she may be separated from the Company’s employ at any time without reference to the grievance procedure and the Company shall be under no obligation to rehire. Upon completion of such probationary period, the employee’s name will be placed on the seniority list. An employee’s service shall be calculated as the elapsed time from the date he/she was first employed on plant work, unless his/her seniority was broken, in which event the calculation shall be from the date he/she returned to plant work following the last break in seniority, subject to the following:
service in the capacity of foreperson or assistant foreperson prior to November 1, 1966, will be included in establishing an employee’s seniority date.
an employee returning to plant work from another part of the Company’s service will be credited with his/her previous service in plant work, notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Article relating to seniority.
On April 1st each year, the Company will issue a seniority list showing those persons who have attained seniority. The list shall be posted in conspicuous places throughout the plant, and a copy delivered to the Chief Steward, stewards and three (3) local officers at the plant, with a supplementary correction list each three (3) months thereafter. When an employee completes the probationary period and attains seniority, as defined under section 1 of this Article, the Union will be advised by the end of the payroll week next following.
10.2	The seniority of an employee shall be considered broken, all rights forfeited and there is no obligation to rehire when he/she:
(a)	voluntarily leaves the service of the Company or is discharged for cause;
(a)
(b)
(c)
or
- 13-
(b)	fails to return to work when called or cannot be located after a reasonable effort on the part of the Company. A registered letter directed to his/her last known address, with a copy to the Union, shall constitute reasonable effort on the part of the Company. The employee shall, within five (5) working days (if the address is in Lethbridge) or seven (7) days (if the address is outside Lethbridge) of the date of such notice, notify the Company with respect thereto and in such event, the employee shall return to work within a reasonable time to be determined by the Company and the Union.
(This clause shall not apply to work of a temporary nature of less than ten (10) days duration.)
(c)
In cases where it is necessary to secure workers in less time than the required notice, the Company, if unable to make contact with the senior eligible employee, may recall the next senior employee, and so on down the list, until the vacancies are filled. However, should the senior employee subsequently report within the required time, he/she shall be given the work for which the next senior employee was recalled; or
has been on lay-off for a period longer than the time allowed in the following schedule:
Length of Allowable Time Off Company Payroll
Length of Seniority at Date of Lay-off
Less than two years
Over two years

"Qualified” shall be interpreted to mean able to regularly perform the job without instruction or assistance. Except by agreement with the Union, the period of qualifying shall not exceed 6 weeks, after which the rate shall be paid. Prior to becoming qualified, a new employee or a recalled employee will be paid the Class 1 rate.
2.	When an employee regularly performs more than one job, he/she will be paid a rate calculated by taking the actual percentage of time worked on the highest rated job and the remaining percentage of time worked on the second highest rated job. When the two highest rated jobs are at the same rate, the employee will be paid the highest rate. Where an employee regularly performs 50% or more of his/her time on the highest rated job, the employee will be paid the highest rate.
3.	Permanent Transfer
Form 300 shall indicate a permanent transfer and a copy of same shall be given to the Chief Steward immediately after the employee is advised. If an employee is transferred permanently to work where the job rate is higher, he/she shall receive the higher rate when he/she becomes qualified, as defined in section 1 above. While an employee is attempting to qualify on a higher rated job, he/she will continue to be paid the rate of the job from which he/she transferred, not the Class 1 rate. If an employee is permanently transferred to work where the job rate is lower, such lower rate shall start twelve (12) weeks, including lay-off, after the date of such transfer.
The twelve (12) week period set out in the foregoing paragraph shall be extended one (1) day for each day the employee is required to return temporarily to his/her previous higher rated work. Where the employee returns temporarily to his/her previous higher rated work for a period in excess of three (3) consecutive weeks, the twelve (12) week period set out in the foregoing paragraph will recommence when the employee is again transferred to the work where the job rate is lower.
4.	T emporarv Transfer

The employee’s regular job rate (Form 300) shall apply immediately such temporary assignment ceases. Form 301 shall indicate a temporary transfer and a copy of same shall be given to the department steward. Where an employee is kept on the same temporary assignment for a period of three (3) months, the rate for such assignment shall be regarded as a permanent transfer under section 3 above.
5.	If an employee at his/her own request is transferred permanently from work where the job rate is higher, the lower rate shall prevail immediately upon transfer.

6.	Where an employee is transferred to work where the job rate is lower as a direct result of the introduction of new equipment or where an employee remains on a job reduced in value following a technological change, his/her rate shall not be reduced for a period of three (3) years, including lay-off, provided that the employee accepts all opportunities for transfer to work where the job rate is higher. Such employee will not be paid a rate greater than the rate paid at the time of transfer except for reasons of a general wage increase after the date of transfer.
7.	An employee whose schedule calls for work to commence at any time other than between 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. inclusive shall receive a night shift premium of thirty (30) cents per hour for all hours worked between 4 p.m. and 7 a.m., such premium to be continued for hours worked after 7 a.m. where the employee was entitled to the premium for hours immediately before 7 a.m. Such premium shall not be a part of his/her regular rate.

fifty cents (50^) per hour above his/her regular rate for the duration of the assignment. No group leader shall hire, lay off, suspend, discharge, exercise other discipline or except on direction from a member of management, transfer employees to other departments.
