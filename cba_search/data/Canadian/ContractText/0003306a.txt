Dear Sir:
This letter will confirm our understanding regarding the continuation of coverage for an employee who is off work due to lay-off or Leave of Absence
This Company’s interpretation shall be to the effect that, provided a prescribed course of treatment has commenced prior to the end of the month following the month in which lay-off or Leave of Absence has occurred, services provided under the prescribed course of treatment will be covered under the terms and benefits of the plan.
A course of treatment is defined as a planned program of one or more procedures or services, rendered by one or more dentists, for the correction of a dental condition diagnosed by the attending dentist as the result of an oral examination. The course of treatment begins on the date a dentist first renders treatment to correct the diagnosed denial condition. (It should be remembered that whenever the charges of a dentist for a proposed course of treatment are expected to be $200.00 or more, the treatment program must be filed (through use of the normal claim form) with the Company prior to the commencement of the course of treatment.)
