6.01A Schedule "A" wage rates and job classifications are guaranteed only until piece rates are established.
6.02	The Company may, at its discretion and in lieu of sending an employee home at any time, assign such employee who is waiting for work to another operation. The compensation for such work done in the case of of an hourly worker shall be his standard hourly rate as long as due diligence is maintained.

6.02A	In the event that the employee requests an operation in lieu of
going home, he shall be compensated by 80 percent of his quarterly average or piece-rate earnings on the operation, whichever is greater.

March, April, May,
June, July, August,
September, October, November.
8
6.03
6.04
The quarterly average is computed by the payroll department and is arrived at by dividing an employee's regular pay by the number of hours worked.
For example:
160 hours at $6.50 per hour 160 hours at $6.25 per hour 80 hours at $6.35 per hour 40 hours at $6.55 per hour 40 hours at $6.00 per hour
$1040.00 $1000.00 $508.00 $262.00 $240.00
480
$3050.00
Therefore, $3050.00 divided by 480 hours equals $6.35 per hour. The operator's quarterly average of $6.35 per hour will be used during the next quarter as a base for computation of Excess and Waiting time and Holiday pay. Make-up pay will not be used as part of the gross earnings for the computation of quarterly averages.

emergencies, discuss the proposal at least one (1) week before the day fixed for the institution of such change. The Company will furnish all information, which is necessary for a complete understanding of the proposed change. The parties referred to above shall mean any two (2) of the following officers, President, Vice-President, Secretary-Treasurer, or Steward of the department involved.

(b)	If there is any question as to the equity of the changes in tasks, work assignments or new incentive rates, a trial period not exceeding fifteen (15) working days shall be instituted in order to give fair trial to such tasks or work assignments or incentive rates.

(c)	No worker shall receive assistance during the trial period which he would not normally receive.
(d)	During the trial period referred to in (b) above, the
employee shall be paid on the basis of his new incentive rate, provided that any increase in the said rates arising by mutual agreement between the parties out of negotiations referred to above, or resulting from the decisions of the Arbitrator, will be made retroactive to the date that the new rates were made effective.
(e)	It is agreed that the Union Engineer shall have access to the plant for the purpose of time studying any operation in question. Complete background data for thorough knowledge of the job, will be supplied by the Company. It is further agreed that completed time studies of both parties will be exchanged concurrently.
(f)	The Company agrees that, if piece-work rates are adjusted, then incumbent employees in the job so effected will not lose earnings as a result, unless the change in job content of the operation amounts to five (5) percent or more. The Union agrees that, if a piecework rate is adjusted due to a change in methods, process, materials, conditions or mathematical error, and such change amounts to five percent (5) change or more, then incumbent employees shall be paid at the new piecework rate established as a result of such change.

Thereafter, employees will be laid off in the inverse order in which their names appear on the seniority list, provided the employees who remain because of greater seniority are able and willing to perform whatever work is available, and further provided that they can perform the job provided without make-up after an appropriate training period.
Exceptions to the aforementioned seniority rules shall be in the case of the Union Committee who shall, in the event of a lay-off, be continued at work regardless of their position on the seniority list, provided any of the employees in their respective departments are still employed in that department. This is provided also that the Union official concerned is willing and able to carry out whatever work is then available. The Union committee shall consist of the President,
Secretary-Treasurer.

(a)	voluntarily quits the employ of the Company,
(b)	is discharged by the Company and such discharge is not reversed through the grievance procedure,

Letter Of Intent between Local 1903
UNITE and HATHAWAY	November 30, 1993
Prescott, Ont.
LAY OFF PROCEDURE
Lay-offs will be done in reverse order of the plant seniority list in groups. Following this , the Company will look at individual jobs. Any job that is overstaffed will then have the junior employee on the job moved to a needed area. A suitable and fair familiarization period will be agreed upon for each change.
Recalls will be governed by groups, but individual recalls will not necessarily be in exact order. However, all employees in a lay-off group will be recalled before employees in a prior group. But in no case will an employee be laid off out of seniority for more than a one (1) month period.
It is understood that an employee who is moved under the above provisions will return to his original job as soon as production requirements warrant.
For lay-offs of less than a full shift, seniority will not be considered.
For lay-offs of three consecutive days or less, it is agreed that short time will be shared equally among the employees on the job in question.
37
The Company recognizes the principles of seniority and recognizes that it is difficult to develop rules which would, in every instance, be fair both to the employee and the Company. Therefore, it is agreed that whenever situations arise on a job which may not be readily answered by the above, the Company and the Union will meet to resolve the problem. Every effort will be made to arrive at an agreement, but if a mutual agreement is not concluded, then seniority shall prevail.
