In week two of the scheduling, the next four (4) senior employees will be approached in the first three days of this week regarding theirvacation preference and they must indicate their preference in the remaining two days (Thursday, Friday) of the same week or be placed at the end of the list. The process continues until all employees have had the opportunity to make a selection. If any employee is absent, unavailable and/or cannot be contacted, he will be placed at the end of the list as if he did not make a selection in his applicable week. After all employees have had the opportunity to make a selection, the relevant articles will apply.
Employees who have not exercised their right during their week, may exercise their right at any time as long as they do not interfere with anyone who has exercised their preference.
The parties agree that they may jointly waive this letter during the life of the agreement in the event that the parties cannot accept its application.
