Pyramiding
14.11	Payment of overtime work shall be made as in 14.09 or 14.10, whichever gives the employee the greatest pay. There shall be no duplication of weekly and daily overtime nor pyramiding of overtime on overtime.

- 62 -
Article 14.15c) - Overtime Distribution
employee within the department will be asked to work, based upon the balance of overtime.
d)	Overtime that occurs because the job carries over the regular shift will first be offered to the employees who worked on the job. If they decline, then any qualified employee within the department will be asked to work, based upon the balance of overtime.
e)	If the Company errs and an employee from the wrong classification works overtime, the Company will allow the overlooked employee to work the missed time at overtime rates at a time convenient to the employee, unless the time chosen is totally impractical to the Company. The work assigned as work-in-kind will not be work that would normally result in a different employee being asked to work overtime; i.e., the work-in-kind will not cause another employee to miss an overtime opportunity.
f)	This Article does not assume that each employee sharing overtime within a particular area and shift will, at any given time, have worked the same number of overtime hours but merely expresses the policy of the Company to keep overtime as nearly in balance as is practicable.
g) If an employee is absent from work for one or more days during the employee’s regular schedule, the Company will not be obliged to call that employee for overtime work on his or her next scheduled days off. For the purposes of determining whether an employee will be called,

Lists
14.16	Up-to-date lists showing how overtime has been allocated within the particular group in the area on the shift shall be maintained by the Company and shall be posted. If an employee refuses the opportunity of working an overtime assignment, it will be considered as an overtime opportunity worked and so recorded.
The recording of overtime worked shall be done utilizing a “moving twelve-month time frame” with the thirteenth month dropping off as a new month is added.
The Company will furnish to the Union a copy of the overtime list as posted.
Maintenance of Balance of Overtime
14.17	If a balance of the overtime hours worked among a group which normally shares overtime work is not properly maintained because of improper allocation and a grievance is filed, and as a result an employee’(s’)
- 64 -

Callout

Employees called out shall not be required to perform routine work after they have completed the work for which they were originally called out, except that they may be required to perform emergency work consistent with their skills and arising during the period of the callout.
In the event an employee on a callout actually works four (4) hours or more in the eight- (8) hour rest period immediately preceding the start of their next shift, they shall have the starting time of their next shift adjusted to provide for eight (8) hours’ rest, after which they will receive a normal day’s pay.
Should the callout require the employee to work up to the start of their next regular shift, they will be permitted to remain at work at straight-time rates until they have accumulated the balance of hours normally worked on a regular shift (i.e., 8, 10 or 12 hours). The employee will then be allowed to go home but will be paid at straight-time rates for the remainder of their regular shift.
Day shift employees who are called out to work between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. and who do not
- 65 -
Article 14.18 - Callout
receive eight (8) hours’ rest prior to the start of their next shift will be allowed to remain at rest for eight (8) hours. Employees will then be required to work the remainder of the next scheduled shift; and if they complete the shift, they will be paid for the full shift.
In the event an employee is required to return to work for one (1) hour or less after receiving eight (8) hours’ rest as referred to above, they shall be allowed to work the period of one (1) hour or less at straight-time rates at the beginning of their next scheduled shift. An employee who has worked sixteen (16) hours in the previous twenty-four (24) hour period will be granted their next scheduled shift off with pay at their regular straight-time rate.

APPENDIX C
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
A)	Purpose
The purpose of the Program is to provide a means of training and developing tradespersons of the highest calibre for Mosaic Potash Esterhazy, further to provide environment and incentive that will assist employees to achieve their maximum potential.
The Program is recognized as requiring the active participation of the Parties, the employee and various levels of government.
B)	Coverage
The Program will cover trades designated as necessary or advisable by the Company.
The number of apprentices required for each trade and number of apprentices at each level within each trade shall be determined by the Company. The Company will inform the Union of changes in the number of apprentices at each level of each trade. However, once an employee is accepted in the Program, they will be allowed to progress through the full apprenticeship subject to the provisions of this Program or the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
C)	General
1)	Standards for entry in the Program shall be determined by the Company in accordance with the provisions of
- 130 -
Apprenticeship Program
Article 9. Employees who already possess a trade certificate in a job classification listed in Appendix A will not be considered for apprenticeship postings.
Any interviews or examinations in relation to an employee's entry into the Apprenticeship Program or interviews while in the Program will be done on company time with no loss of pay. Any preliminary tests conducted by the Company shall only be in relation to the employee's aptitude for their particular trade. The Union may have a representative to peruse the content of the type of tests used.
2)	The Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission shall determine at what level an applicant fits into the Apprenticeship Program and that is the level at which an applicant will be placed.
3)	The Company and each accepted applicant shall sign an apprenticeship contract in the form provided by the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission.
4)	Employees in the Maintenance Department not participating in the Apprenticeship Program will not be denied promotion, laid off or terminated as a result of the Company posting for an opening in the Apprenticeship Program.
An employee bidding into the Apprenticeship Program in a trade currently being held by said employee shall retain their rate if it is higher until their apprenticeship rate surpasses it, at which time they shall progress to the higher rate.
- 131 -
Apprenticeship Program
In the event a maintenance employee enters into the Apprenticeship Program and is subsequently removed from the Program in accordance with this Agreement and their apprenticeship rate is higher than their rate prior to bidding, the employee will revert back to their old job title and applicable rate of pay.
5)	Employees accepted into the Program will enter into an apprenticeship probationary agreement with the Company for a period of six (6) months. This agreement will be registered with the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission.
If at the end of the six- (6) month apprenticeship probationary period both the employee and the Company are satisfied to continue the agreement of apprenticeship, a contract or indenture will be made and registered with the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission.
The six- (6) month period shall start at the time the employee is transferred into the Program. However, the transfer must take place within thirty (30) calendar days after being awarded the job.

INDIVIDUAL SECURITY ACCOUNT PLAN (ISAP)
1.	Purpose
The Individual Security Account Plan (ISAP) is designed to assist employees of the Company during times of layoff to allow them to withdraw from their ISAP Account a weekly amount that would supplement their Employment Insurance benefits. The Plan will also allow the employee to contribute to a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) or a spousal RRSP.
2.	Contributions
Each employee shall contribute One Dollar ($1.00) for all hours paid (exclusive of overtime), and the Company shall match the contribution made by the employee. The ISAP Account of each employee shall accumulate until a minimum of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) is established. After each employee account reaches the $1,500 level, contributions to the ISAP Account shall be placed in a RRSP or a spousal RRSP.
Contributions from the employee will be by payroll deduction each pay period and will be matched by the Company on the same basis. No part of the Company's contribution under the Plan shall be recoverable by the Company. Company contributions to ISAP will be remitted to the Plan Administrator on a pre-tax basis.
- 137 -
Individual Security Account Plan (ISAP)
Employees will be allowed to contribute amounts over and
above the matched contributions.
3.	Plan Administrator
a)	All contributions to each employee's ISAP Account will be paid to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator will hold such contributions and interest earned thereon in an account subdivided by employee basic contribution, employee voluntary contribution, employee transferred contribution and employer contribution for the exclusive benefit of each employee.
b)	The Plan Administrator may invest funds. Funds in the ISAP Account may be commingled with each other and with those under any similar plan or plans and treated as a consolidated fund for investment purposes.
c)	The Plan Administrator shall credit net earnings from such investments to the employee's ISAP Account in proportion to the balance in their account from time to time as interest is allocated.
d)	The Plan Administrator, or its duly authorized agent, shall manage and administer the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the right to use the Company or any of its employees as its agent. In addition to the powers and duties specified in the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall have such powers and duties as may be provided in the Agreement.

b)	Requests for payments by eligible employees from the ISAP Account shall be made to the Plan Administrator in writing, on the prescribed form. Each payment shall be in an amount of One Hundred Dollars ($100) for each week of benefit, unless the balance remaining in the employee's ISAP Account is less than One Hundred Dollars ($100). The benefit of One Hundred Dollars ($100) shall constitute one week of supplementary
- 139 -
Individual Security Account Plan (ISAP)
benefit to Employment Insurance and the benefit shall be paid every second week.
c)	An employee shall be an "eligible employee" only if they are a full-time, active employee on the day prior to the layoff taking place or are otherwise entitled to receive Employment Insurance benefits (E.I.) due to disability insurance expiring during the term of their layoff period.
6.	Payout of ISAP Accounts
All funds in an employee's ISAP Account shall be paid upon request:
a)	to the employee upon retirement,
b)	to the employee in the event of their employment being terminated or
c)	upon the employee's death, to the beneficiary named in the written designation filed with the Plan Administrator prior to payment or if no such designation is in effect, to the employee's estate.
d)	if an employee has been on LTD benefits for a period greater than twenty-four (24) months and/or is not expected to ever return to work as confirmed in writing by the employee's doctor. This would apply to any employee who has no "earned income" for the periods stated above. This would not apply to any employee on short-term disability.

10-HOUR SHIFTS
The Parties agree that some employees of the Company may change to a ten- (10) hour day shift workday, 4 shifts per week to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week. Requests will be handled on a “by department” basis.
The normal hours of work shall be 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday to Thursday or Tuesday to Friday inclusive. Shift schedules for each group participating in the ten- (10) hour shift program will be mutually agreed to by the Parties prior to their implementation. Any other change of shift will fall under Article 14.07.
The Parties recognize that the ten- (10) hour day shift is a preferred shift schedule that does not include working on Sunday. Therefore, shift differential for these employees will exclude compensation for a Sunday premium. The shift differential will be a premium of 3.5 percent of the journeyperson rate of pay for hours 9 and 10 of each day. For employees working any ten- (10) hour shift schedule other than a ten- (10) hour day shift schedule, the normal Article 15 provision for shift premium will apply for all hours worked outside of 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
Special time off with pay will be granted in accordance with Article 20.01. As per Article 21.01, a ten- (10) hour employee who has accumulated paid sick leave may reserve the last forty (40) hours of accumulated paid sick leave to be used at a later date.
As per Article 14.18, this callout provision will apply to a total of 10 hours worked.

RE: MOSAIC/LONG-TERM CONTRACTOR WORK IN THE SR/AE INFLOW CONTROL AREA
The purpose of this Letter of Understanding is to outline the agreement between the Parties regarding how the work in the Brine Inflow Control area will be distributed between Mosaic and long-term contractor personnel.
The Parties agree that:
Managing and controlling the Inflow areas are critical to the ongoing success of the mine. The Inflow areas can change quickly and without notice so quick response time by Mosaic employees and long-term contractor personnel is very important. To ensure employees can respond quickly, work tasks in the Brine Inflow Control areas will be distributed in accordance with the scope of the work required.
Mosaic Employee Responsibility
1.	Beach pumping operation, maintenance, and installation including pump boxes to final destination.
2.	High pressure pumping operation and maintenance.
3.	Rehabilitation of main entries.
4.	Ground control of main entries.
5.	Maintenance of Mosaic mobile equipment.
6.	Mechanical maintenance and installation of pumping, compressors and piping.
7.	Electrical maintenance including power distribution to 5KV sleds in inflow area. Installation of messenger cable.
8.	Muck generated by Mosaic will be hauled by Mosaic.
9.	Installation of inhibitor pumps and tanks.
10.	Material movement from shaft staging.
It is understood Mosaic may require the use of short-term contractors in accordance with Article 25 of the CBA.
- 157 -
LOU - Mosaic/Long-Term Contractor Work in the Inflow Control Area
Long-Term Contractor Responsibility
1.	Back Fill - Includes surface, grout lines, back fill wells.
2.	Mine drilling to gain cavern access.
3.	Rehabilitation of non main entries.
4.	Ground control of non main entries.
5.	Submersible pumps not including those in main travel ways.
6.	Muck generated by long-term contractor will be hauled by long-term contractor.
7.	Blasting.
8.	Operation of inhibitor pumps in non main travel ways.
Should the long-term contractor be required to perform work outside the Inflow area where their expertise is required, they will be treated as a short-term contractor. Some examples may include coring, grouting, and blasting.
If the scope of the work for Mosaic employees and/or long-term contractor employees changes, the Company and Union Executive will meet to determine the appropriate and fair course of action at the request of either Party.
In the event there is an emergency situation that threatens the continued operation of the mine, it is understood that both Mosaic employees and long-term contractor personnel may perform work beyond the responsibilities outlined in this Letter of Understanding.
This Letter will remain in effect for the balance of the term of the current Collective Agreement and is renewable unless agreed otherwise by the Parties.
