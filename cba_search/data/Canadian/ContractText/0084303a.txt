LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
June 19, 1990
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union AFL-CIO-CLC,
Local 720T,
South Western Ontario Textile Joint Board.
Attention: Mr. N. Younger
C,C. Rita Henderson Dear Mr, Younger:
Re: Letter of Understanding for the Contract Period June 1, 1990 to June 1, 1993
The Company will continue the pension plan and amend the pension plan document to include the changes as set out in article 14,05 of the Union Agreement.
The Company will pay the minimum of Past Service spread payments and Current Service cost payments (percent of Employee Contributions) as set out in the triennial actuarial report. However, as permitted by the Law, the Company may supplement these minimum payments up to the total Past Service liability outstanding at any time.
Accordingly, there is scope to contribute greater amounts to the Plan each year and to leave the Par Bonus and Non-Vested Termination Credits in the Fund. The actuarial valuation, every three years, will eventually reveal the time when the agreed deposits, set out below, will exceed the maximum required deposits allowed by the Law at which time the plan benefits (after discussion
- 49 -
with the Union) will be retroactively improved, in order to allow contributions to remain at the agreed level.
The cost for administration of the Plan will be paid from the Fund.
The Company will contribute, to the Fund as follows: The Company currently pays:
(i)	8.9% of regular pay-roll (which includes 3,5 % from the Employee)
(ii)	plus $15,000 per annum for early retirement
(iii)	plus $8,670 per annum for past service upgrade. The Company’s present contribution can be translated
into percentages as follows:
Pension cost 8.9% minus 3,5% from
the employee	=	5.4%
$15,000 per annum as a percent of
pay-roll	=	0.9%
$8,670 per annum as a percent of
pay-roll	=	0,5%
Company Contribution as a percent of pay-roll for the years 1989 and 1990 is = 6.8%
or (6.8%/3.5%) 186% of employee pay-roll deductions.
In 1991 the pension funding will be changed to comply with the new pension legislation at an increase in cost to the Company of	0.6%
Company contribution to the pension
plan in 1991 will be	7.4%
The Employee contributions remain at 3.5% of pay-roll.
50
'Therefore the Company contributions to the plan for 1991 will be (7.4%/3.5%) 211% of the Employee pay-roll deductions.
In 1992 the pension plan will be improved by providing the option for each employee to elect early retirement when the combined factors of age 60 and 30 years of service are reached with no reduction in the pension then payable by the early retirement factors.
The cost, as a percentage of pay-roll,
for this improvement as determined by
the actuary is	1.2%
Company contribution to the pension
plan is:	8.6%
Therefore the Company contributions to the plan for 1992 and 1993 will be (8.6%/3.5%) 246% of the Employee pay-roll deductions.
The Employee contributions remain at 3.5% of pay-roll.
The Company agrees to continue to contribute to the pension plan at this level until December 1993. It should be noted that the current Union Agreement is open to negotiations in May 1993.
