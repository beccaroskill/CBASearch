TWELVE HOUR SHIFT SCHEDULE Hours of Work and Overtime
Work shall be scheduled for the 12-hour shift schedule as per the attached schedule. The Company reserves the right, asperArticle 2,01 ofthe Collective Agreement, to change the 12-hour shift schedule if it deems it is not suitable or is otherwise adversely affecting production.
For the purposes of computing overtime, only those authorized hours worked in excess of 1 2 hours in any one day or 80 hours in a two weeks schedule (averaged over the cycle of the schedule) shall be considered as overtime. Clauses in the Collective Agreement relating to this area shall be suspended for those employees affected by 12-hour shifts while they are in effect.
It is specifically understood that hours paid in accordance with the requirements of the statutory holiday schedule of the Collective Agreement shall not be considered as time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime.
Shift and Sunday Premium
A weighted average shift premium would be calculated for the nightshift, based on the existing (current) shift premiums.
Employees on the dayshift (7a.m. to 7 p.m.) would not receive any shift premium. Employees on the nightshift (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) would receive 70 cents/hour for every hour worked on that shift.
Sunday premiums will continue to be paid as per Article 11.1 6 of the Collective Agreement. At
54
present, this is an additional 95 cents/hour for each hour worked at the employee's basic rate of pay. This is in addition to any shift differential applicable.
Both Sunday and shiftpremiumscontinueto apply only to non-overtime shifts.
Meal Periods
There will be twoone-half hour meal periods during each 12-hour shift, to be scheduled no more than five hours apart. As per Article 11.08 of the Collective Agreement, the lunch period for employees on continuous operation will be on Company time, while employees on steady dayshift will have their lunch period on their own time.

12.02	of the Collective Agreement.
ii)	Where an employee's regular scheduled 1 2-hour shift falls on a statutory holiday as listed in Article 1 2.01, and he is not required to work his shift, he shall be paid 8 hours straight time provided all other requirements are met.
iii)	Where the employee's regular scheduled 12-hour shift falls on a statutory holiday as listed in Article 1 2.01 and he is required to work his shift, he shall be paid at two times his basic rate for all hours worked on that shift in addition to 8 hours pay at straight time.

Vacations
