period of time (However, the Company agrees that they shall not use contractors if it is possible to utilize laid off employees.)
L
iii)	on jobs that involve detailed mechanical or electrical repairs of major importance requiring warranties
iv)	on jobs of an emergency nature where qualified bargaining unit employees are not available.
The Company will discuss with the Union the intent to use contractors per the above, unless an emergency situation exists precluding that.
NO DISCRIMINATION

ARTICLE IV UNION SECURITY
MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP
4.1	All employees of the Company covered by this Agreement as set out in Article 2.1(a) shall as a condition of employment, become and remain a member in good standing of the Union for the duration of this Agreement.
CHECK-OFF OF UNION DUES
4.2	The Company will deduct from all wages due each employee such bi-monthly Union membership dues as are levied on all members of the Union. Each such deduction shall be for the then two week period and shall be in the amount from time to time fixed in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union and certified to the Company by the Secretary of the Local Union as being so fixed. The Company will also deduct, once only and together with the first deduction of Union dues, the amount of the Union Initiation fee, if any, payable by any such employee, and as certified by the Secretary Treasurer of the Local Union.
4.3	The Company shall remit the Union dues deducted on or before the last day of each month to the Secretary Treasurer of the Local Union whose receipt therefore shall constitute full and complete discharge of the Company for the amount so deducted and remitted. Each such remittance shall be accompanied by a list of the names of the employees from whose pay such deductions were made along with the amount deducted for that month and the accumulated total to that date. The Company will provide on each individual employee’s T-4 slip, the total amount of Union dues deductions for the calendar year.
4.4	If the wages due any employee in any week are insufficient to permit the deduction of the full amount of the Union dues for such week after providing for any and all other deductions required by law or authorized by the employee in writing, no Union dues

The employee is responsible to pay full dues for the month in any month in which the employee works five (5) days [vacation shall be considered as days worked for the purpose of dues deduction), however, an employee working less than five (5) days in any month shall not be required to pay dues for that month.
ARTICLE V
HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
5.1	This Article is intended to define the normal hours of work and shall not be construed either as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week or as a restriction on the scheduling of a longer or shorter work week whenever necessary to meet business requirements. The parties to this Agreement jointly recognize that it is undesirable for an employee to work in excess of sixteen continuous hours. Both parties agree to work toward that goal, but both also realize that in certain extreme circumstances the sixteen hour maximum situation may not be attainable.

SHIFTWORKERS - HOURS OF WORK
5.7	The normal work day for shift workers shall be eight (8) consecutive hours which shall include a thirty (30) minute lunch
7
period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled within a one and one-half (1-1/2) hour period at the middle of the shift. The normal work day for twelve hour shift workers shall be twelve (12) consecutive hours which shall include a thirty (30) minute lunch period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled within a one and one-half (1-1/2) hour period approximately five (5) hours into the shift and a fifteen (15) minute lunch period on Company time, to be taken so that a minimum of interference to production requirements will result but to be scheduled sometime after eight (8) hours into the shift.

schedules in the same pattern as the Twelve Hour Shift Schedule. The parties may implement a schedule which is not identical to the existing schedule, however, such schedule will be similar in pattern to it. The Company or the Union may, upon giving thirty (30) days written notice, terminate the application of the schedule in which case, the parties agree that a schedule that complies with the provisions of the basic agreement or a schedule that is agreed to by the parties, will be implemented. The implementation or termination of the schedule shall not result in the payment of overtime hours or any other premiums which would otherwise be applicable.
OVERTIME PAYMENT
5.10	Overtime will be paid for all time worked by employees outside of their regular scheduled hours of work, except when such time is worked because the employee, with the consent of the foreman in charge, exchanges shifts with another employee for personal convenience. Payments will be made at the double time rate for all overtime.
5.11	Employees working shift schedules as provided for in Article 5.9 shall receive the double time rate for the normal hours worked on the sixth day of the normal scheduled work week providing they have worked or were legitimately absent for the balance of the scheduled work week. Employees working the twelve hour shift schedule as provided for in Article 5.9 shall receive the double time rate for the normal hours worked on the last scheduled eight (8) hour period in the scheduled forty-eight (48) hour work week (which occurs once in every four (4) week cycle) providing they have worked or were legitimately absent for the balance of the scheduled work week. Such employees shall receive standard overtime premiums for all time worked outside of their regular scheduled hours of work.
10
DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
5.12	The Company and the Union jointly recognize both the desirability of keeping overtime to a minimum and the fact that all employees should work their fair share of overtime that is required. All overtime is voluntary except the sixth shift as provided in Section 5.9 and employees of regular continuous operating jobs must remain on the job until relieved or a substitute provided.
Subject to the above, employees may apply to waive their availability for overtime, Each overtime waiver will be for a specific six (6) month period (January 1 through June 30 OR July 1 through December 31). At the end of the waiver period, the employees will automatically be considered available for overtime unless they submit another overtime waiver. If the waiver period is January 1 through June 30 and they become available for overtime again on July 1, their overtime standing will reflect the average of those in the department who have their relative qualifications.
OVERTIME ROSTERS
5.13	The Company will maintain the following overtime rosters and post same for information purposes for the employees:
Quarry & Screenline Department
Pulverized Limestone Department
Lime Kiln Department - Centre
Lime Kiln Department - West
Hydrator / Lime Kiln Department - East
Maintenance Department
Environmental Department
Garage Personnel
11
Stores Department Laboratory Department Production Helpers
a)	Ail overtime worked will be recorded on the overtime roster based on the hours worked for the assignment.
b)	All overtime refused will be recorded on the overtime roster based on two (2) times the hours worked for the assignment.
c)	Any personnel working under Article 5.9 shall not count their sixth day in any week as overtime for the purposes of overtime roster records.
d)	Any personnel required to work on a holiday as part of their regular work schedule shall not count hours worked on said holiday as overtime for purposes of overtime roster records.
e)	Any personnel working under Article 5.9 and requested to work overtime on their “long weekend” or “Saturday / Sunday weekend, shall not have overtime refusals during this period marked as refusals for the purposes of the overtime roster.
f)	Overtime rosters will be updated twice weekly, normally each Tuesday and Friday.
g)	Employees who are returning from a prolonged approved absence (excludingvacations other than the special ten week vacation) in excess of two (2) weeks will have their roster standing adjusted to the same position, in relation to those in the department commensurate with their qualifications, as existed prior to the absence.
h)	Employees who transfer permanently to another department will assume the average overtime standing of the group, commensurate with their qualifications, on the first day of their transfer.
12
DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME
5.14	Overtime will be distributed as equally as possible amongst qualified employees, who want to work overtime at the time the overtime work is required. Equitable distribution of overtime over the calendar year is the goal. Both parties realize that flexibility is also desirable and that overtime standings may vary because some departments incur more overtime than others and because some employees, by virtue of their qualifications, have access to more overtime than others. At the end of the calendar year any unjustifiable variation in overtime standing may result in a grievance being successful.
1.	Maintenance Work - Overtime in the Maintenance Department shall be offered initially to maintenance personnel who are qualified in the trade required; if more personnel are required it will be offered first to other qualified employees of the Maintenance Department, then to qualified employees in the department in which the overtime is being performed and then to all other qualified employees.
2.	Production Woik - Production overtime required in any department will be first offered to qualified employees of that department, then to all other qualified employees.
3.	Personnel on Assignment - Personnel on weekly assignment to other departments will carry their total overtime hours with them to that department and will be deemed employees of that department for overtime purposes from the start of that week as defined in Article 5.2. Personnel assigned on a daily basis will carry their total overtime hours with them to that department and will be deemed employees of that department for overtime purposes; however, once personnel assigned on a daily basis have completed their scheduled shift and clocked out, their overtime eligibility reverts to their normal department. New
13
employees will be credited with the average hours of overtime of employees in the department to which they are assigned on their first working day.
4. As a blanket rale in the allocation of overtime, once a determination has been made as to department and qualifications, the qualified employee (per the Qualified Personnel Listing) with the least amount of overtime on the roster is the first to be asked and the progression is upward from there. Copies of overtime requests will be sent to the Recording Secretary of the Union twice monthly. There are permissible exceptions to the blanket rule to which both the Company and the Union have agreed, as follows:
a)	Absent Employees - Employees who are off for the following reasons are not eligible for overtime, should not be called and should not have refusals marked against them.
a)	Sickness (Weekly Indemnity or L.T.D.)
b)	W.C.B, cases
c)	Vacation
d)	Leave of absence (excused absence)
e)	Disciplinary suspension
f)	Maintenance apprenticeship schooling (These employees are not available for overtime on weekdays but have access to overtime on weekends and holidays.)
b)	Casual Overtime - Some overtime instances of relative short duration may be handled by keeping crewing over and not allocation per the overtime roster.
14
(e.g. The Quarry and Screenline crews on #3 shift may stay over for a couple of hours to get out extra production or resolve an operating problem.)
c)	Job Completion - Should an employee be performing a job prior to the regular quitting time and overtime is required to complete such a job, the Company may request such employee to remain for overtime work without regard to that employee’s relative status on the roster
d)	Twelve Hour Shifts - Employees should not be asked to work overtime if it would result in their working in excess of sixteen (16) consecutive hours or in excess of four (4) consecutive days of twelve (12) hour shifts.
5. If the Company makes an error in overtime distribution to an employee outside of the department, the grieving department employee will be given an opportunity for an in-kind remedy (an opportunity to work the same amount of overtime) in the next thirty (30) days. If the opportunity is not convenient for the employee, then another opportunity will be given during this thirty (30) day period. If the second opportunity is declined, the whole issue comes to an end. Should the Company fail to offer the in-kind remedy, the grieving department employee will be paid an amount equivalent to the number of overtime hours misallocated.
EXCHANGE OF SHIFTS
5.15 Employees wishing to exchange shifts for reasons of personal convenience shall request approval of their supervisor(s) for such exchange as far in advance thereof as possible. No overtime payment or other penalty shall be incurred by the Company as a result of any such exchange of shifts by employees. The Company will maintain a file of and copy the Union on, all shift exchanges that are not completed within the same pay period and
15
subsequently will copy the Union on the completion of those shift exchanges.
OVERTIME LUNCH PERIODS
5.16	Employees who work one and one-half (1-1/2) or more hours overtime before their regular starting time or after their regular quitting time shall be paid a lunch allowance of nine dollars ($9.00) in cash. In the event employees work more than fourteen (14) continuous hours (more than eighteen (18) continuous hours, in the case of a twelve hour shift worker), a second meal allowance shall be paid. Should employees request and be allowed to leave the plant, they shall not be entitled to a meal allowance. Should employees be requested to work their normal daily work period on a Saturday and / or Sunday for any reason, no overtime lunch allowance will be paid unless such employees work one and one-half (1-1/2) or more hours before their scheduled starting time or after their scheduled quitting time on such days.
REPORTING PAY
5.17	Employees who report for work in accordance with their assigned weekly schedule or scheduled overtime hours shall be given a minimum of four (4)hours work on the day in question or if no work can be provided on the day in question they shall be entitled to payment for the lesser of their scheduled hours or four (4)hours at their assigned rate unless they have been previously notified by the Company not to report to work for the shift in question.
5.18	It is the responsibility of employees to keep the Company informed of their current address and telephone number, or of a telephone through which contact can be made. The Company will not be liable for any penalty arising from employees’ failure to fulfill their obligations.
16
EMERGENCY CALL-INS
5.19	An emergency call-in is defined as any work outside of employees’ regular scheduled hours of work, which requires them to report to work as soon as possible after being called, and of which they were not notified before last leaving (i.e. clocking out) the Company’s premises.
5.20	Employees who are called in for emergency work shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at double time rate for performance of such emergency work. Such minimum allowance shall be paid whether or not an employee’s regular work day commences before the expiration of two (2) hours after call-in. If maintenance employees on emergency call-in are required to perform work on a second emergency, unrelated to the first emergency, which occurs while they are at the plant and of which they were not notified at the time of the initial call-in, the first call-in shall be considered over at the time they commence work on the second emergency. They shall then be considered as being on, and paid at the rate of, overtime in accordance with Article 5.10,
5.21	Employees who are called in for emergency work shall be paid at double time rate. Employees will be paid one (1) overtime meal allowance if they are called in for emergency work, report to work within a two (2) hour period of notification and are required to remain at work for more than three (3) hours.
5.22	When employees are called in for emergency work, they will punch “in” upon arrival at the plant and the premium rates described herein shall be payable from the time so recorded.
CHANGES IN WORKING SCHEDULES
5.23	It is recognized that variations in business or other conditions may necessitate changes in normal work periods, starting and quitting times, length of work day or work week, movement of jobs from one schedule to another. The Company will advise the Union of any such change before placing it into
17
effect. A meeting will be held to discuss the matter if requested by either party.
5.24	Final weekly work schedules shall be posted no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Friday prior to the effective date of the schedule. If employees’ schedules are changed subsequent to the above time, they will be given at least forty-eight (48) hours notice; in the event that they do not receive forty-eight (48) hours notice, they will be paid a premium of four (4) hours at their base rate of pay for the first period of continuous hours worked after such change of schedule. Their entitlement to the premiums listed in Articles 12.10(a) and 12.10(b) will not be affected by this premium.
5.25	Where employees have to work two (2) consecutive regular scheduled shifts, they shall be paid at double time for the second such shift. Employees on a twelve hour shift schedule may not be scheduled to work two (2) consecutive regular scheduled shifts and the Company may modify the application of any manpower scheduling guidelines to ensure it does not occur.
FLEXIBLE-PUNCHING OF TIME CARDS
5.26	In any continuous shift operation, where the employees relieve on the job, if incoming employees clock in prior to the start of their shift and indicate that they are willing to take over the responsibility for the operation, the outgoing employees may clock out and leave without waiting to the end of the shift; employees will receive their regular shift wages. The maximum time frame is thirty (30) minutes.
Participation in the program is subject to a request from a majority of the employees of the particular operation and Company approval. Relieving must take place on the rob and there can be no misunderstanding as to whether or not the incoming employee agreed to take over or not; the scheduled employee is responsible until the end of the shift unless there is agreement.

34
recalled even though employees of other departments with greater Company seniority are still laid off.

Off-shift employees may call in to be added to the list up to the cutoff time. If any employees are going on vacation and they see a vacancy coming up that they wish, they must apply before going on vacation; this applies to vacation only. If a vacancy occurs for any other reason, while the employees are off, they may apply only on the firstweek of their return, after which they lose that right; if they apply, they will be scheduled on the job the following week for the duration of the vacancy, If posted employees wish to obtain a vacancy inside or outside the department except in departments with progression relief they must bid for the vacancy.

Any qualified employees holding that relief job may apply for the vacancy if it represents an upgrade in their wage rate outside own department or if within own department represents either a lateral or upgrade in their wage rate.
Filling Vacancies
The vacancy will be filled by the senior qualified employee who applies.
If no one applies for the vacancy, it will be filled with the most junior unposted employee first and then the most junior posted employee second, capable of doing the job, even if that employee must be moved off his / her posted job; unforeseen vacancies and vacancies as a result of posted personnel relieving others, will be filled by assignment, but will be posted the following week, if the vacancy is still there.

APPENDIX I
1)	Letter Of Understanding
The Company and the Union agree that Article 23.2 should somehow reflect service under the Ingersoll Lime Limited “Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees”. Because the merger of the two (2) pension plans has not received regulatory approval and the uncertainty regarding whether / how to reflect that service, the parties agree in principle that Article 23.2 may need to be changed and resolve to do so based on the decisions of the Financial Services Commission of Ontario on the merger application

The Union agrees to assist the Company in communicating with any employee on weekly indemnity benefits at the request of the Company. If the parties are unsuccessful in contacting an employee on weekly indemnity benefits, the direct deposit of benefits for the employee will be discontinued.
3)	Letter Of Understanding
The Company and the Union agree to submit the outstanding arbitration cases to mediation in an effort to resolve outstanding issues in a fair and equitable manner. The Company and the Union reserve all rights to proceed to arbitration in respect of these matters should no resolution be reached.
78
4) Letter Of Understanding
The Company agrees that if the Company requires medical forms and / or notes from an employee and the employee incurs a cost for obtaining such forms or notes, the Company shall reimburse the employee for the cost of a form or note to a maximum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per form or note.
