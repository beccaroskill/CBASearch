ARTICLE 2
RECOGNITION - EXCLUSIONS
The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive Bargaining Agency for all the Company’s employees in its plant at Cardinal, Ontario, except those employed within the following classifications:
Foreman, Chief Engineers, those above the rank of Foreman, Office Workers, Plant Protection Employees and Highway Tractor Trailer Drivers.
ARTICLE 3
RESERVATION TO MANAGEMENT
The location of the Plant, the operation and management of its business, the products to be manufactured, the schedules of production, the methods, processes and means of manufacturing, together with the determination of the number of employees in any department, or in any job are exclusively the responsibility of the Company.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Union recognizes the right of the Company (1) to hire, promote and transfer within the bargaining unit, (2) to discipline any employee for justifiable cause, (3) to allocate work, describe, and classify jobs, and (4) to determine the number of employees in any classification.

(a)	All Employees shall, as a result of this agreement, have the right to join the Union or to remain a member of the Union.
(b)	The Company will deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement an amount equal to the regular dues established by the Union. Such deductions, as authorized by the Union Executive, will be made weekly and the Company shall deliver to the designated officer of the Union the amount so collected by the end of the current month or as soon as possible.
No deduction of dues shall be made in any pay period in which the total amount earned in excess of all deductions required by law is not sufficient to cover the full amount. In such cases, the dues shall be deducted from the next regular pay period in which sufficient earnings are payable to cover such deductions.
10
ARTICLE 5
WAGE ADMINISTRATION
(A)	Schedule “B” is part of this Agreement. Subsequent revisions and additions to Schedule “B” as agreed to by the parties hereto, will be incorporated by amendment at the Union-Management Monthly Meeting, next following such agreement.
(B)	(1) Before new jobs are created or the duties of old jobs are merged during the term of the contract, the Company will meet with the Union executive at a monthly management meeting to discuss the merger or new jobs. Such new or merged jobs will be classified, and the rates put into effect by the Company. It is agreed that in the event the Union does not agree with the Company, the matter may be taken up under Grievance Procedure.
(2)	Jobs which are practically identical from the standpoints of duties shall be classified under the same occupational title.
(3)	Rates of compensation for the same rate classification shall prevail throughout the plant regardless of Department or Division in accordance with Schedule “B”.
(4)	The rate of a present worker in any occupation which has been assigned to a lower Rate Classification than it carried previously will not be reduced; however, the proper and related new Rate Classification as set forth in the foregoing rate schedule will apply to any future workers in the occupations.
(5)	An employee who is required to perform in the regular manner, not an emergency or substitution, the work of more than one job, will be paid at the respective rates assigned to each job for the number of hours spent on each job.
(6)	(a) When an employee is awarded a job in a higher wage group, he will receive his old rate until he takes over the full responsibility of the job. He will then receive the rate of the new job to which he has been assigned.
(b) When an employee is awarded a job in a lower wage group he will receive the rate of the job to which he has been assigned. For the days he would have been working from the general plant schedule, he will receive the lesser of Rate 1 or the normal hourly rate appearing on his Form “8”.
(7)	(a) If, when an employee would normally be working on his own job, he is required to substitute on another job, he shall be paid at his own rate or the rate of the other job, whichever is greater.
(b) An employee, temporarily assigned to other work for one or more days or shifts, when there is a lack of work in his regular occupation, shall receive the rate of the job to which he is temporarily assigned except as provide under Article 11(B),
11
paragraph 4.
(c)	An employee who has been working on his own job, and because of lack of work may be temporarily assigned to work for part of the day or shift on another job, will be paid for the balance of the shift at his own job rate or the rate of the job to which he has been temporarily assigned, whichever is the greater.
(C)	Employees will be paid each Thursday for earnings up to 7:00 am the preceding Sunday. Deductions will be made as per schedule as mutually agreed upon. In the event of Thursday falling upon a recognized holiday,wages shall be paid Friday.
The Company will provide notification to employees if their pay has been altered.
12
ARTICLE 6
HOURS OF WORK
(A)	Working Hours -
The working day begins at 7:00 am and ends at 7:00 am. As recognized by the Company, Sunday begins at 7:00 am on the calendar day Sunday and ends at 7:00 am. on the calendar day Monday. The same applies to recognized holidays.
The recognized work week shall consist of five days or shifts of eight (8) hours, or a total of 40 hours between 7:00 am Sunday and 7:00 am the following Sunday. However, in the cases listed in Schedule C which is part of this Agreement “Jobs on Monday to Friday Work Week” the recognized work week shall consist of eight (8) hours per day Monday to Friday, and work on Saturdays and Sundays on these jobs shall be on a call back basis. Nothing in this paragraph is to be interpreted as a guarantee of work or as a limitation on assignment of overtime work outside the recognized work week.
It is the duty of all employees to report for their scheduled work periods unless they have obtained their supervisor’s permission to be absent. If an employee is prevented from reporting for duty through exceptional circumstances, he should notify his supervisor at least fourteen (14) hours before his work period begins indicating the anticipated time of return to work.
If an employee has been absent from his work for more than one day because of sickness or any other cause he must report to his supervisor at least sixteen (16) hours prior to the beginning of the work period in which he intends to begin duty.
Employees are responsible for keeping their supervisor advised of the phone number at their principal residence at which they can be contacted. Without such advice, the Company cannot be responsible for notifying employees concerning extra work, callbacks, schedule changes, etc. An employee will not be considered available, for that job, if a phone call to the phone number given is unsuccessful in contacting the employee.
Day workers will be allowed five (5) minutes before quitting time at noon and night to put their tools away and wash up.
13
Employees up to 15 minutes late will lose 1/4 hour’s pay. Employees 16 to 30 minutes late will lose 1/2 hour’s pay, etc.
The same regulations will apply for employees leaving work ahead of time.
Employees working overtime will be paid to the nearest 1/4 hour as authorized by their supervisor.
An employee reporting late for work must work eight (8) hours before overtime rates can be applied.
To meet our product demand and ensure customer service, it is the duty of the employees to remain on the job if required to meet special circumstances. If an employee does not wish to remain, the supervisor will endeavor, in accordance with the Collective Agreement to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work, but failure to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work without increasing the cost, to the Company, does not relieve the employee on the job of the responsibility towards his job.
(B)	Day Work
The normal hours of work are:
and
or
or
and
or
and
or
and
7:00 am to 12:00 noon 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
7:00 am to 3:00 p.m.
8:00 am to 12:00 noon 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

7:00 am to 12:00 noon 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
or such other eight (8) hour schedules that may be necessary to meet special conditions resulting from production demands, delivery schedules, the type of job, or seasonal variations which might affect the daylight hours. Except as otherwise provided, the Company will not schedule less than 8 hours.
(C)	Shift Work -
The normal hours of work for shift workers are any one of the following
shifts:
First Shift - 7:00 am - 3:00 p.m. Second Shift - 3:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. Third Shift -11:00 p.m. - 7:00 am
14
15
Each revolving shift shall rotate in sequence weekly. Employees are not to exchange shifts without permission from their supervisor.
When a shift begins each shift worker is required to be at his place. At the end of a shift no shift worker may leave his place to wash up or dress unless his mate has changed his clothes and reported to take on the responsibilities of the position. If a shift worker does not report for his shift, and has not given the required notice, the employee on the job shall notify the department supervisor. He shall then remain at his post until a substitute is secured.
When a replacement is required for a shift job or day job after the Schedule has been posted for the following work week, the supervisor will attempt to make the replacement in accordance with Article 6 (E) using the following priority provided no overtime results.
1.	Regular Operator, provided using the Regular Operator does not involve
moving him from one shift to one of the other two shifts.
2.	Replacement Operators in order of priority.
If overtime cannot be prevented the Replacement will be made in the
following priority:
(1)	Person on the job.
(2)	Regular Operator on his assigned day off.
(3)	Other Regular Operators in order of seniority.
(4)	Replacement Operators in order of priority.
The supervisor may at his discretion use any of the above in an effort to minimize the amount of overtime or avoid the need for any operator to work in excess of 16 hours continuously.

(D)	Replacement Operator -is an employee who replaces a Regular Operator or other Replacement Operator during their temporary absence due to sickness, vacation, assigned days off, or other similar cause. The Replacement Operator will have the same rights and obligations of the job for the days he is on the job as if he were the regular operator, but he shall not have priority over regular operators for any overtime assignments for such days and he shall not have the rights and obligations of any other replacement job he may have for those days.
(The above applies when there is more than one operator on a shift or days.)
A Regular Operator who also holds a Replacement job will not have the rights and obligations of his Regular job for the day he is working on his Replacement job. Replacement of Regular Operators Rate 5 or higher will be made from Replacements (in order of priority) who have received their jobs in accordance with Article 11 (A) (7) as a result of a bulletin. When a Replacement operator is replacing a Regular operator for one calendar week, he shall have no rights to his other jobs for that seven day period.
When there is more than one Replacement Operator for a job the priority of the Operators shall be indicated as Replacement Operator No. 1, Replacement Operator No.2, - etc., and such priority shall be indicated on the job bulletin when the vacancy is posted. A Replacement Operator No. 1 regularly on shift work is limited to that job, i.e.: he may not hold another Regular Job or Replacement job. Similarly, a Regular Operator regularly on shift work is limited to that job.
A day worker is limited to holding one replacement job plus a regular job within the division or is limited to holding two replacement jobs.
(E)	Work Schedules-
A work schedule is to be posted on the bulletin board in each department on Thursday on which is shown the planned working days and shifts, for the following week. This schedule will indicate “assigned day off” and “down days”, if any, and in the event that any work which is Rate 2 or higher shown on this schedule to be performed by an employee at overtime rates then such work will be scheduled to the Regular Operator or the Replacement Operator enjoying the rights of the Regular Operator unless it is assigned in accordance with Article 6 (C).
As an exception to the preceding paragraph the existing system of scheduling week-end relief and days off will continue. The present common practice is the scheduling of the 3 - 11 shift Saturday to Replacement Operators three Saturdays out of four, with the 4th such shift being scheduled to the Regular Operators. There are exceptions to this general rule in various departments and in situations where Replacement Operators are not available.
20
The schedule may be changed by the supervisor by advising the man concerned at least “25” hours before the shift or day concerned for an assigned day off or down day change if such change is caused by production demands, or by at least “17” hours notice if the change is for any other reason, provided, however, that not withstanding the foregoing, no notice of a change in schedule is required if caused by serious breakdown. In any of these cases, the additional time worked is not on a “call back” basis. When an employee has had his schedule changed he will be given at least 17 hours notice from his previously scheduled starting time. Without 17 hours notice the employee will receive overtime rates and the time scheduled will be included in calculating the workweek under Article 7(A).
Assigned Day Off is a day of relief from the regular job assigned to an employee to conform to the recognized work week.
When owing to a change in the work schedule and the employee has not been advised that regular work is not available and reports for work, he will be supplied with at least four hours work or pay, at straight time on week days, but such time will not be included in the work week. If on a Sunday or holiday or assigned day off, his work will be treated as a call back. The above does not apply in the case of a serious breakdown.
When an employee is required to come in to work ahead of his regular starting time he will be given twelve (12) hours warning. Without twelve (12) hours warning his early starting time will be on a call back basis.
Except as otherwise provided, when employees are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs, they will be guaranteed 8 hours work or pay in lieu thereof.
All employees assigned to work at overtime rates, who are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs are not required to work 8 hours because of lack of work on their job will be guaranteed at least 4 hours work or pay on a call back basis.
(F)	For reasons of product demand or efficiency, assigned days off and down days will be determined by the supervisor concerned. Recognizing that employees would like their two days off consecutively, the supervisor will prepare the schedules accordingly when feasible, providing additional cost is not incurred.
21
ARTICLE 7
OVERTIME
(A)	Overtime rates of time and one-half the regular rate will be paid for:
(1)	a) work in excess of eight hours continuously
b)	work in excess of eight hours in any one day.
c)	hours worked between 3 p.m. Saturday and 7 am Monday
d)	hours worked between 7 am Saturday and 3 p.m. Saturday except hours
worked	from the general schedule.
OR
(2)	Scheduled time worked in excess of 40 hours in any one work week.
No more than 8 scheduled hours per day will be included in calculating the work week.
(B)	(1) When an employee is scheduled to work 8 hours on Sunday and is not required to work 8 hours because of lack of work on his job, the time worked will not be included in calculating the work week under Article 7 (A) and will not be included as “opportunity of working” under Article 11 (B)
(2) When an employee is scheduled to work 8 hours on Sunday and has the opportunity of working 8 hours or more on Sunday, time worked up to but not exceeding 8 hours will be included in calculating the work week under Article 7 (A). Such time scheduled will be included as 8 hours in determining the “opportunity of working” under Article 11 (B).
(C)	Work on Recognized Holidays - As shown in Article 9 (A) will be paid at the rate of time and one-half of hourly rate with the exception that work on New Year’s Day, Christmas Day and Labour Day will be paid at double time. If an employee works 8 hours or is scheduled to work 8 hours or is paid for 8 hours on a Recognized Holiday, such time worked or paid for will be included in computing the work week.
(D)	(1) Time worked on call back basis will be paid at time and one-half, and will not be included in the forty hour work week.
(2) Call backs or overtime will terminate at the beginning of the employee’s regular scheduled day or shift. When an employee continues on his regular shift without interruption after a call back, overtime rates will again become effective eight hours after he started his call back work.
22
(3)	Work on an Assigned Day Off or a Down Day - When an employee is required to work on his assigned day off or his down day without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6 (E), he shall be paid on a call back basis.
(E)	(1) Call Back or Call In - With the exception of work normally performed by the mechanical division, the Company is not obligated to call in any employees for any job of approximately one-half hour duration, that can be done by other hourly employees in the plant available to perform the work. In addition the Company is not obligated to call in any employee for any mechanical task that can be done by the utility mechanics. Nor is the Company obligated to call in any employee who is scheduled on vacation, floating holidays, Union business, labour relations, or requested time off.
Employees called in for non operational activities such as crew meetings, safety meetings, safety training, training meetings, environmental meetings and other similar meetings mutually agreed to between the Company and the Union will be paid on a call back basis.
(2)	Employees who are called in to work without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6 (E) for a limited period of time will get a minimum of four (4) hours regular pay, except that the minimum pay will be 6 hours regular pay if the employee is called in to work without notice between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 am. If the employee’s services are not required for two hours and forty minutes he can with the supervisor’s permission leave the plant. If, however, while he is in the plant on a call back another emergency arises requiring his attention he must remain on the job and subject to the instructions of the supervisor concerned.
OR
(3)	If an employee is called upon after his regular quitting time and after having been relieved from his work to work overtime he will be paid on a call back basis.
(F)	Work on Split Shifts - Employees may be required at the request of their supervisor to work a split shift. In such cases the actual hours worked within the span of their normal working hours will be paid for at regular rates, and any time so worked outside of normal working hours will be compensated for at time and one-half.
(G)	Shift Relief - Overtime will not be paid in the case of a mutual agreement between two shift workers on the same job to relieve at a time other than the normal shift change time. This arrangement must have the permission of the supervisor concerned.
Employees may be required by their supervisor to work 12 hour shifts in situations in which two operators are only available to cover the 24 hours duty per day. Such 12 hour shifts will be considered as normal hours of work in accordance with Article 7(A)1.
23
(H)	Noon Hour Work - Employees who are advised before noon that they are required to do unscheduled work during the noon hour, will be paid one and one-half hours’ pay. Such time will be included in the 8 hour work day.
Work during the noon hour will be paid for on a call back basis only if the following conditions prevail:
(1)	The employees concerned must have worked during the morning and be scheduled to work that afternoon.
(2)	The employee concerned was not advised before 12 noon of the noon hour work.

Weekend Stand -by Coverage
During the period of Victoria Day weekend to Labour Day weekend inclusive, the following procedure of mandatory weekend coverage for emergency repairs will be followed:

(7:00 am on Tuesday for holiday weekends).
Mechanical Shop:	1 mechanic
Electric Shop:	1 mechanic
Each designated mechanic on call will receive a rate of pay in the amount of $300.00 per weekend, (plus $150.00 for each additional day of coverage on holiday weekends), in addition to their pay for hours worked. For the purposes of this article where a recognized holiday falls on a Saturday or a Sunday the assigned day off continuous to the weekend shall be considered part of the holiday weekend.
Employees in the shops identified above will be scheduled for stand-by duty on a rotating basis.
A schedule will be posted in each shop by May 1, each year.
24
In addition to the above, employees in each of the shops identified above will be scheduled for stand-by duty on a seniority voluntary basis for the remaining weekends. If a holiday falls in the middle of the week, each designated mechanic will be paid $175.00 per day in addition to their callback or pay for hours worked.
Callbacks will be handled as before except designated individuals are obligated to come in when called.
(J)	Employees who during their normal working hours are notified that they will be required to start their day’s work the following morning before 7:00 am will be paid time and one-half for time worked before 7:00 am and time and one-half after eight
(8)	hours work.
(K)	It is not the intention of the Company to schedule overtime work in one department to avoid overtime in another department.
For example, an employee under ordinary circumstances, will not leave his regular job to go to another job to act as a replacement if so doing creates overtime on the regular job.
In the case of an R2 holding jobs of the same rate, he will be scheduled if possible on a rotating basis.
(L)	Distribution of extra Rate 1 overtime work within the Division:
The Company agrees not to use contractors to perform rate 1 overtime work until eligible bargaining unit employees from the division have been afforded the opportunity to perform said work. For the purpose of this provision, extra Rate 1 overtime work is defined to be Rate 1 work to be performed by an employee, which work is deemed necessary by the Company, and in the opinion of the Supervisor concerned will be in excess of two hours duration and cannot be done by employees within their recognized work week.
In order to distribute extra Rate 1 overtime work equitably among employees within a Division, a list, in seniority order of employees who hold a regular and/or replacement job within the Division, and who wish such work will be kept.
Employees are responsible for advising their Supervisor of their desire to be included on the list and of a phone number by which they can be reached at all times. As extra Rate 1 overtime work occurs, employees on the list will be given the opportunity on a rotational basis, providing the employee is capable of doing the work. Such time worked is not included in calculating the work day or work week. For such work, only one phone call to the phone number given is required of the Supervisor. If an employee does not wish to take advantage of the opportunity, he will forfeit his turn and be eligible again when his turn comes up on the next rotation. An employee who refuses to work Rate 1 overtime on 3 consecutive occasions will forfeit their right to be included in the Rate 1 overtime list. Employees who forfeit their right will be given the right to renew their position on the Rate 1 overtime list on January 1 and July 1 each year.
25
When planned cleaning is required, procedure will be to call eligible employees on the Rate 1 overtime list, during the preceding workday, on a rotational basis. When planned cleaning is required it will be scheduled to commence at 7:00 a.m. In order to be eligible employees must either be on their assigned day off or working the 3-11 shift.

ARTICLE 11
EMPLOYEE SECURITY
(A)	Each of the parties hereto recognizes that employees are entitled to an
equitable measure of job security based on seniority, subject to the following provisions:
(1)	In the selection of employees for job vacancies, appointments will be made to the most senior employee with sufficient ability to perform the duties of the position. Ability shall include skill, efficiency, responsibility and physical fitness to perform the duties of the position. Such appointments will be subject to the provisions of Article 11 (A) (6).
The selection of Replacement Operators may be from the Regular employees within the division concerned. As an exception to Article 6 (D) which limits Employees to one division, that rule may be set aside by mutual agreement when the parties agree there would be no conflict in so doing.
(2)	Seniority Status: Employees other than the employees hired by mutual agreement on a strictly temporary basis, shall have seniority status from their last date of hire, and shall come under the provisions of this Agreement, except that they shall be on probation for 70 days worked. The Company shall have the exclusive and unlimited right to determine if a probationary employee shall be retained. In determining whether an employee shall be retained, the Company shall not act in an arbitrary, discriminatory or bad faith manner. The Company’s decision on retention or discharge of a probationary employee shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Not withstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph the Company and the Union may exclude specific employees from seniority status by mutual agreement in writing.
(3)	An employee shall have his seniority broken and employment severed under the following conditions:
If he voluntarily resigns or quits.
If he is discharged for justifiable cause.
If he is absent for seven consecutive days without notifying the Company unless there was justifiable reason for not notifying the Company.
If he does not work for a continuous period exceeding twelve months due to a lay-off.
31
If he does not return to work after a lay-off, within fourteen (14) consecutive days of being called without reason acceptable to the Company. Provable sickness shall be considered an acceptable reason. The employee shall be notified by registered mail to his last known address of recall after lay-off. Absence for which special permission in writing has been given by the Company shall not break seniority, or sever employment. An employee wishing to be absent from his work in excess of 3 working days for reasons other than lay-off or illness must apply for a Leave of Absence.
(4)	Seniority Lists:	The Company will prepare seniority lists which will be
revised annually or whenever proof of an error has been submitted. Copie s of revised lists will be furnished to the Union. Plant wide seniority shall be as of Article 11 (A) (2).
(5)	Posting Job Vacancies:	All hourly job vacancies within the scope of this
Agreement, with the exception of Rate 1 jobs, temporary jobs not exceeding one month, or as mutually agreed, will be posted. In cases of temporary vacancy, the job will be posted if conditions warrant, affording protection for the regular employee to return to his regular job. Where a temporary vacancy is posted to replace an employee temporarily off work, it shall be posted subject to permanency. Other temporary vacancies shall be limited to one year at which point, the jobs will be reposted or considered as permanent.
When a vacancy becomes evident the job vacancy, if subject to posting, will be posted on all bulletin boards immediately for a period of eight (8) days, indicating job title, rate of pay and hours of work. The successful applicant will be chosen within an additional fourteen days and, provided no replacement is required by bulletin on the successful applicant’s job, he shall begin training within 21 days of the posting of the selection. If a vacancy results from retirement, the vacancy is to be posted sixty (60) days in advance of normal retirement date.
The Company will forward to the President and to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union, copies of the job postings, list of applicants and selectee within the time limits. In addition, members of the Union Executive will, upon request, be shown lists of applicants at the Personnel Office.
The selection of applicants for job vacancies will be in accordance with Article 11 (A) (1). In selecting applicants for posted job vacancies it is stipulated that the selectee’s appointment is temporary, but subject to permanency if found satisfactory after a reasonable period of training and when previous incumbent’s appointment to another job has been declared permanent. An employee who is selected for a job will be given up to a 5 day training period to determine if he wishes to continue this training. After this five days of training, he shall have no grievance if he loses the rights to his former job. This loss of rights to his former job does not apply if he proves to be unsatisfactory on his new job prior to being declared permanent. This also applies to hourly employees being selected for jobs listed in Article 2. During the above 5 day training period the employee will be paid Rate 1.
32
Employees who continue to train after this five (5) day training period will be paid in accordance with the Article 5 (6) retroactive to the beginning of the training period.
In the event that a selectee proves during his training period to be unsatisfactory or desires to return to his former job then the next selection will be made from those who answered the bulletin. If none of the applicants are qualified, an employee who has completed his probation or is currently serving his probationary period will be appointed. If the job is not filled within 90 days the job will be reposted if requested by the Union. Applicants who applied for the initial posting and apply for the re-posting, may not be considered if they were selected in the first instance, and withdrew after the training period had begun.
An employee with over five years seniority who applies for and is selected to a job, may apply for another job within 24 months of his previous selection but he shall have no grievance if he is not selected in the second instance. An employee with less then five years seniority who is appointed to a job, or who applies for and is selected to a job, may apply for another job within 36 months of his previous selection but he shall have no grievance if he is not selected in the second instance.
Employees are restricted to an 18 month waiting period when moving from a regular job to a regular job with a higher rate classification. The above restrictions do not apply if an employee is improving his position in the replacement sequence, or moving to a posted regular day job or days (shift as required). The above does not apply to employees changing shifts within the same job. Filling of the new vacancy will be accomplished by selecting an applicant from the original list for that bulletin by continuing down the list.
When an employee bids to the same job (moving in the replacement sequence) his 36 or 24 month restriction period does not get reset to zero. When an employee bids to the same job (moving to a different shift) his 36 or 24 month restriction period does not get reset to zero. If no additional training is required, the restriction period for the employee does not get reset.
(6)	Those employees not covered by the Agreement prior to June 16, 1967 have full seniority from 1st date of hire for all purposes except awarding of bulletined jobs. For the purpose of awarding bulletined jobs no time spent outside the bargaining unit shall be recognized.
(B)	Subject to Article 11 (D) all regular employees will be guaranteed the opportunity of working the number of days equivalent to the grind week up to a maximum of 40 hours, or 32 hours during a week in which an employee is paid for, but does not work, 8 hours on a recognized holiday, or 24 hours during a week in which an employee is paid for, but does not work, 8 hours for each of 2 recognized holidays. Regular employees who have less than 5 years seniority will be guaranteed the opportunity of working a minimum of 150 days in each contract year with recall rights for the term of this Agreement.
(“Regular employees’ excludes probationary employees and student employees”)
33
Employees in the Mechanical Division will be subject to the above guarantee and any additional work undertaken by the Mechanical Division will be handled by the regular members of the shop concerned.
It is also agreed by both parties that certain active employees are limited for work under Article 11 (C) and it is agreed that these employees shall be assigned to duties that their limitations will allow them to perform. Excluded from the above are employees who qualify for LTD under the terms of the Agreement.
When a regular assigned employee has been given an assigned day off because he had an expected work week of 40 hours, and his scheduled work is reduced he will receive 8 hours work or 8 hours pay for each day’s work that he would have received, if he had not been given an assigned day off.
(C)	General Plant Schedule - Extra Work as requisitioned by divisions will be allocated with as much advance notice as practical by the Support Services Department to employees without regular assigned jobs and to employees who are not scheduled for the full recognized work week on a divisional schedule. All work for the following week requisitioned prior to 4:00 p.m. Friday will be allotted and posted by 5:00 p.m. Friday. In applying the foregoing, if senior employees have an expected work week of less than the Recognized work week and work on Rate 1 jobs is available on days they are not scheduled to work on a Divisional Schedule, then such Rate 1 work will be allocated to the more senior employees provided no extra cost results.
Work allocated under this section will be distributed on a seniority basis, ability to do the work required, availability and the expected work week. It is recognized however, that it is not practical nor possible to allocate such work strictly on a seniority basis.
Work allocated under this section will be included in the work week for all employees but provisions covering call back pay, down day change, assigned day off change, starting time change, and work reduction do not apply to such work.
Employees will be paid the rate of the job to which they are assigned (except the application of Rate 1A to Probationary Employees).
(D)	(1) Lay-offs: Where changes in methods, production or policy would require a permanent lay-off, the reduction in employees will be made by laying off the lowest Plant seniority employees. When additional employees are required, the former employees will be re-hired in reverse order of lay-off.
(2) In any job displacement the Company will transfer the Regular Operators and the Replacement Operators who are affected, to Rate 1 jobs provided they have sufficient seniority and are able to do the work available. Vacancies in Rate 1 jobs will be created by transferring the least senior employees with regular Rate 1 jobs from the Rate 1 jobs. The Regular and Replacement Operators permanently
34
displaced will be guaranteed a minimum of not less than the rate of their former job for the work done during a period of 18 months after the displacement.
(E)	The Company agrees except in cases of urgency, not to let or enter into contracts for Plant maintenance work or the performance of other bargaining unit work at the Plant, which work is normally performed by Mechanical employees or other bargaining unit employees, while Mechanical or other regular bargaining unit employees who are qualified and capable of doing the work are on layoff status.
Maintenance work is defined to mean repair and replacement of existing equipment in kind.
Exceptions to the foregoing are jobs which are normally contracted out such as roof and road repairs, elevator maintenance, etc., together with jobs that require special skills not possessed by employees, or equipment which is not owned by the Company.
The Company will give the Union five (5) days prior notice (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) of the letting of contracts mentioned above in Article 11 (E), paragraph 1.
The Company will continue its efforts to undertake selected non-routine jobs such as building demolition when necessary skilled and unskilled regular employees are available within the workforce. Such work will be undertaken by the Company only if it can be done safely and at comparable cost. Unskilled labour on these jobs will be paid at Rate 1. Qualified mechanic when needed will be on the job.
(F)	Employees who are excluded from the bargaining unit shall not perform routine work normally done by hourly employees. Violation of this provision is subject to the Grievance Procedure.
(G)	The facilities (excluding the office) previously occupied by Best Foods Canada Inc. at Cardinal shall be considered as part of the plant as defined in Article 2 for the purposes of this agreement.
35
ARTICLE 12
DISCIPLINE
(A)	Subject to the right of an employee to file a grievance the Company reserves the right to discipline any employee for any justifiable cause.
A conduct record must be filed with the Support Services Office within 14 calendar days of the alleged offense becoming apparent. The employee shall be notified of the discipline imposed within 12 calendar days after the filing of the conduct record and in the case of discharge or suspension, the President of the Union will be advised by registered mail within this period.
(B)	If a suspension or discharge is disputed, an appeal must be made through the grievance procedure within 14 calendar days of notification to the employee and the Union. In case of suspension, the discipline must commence within 24 calendar days of the discovery of the alleged offense.
If it is found that no penalty is justified the employee so reinstated will be reimbursed for loss of earnings by payment of 2% of previous 12 months earning for each week’s loss of earnings or by payment for such time at his regular rate, whichever is the greater. As well the said 2% penalty is also applied to unjustified, non-disciplinary suspension, demotions or terminations.
If the penalty is reduced, the employee will be paid for the unjustified time off by payment of 2% of previous 12 months earnings for each week’s unjustified loss of earnings or by payment for such at his regular rate, whichever is the greater. From this amount paid to him, will be deducted any earnings or benefits he has received from any other source during the period of unjustified time off.
(C)	Complete records in writing will be kept of discipline administered. Upon the written request of an employee to the Support Services Department, a record of his disciplinary record will be made available to him. The employee has the right to appeal through the Grievance Procedure in all cases of discipline.
The Company agrees to remove quarterly each year, from the employee ‘s files all discipline records that are 2 years old or older.
In addition, the Company has agreed that an employee may, if he wishes, be accompanied by his steward if he is being reprimanded as the result of a written conduct record. The employee will be required to initial the conduct record to indicate only that he has received it.
36
ARTICLE 13
UNION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES

(E)	The Company agrees it will reimburse Union officers called in for monthly Union-Management meetings at regular rate for any hours between 7:00 am and 3:30 p.m. Such time will not be included in the work week. When the Union Officers or Committees are scheduled for and paid for 8/12 hours in one day for attending joint Union-Management meetings, such 8/12 hours will be considered as 8/12 hours worked in computing the work week under Article 7 (A), and in determining the “opportunity of working” under Article 11 (B).
(Understanding is that short duration meetings will be done on a call back
basis as current practice.)
Meetings convened by a Conciliation Officer or by a Conciliation Board during the term of this Agreement shall be deemed to be joint Union-Management Meetings.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Re:	Meal Allowance, Work Clothing & Safety Shoes
This is to confirm that the Company will provide each regular employee a meal and clothing allowance of $75.00 no later than April 15th each contract year. The Company will pay $210.00 during the first contract year, and $210.00 during the second contract year towards the purchase of safety shoes or boots for each regular employee.

62
RE: MECHANICAL DIVISION
1)	If more permanent employees are required in another shop the Company will discuss the possibilities of a permanent transfer with the Union before positions for new apprentices or employees are posted in the shop requiring the additional employees.
2)	If it is found necessary to reduce the work force in any of the mechanical shops the Company will meet with the Union in an attempt to reach a satisfactory method of displacing employees. It is recognized that if skill and ability to perform the work are equal then seniority will govern.
3)	If a yard hand performing duties of a mechanical helper has been working on a job for all or most of the day and there is overtime involved on this job, the most senior yard hand will be afforded the first opportunity and so forth by seniority to stay on overtime, provided no regular member of the shop concerned wishes to avail himself of the overtime.
The above only applies to a yard hand working with a regular member of the shop concerned.
4)	For callbacks, Utility Mechanics will be used only after the regular employees of the shop concerned.
The sequence would be:
1)	Regular employees of shop concerned by seniority.(Apprentices are considered to be Regular employees of the shop concerned.)
2)	Regular or replacement Utility Mechanic on the job.
3)	Regular Utility Mechanic on his assigned day off.
4)	Regular Utility Mechanic in order of seniority.
5)	Replacement Utility Mechanic in order of priority.
The Supervisor may, at his discretion, use any of the above in an effort to minimize the amount of overtime or avoid the need for any operator to work in excess of 16 hours continuously.
63
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE: APPRENTICE TRAINING PROGRAM
In administering the Apprentice Training Program, the following general principles will be followed:

The service requirement for Instrumentation Mechanic is 8000 hours. Should the Instrumentation Mechanic become a provincially regulated trade, the service requirement will be as provided for by the Provincial Apprentice Program.
All hours worked as an apprentice (including overtime) shall be included as hours worked towards the service requirement. After attainment of 4000 hours towards the service requirement, the above apprentices will proceed to Rate 8 as provided for in Section 5 of Schedule B. After attainment of 8000 hours towards the service requirement and the successful completion of all relevant testing the apprentice will progress to Mechanic Grade 3 - Rate 9 (Rate 9 will be effective on the date that the testing is successfully completed). Upgrading to Rate 10 will occur after the employee has worked 2080 hours as a Grade 3 Mechanic.
For purposes of collective agreement administration the following job titles apply:

3.	Apprentice on Job Training - Each apprentice will be given experience with various mechanics and will not remain with one mechanic for long periods.

C)	For training purposes employees will be scheduled on eight (8) hour shifts or a combination of eight (8) and twelve (12) hour shifts.

Memorandum re: Notification for Mechanical Weekend Work
December 13, 2000
Todd Deschamps Vice President Local 483 RW/CAW Cardinal, Ontario
Delivered by Hand
Dear Todd,
Further to our meeting of November 17, 2000 the Company intends to implement the following procedure for assigning planned weekend work to Mechanical Division employees effective Friday, December 15, 2000.
This procedure applies in situations where employees are absent on a Friday.
In all cases the foreman will call the employee’s principle residence.
1.	Employees - With Answering Machine
Foreman will call the employee’s phone number and leave a message that there is planned work and the expected duration of the work.
If the employee wishes to avail himself of the opportunity he must phone back to the foreman prior to 2:00pm on Friday and either speak to the foreman personally or leave a message on the shop extension that he will be in at the established starting time.
2.	Employees - No Answering Machine
Foreman will call the employee’s phone number prior to 2:00pm on Friday to notify him of the availability of planned work.
The above would also apply on a Thursday where a recognized holiday falls on a Friday.
Employees on vacation for a calendar week are ineligible for planned work for the weekend days of the calendar week.
Yours truly,
Ken Shaw
Manager Support Services
Cc. Kevin Patrick Frank Hitsman John Playford Paul Choquette
79
Memorandum re: Resolution of Same Seniority Dates
Employees who are currently listed in the collective agreement will have seniority in the order in which they are listed.
Employees hired on the same date after May 1, 2001 will have their seniority established by the Company on their date of hire. The Company will furnish the Union with a list in seniority order at the end of each quarter when new employees have been hired.
Student employees will only be considered as applicants for jobs listed in Schedule B after all other employees have been considered except for “Temporary Vacation Relief’ as provided for in the 12 Hour Shift Schedule for Continuous Operations.
It is mutually agreed the student probationary period will be May 1st to Labour Day inclusive and students employed during the probationary period shall not acquire seniority.
80
Memorandum of Understanding Re: Receiver & Supplier-Stores
The Company agrees to maintain three Regular Operators in the Job Title “Receiver and Supplier - Stores” for the duration of this agreement.
The three Regular Operators will be responsible for coverage during any temporary absence due to sickness, vacation, or other similar cause.
Article 6(D) does not apply-there is no replacement operator.
The job duties are expanded to include all chemical unloading.
Both parties acknowledge the above memorandum is a variation from the collective agreement.
81
Mechanical Division Memorandum
1.	The Company will provide the Union each week with a list of contractors who were in the plant the previous week.
2.	The Company will attempt to select repair work to be undertaken by regular members of the Mechanical Division after hours and on weekends.
3.	Tinsmith duties will be assigned to the Millwright Shop when available and practical.
4.	All work associated with the repair and maintenance of pneumatic conveying lines will be transferred to the Millwright Shop.
5.	Two millwright shop employees have been trained in insulation. Whenever possible they will be given the opportunity for minor repair jobs.
6.	Whenever painting duties are to be performed by our own employees, whether after regular hours or on weekends, this work will be offered to the regular employees of the Mechanical Division by Seniority.
It is not the Company’s intention to have contractors working on weekends. However situations can arise which necessitate the presence of contractors on weekends. When this occurs, and if possible, the Company will inform the Union beforehand.
82
Memorandum - Callback Procedure
Mechanical Division
Employees will be called from the shop concerned in seniority order in accordance with Article 6(A) paragraph 5 and Article 7(E)(1).
If additional employees are required to help with the job, the list from the shop concerned will be exhausted before returning to the top of the seniority list for that shop and calling the employees a second time.
When the list of available employees in the shop concerned has been exhausted, employees in the subsequent shop will be called in seniority order providing they have sufficient ability to perform the work.
Mechanical-Electrical-Yard-Tractor Driver-Safety Observer Electrical-Mechanical-Yard-Tractor Driver-Safety Observer Yard-Mechanical Division in seniority order
Prior to leaving the plant, mechanics will make a reasonable attempt to notify the supervisor concerned that they have completed the job.
Callbacks - Mechanic in the plant for planned work
If a breakdown occurs while mechanics are in the plant carrying out planned work, employees from the shop concerned will be called as per the above procedure.
Once the list of Mechanics from the shop concerned has been exhausted the employees carrying out the planned work will be directed to work on the breakdown.
Callbacks - Mechanic already in the plant on another callback
The employee will be contacted and advised that he/they may be required for another breakdown.
Once the list of mechanics from the shop concerned has been exhausted, the employees on the initial callback will be directed to work on the subsequent breakdown as a continuation of the same callback.
83
Memorandum re: Make Up Shifts
The Make-up shift provision will be applied when an employee is unable to complete his scheduled shift as a result of number of consecutive hours worked and being subsequently sent home by his supervisor.
Employee will be scheduled to work the hours lost, beyond his normal scheduled hours.
His schedule will be posted as part of the normal weekly schedule on Thursday for the following week with the understanding that the work will be scheduled on a day that otherwise would be an assigned day off.
Hours worked will be excluded from the calculation of the workweek for the purposes of calculating overtime. (In the event, the work is scheduled for the weekend then the hours worked would be paid on the basis of the weekend overtime premium of time and one half).
The scheduling of work will be done as soon as reasonably practicable.
If the employee declines the scheduled work or fails to report for work on the scheduled day, then he forgoes his rights under this memorandum.
Make-up shifts will not interfere with normal scheduling and call-in procedures.
It is agreed that the Union would not process any grievance on behalf of any employee once the make-up shift provision has been administered as described above.
