21
Mates, Engineers and Cooks shall be entitled to bump the most junior crewmember in their respective classifications (e.g. Mate bumps most junior mate).

24
12:09:01
12:09:03
The parties agree to establish a relief priority list to include crewmembers who relieve on scallop vessels. Relieving crewmembers shall be ranked on the basis of the number of trips sailed and shall be called in relief in that order. New additions will be added to the list on the completion of three (3) trips from that port. Relief priority based on the total number of trips will be determinative of the opportunity to fill permanent vacancies within the fleet and attain seniority as a regular crewmember.

FISHERY PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED BARGAINING UNIT PENSION PLAN
INTRODUCTION
Having sufficient income to meet your financial needs when you reach retirement age is increasingly important to all Canadians. Your government benefits, such as the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security, will meet part of your requirements, but in order to face the challenge of maintaining a comfortable lifestyle after retirement, other sources of income are necessary. One important additional source of income is your Fishery Products International Limited (FPI) Pension Plan for unionized employees. This Plan, combined with government benefits and your own savings, will go a long way toward ensuring a secure retirement.
HOW DO I BECOME A MEMBER?
Participation in the Pension Plan is mandatory for all employees who are members of the Fishermen, Food and Allied Workers Union or CAW Canada, who have been employed continuously for two years by FPI and have reached age 21. You will be notified by the Human Resources Department when you are eligible to join.
60
WHAT DOES THE PLAN COST?
FPI pays all costs related to the Pension Plan, including its administration.
WHEN DO PENSION BENEFITS START?
Your normal retirement date is the first day of the month following your 65th. birthday. If your birthday falls on the first day of a month, your Pension begins that day.
You can also retire anytime following your 55th. birthday, but the monthly amount of Pension you receive will be reduced by 6% for each full year prior to your normal retirement date. For example, if your normal retirement date is June 1, 1998 and your actual date of retirement is June 1, 1996, your monthly Pension benefit will be reduced by 12%.
61
HOW IS MY PENSION DETERMINED?
Your Pension is based on a system of units. If you work in a plant each unit is equal to 1,800 hours of work. If you work on a trawler, 120 sea-days is equal to a unit. You may earn up to 1.5 units in any calendar year. If you work less than 1,800 hours in a plant or 120 days at sea, you will receive a portion of a unit. For example, 900 hours of plant work or 60 days at sea is equal to half a unit.
At the time of your retirement, each unit is equal to $10 of monthly Pension. For example, if you have been a member of the Plan for 30 years when you reach age 65 and have accumulated 40 units during that period, the Plan will pay you $400 a month. In any case, if you have been employed for five or more years by FPI, you are guaranteed a minimum Pension of $50 a month.
HOW WILL THE BENEFIT BE PAID?
Once you retire, you will receive your Pension every month for the balance of your life. In addition, if you are married and die before your husband or wife, the surviving spouse will ontinue to receive an amount equal to 60% of your monthly Pension for as long as he or she lives.
62
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PENSION IF I DIE AFTER RETIREMENT?
If you die within the first five years after retirement, the balance of the Pension for that five year period will be paid to your spouse or the person you have named as your beneficiary. If your spouse is still alive at the end of the five year period, he or she will continue to receive payments each month equal to 60% of your full Pension.
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DIE BEFORE I RETIRE?
The value of your Pension at the time of death will be calculated and paid to your beneficiary as a lump sum.
ARE THERE OTHER PENSION OPTIONS AVAILABLE?
Yes. You may choose a Pension that provides for a longer guarantee period or a Pension that provides a higher proportion of your full Pension for your surviving spouse. The amount of your Pension will be adjusted to reflect the option you select. See your Human Resources Department for details.
63
WHAT HAPPENS IF I LEAVE FPI BEFORE RETIREMENT?
If you have been a member of the Pension Plan for at least two (2) years, or are 45 years of age and have been employed by FPI for 10 years you are considered to be vested. This means you will receive a deferred Pension when you reach age 65, based on the number of units built up while you were an FPI employee.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENSION PLAN?
Your Pension is administered by a Committee made up of Union and Management Representatives.
A FINAL NOTE
This Schedule contains a Plan language explanation of the Pension Plan. As such, it may not contain all of the details which are contained in the official Plan text that governs the Plan. If you have any questions about your Plan, please contact your Human Resources Department.
