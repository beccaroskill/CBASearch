III	- Contracting Out
The Company prefers to have work done by its employees although at times it is necessary to have work performed by outside contractors. The relevant factors which the company will consider before contracting out such work include, adverse effect on employees, availability of required skills, duration and frequency of the job, urgency of the job, cost of equipment in relation to its use and relative cost comparison.
The Company shall inform a representative of the Union prior to bringing contractors into the plant, unless an emergency situation arises in which case the Union shall be immediately notifiedonce the emergency is over. When work performed on the premises by outside contractors represents a material change in practice and has an adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such change of practice, the matter may be the subject of a grievance and may be taken to arbitration.
Should an Arbitration Committee be called on to review the Company's action, it may consider the relevant factors referred to above, in order to determine the reasonableness of the Company's action with regard to all circumstances. Should the Arbitration Committee find the Company's action was not reasonable, the Committee will direct that the Company choose between having the work performed by its employees or ceasing such operation, and the Company shall have a reasonable time to effect the decision.
This provisiondoes not apply to cafeteriaoperations, to "out of town". deliveries, and to installation and construction work. The Company may at times experiment to determine if work can be performed effectively and economically by its own employees. When this is done for a trial period, it shall not be considered a change of practice should the Company elect to contract out, after the trial period.
