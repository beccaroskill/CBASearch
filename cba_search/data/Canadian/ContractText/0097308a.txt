1.	It i s understood feat no new upward or downward revision of rates will be established by any operators without mutual agreement with the Local Union. Where applicable the provisions cf fee Plywood or Sawmill Job Evaluation Programs shall prevail.
2.	Re: Article X - Seniority - Section 9:
It is understood that the interpretation of this clause made by the Honourable Gordon McGregor Sloan under the Coast Agreement will apply as set out below:
71
“When an Employee has left, or leaves, the bargaining unit because c£ promotion to a supervisory position, and who later is reinstated as a member of such bargaining unit because of demotion or reduction in forces, he returns thereto with the seniority he had when an Employee within the bargaining unit In other words, bis seniority is “frozen" at the time he leaves the bargaining unit and ceases to run until his return thereto".
It is agreed, however, that persons transferred out of the bargaining unit for temporary supervisory duty with the Company lur a period c£ not more than four (4) months in each calendar year shall continue to retain their seniority.

Should any special circumstances arise which will require an extension of this provision, same shall be discussed between the Local Union and Management and, if agreement is reached, the 0>& may be extended.
It is agreed that the above understandings shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been written into the actual contract and this Section of Adjustments end Interpretations shall form Supplement No. 2 and be part of the Contract.

of the Agreement
Interpretation cf the Agreement
1.	Clarification of Agreement
Article V - Wages - Section 7 - Shift Differential Clarification
Any Employee who works more than one hour outside cf the shift which is recognized as a regular day shift, should be paid night shift differential for all time worked on the overlap shift. This applies to the front end of the shift and/or the back end cf the shift
In other words, if you work a scheduled shift that is more than one hour outside of the regular day shift you should receive night shift differential for the entire hours spent on that shift
2.	Clarification of Agreement
ArticleVII - Hours of Work - Double Time on Sunday
There has been considerable discussion in regards to the interpretation of Article VII - Hours of Work, Section l(b)(ii) and (b)(iv) as it applies to three (3) shift operations where some Employees, who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days, and regularly come in one (1) ortwo (2) hours early to do preparatory work prior to the start of the first shift on Monday. The pertinent clauses read as follows:
Article VII -Hours of Work
Section 1(b)- Doable straight time shall be paid for the following:
“(ii) Hours worked on Sunday by Employees who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days ;
(iv)Item (ii) above shall not apply to Employees who work Sunday as a regularly scheduled day."
108
Inasmuch as (iv) above was negotiated to apply to Employees who regularly work an a Seven (7) day tour, such as Security Guards, Watchmen, StBEmRant Employees, agreement bas been reached on the application of section (iv) above.
Where Employees regularly come in late Sunday night to do preparatory work, the Company will pay double straight time rates of pay for those hours worked prim to Sunday midnight. However, the Company reserves the right to either shorten his s---
shift to parallel the normal hours of the shift cr to require the Employee to work bis normal shift at straight time in addition to the time worked prior to Sunday midnight
3.	Article VII - Honrs cf Work- Section 9 — Hot Meals
where Maintenance, Repair or Construction Employees are required to work two (2) hours or more overtime beyond their normal shift, the Company shall provide a hot meal, such hot meal to be consumed by the Employee on Company time before beginning the over tune work.
Negotiated additions to above:
Production Employees working in conjunction with o r assisting Maintenance Employees and who work two (2) or more horns c£ overtime beyond their regular shift will be entitled to a hot meal as provided in Section 9 if the Maintenance Employees with whom they are working become entitled to a hot meal.
The Company will ensure that a hot meal will be provided whenever possible.
However, where the provision cf a hot meal is considered impractical, Employees will be paid the equivalent of one (1) hour’s pay at rate and one-half in lieu of both the hot meal and the time required to consume the meal.
For the purpose of this agreement rate and one-half will be calculated at the regular hourly rate of pay the Employee is receiving far the overtimework being performed.
