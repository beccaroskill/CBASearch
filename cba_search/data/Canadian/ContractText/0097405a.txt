SUPPLEMENT NO. 2
ADJUSTMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
In connection with the interpretation of certain clauses in the contract between IWA-CANADA and certain Interior Operators, the following interpretations of the Contract have been agreed upon:
Section 1:
With respect to the definition of the two categories Lumber grader and Boomman, the following is agreed upon:
Lumber Grader:	One who grades for shipment
Boomman:	One who makes up or breaks down booms or
who grades logs.
Section 2:
a)	With respect to Call-time as covered in Article VII,
Section 7 or Section 8, the following understanding has been reached.
If workers present themselves for work, and due to any conditions beyond their control, there is no work available they shall receive two hours' pay unless sufficient warning has been given cancelling the work call for that day. However, if there is a possibility that work may be available within two (2) hours of the regular starting time, the employer may request employees to stay at their place of employment during the call-time period.
In the case of logging camp employees, the interpretation of call-time shall be as follows:
Employees will not be deemed to have been called for work if they do not leave the camp or the assembly point except those employees using their own means of transportation who present themselves for work not having sufficient warning.
75
Supplement No. 2, Section 2 a) Cont'd.
Sawmill employees being transported by Company vehicle shall be covered by the above clause.
