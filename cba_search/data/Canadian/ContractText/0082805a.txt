8,15	LAYOFFS - MORE THAN FIVE (5) COMPLETE SHIFTS
36
In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees on an occupation in a department for more than five (5) complete shifts, for weekday employees or more than three (3) complete shifts for weekend employees or more than three (3) complete shifts for seven (7) day twelve (12) hour shift employees, the employee on the occupation with the least seniority according to the seniority list established in Paragraph 8.19 will be subject to layoff. The employee subject to said layoff firstly has the right to replace a probationary employee on production or an employee with the least seniority on an occupation which he has previously fulfilled satisfactorily or on an equivalent or lower ranked occupation in his department provided that he is qualified to perform the work within a maximum delay of five (5) days for weekday employees or four (4) days for employees on weekend shifts, or seven (7) day schedule. Secondly if the employee is unable to use the above provisions he has the right to replace a probationary employee onproduction or an employee with the least seniority on an occupation which he has previously fulfilled satisfactorily or an equivalent or lower ranked occupation in another department provided that he is qualified to perform the work within a maximum delay of five (5) days for weekday employees or four (4) days for employees on weekend shifts or seven (7) day operation.
This last disposition can only be invoked once by an employee concerned on the occasion of each layoff and will only be applied to employees with six (6) months seniority or more.
37
An employee who is laid off, must indicate his intentions in regards to exercising his seniority rights within five (5) working days.
In cases where occupations and/or complete assignments are permanently eliminated due to a reduction of machinery or technological change, this last disposition which will be extended to thirty-five (35) working days, can only be invoked once by an employee concerned on the occasion of each layoff and will be applied to employees who have at least completed their probationary period.
An employee who transfers to another department as a result of Article 8.15 will have his/her seniority transferred effective immediately when the transfer occurs. This does not eliminate the provisions of Article 8.16 (d).

ARTICLE 9 PRODUCTIVITY
9,01	a) During the course of the present agreement, all changes concerning tasks, work assignments piecework rates or changes in the regular duties of an hourly paid occupation or changes from an hourly rated occupation to piece-work rated occupation, or vice versa and the establishment of new rates, therefore shall be submitted by the Company to the Union.
b) The Plant Manager, upon request, at any time after the commencement of change referred to in Paragraphs 9.02, 9.03 and 9.04, or at any time after a written request for a revision of element time values has been submitted under Paragraph 9.05, and until such time as the change is accepted or the written request for revision is settled, or a decision of the sole arbitrator is rendered, shall grant the Union permission to delegate a representative to observe the effects of the said change and/or to carry out chronometrical tests himself for the purpose of verification provided the said representative does not hinder the proper functioning of the department.
45
9.02	If a change contemplated by the Company concerning a piece work occupation has to do with the revision of a measured work element or the addition of measured work element not already established or the complete elimination of a measured work element, the Company must at least one (I) working week prior to the application of that change, advise the Union in writing of the nature of the change.
If the change applies to a measured piece work occupation and affects the existing standard time value by twenty percent (20%) or more, a period of adaptation will be applied.
The period of adaptation will have a maximum duration of four (4) weeks. During this period, the employees concerned will work under the new conditions. For wage payment purposes, the difference between the preceding and new standard time values will be applied progressively in five (5) equal weekly increments: one increment at the beginning of each adaptation week, and one last increment at the beginning of the fifth week. At the conclusion of the period of adaptation, the full revised standard time value will be in effect for wage payment purposes.
46
When the change has been put into effect by the Company, and the Union does not agree with such change, a review will be made by a representative of the plant's Industrial Engineering Department and the representative of the Union. Such review will include an inspection of the j ob
specification and summary data which formed the basis
for the change. If such review does not settle the grievance, the Union may refer the said change to the sole arbitrator mentioned below for his decision.
Only the work elements changed and calculations affected by the change will be subject to review by the sole arbitrator. If no request is made in writing by the Union to submit such change to the sole arbitrator within forty-five (45) days after the date it was put into effect, the change shall be deemed to be accepted.
9.03	If a change contemplated by the Company concerning a piece work occupation has to do with a revision of a measured work element or the addition of a measured work element, or the complete elimination of a measured work element because of the installation of different machinery, or if an hourly or piece work element because of the installation of different machinery or if a non-nteas-ured hourly occupation is to be placed by the Company on measured piece work, or if a new occupation is introduced, the Company must, at least two (2) working weeks prior to the application of such change, advise the Union in writing of the nature of the change. On the date that such change takes place, it will be considered as under a trial period, the conditions of which are defined in Paragraph 9.06 and the following paragraphs.
47
9.04	All changes made by the Company concerning piece work occupations other than those referred to in Paragraphs 9.02 and 9.03 are to be settled, if grievances arise, by the following procedure:
Step One:
A review of the grievance is to be made by an Industrial Engineering representative of the Company and a representative of the Union.
Such review will include an inspection of thej ob specification and test data which form the basis for the change. The representative of the Union may also, by arrangement with the Industrial Engineering representative of the Company, visit the premises where the grievance arose. Notice of the nature of such change will be given to the Union in writing.
If no grievance is made as a result of any changes referred to in this paragraph within twenty (20) working days after the change is to be put into effect, the change shall be deemed to be accepted.
9.04	Step Two:
If the review provided in Step One above does not provide an immediate solution to the grievance, joint tests will be made by an Industrial Engineering representative of the Company and a representative of the Union to settle the grievance on the change concerned.
48
Anyj oint tests shall be of the same nature and to the same extent as the tests upon which the change was originally based. The extent of thej oint test called for may be varied by the parties by mutual agreement.
If the results of thej oint tests made by the Company and the Union are such as not to affect the standard time value by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the saidj oint tests affect the standard time value by greater than plus orminus 4%, the standard time value will be so revised and put into effect.
If the results of the said joint tests call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change.
If the parties, after having completed thej oint tests in this Step Two, and after having studied their findings cannot agree on the results of the said joint tests, the Union may refer the said change to the sole arbitrator mentioned below.
Step Three:
The sole arbitrator shall review the change made by the Company and shall make tests of the same nature and to the same extent as the tests upon which the change was originally based.
49
If the results of the tests made by the sole arbitrator arc such as not to affect the standard time value by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the test made by the sole arbitrator affect the standard time value by greater than plus or minus 4%, the standard time value will be so revised and put into effect.
If the results of the test made by the sole arbitrator call for an increase in the standard lime value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change.
It is recognized that due to their nature, changes referred to in this Paragraph 9.04 may be frequent and continuing revisions of such changes to reflect modifications in conditions may be called for at any time.
9.05	a)	If no change is introduced by the Company, but if in
the opinion of the Union, a change has occurred of the type covered in Paragraph 9,04, in case of an unsettled complaint, a grievance may be submitted for settlement, including arbitration if necessary, in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 9.04.
50
9.05	}>) If no change is introduced by the Company of the
type covered in Paragraphs 9.02 and 9.03, but if in the opinion of the Union a time of one or several elements of a standard time value requires modification, the following procedure will apply.
1.	When one or more element times of a standard time value which have not been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator have been in effect and a period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of the last acceptance by the Union, it may request a revision in the said standard time value. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been arbitrated, this will not preclude the balance of the element times of the said standard time value not arbitrated,from the applicationof this paragraph. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator, but if in the opinion of the Union a change has occurred, which had not been covered by the decision of the sole arbitrator (or submittedas a change by the Company) and which in their opinion affects the standard time value such contention may be submitted by the Union to the sole arbitrator for his decision. In such a case, the burden of proof falls on the Union.
51
2.	Within forty-five (45) days from the written request of the Union for a revision of element time values, both parties will meet to attempt to finally settle the request. Failing a mutually satisfactory settlement, the request for revision by the Union may be referred to arbitration according to the dispositions of Paragraph 9,11, When such a request is made for arbitration, then all the element times for a standard time value except such element times as have been previously arbitrated shall be referred to the sole arbitrator for decision.
If, within the said delay of forty-five (45) days, the Union does not submit it’s request for revision to arbitration, the said request for revision will be deemed to have been abandoned.
3,	Following a request for arbitration made by the Union, according to Paragraph 1, if the arbitrator finds a difference from the standard time value in effect of 4% or more, then and only then, shall the arbitrator decide that a change in the standard time value be put into effect in accordance with his observations. If the results of the review are made by the arbitrator, call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the Union’s request for revision.
52
4.	For all requests for revisions which are raised during
the first three (3) months following the signature of the Collective Labour Agreement, the retroactivity, if any, will be limited to a four (4) week period following the date the request for revisions was submitted.
9.06	Following the date that the changes referred to in Paragraph 9,03 above take place, a trial period of twenty (20) working days will follow.
9.07	During the trial period of twenty (20) working days, the employees concerned will work under the new conditions and be paid according to the new rate and during the said twenty (20) working days, their average hourly earnings will not be lower than their straight time average hourly earnings during the last four (4)weeks while the employees were working on piece work during the previous six (6) months. In no case shall this guarantee of average hourly earnings extend beyond the said twenty (20) working days.
9.08	At any time during the trial period the Company and the Union will meet to review the results obtained during the trial period and will try to agree on the change.
53
9.09	Prior to the end of the sixth (6th) week following the completion of the trial period, if there is no agreement on the change, the Union must notify the Company and the sole arbitrator (referred to in Paragraph 9.11 hereafter) thereof in writing by registered mail and the change will be referred to the sole arbitrator for his decision. The parties may refer the change to the sole arbitrator prior to the completion of the trial period by mutual consent.
If such a notice is not sent during the said trial period or prior to the end of the sixth (6th) week following the completion of the trial period by the Union, and if no notice is sent by the Company within the same period of it’s intention to abandon the proposed change, the said change will be considered as final and accepted by both parties.
9.10	In cases where the change is submitted to the solearbitra-tor, the sole arbitrator must render his decision within eight (8) additional working weeks from the date a change was submitted to him. In any event, the change will remain in force until the final decision of the sole arbitrator has been rendered.
9.11	The sole arbitrator for the purpose of this article and the duration of this agreement will be an Industrial Engineer to be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties.
54
;9.12	The sole arbitrator must, before starting each arbitration,
make a sworn declaration stating that he has no pecuniary interest in the question, that he is not personally associated with, or interested in, a fum or company that manufactures textiles, and that he is not by reason of his business affairs, or any other circumstances influenced or prejudiced in favour of either employees or employers.
9.13	Each of the parties to this agreement will bear its own expenses of arbitration. The fees and expenses of the sole arbitrator will be paid for on the basis of one half by the Company and one half by the Union.
9.14	a) All grievances arising out of Articles 9 and 10 shall
be submitted to the sole arbitrator for decision. In any case, the decision of the sole arbitrator must be within the framework of the Company’s work measurement plan and wage payment methods, and further, the sole arbitrator shall not have the power to amend, alter, or modify the terms of this agreement.
9.14	b) For the purposes of Articles 9 and 10 of the Collec-
tive Labour Agreement, one of the following firms will act as arbitrator as called upon:
Woods Gordon & Co.-Charron, Bourgetel et Ass. Enrg.-Leatham Simpson,
55
9.15	Thedecisionofthesolearbitratorwill be final and binding on the Union and the Company, and all employees or groups concerned. In so far as wages are concerned, the decision will be retroactive to the commencement of the trial period should the sole arbitrator so decide, and the amount of retroactive adjustments, if any, shall be determined by the said sole arbitrator.
9.16	If, at any time during the trial period, the Company decides to abandon the proposed change, an adjustment of wages must he made in such a manner as to ensure that for the time during which the trial period has been in force, average hourly earnings for each employee immediately concerned are equivalent to 100% of the average hourly earnings of that employee during the last four (4) weeks while the employee was working on piece work during the previous six (^months.
9.17	When the Company advises the Union of a change in task under Paragraph 9.03, it will give to the Union all pertinent information and all necessary explanations concerning such change or new occupation.
9.18	Upon request, the Company will, at the commencement of a trial period, make available to a designated representative of the Union for examination, the j ob specification data referring to the establishment of the task which has been placed on such trial period. It is understood and agreed that such job specification data is a confidential company document, is to be returned to the company within a reasonable delay, and is not to be retained beyond the conclusion of such trial period.
56
9.19	Upon request, the Company will, at the commencement of a trial period, supply in writing to the Union, the average hourly earnings of each employee placed under such trial period during the last four (4) weeks while the employee was working on piece work during the previous six (6) months. The Union will also be provided in writing, if they so request, with the average hourly weekly earnings of said employees during such trial period.
9.20	Grievances arising from changes in measured or unmeasured hourly paid occupations or a regular assigned increase in the scheduled volume of work of such an hourly paid occupation may also be submitted to the sole arbitrator for decision within forty five (45) days following the occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the grievance or knowledge of same, as the case may be. In this case, however, the sole arbitrator shall determine whether or not the changed occupation or a regularly assigned increase in the scheduled volume of work of such an hourly paid occupation requires more than a normal daily work performance. The sole arbitrator shall decide the content of a normal daily work performance and the Company will modify the content of the occupation accordingly. A normal daily work performance may be defined as the average amount of work a qualified employee working at normal pace (as defined in Article IO), under standard conditions, can produce over a day.
9.21	It is understood that all changes which affect the standard time value will be taken into account in the standard time value for the occupation.
57
9,22	Changes in piece work rates shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of this article where applicable.
WAGE PAYMENT METHODS
10.01 MEASURED DIRECT OCCUPATIONS
a)	Measured direct occupations are to be paid on the basis of piece work rates, expressed in dollars (or cents) per production or machine unit, derived from work measurement and based on “objective hourly rates”, appearing on the rate lists for piece work occupations, annexed to this agreement, except the employees under probationary period (Paragraph 8.02 of the Collective Agreement).
b)	Measurement is based on the execution of each element of work at a reference pace under usual and normal operation conditions. The reference pace is defined as “walking three miles per hour over smooth, level ground without load”.
An employee on measured work with a one hundred percent (100%)work assignment, including allowances forrest and personal needs (varying from 10% to 25% of work time), normally exceeds the reference pace described above by 25%.
58
c)	The piece work rates are calculated so that a one hundred percent (100%)work assignment will give an employee the opportunity to cam the objective rate.
d)	For any delay or time loss beyond his control, and for which he is not responsible, the frequency and length of which are not foreseeable (and which have not been taken into account in the machine efficiency calculations), the measured direct employee is paid the objective rate.
He reports these delays and time losses without delay and has them signed and approved by his Department Foreman, or his assistant. Such are, for example: delays resulting from waiting for work, breakdown and maintenance of machinery, power failure, etc.
e)	The total piece work earnings will be calculated weekly for each employee on a measured direct occupation, and he is guaranteed that his average hourly earnings for the week will not be lower than ninety percent (90%)of the objective rate for his occupation.
10.01MEASURED DIRECT OCCUPATIONS
e) Each employee will be informed of his guaranteed rate.
Each week, a sheet showing the following information for the preceding week will be posted in the department:
-	Occupation and employee's name
-	Objective rate
59
-	Hours worked
-	Average hourly piece work earnings
-	Total earnings (excluding shift and overtime premiums)
-	Percent pay performance (in relation to objective rate)
-	Payments for delays (included in the total earnings amount)
f)	Some occupations previously paid as measured direct occupations may be reclassified by the Company as measured indirect occupations, and paid according to provisions in Paragraph 10.02.
Also, some occupations previously paid as measured indirect or as unmeasured occupations may be reclassified by the Company as measured direct occupations, and paid according to 10.01 a) above.
In either case, the Company will submit to the Union, the data pertinent to such changes at least two weeks prior to the change, and will meet with the Union Representatives on request to explain the change.
10.02 MEASURED INDIRECT OCCUPATIONS
60
a)	Measured indirect occupations are to be paid hourly rates appearing on the rate lists for measured hourly paid occupations annexed to this agreement, except the employees under probationary period (Paragraph 8,02 of the Collecti ve Agreement), andexcept otherwise provided in Paragraph 10,03 below.
The occupations mentioned in paragraph 10.01 F) above, reclassified from measured direct to measured indirect, are also to be paid on this same basis.
Some previously unmeasured occupations, which may bejudged measurable by the Company, are also to be paid on this same basis when they have been measured.
b)	The employees on measured indirect occupations are to be given around one hundred percent (100%) work assignments as described in preceding Paragraph 10.01 b).
10,0,3 WORK ASSIGNMENT
a)	Experienced employees on measured occupations, direct or indirect shall be given around one hundred percent (100%)work assignments, as defined in the preceding Paragraph 10.01 b).
61
It is understood that, in the case of emplbyees on measured direct occupations and piece work payment, there is no obligation on the Company to offer such a work assignment, when the assignment is not available or when the employee is not capable or willing of handling such an assignment.
b)	An individual employee with a physical handicap may request a work assignment lower than one hundred percent (100%) on a measured occupation. The Company will consider each such request individually.
If the request is reasonable and the employee is on a measured direct occupation, he will be given a work assignment between 60% and 100%, as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation if practical, and he will be paid his piece-work earnings. If the employee is on a measured indirect occupation, and his request is reasonable, he will be given a work assignment between 80% and 100% as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation, and if practical, and he will be paid according to his assignment.
62
At certain processes, due to the number of productive units, isolation of equipment, etc..,, it may be impossible or impractical to implement a reduced work assignment of an employee on such a process without reducing the volume of production to the next process. Also an employee may not be capable of handling a work assignment between 90% and 100% on a measured direct occupation. In such cases, an occupational transfer for the employee will be considered in line with Article 8.10 (Permanent transfers).
Such requests for areduction in work assignments are limited to one per year for each employee and to one per occupation per month.
c)	In the case of an employee on a measured occupation, direct or indirect, who in the opinion of the Company, is not capable or willing of handling a 100% work assignment, the same conditions as in Paragraph 10.03 b) above for a reduced assignment or transfer will apply. However, before proceeding in this manner, the Company will advise the Union, giving the reasons for the contemplated change.
d)	When an employee on a measured direct occupation, who in the opinion of the Company is continually incapable of producing at the present guaranteed rate of 90 %, his guaranteed rate will then become 80% of the objective rate of his occupation.
63
However, before proceeding in this manner, the Company will advise the Union giving the reasons for such change.
Such case will be individually reviewed every six (6) months following the date of change.
10.04	MEASURED TIME VALUES
The measured time value is expressed in minutes and is the time required to perform an operation at a pace and with allowances for rest and personal needs as defined in paragraph 10.01 b) under standard conditions.
The measured time values will not be changed except if a change in the conditions result in an increase or a decrease in the work content, or if in the opinion of both parties an error has been made that would require an adjustment.
Checks are made to make sure that conditions are maintained in conformity with those used to calculate a measured time value.
10.05	INFORMATION
A copy of the job specification in force will be made available in the department. If the Company makes a change concerning an occupation, the job specification will be also made available in the department.
64
The method of calculation of wage payment may be checked by the employee personally or by his representative.
