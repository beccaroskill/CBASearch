Should a grievance arise between the Co-operative and Union or employees as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this Agreement, or as to the compliance by either party with any of its obligations under the Agreement, there shall be no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or suspension thereof by the Union or its members, or lockouts by the Co-operative on account of such grievance.
In the case of any general allegation by the Union that the Co-operative has violated this Agreement in a manner that affects broad principles rather than specific individuals, the Union Grievance Committee shall present such grievance in writing directly to the Mill Manager at Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure.
It is agreed that at the request of the Co-operative, the union Grievance Committee will meet with Management representatives to discuss any complaints or grievances that Management may have.
The time periods as stated in this article are exclusive of weekends and holidays. They may be reasonably extended by mutual agreement between the parties'hereto.

Step 1 - The employee shall be accompanied by the Chairperson or in his absence another member of the Grievance Committee, and shall submit in writing and discuss his grievance with his supervise'
The supervisor shall give his decision in writing to the employe or to the Grievance Committee member involved within forty-eight (48) hours after presentation of the grievance.
Any grievance which cannot be resolved at Step 1, above, shall be referred to the Chairperson, or in his absence, a member of the Grievance Committee and committed to writing for resolution at the next- Step.
Step 2 - If the grievance is not resolved in Step 1, the Chairperson or in his absence, another member of the Grievance Committee, shall within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the decision in Step 1, submit to the Mill Manager a signed written "Statement of Grievance" on proper forms.

Letter of Intent and/or Understanding
Truck Driver Hours
It is not the intention of Co-op Atlantic to reduce the hours of the truck drivers below an average of fifty (50) hours per week, however if conditions change and a reduction of hours is necessary, the hours will not be reduced below an average of forty (40) hours per week.
Transfer Of Work
In the event that the Co-operative transfers all or part of its operations resulting in the layoff of one or more employees, the Co-operative will endeavour to transfer the affected employee(s) if the transfer can be accommodated. The provisions of the moving and relocation allowance policy shall apply if the Cooperative offers a transfer.

Banking of hours
An employee may elect to bank his overtime earned at the applicable rate to a maximum of 24 hours. Such time must be used by the end of the four-week accounting period following the one in which it was earned or be paid out with the next pay. Requests for time off under this provision should be made (in writing) one week in advance to the employee's supervisor who will make every effort to give an answer within two days. In any event, the final decision for such leave is left with management.
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
The provisions of the Canada Labour Code will apply.
SEVERANCE PAY
Where the Co-operative terminates the employment of an employee who has completed five (5) years' service or more and the termination was not a dismissal for cause, the co-operative will pay to the employee one (1) weeks pay at his current rate for each full year of service to a maximum of twenty-five weeks.
An employee who would qualify under the above except that he is laid off rather than having his employment terminated, will qualify once his seniority rights expire. (See article eleven). An employee aged fifty-five (55) or older who is laid off may take severance pay at any time prior to or upon expiry of his seniority and in so doing, forfeits further seniority rights. He may, in addition, take early retirement, subject to the terms and conditions of the Co-op Atlantic Employees Pension Plan.
26
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that severance allowance will be paid only where termination results from technological change, aut- nation, reorganization or other similar reason beyond the control of th^_Jmployee.
Likewise, it is understood that the severance allowance will not be paid when an employee:
a)	resigns voluntarily
b)	is laid off prior to age 55 and has seniority rights
c)	is dismissed for just cause and this is not reversed through the grievance procedure
d)	has reached normal retirement age as defined in Co-op Atlantic Employee Pension Plan
e)	is offered other comparable employment within Co-op Atlantic, at the same geographic location
It is agreed that where an employee qualifies for a severance allowance under this Article, such allowance shall be paid in a lump sum to the employee, his beneficiary, or estate as the case may be.
The date of payment shall be as requested by the employee, but in no case shall this be later than twelve (12) months after the employee's last day of employment with the Co-operative.
LOST TIME DUE TO STORMY WEATHER
In cases of severe bad weather (eg. snow storms) which prevent employees generally from getting to work on time or at all, a grace period of one hour will be allowed so that employees who arrive at work within one hour of their normal starting time will suffer no loss of pay. The grace period will only apply where the Manager rules that the storm did in fact constitute "severe bad weather".
CLOTHING
The Co-operative will provide maintenance workers with coveralls as required. Mill Workers will receive two (2) pairs 'of coveralls per year, one (1) thermal pair and one (1) regular pair.

The above licence will not be a requirement for production jobs, other than maintenance, providing another person on the same shift has a valid licence. If the holder of a valid licence leaves or changes shifts and he was the only person on the shift with a valid licence, the replacement will be required to possess a valid licence unless other arrangements satisfactory to management can be made to fulfil the requirements for a licensed operator on shift.
29
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING ABSENTEEPERSONS

Emplo s appointed as absenteepersons will be required to perform any job or combination of jobs in the production area. The appointees will be paid at the Group III level.
If at any time during the life of this agreement it is determined by either party that this arrangement is unsuitable, notice will be given in writing and within thirty (30) days the previous structure and pay scale shall be restored.
