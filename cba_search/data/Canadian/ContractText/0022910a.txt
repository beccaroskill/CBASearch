ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3.01	The Union recognizes the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects except as expressly modified or restricted by this Agreement and to
5
make and alter from time to time, reasonable rules and regulations to be observed by employees, provided however, that any dispute as to the reasonableness of such rules and regulations or any dispute involving claims of discrimination, inequity, or unfairness against any employee in the application of such rules and regulations shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement.
3.02	The Company shall have the right to hire; to discipline, demote and discharge employees for just and sufficient cause; and to direct the workforce, provided however, that any exercise of these rights in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
3.03	The Company shall not exercise its right to direct the workforce in a discriminatory, inequitable or unfair manner.
SUPERVISORS AND SALARIED EMPLOYEES
3.04	Supervisors and other salaried employees shall serve in these capacities and they shall not be allowed to work on operations performed by employees coming under the scope of this Agreement, except to assist in emergency situations; a necessary demonstration of operations; studying or testing equipment; or putting new equipment into operation. The Company shall actively discourage Supervisors from performing work assigned to employees covered by this Agreement except as provided above.
CONTRACTING OUT
3.05	The Company recognizes the Union’s concern over “contracting out” by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the
6
employees. Use of contractors will be kept to a minimum with the exception of capital, major repair maintenance (R & M) work and emergency work.
The Company will, therefore, having due regard to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services and to operating efficiency and the time to do the work, make efforts to limit the amount of future work to be “contracted out” during this agreement.

e)	Any employee who accepts layoff in lieu of a transfer to another department or is laid off on the basis of General Seniority shall continue to accumulate General Seniority and shall be eligible for recall to work for a period not exceeding twenty-four (24) months after which the layoff shall be deemed to be permanent and his employment terminated.
f)	The laid off employee shall leave his address with the Company and shall notify the Company of any change of address.
g)	The reasonable trial or training period as referred to in Article 9.02, does not apply in the case of layoff and recall and restoration of the workforce, except for permanent reductions in the workforce, or layoff in excess of six (6) months, as outlined below. For other than permanent reductions in the workforce or layoff in excess of six (6) months, a senior employee will be entitled to a three-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. It is understood the Company may refuse to grant three-day familiarization period if it can demonstrate that the employee could not meet the requirements of the job even if a three-day familiarization period were granted. An employee who fails to meet the requirements of the job during the three-day familiarization period in a job at bid level or above will be eligible to displace a junior employee in a position below bid level who filled the vacancy as per 11.04(d) on the basis of General Seniority. The three-day familiarization period will be three normal work days for the individual based on the weekly work schedule in effect
55
for the classification in which the period of familiarization is being offered whether it be on the 8, 10 or 12-hour schedules.
In the event of a permanent reduction of the workforce, or lay off in excess of six (6) months, senior employees who are displaced from their Department and are not qualified for other vacancies identified as per
11.04	(d) at the time of the reduction, will be allowed a reasonable trial or training period not exceeding thirty (30) working days in one of these vacancies for which they are eligible based on General Seniority. If an employee fails to meet the requirements of the job during the trial and training period he will be laid-off or may displace a junior employee at or below bid level on the basis of General seniority. If an indefinite lay off becomes a permanent lay off, those employees affected will have their eligibility for work determined based on their status at the time the lay off or reduction commenced, including the thirty (30) day trial or training period as outlined above.
RECALL OF THE WORKFORCE
11.05	A laid off employee who fails to report for work to the Company’s office within ten days after receiving notification of recall by registered mail or telegram unless he requests and receives an additional ten days extension during the ten days, shall forfeit his seniority and right to recall. This period will be extended if disability prevents immediate return if the employee notifies the Company of the personal disability within the ten-day period.
11.06	If at the time of the layoff the Company gives an employee a definite date upon which he is to return to work, notification will not be necessary and failure to
56
return upon the designated date shall constitute a voluntary termination of employment as of the date of layoff.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
11.07	When an employee is laid off the Company may require that he be examined by the Company physician to determine his physical condition and upon recall shall be re-examined by the physician. If the layoff has continued for thirty days or more or if he has been involved in an accident during the layoff, he shall be eligible to return to work if he is physically capable of performing the work for which he is recalled. The physician’s fee will be paid by the Company.
11.08	A copy of the physician’s verification of the employee’s fitness to return to work shall be furnished to the Company, the Union and the employee involved.
LAYOFF DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
11.09	An employee with five or more years of General Seniority who is laid off as a result of technological change, as defined by the Trade Union Act 1994, or permanent property closure, shall receive a severance payment of one week’s pay (40 hours) at the employee’s base wage at the time of layoff, for each complete year of accumulated service prior to this layoff, up to a maximum of thirteen weeks’ pay. In the event an employee who received a severance payment as provided above, is recalled within the period covered by the payment (maximum of thirteen weeks), he shall repay a prorated amount of the severance payment based upon the date of recall.Subject to the mutual written agreement between the Company and the Union, employees subject to layoff
57
because of technological change, will be entitled to retrain in other job assignments within the scope of this Agreement. The parties agree that for the purpose of this agreement, the term “significant numbers” as referred to in the Trade Union Act shall mean one or more persons, and as such any provisions outlined in this agreement or in the Trade Union Act shall apply should a technological change effect one or more employees.
EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN
11.10	In the event of an emergency shutdown (seven days or less), selection of employees to be retained and scheduling of work will be done by the Company in consultation with the Union in the manner best judged to expedite the work and return to operation as early as possible.
11.11	Selection of employees in such circumstances will be made in a fair and equitable manner. Senior qualified employees shall be given full consideration.
11.12	Whenever possible, the Union will be advised in writing in advance of the shutdown.
BASIS OF RECALL
11.13	(a) Employees will be recalled from layoff on the basis of their General Seniority and ability to perform the work for which they are being recalled.
(b) An employee who lost his job assignment due to a reduction of the workforce or layoff will be required to return to that job assignment when it next becomes vacant on the basis of General Seniority, unless he has since been awarded a posted job, or has been displaced for more than 24 months; however, when a vacancy occurs in a Department, preference to fill the vacancy will be given to
58
a qualified employee with more General Seniority who was displaced from his job for 24 months or less due to a layoff or reduction of the workforce, until there is a vacancy in his former job assignment.
(c) The Company will not be required to post such vacancies until all eligible employees have been returned to their former job assignments.
MAINTENANCE OF RATE
11.14	(a) An employee who is demoted due to a reduction in the workforce will maintain his base rate of pay for a maximum of twelve calendar months from the original date of demotion providing he has three years of service in the classification he was demoted from.
(b)	An employee who is laid off due to a reduction in the workforce and is subsequently recalled into a lower paying classification within twelve calendar months from the original date of layoff, will maintain the base rate of pay he had at the time of layoff for the remainder of the twelve calendar month period providing he has three years of service in the classification he was laid off from.
(c)	An employee who is demoted due to a technological change as outlined in Article 11.09, will maintain his base rate for a maximum of eighteen calendar months from the original date of demotion providing he has three years of service with the Company. An employee who is maintaining his rate in accordance with this provision shall be required to accept any higher paying permanent vacancy in the department he was demoted from providing he has the seniority and qualifications to fill that classification. Failure to do so will result in the loss of these rate maintenance provisions.

RE: BENEFITS - LONG TERM DISABILITY
The parties hereby agree to a Long Term Disability Plan, which will provide a total benefit payable of 55% of the employee’s base wage at the date of disability to take effect on expiration of the STD plan.The program will be comprised of two plans:
Plan A
An employee paid plan at a benefit level of 38.5% of base wages. This plan will be fully funded by the employee and as such, any benefits received will not be subject to Income Tax deductions. Premiums will be deducted on a biweekly basis. The employee is responsible for the continuation of payment of LTD premiums while absent from work for any reason except while receiving benefits from the plan.
Plan B
An employer paid plan at a benefit level of 16.5% of base wages. This plan will be fully funded by the Company and as such, any benefits received will be subject to Income Tax deductions.
Any CPP or other applicable offsets will be proportionately applied to both Plans as outlined in the plan text.
107
Premiums are reviewed on a calendar year basis and are set based on experience and expenses within the Plan. A summary of this review will be provided to the Local union representatives.
The Company also agrees that they will continue to administer the LTD program and will continue to explore securing other insurance carriers that will provide the adjudication of claims in a timely and cost effective manner.
It is further agreed that the Company will not pursue any additional cost sharing of other benefit plans including medical, dental, life insurance and vision care programs.
This letter supercedes the LTD plan described in the Benefit Summary of the Collective Agreement for the life of this agreement.
The Company further agrees it will consult with the Union prior to any changes in the LTD premiums of the employee paid plan.
This agreement will expire on April 30, 2011, or until a new agreement is signed.

RE: VACATION PAYOUT ELECTION OPTION
Pursuant to Article 6.05 (c) it is agreed that for the vacation year, in anticipation of a vacation shutdown, the Company will pay out all outstanding vacation monies earned up to and including May 30th of each year for the life of this Agreement.
This payout will occur on June 30th of each year for the life of this Agreement, however an employee may elect, in writing by May 31, to have his available vacation pay allotment paid out when he takes his vacation time. The formula to be used is the total vacation earnings divided by the number of entitled vacation hours. If the employee makes this election, the vacation earnings will be paid in the applicable pay period in which the employee utilized vacation hours.
Manpower requirements and scheduling of vacation will be in accordance with Article 6.05 (a). Employees will be required to take their vacation allotment prior to June 30 of each year. Those who do not schedule their vacation will have it scheduled by the Company given one (1) month’s notice.

RE: SHORTENED WORKWEEK - PUBLIC HOLIDAY SCHEDULING
The parties agree the provisions of this Memorandum of Agreement, when applied, supersede Article 8.08(a), 8.16(b), or any other provisions, which may be deemed to be in conflict.
It is agreed, for the life of the new Collective Agreement the following provisions will apply:
When a public holiday falls on an employee’s scheduled day off, the Company may schedule another day off without pay during the pay period in which the public holiday falls. In such an event, shortened workweek overtime will not be paid regardless of which week in the pay period the other day off is scheduled.
However, when the Company chooses to schedule another day off as above, it shall be consecutive with the employee’s other scheduled days off in the pay period, and unless the holiday falls during an operating cycle the day off will be scheduled to tie in with the holiday weekend.
Notwithstanding Article 6.09, if another day off is scheduled the pay for the public holiday, as above, will be the greater of base
113
rate times 8 hours or times the hours which would have been scheduled on the other day off.
The Company will post a weekly work schedule on the Monday prior to the start of the workweek, and such will indicate the scheduling of another day off, if any.
This agreement will expire on April 30, 2011, or until a new agreement is signed.

RE: COOPERATIVE WAGE STUDY (CWS)
This letter of intent is designed for the purpose of re-affirming the basic principles of the Cooperative Wage Study Program (referred to as C.W.S.). This re-affirmation is necessary because of recent trends within the workforce that employees feel that C.W.S. is to be used as a detailed job description used to determine one’s day-to-day job duties.
The following principles are statements cited from the Job Description and Classification Manual published in August 1971 by the United Steelworkers of America - AFL - CIO CLC:
a) Significant details concerning the function and requirements of each job shall be set forth in a job description, which shall:
-	Provide a means of identifying the job under consideration, the processes, equipment, and products with which it is concerned, and shall serve only as a basis from which to classify the job.
-	Reflect the general details considered necessary to describe the principal functions of the job identified and shall not be construed as a detailed description of all the work requirements that may be inherent in the job.
115
- Provide, together with the reasons for the classification, the basis from which to judge changes in the job content which may result from new or changed conditions when such are established from time to time.
b) The job classification of a job shall serve only to assign the job into a proper job class for application of the standard hourly wage scale.
In summary, these principles outlined are designed solely for the purposes of determining wage rates and not to provide any basis for determining the day-to-day job activities of any individual employee. Referring to the term “inherent” as outlined on the bottom of each job description, this term is defined as: Job duties that have been common to a particular job prior to the implementation of C.W.S., whether they were specifically addressed in the job description or not, shall continue to be part of that particular job.
This agreement will expire on April 30, 2011, or until a new agreement is signed.

It is understood and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement are better than the provisions of the law.
This agreement will expire on April 30, 2011, or until a new agreement is signed.

RE: SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS
Whereas the Corporation has proposed to USW Local Union 7458 the implementation of the Safety Improvement Process known as “SIP” as a means to improve safety and prevent accidents on site by reducing employee exposure to risk; and the USW Local Union 7458 is prepared to accept the implementation of said program within certain guidelines as agreed to between the parties; the implementation and application of the SIP program is as follows;
IT IS HEREBY AGREED THAT THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES WILL GOVERN THE APPLICATION OF SIP:
Neither the United Steelworkers (USW) nor USW Local Union 7458 has endorsed or is now endorsing BST or any of their products or services. The USW and USW Local Union 7458 have agreed to participate in a pilot project at the Cory Mine site in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, of the safety improvement process (SIP) from BST. References to the USW or USW Local Union 7458 by BST or PCS as union endorsement or approval of SIP or any other BST products or services will result in the termination of the pilot project known as SIP at the Cory Mine site.
The SIP will enlist the skill, knowledge and commitment of the workforce by utilizing the Hazard Based Hierarchy of Controls and
131
identifying and correcting safety hazards and will not assume that worker’s behaviors are the primary cause of workplace accidents.
The OHC will monitor SIP at Cory. All findings and recommendations by the Facilitator or generated through the SIP program will be reviewed and discussed with the OHC and the General Manager or his designate prior to any further dissemination or discussion. The Facilitator will report to the General Manager and make monthly reports at the OHC meetings and the USW Local 7458 monthly meetings. Upon implementation of the SIP program, all behavioral-based safety programs at the Cory site will cease to exist.
The selection of the members of any of the committees created under the SIP program, including a Steering committee, shall be the subject of discussions involving the company, the USW local 7458, and the Facilitator. The members of any committees shall be chosen by a consensus of these three parties.
All orientation and training of the Facilitator or employees on the Steering Committee or any employee volunteering to receive training in the SIP process that constitutes overtime shall be paid as outlined in the CBA. The Facilitator will receive a one day orientation to the USW position on behaviour-based safety and hazard identification prepared by the USW and paid for by the company.
General SIP information sessions will be provided to all employees on company time and will include an orientation to the USW position on behaviour-based safety and hazard identification and its involvement in SIP prepared by USW. This USW portion will not exceed 2 hours duration.
Analysts in the SIP are volunteers who are committed to improving the safety of their coworkers. Typically they volunteer for a two-year period and have the ability to withdraw their participation should they not be able to commit to the program.
Participation in SIP is voluntary. No recommendation, observation, or any other activity associated with or part of any employee involvement in SIP will result in discipline.
132
In selecting a Facilitator for the Safety Improvement Process (SIP), the parties agree to use the revised guidelines for selecting a suitable SIP Facilitator as established by BST and their North American clients. Issues unique to this location will be addressed as follows:
•	Performance Dimensions for the hourly SIP Facilitator, including Safety Performance, Personal Characteristics, Abilities, Knowledge, and Experience shall be determined by the joint Selection Committee (Union-Management).
•	The Selection Committee will consist of three (3) USW Local Union 7458 appointed members and two (2) management members and will jointly develop a shortlist of candidates. The General Manager will make the final selection decision.
•	When the parties determine a new SIP Facilitator is required, the selection committee process will be utilized.
•	The job classification and rate for the SIP facilitator will be determined by the CWS.
•	The SIP Facilitator shall work Day Shift (8:00 am to 4:00 pm, Monday to Friday).The SIP Facilitator may be required to work overtime and this must be pre-approved by the General Manager.
•	The initial SIP Facilitator selected will work a 3-year term subject to terms and conditions below and renewal of this LOA.
•	The SIP Facilitator will continue to accumulate departmental seniority from the department from whence he came and all applicable provisions of the collective agreement will apply.
•	The SIP Facilitator will receive a probationary review immediately following 3 months in the role. The format and content of the review will be established and implemented by the General Manager jointly with the President of USW Local 7458.
•	The Facilitator will return to his original position upon receipt of 4 weeks’ written notice from the General Manager, the Facilitator, or the USW Local 7458. The company agrees
133
to absorb the cost of replacing the SIP Facilitator until such time as a position in that job classification retires, resigns, or bids out via attrition.
•	The provisions of Article 10.21 will not apply.
•	During short term layoff periods (not exceeding 5 weeks), no person shall be eligible to bump the SIP Facilitator.
During the term of this Letter of Agreement, the parties agree to address in good faith any problems that are identified by the USW or the company with respect to the contents, rules, and application to SIP.
Within 30 days after this agreement is signed, representatives of the USW and the company will meet to establish criteria for an evaluation of the SIP program at Cory Division, said evaluation to commence no later than 6 months after the agreement is signed or 2 months prior to the termination date of the current collective agreement, whichever comes first, and to be completed prior to the termination date.
This letter of understanding will expire on April 30, 2011 or until a new agreement is signed. This agreement may be cancelled by ether party with 4 weeks written notice. Should this LOU expire or this agreement be terminated, the SIP program will end.

RE: CO-GEN OPERATOR WAGES
The parties to the PCS/United Steelworkers Local 7458 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) agree that special market considerations exist which affect the Corporation’s ability to recruit and retain Co-Gen Operators (2nd Class ticketed).
In recognition of this the parties agree to adjust Co-Gen Operator wages via a “Market Adjustment” which recognizes market demand and influences. The “Market Adjustment” will be implemented to reflect a new hourly rate of pay. The term of the agreement will correspond to the term of the current CBA. Employees eligible for the “Market Adjustment” will also be eligible for any collectively bargained wage increase (applied on a percentage basis) and the special COLA provision.
It is agreed by both parties that prevailing market conditions will effect rates of pay during the next round of negotiations and this market adjustment and process falls outside of Co-operative Wage Study (CWS) process as described in Article 15 of the collective bargaining agreement.
Both parties agree that the facility will be staffed whenever possible with 2nd Class Engineers. Any 3rd Class Engineers hired
147
to the site will be hired under the provisions of the CBA, which recognizes that 3rd Class ticketed Engineers will only work at the Co-Gen facility with a 2nd Class permit, to be issued under The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Act and that the hourly rate will reflect Job Class 24 (JC24) contained in the CBA.3rd Class Engineers working with a 2nd Class permit will remain at JC24 until they obtain their full 2nd Class ticket and they will not be eligible for the “Market Adjustment” while working with a 2nd class permit. Job Class 24 rates are:
May 1,2008 $35.899 May 1,2009 $37,875 May 1,2010 $39,957
If the Company decides that 3rd Class Engineers are to be hired on site as 3rd Class Engineers, both parties agree that a job description shall be drafted and the CWS process will be invoked to determine Job Class and wage.
Any new-hire hired as a 3rd Class Engineer and permitted to 2nd Class status, who fails to acquire their 2nd Class Engineer ticket as per the provisions in their offer letter of employment, will be laid off in accordance with the layoff provisions contained in the collective agreement. The union will receive a copy of the offer letter of employment, if this situation occurs.
In recognition of the additional responsibilities and duties performed by the 2nd Class Co-Gen Operators prior to and until the re-organization of supervisory structures by the end of 2006, the Company and Union CWS Committee hereby agree to amend the job factoring for 2nd Class Co-Gen Operators to JC27 for the period from May 7, 2002 until the job description changes, after the re-organization of supervisory structures.
Furthermore, the parties agree that final classification as agreed upon through the CWS process for changes to the 2nd Class CoGen Operator job after the end of 2006 will alter this level and
148
that both parties agree to recognize the final results of the CWS review, or submit the issue to arbitration by normal procedures should mutual agreement not be reached. The review will only establish a job classification that will allow the Company to correctly return the 2nd Class Co-Gen Operators to the proper job classification and wage level, only if the market adjustment is no longer required.
The rate of pay for the Co-Gen Operator will be as follows:
Co-Gen Operator
2nd Class Steam Engineers
Rate of Pay effective May 1,2008 Rate of Pay effective May 1,2009 Rate of Pay effective Mayl, 2010
$44.084
$46.509
$49.067
This agreement will expire on April 30, 2011, or until a new collective agreement is signed.

Purpose
The Individual Wage Security Account (the “Account”) is designed to assist Employees of the Cory Division of the Corporation who are members of the USW, Local 7458 (“Employees”) by allowing them to withdraw a weekly amount from their Accounts during times of layoff. The Plan will also allow the Employee to, in February of each year, withdraw any monies in excess of $2500.00.
Trustee
(a)	A Committee consisting of two representatives selected by PCS Inc., Cory Division and two representatives selected by the Cory Local 7458 (the “Committee”) will select an appropriate financial institution to act as Trustee and will negotiate a Trust Agreement with said Trustee.
(b)	All contributions to each Employee’s Account will be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee will hold such contributions and income earned thereon as a separate trust account for exclusive benefit of each Employee.
(c)	The Trustee will invest the funds upon the advice of the committee.Funds in the individual Accounts may be comingled with each other and with those under any similar plan or plans, and treated as a consolidated fund (the “Fund”) for investment purposes only.
(d)	The Trustee shall credit net earnings from such investments to the Employee’s Account in proportion to the balance in his account from time to time.
150
(e)	The Trustee, or its duly authorized agent, shall manage and administer the trust. The Trustee shall have the right to use PCS Inc., Cory Division or any of its employees as its agent in consultation with the Committee. In addition to the powers and duties as may be provided in the trust agreement.
(1) As soon as is practicable after January 1st of each year, the Trustee shall furnish each employee with a statement of the balance in his Account as of December 31st of the preceding year.
Contributions
Each active full-time Employee receives a fixed number of hours of paid disability (sick leave) per year. When the unused total amount of such hours has accumulated to 120 hours, any additional hours will be converted to dollar ($) value (number of hours X base rate less any applicable deductions) at the end of each year and paid into the Account of each Employee. The Account of each Employee shall accumulate until a minimum of $2,500.00 is reached. An Employee whose Account is greater than $2,500.00 may each year during the month of January, elect to either leave the money in the Account with withdraw a cash payment of all accumulated monies in excess of $2,500.00.
Contributions will be calculated as at December 31st each year and then forwarded to the Trustee following processing of the payroll. No part of the contribution under the Plan or income from such contribution shall be recoverable by PCS Inc., Cory Division.
Cost of Administration
The Trustee shall be paid such reasonable compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the Committee and the Trustee. All expenses of the Trust, including reasonable legal fees and the compensation of the Trustee, and all taxes of any nature whatsoever including interest and penalties assessed against or imposed upon the Trust or the fund or the income thereof, shall be paid out of the earnings of the Employees’ Accounts and shall constitute a prorata charge upon this Account.
151
Benefits
An Employee shall be an “eligible Employee” to receive payment from his account for each week he is on layoff, provided that the layoff is for a period of a minimum of seven (7) days in that week, due to his being laid off by PCS Inc., Cory Division. Layoff does not include absences from work for disciplinary reasons, strikes, vacation shutdowns, slowdowns, work stoppages, walkouts, lockouts or any other form of work stoppage owing to a labour dispute, nor does it include any absences from work due to sickness, injury of leave of absence for any other reason.
Requests by eligible Employees for payments from individual Accounts shall be made to the Trustee or the Trustee’s duly authorized agent, in writing no later than the last day of layoff, on the form prescribed by the Committee. Each payment shall be in the net amount of $150.00 for each week of benefit, unless the balance remaining in the Employee’s individual Account is less than $150.00, in which case the entire remaining balance shall be paid out for that week. The benefit of $150.00 shall constitute one week of supplementary benefit and the benefit shall be paid every second week.
An Employee shall be an “eligible Employee” only if he is a fulltime active Employee on the day prior to the layoff taking place, or is otherwise entitled to receive Unemployment Insurance Benefits (UIC) due to disability insurance expiring during the term of his layoff period.
Final Settlement of Security Accounts
All funds in an Employee’s Account shall be paid within three (3) months; a) to the Employee upon retirement, b) to the Employee in the event of his employment being terminated, c) upon the Employee’s death, to the beneficiary named in the written designation filed with the Trustee prior to payment or if no such designation is in effect, the Employee’s estate. Each employee or his beneficiary may file with the Trustee a written designation in
152
the form prescribed by the Trustee, to receive payment from his Account in the event of his death.
In addition to the above, the 120 retained hours multiplied by the employee’s base rate will be paid out upon death or retirement.
Deduction
Any contributions to an Employee’s account will be net of any deductions such as income tax, CPP, etc., which must be made by reason of any Federal, Provincial, or Municipal law or regulation from pay at source. PCS Inc., Cory Division shall have the right to make such deductions and pay only the balance to the Employee’s account.
Cash Payouts
On or before January 20th of each year, each Employee with more than $2,500.00 in his Account may elect to be paid in cash any amount in excess of $2,500.00. Payment of such excess will be made in February of each year provided requests are received prior to January 20th of said year.
