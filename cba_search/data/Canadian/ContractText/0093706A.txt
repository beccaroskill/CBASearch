the grievance shall be reduced in writing and presented to the Supervisor.

The Shop Manager shall give his written reply to the Union within 3 working days of such meeting. If the Shop Manager's reply is not satisfactory, the next step must be taken within a reasonable period of time after the delivery of the Shop Manager's reply to the Union.

Step No. 3
