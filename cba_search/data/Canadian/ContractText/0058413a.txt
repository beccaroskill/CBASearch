(D)	ReplacementOperator-A Replacement Operator is an employee
who replaces a Regular Operator or other Replacement Operator during their temporary absence due to sickness, vacation, assigned days off, or other similar cause. The Replacement Operator will have the same rights and obligationsof the job for the days he is on the job as if he were the regular operator, but he shall not have the rights and obligations of any other replacementj ob he may have for those days. When there is more than one operator on a shift or days, a ReplacementOperatorwill not have priority over the Regular Operator for any overtime assignments.
A Regular Operator who also holds a Replacement job will not have the rights and obligations of his Regularjob for the day he is working on his Replacementjob. Replacement of Regular Operators Rate 5 or higher will be made from Replacements (in order of priority) who have receivedtheirjobs in accordance with Article 11 (A) (7) as a result of a bulletin. When a Replacementoperator is replacinga Regular operator for one calendar week, he shall have no rights to his otherjobs for that seven day period.
When there is more than one ReplacementOperator for a job the priority of the Operators shall be indicated as Replacement Operator No. 1, Replacement Operator No.2, - etc., and such priority shall be indicated on the job bulletinwhen the vacancy is posted. A ReplacementOperator regularly on shift work is limited to that job, i.e.: he may not hold another Regular Job or Replacementjob. Similarly, a Regular Operator regularly on shift work is limited to that job.
A day worker is limited to holding one replacementj ob plus a regular job within the division or is limited to holding two replacement jobs.
(E)	Work Schedules-
A work schedule is to be posted on the bulletin board in each departmenton Thursday on which is shown the plannedworking days and shifts, for the followingweek. This schedule will indicate"assignedday off and "down days", if any, and in the event that any work which is Rate 2 or higher shown on this schedule is to be performed by an employee at overtime rates then such work will be scheduled to the Regular Operator or the Replacementoperator enjoying the rightsof the RegularOperator unless it is assigned in accordancewith Article 6 (C).
16
As an exception to the preceding paragraph the existing system of scheduling week-end reliefand days off will continue. The presentcommon practiceisthe scheduling of the 3 -11 shift Saturdayto Replacement Operators three Saturdays out of four, with the 4th such shift being scheduled to the Regular Operators. There are exceptionsto this general rule in various departments and in situations where Replacement Operators are not available.
The schedule may be changed by the supervisor by advising the man concerned at least “25” hours before the shift or day concerned for an assigned day off or down day change if such change is caused by production demands, or by at least "17" hours notice if the change is for any other reason, provided, however, that not withstanding the foregoing, no notice of a change in schedule is required if caused by serious breakdown. In any of these cases, the additional time worked is not on a "call back" basis. When an employee has had his schedule changed he will be given at least 17 hours notice from his previously scheduled starting time. Without 17 hours notice the employee will receive overtime rates and the time scheduled will be included in calculating the workweek under Article 7(A).
Assigned Day Off is a day of relief from the regularjob assigned to an employee to conform to the recognized work week.
When owing to a change in the work schedule and the employee has not been advised that regular work is not available and reports for work, he will be supplied with at least four hours work or pay, at straight time on week days, but such time will not be included in the work week. If on a Sunday or holiday or assigned day off, his work will be treated as a call back. The above does not apply in the case of a serious breakdown.
When an employee is required to come in to work ahead of his regular starting time he will be given twelve (12) hours warning. Without twelve (12) hours warning his early starting time will be on a call back basis.
Exceptas otherwise provided, when employeesare scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs, they will beguaranteed8 hoursworkor pay in lieu thereof.
All employees assigned to work at overtime rates, who are scheduled for 8 hourswork on their regularjobs are not requiredto work 8 hours because of lack of work ontheirjob will be guaranteed at Ieast4 hourswork or pay on a call back basis.
(F)	For reasons of product demand or efficiency, assigned days off and
down days will be determined by the supervisor concerned. Recognizing that employees would like their two days off consecutively, the supervisor will
17
prepare the schedules accordingly when feasible, providing additional cost is not incurred.

RE: MECHANICAL DIVISION
1)	If more permanent employees are required in another shop the Company will discuss the possibilitiesof a permanent transfer with the Union before positionsfor new apprentices or employees are posted in the shop requiring the additional employees.
2)	If it is found necessary to reduce the work force in any of the mechanical shops the Company will meet with the Union in an attempt to reach a satisfactory method of displacing employees. It is recognized that if skill and ability to perform the work are equal then seniority will govern.
3)	If a yard hand performingduties of a mechanical helper has been working on a job for all or most of the day and there is overtime involved on this job, the most senior yard hand will be afforded the first opportunity and so forth by seniority to stay on overtime, provided no regular member of the shop concerned wishes to avail himself of the overtime.
The above only applies to a yard hand working with a regular member of the shop concerned.
4)	For callbacks, Utility Mechanicswill be used only after the regular employees of the shop concerned.
The sequence would be:
1)	Regular employees of shop concerned by seniority.(Apprentices are consideredto be Regular employees of the shop concerned.)
2)	Regular or replacement Utility Mechanic on the job.
3)	Regular Utility Mechanic on his assigned day off.
4)	Regular Utility Mechanic in order of seniority.
5)	Replacement Utility Mechanic in order of priority.

Memorandum re: Make Up Shifts
The Make-up shift provision will be applied when an employee is unable to complete his scheduled shift as a result of number of consecutive hours worked and being subsequently sent home by his supervisor.
Employee will be scheduled to work the hours lost, beyond his normal scheduled hours.
His schedule will be posted as part of the normal weekly schedule on Thursday for the following week with the understanding that the work will be scheduled on a day that otherwise would be an assigned day off.
Hours worked will be excluded from the calculation of the workweek for the purposes of calculating overtime. (In the event, the work is scheduled for the weekend then the hours worked would be paid on the basis cf the weekend overtime premium of time and one half).
The scheduling of work will be done as soon as reasonably practicable.
If the employee declines the scheduled work or fails to report for work on the scheduled day, then he forgoes his rights under this memorandum.
Make-up shifts will not interferewith normal scheduling and call-in procedures.
It is agreed that the Union would not process any grievance on behalf of any employee once the make-up shift provision has been administered as described above.

Pension Pop Up
An example of how a pop-up pension would work:
Example
Employee approaches retirementand requestsoption forms
The administrator calculatesthe Normal form of Pension
Let's assume that based on the employee's age, serviceand salary that the
monthly pensionworks out to be $1500.00 payablefor life.
Joint and 60% Survivor Pension (No Pop-up)
Let's also assume that based on the employee'sage, service and salary that the pension payable as a Joint and 60% survivor pension is$1350.00. Then in the event of the retiree's death priorto his spouse, his spouse would receive a pension of $810.00 per month for the remainder of her life. If the spouse dies before the retiree, then the retiree continues to receive $1350.00 per month for the rest of his life.
Joint and 60% Survivor Pension (with Pop-up)
Based on the employee'sage, service and salary, the monthly pension payable as a Joint and 60% survivor pension with pop-up is$1335.00 per month. Then, in the event of the retiree'sdeath priorto his spouse, his spouse would receive $801.00 per monthforthe remainder of her life. Ifthe spouse dies before the retiree, then the retiree's pensionwould pop-up to the normal form amount of $1500.00 per month from the date of his spouse's death for the remainder of his life.
All forms have been calculated as being actuarially equivalent to the normal form.
