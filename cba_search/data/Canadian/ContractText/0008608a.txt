1:04(A)
The Company recognizes the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada (C.A.W. -Canada), as the collective bargaining agent for all crewmembers, excluding captains, on scallop vessels owned and/or chartered by the Company operating out of Nova Scotia ports.
NOTE: The Company withdrew its proposal to have the Mates and Chief Engineers excluded, provided the Agreement recorded that such withdrawal is without prejudice to the Company’s right to make application to the Labour Relations Board at any time during the currency of the Collective Agreement to exclude such positions from the Bargaining Unit, and, if successful, such positions will be so excluded effective the date of the Board’s order.
The Company shall not make any individual agreement with the crew directly or indirectly in conflict with this agreement.
Where any fisheries other than scallop fishing areas entered into involving new species, methods of catching, or requiring a different method of settlement, either party on notice to the other may request appropriate amendment or additions to the contract. Failing settlement, matters in dispute shall be referred to arbitration upon ten (10) days’ notice by either party.
It is recognized by the Union and its members that mates and chiefs, while members of the bargaining unit, are in fact ships officers and responsible for the exercise of certain management functions, which functions do not include the final authority to hire, fire, suspend, promote or demote. They will exercise these duties
5
Riverport Fleet Agreement - 2002-2004
and responsibilities as established by the Company and maintain discipline and efficiency. Membership in a bargaining unit is not to restrict mates and chiefs in the proper performance of their duties.

1.	pilotage, safety and navigation of the vessel;
2.	supervision, as required of the crew;
3.	responsible to the Captain for the overall cost efficient operation
of the vessel;
4.	direction of the crew when handling raw material at sea to ensure
the highest standards of quality;
1:04(C) Without limiting the generality of 1:04 (A) the prime responsibility of the Engineer is to efficiently operate and maintain the engine room equipment and to maintain other mechanical and electrical equipment on board the vessels and to promote the highest level of maintenance and safety. Engineers shall be directly responsible to the Captain while at sea for the efficient operation and maintenance of those areas of the vessel which are the responsibility of the engineers.

feminine and the singular shall include the plural as the context may require.

ARTICLE 13
13:01
When the Captain of a vessel is assigned to a bare boat his crew shall be transferred with him.
The parties agree to maintain a relief priority list to include crewmembers who relieve on scallop vessels. Relieving crewmembers shall be ranked on the basis of the number of trips sailed and shall be called in relief in that order. Subject to the rights of displaced regular crew members to obtain relief trips, the Reliever List shall contain a maximum of eighteen (18) relieving crew members, i.e. crew members who have not held regular positions on Company vessels. Relief priority based on the total number of trips will be determinative of the opportunity to fill permanent vacancies within the fleet and attain seniority as a regular crewmember.
Relieving crewmembers who are called for a trip and refuse to sail without just cause, communicated at the time they are called, shall be placed at the bottom of the list. It is further agreed that where the Company has less than six (6) hours’ notice of the need for a relieving crewmember, and none are at the port seeking a trip at sea, the Company may call the crewmember who resides closest to the plant. If no one on the relief list is available within twenty (20) miles of the vessel awaiting a crewmember, the Company may take on a new crewmember if available.
- SAFETY
Any work necessary for the safety of the vessel, crew, cargo or tow, for the saving of other ships or lives, shall be performed at any time on immediate call by all crewmembers notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement which might be construed to the contrary.

FISHERY PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED BARGAINING UNIT PENSION PLAN
INTRODUCTION
Having sufficient income to meet your financial needs when you reach retirement age is increasingly important to all Canadians. Your government benefits, such as the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security, will meet part of your requirements, but in order to face the challenge of maintaining a comfortable lifestyle after retirement, other sources of income are necessary. One important additional source of income is your Fishery Products International Limited (FPI) Pension Plan for unionized employees. This Plan, combined with government benefits and your own savings, will go a long way toward ensuring a secure retirement.

Participation in the Pension Plan is mandatory for all employees who are members of the Fishermen, Food and Allied Workers Union or CAW Canada, who have been employed continuously for two years by FPI and have reached age 21. You will be notified by the Human Resources Department when you are eligible to join.
WHAT DOES THE PLAN COST?
FPI pays all costs related to the Pension Plan, including its administration.
WHEN DO PENSION BENEFITS START?
Your normal retirement date is the first day of the month following your
49
Riverport Fleet Agreement - 2002-2004
65th. birthday. If your birthday falls on the first day of a month, your Pension begins that day.
You can also retire anytime following your 55th. birthday, but the monthly amount of Pension you receive will be reduced by 6% for each full year prior to your normal retirement date. For example, if your normal retirement date is June 1, 1998 and your actual date of retirement is June 1, 1996, your monthly Pension benefit will be reduced by 12%.
HOW IS MY PENSION DETERMINED?
Your Pension is based on a system of units. If you work in a plant each unit is equal to 1,800 hours of work. If you work on a trawler, 120 sea-days is equal to a unit. You may earn up to 1.5 units in any calendar year. If you work less than 1,800 hours in a plant or 120 days at sea, you will receive a portion of a unit. For example, 900 hours of plant work or 60 days at sea is equal to half a unit.
At the time of your retirement, each unit is equal to $10 of monthly Pension. For example, if you have been a member of the Plan for 30 years when you reach age 65 and have accumulated 40 units during that period, the Plan will pay you $400 a month. In any case, if you have been employed for five or more years by FPI, you are guaranteed a minimum Pension of $50 a month.

HOW WILL THE BENEFIT BE PAID?
Once you retire, you will receive your Pension every month for the balance of your life. In addition, if you are married and die before your husband or wife, the surviving spouse will continue to receive an amount equal to 60% of your monthly Pension for as long as he or she lives.
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PENSION IF I DIE AFTER RETIREMENT?
If you die within the first five years after retirement, the balance of the Pension for that five year period will be paid to your spouse or the person you have named as your beneficiary. If your spouse is still alive at the end of the five year period, he or she will continue to receive payments each month equal to 60% of your full Pension.
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DIE BEFORE I RETIRE?
The value of your Pension at the time of death will be calculated and paid to your beneficiary as a lump sum.
ARE THERE OTHER PENSION OPTIONS AVAILABLE?
Yes. You may choose a Pension that provides for a longer guarantee period or a Pension that provides a higher proportion of your full Pension for your surviving spouse. The amount of your Pension will be adjusted to reflect the option you select. See your Human Resources Department for details.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I LEAVE FPI BEFORE RETIREMENT?
If you have been a member of the Pension Plan for at least two (2) years, or are 45 years of age and have been employed by FPI for 10 years you are considered to be vested. This means you will receive a deferred Pension when you reach age 65, based on the number of units built up while you were an FPI employee.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENSION PLAN?
Your Pension is administered by a Committee made up of Union and Management Representatives.
