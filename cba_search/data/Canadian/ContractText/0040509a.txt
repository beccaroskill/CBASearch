The Plan shall not require the Company to guarantee the benefits or assure the solvency of the Fund and further that all costs of establishing the Plan and all costs of operation and administration (except as noted in the previous paragraph) shall be paid from the assets of the Plan. In the event that the current legislation in British Columbia relating to pensions changes so that it alters the language or intent herein of the Collective Agreement, specifically related to the nature of the Plan, the contribution rates and/or solvency requirements, then the parties agree to move to other retirement plan options. This in no way will affect the negotiated contributions of either party.
The Company shall be required to make payments to the Teamsters Canadian Pension Plan as herein set forth. Such contributions shall be, for each employee working in a job classification covered by the Collective Agreement:

The gross earnings of an employee shall be the sum of his regular earnings, overtime, shift differential, premiums and any other earnings payable to the employee in accordance with the terms of the Collective Agreement.
Contributions along with a list of employees for whom they have been made and the amount of contribution in respect to each employee and his gross earnings shall be forwarded by the Company to the Custodian of the assets of the Plan designated by the Trustees. A copy of the list of employees shall also be mailed to the Administrator of the Plan.
Such payment shall be made to the custodian for each fiscal period (4 or 5 week) not later than twenty-one (21) days after the end of each fiscal period. The Company shall also submit to the Plan Administrator within ninety (90) days following the end of each plan year a listing of all employees who were covered by the Plan during such plan year showing, for each, the gross earnings upon which the Company's contributions were based during the plan year. Copies of all the listings shall also be forwarded if required to the Union.
