Work shall be scheduled for the 12-hour shift schedule as per the attached schedule. The Company reserves the right, as per Article 2,01 of the Collective Agreement, to change the 12-hour shift schedule if it deems it is not suitable or is otherwise adversely affecting production.
For the purposes of computing overtime, only those authorized hours worked in excess of 12 hours in any one day or 80 hours in a two weeks schedule (averaged over the cycle of the schedule) shall be considered as overtime. Clauses in the Collective Agreement relating to this area shall be suspended for those employees affected by 12-hour shifts while they are in effect.
It is specifically understood that hours paid in accordance with the requirements of the statutory holiday schedule of the Collective Agreement shall not be considered as time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime.
Shift and Sunday Premium
A weighted average shift premium would be calculated for the nightshift, based on the existing (current) shift premiums.
Employees on the dayshift (7 am. to 7 p.m.) would not receive any shift premium. Employees on the nightshift (7 p.m. to 7 am.) would receive 70 cents/hour for every hour worked on that shift.
59
Sunday premiums will continue to be paid as per Article 11.16 cfthe Collective Agreement. At present, this is an additional95 cents/hour for each hourworked at the employee's basic rate of pay. This is in addition to any shift differential applicable.
Both Sunday and shift premiums continue to apply only to non-overtime shifts.
Meal Periods
There will be two one-half hour meal periods during each 12-hour shift, to be scheduled no more than five hours apart. As per Article 11.08 of the Collective Agreement, the lunch period for employees on continuous operation will be on Company time, while employees on steady dayshift will have their lunch period on their own time.
Recognized Holidays
I) Where an employee is not scheduled to work on a statutory holiday, he shall be paid 8 hours pay at straight time in accordance with Articles 12.01 and 12.02 of the Collective Agreement.
ii)	Where an employee’s regular scheduled 12-hour shift falls on a statutory holiday as listed in Article 12.01, and he is not required to work his shift, he shall be paid 8 hours straight time provided all other requirements are met.
iii)	Where the employee's regular scheduled 12-hour shift falls on a statutory holiday as
60
listed in Article 12.01 and he is required to work his shift, he shall be paid at two times his basic rate for all hours worked on that shift in addition to 8 hours pay at straight time.
iv)	Floating holiday will continue to be administered as per Article 12.03 of the Collective Agreement. However, where an employee on 12-hour shifts takes the shift off on a floating holiday, he will be paid for 8 hours.
All qualifying periods and working days shall be met as per appropriate clauses in the Collective Agreement.
Vacations
Vacations entitlements as per the relevant sections of the Collective Agreement shall continue to be the same total number of “hours” of time off. For example, Article 10.03 says that “an employee with more than five (5) years but less than thirteen (13) years area seniority as of July 1st, will be entitled to a vacation of three (3) weeks and pay of six percent (6%)..." That same employee, working on a 12-hour shift schedule, will be entitled to a vacation of 120 hours and pay of six percent (6%).
Jury Duty
Where the 12-hour shift schedule is in effect and an employee’s regular scheduled 12-hour shift qualifies as per Article 9.05 of the Collective Agreement, he shall be paid the difference between his base rate of
61
twelve (12) hours and the daily jury or crown witness fee received.

Where the 12-hour shift schedule is in effect and an employee’s regular scheduled 12-hour shift qualifies as per Article 9.06 of the Collective Agreement, he shall receive pay for the twelve hours. However, the total accumulated hours paid for funeral leave shall total no more than 24 hours.
Leave of Absence
I) Requests for unpaid leave of absence continue as per Articles 9.01, 9.02, and 9.03 of the Collective Agreement.
ii) Where an employee is on leave of absence for the purpose of attending trade school, he will be paid upon successfully completing his school session, the difference between what his earning would have been had he worked his regular scheduled 12-hour schedule at his base rate of pay and the monies he receives from government agencies, i.e. Unemployment Insurance.
Benefit Plan ■ Weekly Indemnity
The qualifying “days” for benefits for employees on the 12-hour shift schedule shall be two “days” or two 12-hour shifts. Benefits received after that will be calculated on an “hours of work missed" system and comparedto the weekly benefit amount of Unemployment Insurance maximum plus $10.00 which is based on a 40-hour week.
