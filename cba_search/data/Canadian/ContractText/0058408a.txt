MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
ENTERED INTO AND AMENDED THIS 15TH DAY OF APRIL 1998 BETWEEN
CASCO INC.
Having its Head Office in the city of Toronto Ont., and plant at Cardinal, Ontario hereinafter referred to as “The Company”
OF THE FIRST PART:
and
UNITED FOOD PROCESSORS UNION LOCAL N0.483

OF THE SECOND PART:
WITNESSETH:
ARTICLE 1
PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
The purpose of this agreement is to promote the best mutual relationship between the Company and the Union, define orderly collective bargaining and grievance procedures; and to prevent interruptions of work and interference with the efficient operation of the Company's business.
1
ARTICLE 2
RECOGNITION - EXCLUSIONS
The company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive Bargaining Agency for all the Company’s employees in its plant at Cardinal, Ontario, except those employed within the following classifications:
Foremen, Chief Engineers, those above the rank of Foreman, Office Workers, Plant Protection Employees and Highway Tractor Trailer Drivers.
ARTICLE 3
RESERVATION TO MANAGEMENT
The location of the Plant, the operation and management of its business, the products to be manufactured, the schedules of production, the methods, processes and means of manufacturing, together with the determination of the number of employees in any department, or in any job, are exclusively the responsibility of the Company.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Union recognizes the right of the Company (1) to hire, promote and transfer, (2) to discipline any employee for justifiable cause, (3) to allocate work, describe, and classify jobs, and (4) to determine the number of employees in any classification.
2
ARTICLE 4
UNION SECURITY
The Company agrees to a modified Rand Formula which consists of the following provisions:
(a)	No employee shall, as a result of this agreement, be obliged to join the Union or to remain a member of the Union.
(b)	The Company will deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement an amount equal to the regular dues established by the Union. Such deductions, as authorized by the Union Executive, will be made weekly and the Company shall deliver to the designated officer of the Union the amount so collected by the end of the current month or as soon as possible.
No deduction of dues shall be made in any pay period in which the total amount earned in excess of all deductions required by law is not sufficient to cover the full amount. In such cases, the dues shall be deducted from the next regular pay period in which sufficient earnings are payable to cover such deductions.
3
ARTICLE 5
WAGE ADMINISTRATION
(A)	Schedule “B" is part of this Agreement. Subsequent revisions and additions to Schedule “B” as agreed to by the parties hereto, will be incorporated by amendment at the Union-Management Monthly Meeting, next following such agreement.
(B)	(1) Before new jobs are created or the duties of old jobs are merged
during the term of the contract, the Company will meet with the Union executive at a monthly management meeting to discuss the merger or new jobs. Such new or merged jobs will be classified, and the rates put into effect by the Company. It is agreed that in the event the Union does not agree with the Company, the matter may be taken up under Grievance Procedure.
(2)	Jobs which are practically identical from the standpoints of duties shall be classified under the same occupational title.
(3)	Rates of compensation for the same rate classification shall prevail throughout the plant regardless of Department or Division in accordance with Schedule “B”.
(4)	The rate of a present worker in any occupation which has been assigned to a lower Rate Classification than it carried previously will not be reduced; however, the proper and related new Rate Classification as set forth in the foregoing rate schedule will apply to any future workers in the occupations.
(5)	An employee who is required to perform in the regular manner, not an emergency or substitution, the work of more than one job, will be paid at the respective rates assigned to each job for the number of hours spent on each job.
(6)	(a) When an employee is awarded a job in a higher wage group, he
4
will receive his old rate until he takes over the full responsibility of the job. He will then receive the rate of the new job to which he has been assigned.
(b) When an employee is awarded a job in a lower wage group he will receive the rate of the job to which he has been assigned. For the days he would have been working from the general plant schedule, he will receive the lesser of Rate 1 or the normal hourly rate appearing on his Form “8".
(7)	(a) If, when an employee would normally be working on his own
job, he is required to substitute on another job, he shall be paid at his own rate or the rate of the other job, whichever is greater.
(b)	An employee, temporarily assigned to other work for one or more days or shifts, when there is a lack of work in his regular occupation, shall receive the rate of the job to which he is temporarily assigned except as provide under Article II(B), paragraph 4.
(c)	An employee who has been working on his own job, and because of lack of work may be temporarily assigned to work for part of the day or shift on another job, will be paid for the balance of the shift at his own job rate or the rate of the job to which he has been temporarily assigned, whichever is the greater.
(C)	Employees will be paid each Thursday for earnings up to 7:00 am the preceding Sunday. Deductions will be made as per schedule as mutually agreed upon. In the event of Thursday falling upon a recognized holiday, wages shall be paid Friday.
5
ARTICLE 6
HOURS OF WORK
(A)	Working Hours -
The working day begins at 7:00 am and ends at 7:00 am. As recognized by the Company, Sunday begins at 7:00 am on the calendar day Sunday and ends at 7:00 am. on the calendar day Monday. The same applies to recognized holidays.
The recognized work week shall consist of five days or shifts of eight
(8)	hours, or a total of 40 hours between 7:00 am Sunday and 7:00 am the following Sunday. However, in the cases listed in Schedule C which is part of this Agreement “Jobs on Monday to Friday Work Week” the recognized work week shall consist of eight (8) hours per day Monday to Friday, end work on Saturdays and Sundays on these jobs shall be on a call back basis. Nothing in this paragraph is to be interpreted as a guarantee of work or as a limitation on assignment of overtime work outside the recognized work week.
It is the duty of all employees to report for their scheduled work periods unless they have obtained their Foreman’s permission to be absent. If an employee is prevented from reporting for duty through exceptional circumstances, he should notify his Foreman or Superintendent at least fourteen (14) hours before his work period begins indicating the anticipated time of return to work.
If an employee has been absent from his work for more than one day because of sickness or any other cause he must report to his Foreman or Superintendent at least sixteen (16) hours prior to the beginning of the work period in which he intends to begin duty.
Employees are responsible for keeping their Foreman advised of the phone number at their principle residence at which they can be contacted. Without such advice the Company cannot be responsible for notifying employees concerning extra work, call backs, schedule changes, etc. An employee will not be considered available, for that job, if two phone calls to the
6
phone number given are unsuccessful in contacting the employee, provided that one of the calls is made and recorded by the Security Office personnel. As an exception to the above, in case of mechanical breakdown, one telephone call, not necessarily from the Security Office will suffice.
Day workers will be allowed five (5) minutes before quitting time at noon and night to put their tools away and wash up.
Employees up to 15 minutes late will lose 1/4 hour’s pay. Employees 16 to 30 minutes late will lose 1/2 hour’s pay, etc.
The same regulations will apply for employees leaving work ahead
of time.
Employees working overtime will be paid to the nearest 1/4 hour as authorized by their foreman.
An employee reporting late for work must work eight (8) hours before overtime rates can be applied.
To meet our product demand and ensure customer service, it is the duty of the employees to remain on the job if required to meet special circumstances. If an employee does not wish to remain, the Foreman will endeavor, in accordance with the Collective Agreement to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work, but failure to locate another worker who is willing and able to do the work without increasing the cost, to the Company, does not relieve the employee on the job of the responsibility towards his job.
(B)	Day Work
The normal hours of work are:
7:00 am to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
or 7:00 am to 3:00 p.m.
or	8:00 am to 12:00 noon
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
7
or 9:00 am to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
or 7:00 am to 12:00 noon and 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
or such other eight (8) hour schedules that may be necessary to meet special conditions resulting from production demands, delivery schedules, the type of job, or seasonal variations which might affect the daylight hours. Except as otherwise provided, the Company will not schedule less than 8 hours.
(C)	Shift Work -
The normal hours of work for shift workers are any one of the following shifts:
First Shift	- 7:00 am - 3:00 p.m.
Second Shift - 3:00 p.m. -1 1:00 p.m.
Third Shift	- 11:00 p.m. - 7:00 am
Each revolving shift shall rotate in sequence weekly. Employees are not to exchange shifts without permission from their Superintendent or Foreman.
When a shift begins each shift worker is required to be at his place. At the end of a shift no shift worker may leave his place to wash up or dress unless his mate has changed his clothes and reported to take on the responsibilities of the position. If a shift worker does not report for his shift, and has not given the required notice, the employee on the job shall notify the Department Superintendent or Foreman. He shall then remain at his post until a substitute is secured.
When a replacement is required for a shift job or day job after the Schedule has been posted for the following work week, the Foreman will attempt to make the replacement in accordance with Article 6 (E) using the following priority provided no overtime results.
8
1.	Regular Operator, provided using the Regular Operator does not involve moving him from one shift to one of the other two shifts.
2.	Replacement Operators in order of priority. If overtime cannot be prevented the Replacement will be made in the following priority:
(1)	Person on the job.
(2)	Regular Operator on his assigned day off.
(3)	Other Regular Operators in order of seniority
(4)	Replacement Operators in order of priority.
The Foreman may at his discretion use any of the above in an effort to minimize the amount of overtime or avoid the need for any operator to work in excess of 16 hours continuously.
(D)	Replacement Operator -is an employee who replaces a Regular Operator or other Replacement Operator during their temporary absence due to sickness, vacation, assigned days off, or other similar cause. The Replacement Operator will have the same rights and obligations of the job for the days he is on the job, as if he were the Regular Operator, but he shall not have the tights and obligations of any other Replacement job he may have for those days. A Regular Operator who also holds a Replacement job will not have the rights and obligations of his Regular job for the day he is working on his Replacement job. Replacement of Regular Operators Rate 5 or higher will be made from Replacements (in order of priority) who have received their jobs in accordance with Article 11 (A) (7) as a result of a bulletin. When a Replacement operator is replacing a Regular operator for one calendar week, he shall have no rights to his other jobs for that seven day period.
When there is more than one Replacement Operator for a job the priority of the Operators shall be indicated as Replacement Operator No. 1, Replacement Operator No.2, - etc., and such priority shall be indicated on the job bulletin when the vacancy is posted. A Replacement Operator No. 1 regularly on shift work is limited to that job, i.e.: he may not hold another Regular Job or Replacement job. Similarly, a Regular Operator regularly on shift work is limited to that job. A shift worker Replacement Operator No. 2 is limited to holding one other Replacement No. 2 or No. 3 job within the Division,
9
A day worker is limited to two (2) Replacement jobs plus a Regular Job within the Division.
The following Replacement Personnel are not restricted to the job limitations imposed by 6(D) {i.e. They may be selected to an additional Replacement #2 Job.}:
Corn Elevator Operator Replacement #1 Bldg. 43 Operator and Loader Replacement #1 Dextrine Operator Replacement #1
(E)	Work Schedules-
A work schedule is to be posted on the bulletin board in each department on Thursday on which is shown the planned working days and shifts, for the following week. This schedule will indicate “assigned day off and “down days”, if any, and in the event that any work which is Rate 2 or higher shown on this schedule to be performed by an employee at overtime rates then such work will be scheduled to the Regular Operator or the Replacement Operator enjoying the rights of the Regular Operator unless it is assigned in accordance with Article 6 (C).
As an exception to the preceding paragraph the existing system of scheduling week-end relief and days off will continue. The present common practice is the scheduling of the 3 - 11 shift Saturday to Replacement Operators three Saturdays out of four, with the 4th such shift being scheduled to the Regular Operators. There are exceptions to this general rule in various departments and in situations where Replacement Operators are not available.
The schedule may be changed by the Foreman or Supervisor by advising the man concerned at least “22" hours before the shift or day concerned for an assigned day off or down day change if such change is caused by production demands, or by at least “12” hours notice if the change is for any other reason, provided, however, that not withstanding the foregoing, no notice of a change in schedule is required if caused by serious breakdown. In any of these cases, the additional time worked is not on a “call back” basis.
10
Assigned Day Off is a day of relief from the regular job assigned to an employee to conform to the recognized work week.
When owing to a change in the work schedule and the employee has not been advised that regular work is not available and reports for work, he will be supplied with at least four hours work or pay, at straight time on week days, but such time will not be included in the work week. If on a Sunday or holiday or assigned day off, his work will be treated as a call back. The above does not apply in the case of a serious breakdown.
When an employee is required to come in to work ahead of his regular starting time he will be given twelve (12) hours warning. Without twelve (12) hours warning his early starting time will be on a call back basis.
Except as otherwise provided, when employees are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs, they will be guaranteed 8 hours work or pay in lieu thereof.
All employees assigned to work at overtime rates, who are scheduled for 8 hours work on their regular jobs are not required to work 8 hours because of lack of work on their job will be guaranteed at least 4 hours work or pay on a call back basis.
(F)	For reasons of product demand or efficiency, assigned days off and down days will be determined by the Foreman concerned. Recognizing that employees would like their two days off consecutively, the Foreman will prepare the schedules accordingly when feasible, providing additional cost is not incurred.
11
ARTICLE 7
OVERTIME
(A)	Overtime rates of time and one-half the regular rate will be paid for:
(1)	a) work in excess of eight hours continuously
b)	work in excess of eight hours in any one day.

Article 11 (B).
(2) When en employee is scheduled to work 8 hours on Sunday and has the opportunity of working 8 hours or more on Sunday, time worked up to but not exceeding 8 hours will be included in calculating the work week under Article 7 (A). Such time scheduled will be included as 8 hours in determining the “opportunity of working” under Article 11 (B).
12
(C)	Work on Recognized Holidays -As shown in Article 9 (A) will be paid at the rate of time and one-half of hourly rate with the exception that work on New Year's Day, Christmas Day and Labour Day will be paid at double time. If an employee works 8 hours or is scheduled to work 8 hours or is paid for 8 hours on a Recognized Holiday, such time worked or paid for will be included in computing the work week.
(D)	(1) Time worked on call back basis will be paid at time and one-half, and will not be included in the forty hour work week.
(2)	Call backs or overtime will terminate at the beginning of the employee's regular scheduled day or shift. When an employee continues on his regular shift without interruption after a call back, overtime rates will again become effective eight hours after he started his call back work.
(3)	Work on an Assigned Day Off or a Down Day - When an employee is required to work on his assigned day off or his down day without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6 (E), he shall be paid on a call back basis.

In addition the Company is not obligated to call in any employee for any mechanical task that can be done by the utility mechanics. Nor is the Company obligated to call in any employee who is scheduled on vacation, floating holidays, Union business, labour relations, or requested time off.
(2) Employees who are called in to work without sufficient notice as specified in Article 6 (E) for a limited period of time will get a minimum of four (4) hours regular pay, except that the minimum pay will be 6 hours regular pay if the employee is called in to work without notice between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 am. If the employee’s services are not required for two hours and forty minutes he can with the Foreman or Foremen's permission leave the plant. if, however,
13
while he is in the plant on a call back another emergency arises requiring his attention he must remain on the job and subject to the instructions of the Foreman or Superintendent concerned.
OR
(3) If an employee is called upon after his regular quitting time and after having been relieved from his work to work overtime he will be paid on a call back basis.
(F)	Work on Split Shifts-Employees may be required at the request of their Supervisor to work a split shift. In such cases the actual hours worked within the span of their normal working hours will be paid for at regular rates, and any time so worked outside of normal working hours will be compensated for at time and one-half.
(G)	Shift Relief - Overtime will not be paid in the case of a mutual agreement between two shift workers on the same job to relieve at a time other than the normal shift change time. This arrangement must have the permission of the Foreman concerned.
Employees may be required by their Foreman or Supervisor to work 12 hour shifts in situations in which two operators are only available to cover the 24 hours duty per day. Such 12 hour shifts will be considered as normal hours of work in accordance with Article 7(A)1.
(H)	Noon Hour Work - Employees who are advised before noon that they are required to do unscheduled work during the noon hour, will be paid one and one-half hours' pay. Such time will be included in the 8 hour work day.

(I)	The employees concerned must have worked during the morning and be scheduled to work that afternoon.
(2) The employee concerned was not advised before 12 noon of the noon hour work.
14
Such call back pay will terminate at the time the employee would normally begin his afternoon work.
(I)	Employees who during their normal working hours are notified that
they will be required at a definite time on a later shift during that day will be paid a minimum of two hours and forty minutes at time and one-half their hourly rate.
An employee may be required to stand by at home for duty at an indefinite time later during that day for which he shall receive a minimum pay equal to a call back whether or not his services are required.
Weekend Stand -by Coverage
During the period of Victoria Day weekend to Labour Day weekend inclusive, the following procedure of mandatory weekend coverage for emergency repairs will be followed:
Mechanics from each of the following shops will be on stand-by from 3:30 p.m. on Friday until 7:00 am on the following Monday,
(7:00 am on Tuesday for holiday weekends).
Machine Shop:	1	mechanic
Millwright Shop:	1	mechanic
Instrument Shop:	1	mechanic
Electric Shop:	1	mechanic
Each designated mechanic on call will receive a rate of pay in the amount of $200 per weekend, ( $300 per holiday weekend) in addition to their pay for hours worked.
Employees in the shops identified above will be scheduled for standby duty on a rotating basis. A schedule will be posted in each shop by May 1, each year.
In addition to the above, employees in each of the shops identified above will be scheduled for stand-by duty on a seniority voluntary basis for the remaining weekends.
15
Callbacks will be handled as before except designated individuals are obligated to come in when called.
(J)	Employees who during their normal working hours are notified that they will be required to start their day’s work the following morning before 7:00 am will be paid time and one-half for time worked before 7:00 am and time and one-half after eight (8) hours work.
(K)	It is not the intention of the Company to schedule overtime work in one department to avoid overtime in another department.
For example, an employee under ordinary circumstances, will not leave his regular job to go to another job to act as a replacement if so doing creates overtime on the regular job.
An R2 holding two R2 jobs will replace in the lower rate job when
available.
In the case of an R2 holding jobs of the same rate, he will be scheduled if possible on a rotating basis.
(L)	Distribution of extra Rate 1 overtime work with the Division:
For the purpose of this provision, extra Rate 1 overtime work is defined to be Rate 1 work to be performed by an employee, which work is deemed necessary by the Company, and in the opinion of the Foreman concerned will be in excess of two hours duration and cannot be done by employees within their recognized work week.
In order to distribute extra Rate 1 overtime work equitably among employees within a Division, a list, in seniority order of employees who hold a regular and/or replacement job within the Division, and who wish such work will be kept. Employees are responsible for advising their Foreman of their desire to be included on the list and of a phone number by which they can be reached at all times. As extra Rate 1 overtime work occurs, employees on the list will be given the opportunity on a rotational basis, providing the employee is capable of doing the work. Such time worked is not included in calculating the work day or work week. For such work, only one phone call to the phone number given is required of the Foreman. If an employee does not wish to

ARTICLE 11 EMPLOYEE SECURITY
(A)	Each of the parties hereto recognizes that employees are entitled to an equitable measure of job security based on seniority, subject to the following provisions:
(1)	In the selection of employees for job vacancies, appointments will be made to the most senior employee with sufficient ability to perform the duties of the position. Ability shall include skill, efficiency, responsibility and physical fitness to perform the duties of the position. Such appointments will be subject to the provisions of Article 11 (A) (6)
The selection of Replacement Operators may be from the Regular employees within the division concerned. In addition to this, a Replacement #2 or Replacement #3 Shift Worker, may be selected to an additional Replacement #2 or #3 shift job, within the division. The number of jobs already held by an applicant is an important consideration in making a selection. As an exception to Article 6 (D) which limits Employees to one division, that rule may be set aside by mutual agreement when the parties agree there would be no conflict in so doing.
(2)	Seniority Status:	Employees other than the employees hired by
mutual agreement on a strictly temporary basis, shall have seniority status from their last date of hire, and shall come under the provisions of this Agreement, except that they shall be on probation for 70 days worked. The Company shall have the exclusive right to determine if a probationary employee shall be retained. The Company's decision on retention or discharge of a probationary employee shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Not withstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph the Company and the Union may exclude specific employees from seniority status by mutual agreement in writing.
23
It is mutually agreed the student probationary period will be May 1 st to Labour Day inclusive.

If he voluntarily resigns or quits.
If he is discharged for justifiable cause.
If he is absent for seven consecutive days without notifying the Company unless there was justifiable reason for not notifying the Company.
If he does not work for a continuous period exceeding twelve months due to a lay-off.
If he does not return to work after a lay-off, within fourteen (14) consecutive days of being called without reason acceptable to the Company. Provable sickness shall be considered an acceptable reason. The employee shall be notified by registered mail to his last known address of recall after layoff. Absence for which special permission in writing has been given by the Company shall not break seniority, or sever employment. An employee wishing to be absent from his work in excess of 3 working days for reasons other than lay-off or illness must apply for a Leave of Absence.
(4)	Seniority Lists:	The Company will prepare seniority lists which
will be revised annually or whenever proof of an error has been submitted. Copies of revised lists will be furnished to the Union. Plant wide seniority shall be as of Article 11 (A) (2)
(5)	Posting Job Vacancies:	All hourly job vacancies within the
scope of this Agreement, with the exception of Rate 1 jobs, temporary jobs not exceeding one month, or as mutually agreed, will be posted. In cases of temporary vacancy, the job will be posted if conditions warrant, affording protection for the regular employee to return to his regular job.
24
When a vacancy becomes evident the job vacancy, if subject to posting, will be posted on all bulletin boards immediately for a period of eight (8) days, indicating job title, rate of pay and hours of work. The successful applicant will be chosen within an additional fourteen days and, provided no replacement is required by bulletin on the successful applicant's job, he shall begin training within 21 days of the posting of the selection. If a vacancy results from retirement, the vacancy is to be posted sixty (60) days in advance of normal retirement date.
The Company will forward to the President and to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union, copies of the job postings, list of applicants and selectee within the time limits. In addition, members of the Union Executive will, upon request, be shown lists of applicants at the Personnel Office.
The selection of applicants for job vacancies will be in accordance with Article 11 (A) (1). In selecting applicants for posted job vacancies it is stipulated that the selectee’s appointment is temporary, but subject to permanency if found satisfactory after a reasonable period of training and when previous incumbent's appointment to another job has been declared permanent. An employee who is selected for a job will be given up to a 5 day training period to determine if he wishes to continue this training. After this five days of training, he shall have no grievance if he loses the rights to his former job. This loss of rights to his former job does not apply if he proves to be unsatisfactory on his new job prior to being declared permanent. This also applies to hourly employees being selected for jobs listed in Article 2.
In the event that a selectee proves during his training period to be unsatisfactory or desires to return to his former job then the next selection will be made from those who answered the bulletin. If none of the applicants is qualified, an employee who has completed his probation or is currently serving his probationary period will be appointed. If the job is not filled within 90 days the job will be re-posted if requested by the Union. Applicants who applied for the initial posting and apply for the re-posting, may not be considered if they were selected in the first instance, and withdrew after the training period had begun.
25
An employee with over 5 years seniority who applies for a job and is selected for the job, may apply for another job within six months of his previous selection but he shall have no grievance if he is not selected in the second instance. In the case of employees with less than 5 years seniority the period is twenty-four months {instead of six months}. The above shall not be applicable if the employee withdraws within 3 days of the posting of their selection. The above restrictions do not apply if an employee is improving his position in the replacement sequence, or moving to a job at the same or higher job rate classification, or moving to a posted regular day job {shift as required} from a shift job.
(6)	Employees Rate 3 and above within the Mechanical Division (except the Yard employees) will be upgraded, taking into consideration seniority, skills, ability to perform the work required, efficiency, responsibility and physical fitness.
Once each calendar year such employees may request an upgrading, on a form provided by the Company.

Rate 10 is provided for upgrading mechanics who have upgraded their skills beyond the normal requirements of the job. Such upgrading will be the responsibility of the Supervisor.
(7)	Those employees not covered by the Agreement prior to June 16, 1967 have full seniority from 1st date of hire for all purposes except awarding of bulletined jobs. For the purpose of awarding bulletined jobs no time spent outside the bargaining unit shall be recognized.
(B)	Subject to Article 11 (D) Regular Employees who have five years plant seniority or more, will be guaranteed the opportunity of working the number of days equivalent to the grind week up to a maximum of 40 hours, or 32 hours during a week in which an employee is paid for, but does not work, 8 hours on a recognized holiday, or 24 hours during a week in which an employee is paid for, but does not work, 8 hours for each of 2 recognized holidays.

Employees in the Mechanical Division will be subject to the above guarantee and any additional work undertaken by the Mechanical Division will be handled by the regular members of the shop concerned.
It is also agreed by both parties that certain active employees are limited for work under Article 11 (C)and it is agreed that these employees shall be assigned to duties that their limitations will allow them to perform. Excluded from the above are employees who qualify for LTD under the terms of the Agreement.
When a regular assigned employee has been given an assigned day off because he had an expected work week of 40 hours, and his scheduled work is reduced he will receive 8 hours work or 8 hours pay for each day's work that he would have received, if he had not been given an assigned day off. The above work or pay in lieu of work shall not apply in case of a serious breakdown.
(C)	General Plant Schedule - Extra Work as requisitioned by divisions will be allocated with as much advance notice as practical by the Industrial Relations Department to employees without regular assigned jobs and to employees who are not scheduled for the full recognized work week on a divisional schedule. All work for the following week requisitioned prior to 4:00 p.m. Friday will be allotted and posted by 5:00 p.m. Friday. In applying the foregoing, if senior employees have an expected work week of less than the Recognized work week and work on Rate 1 jobs is available on days they are not scheduled to work on a Divisional Schedule, then such Rate 1 work will be allocated to the more senior employees provided no extra cost results.
Work allocated under this section will be distributed on a seniority basis, ability to do the work required, availability and the expected work week. It is recognized however, that it is not practical nor possible to allocate such work strictly on a seniority basis.
27
Work allocated under this section will be included in the work week for all employees but provisions covering call back pay, down day change, assigned day off change, starting time change, and work reduction do not apply to such work.
Employees called in to work under this section will be guaranteed a minimum of 4 hours work except in case of a breakdown.
Employees will be paid the rate of the job to which they are assigned (except the application of Rate IA to Probationary Employees).
(D)	(1) Lay-offs: Where changes in methods, production or policy would require a permanent lay-off, the reduction in employees will be made by laying off the lowest Plant seniority employees. When additional employees are required, the former employees will be re-hired in reverse order of lay-off.
(2) In any job displacement the Company will transfer the Regular Operators and the Replacement Operators who are affected, to Rate 1 jobs provided they have sufficient seniority and are able to do the work available. Vacancies in Rate 1 jobs will be created by transferring the least senior employees with regular Rate 1 jobs from the Rate 1 jobs. The Regular and Replacement Operators permanently displaced will be guaranteed a minimum of not less than the rate of their former job for the work done during a period of 18 months after the displacement.
(E)	The Company agrees except in cases of urgency, not to let or enter into contracts for Plant maintenance work or the performance of other bargaining unit work at the Plant, which work is normally performed by Mechanical employees or other bargaining unit employees, while Mechanical or other regular bargaining unit employees who are qualified and capable of doing the work are on layoff status.
Maintenance work is defined to mean repair and replacement of existing equipment in kind.
Exceptions to the foregoing are jobs which are normally contracted
28
out such as roof and road repairs, elevator maintenance, etc., together with jobs that require special skills not possessed by employees, or equipment which is not owned by the Company.
The Company will give the Union five (5) days prior notice (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) of the letting of contracts mentioned above in Article 11 (E), paragraph 1.
The Company will continue its efforts to undertake selected nonroutine jobs such as building demolition when necessary skilled and unskilled regular employees are available within the workforce. Such work will be undertaken by the Company only if it can be done safely and at comparable cost. Unskilled labour on these jobs will be paid at Rate 1. Qualified mechanic when needed will be on the job.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Meal Allowance, Work Clothing & Safety Shoes
This is to confirm that the Company will provide each regular employee a meal and clothing allowance of $50.00 no later than April 15th each contract year. The Company will pay $125 during the first contract year, and $125 during the second contract year towards the purchase of safety shoes or boots for each regular employee. Employees who are absent due to sickness or other reasons, are not eligible for meal and clothing allowance or subsidy on safety shoes until they return to work.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE: CALCULATION OF A.M.E. FOR PERSONS RETIRING WHILE ON LONG TERM DISABILITY
Calculation of A.M.E. for persons retiring while on Long Term Disability will be based on the last 3 years (36 months) of active employment. In selecting these 3 years the individual concerned must have worked 1040 hours in each year. These 3 years (36 months) actual earnings will be compared to the Normal Hourly Rate the employee held during each of these years of service multiplied by 2080 hours and the greater amount used.
In the above cases, the pension formula in effect on the day prior to retirement will be used to calculate the pension.
59
RE: MECHANICAL DIVISION
1)	If more permanent employees are required in another shop the Company will discuss the possibilities of a permanent transfer before positions for new apprentices or employees are posted in the shop requiring the additional employees.
2)	If it is found necessary to reduce the work force in any of the mechanical shops the Company will meet with the Union in an attempt to reach a satisfactory method of displacing employees. It is recognized that if skill and ability to perform the work are equal then seniority will govern,
3)	If a yard hand performing duties of a mechanical helper has been working on a job for all or most of the day and there is overtime involved on this job, the most senior yard hand will be afforded the first opportunity and so forth by seniority to stay on overtime, provided no regular member of the shop concerned wishes to avail himself of the overtime.
The above only applies to a yard hand working with a regular member of the shop concerned.
Yard hands will not be used for callbacks until all other regular members of the Mechanical Division have been given the opportunity.
For callbacks, Utility Mechanics will be used only after the regular employees of the shop concerned.
The sequence would be:
1)	Regular employees of shop concerned by seniority.(Apprentices are considered to be Regular employees of the shop concerned.)
2)	Regular or replacement Utility Mechanic on the job.
3)	Regular Utility Mechanic on his assigned day off.
4)	Regular Utility Mechanic in order of seniority.
60
5)	Replacement Utility Mechanic in order of priority,
The foreman may, at his discretion, use any of the above in an effort to minimize the amount of overtime or avoid the need for any operator to work in excess of 16 hours continuously.
61
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
RE: APPRENTICE TRAINING PROGRAM
In administering the Apprentice Training Program, the following general principles will be followed:
1.	Education Requirements - General requirements are 3 years High School approximately. Employees with less than 3 years High School are considered for apprenticeship, if their abilities and experience indicate they would be successful in training.
2.	Tests - When it is considered advisable to give apprentices written tests to show their progress, the apprentices will be advised of the test, and nature, at least three days before it is given.
3.	Apprentice on Job Training - Each apprentice will be given experience with various mechanics and will not remain with one mechanic for long periods.
4.	Apprentice Working Rights - Regular employees of the Mechanical Dept. will get preference for overtime, call back, and work on premium days. However, if an apprentice has been working on a job for all or most of the day and there is overtime involved on this job, the apprentice will stay on overtime to complete the job.
5.	Night School Courses - The Company will pay tuition fees for apprentices attending approved courses, with a minimum attendance requirement at the sessions.

If it is acceptable to the Supervisor, 80 hours of an employees vacation, consisting of 6 days of 12 hours and 1 day of 8 hours may be taken one, two or three days at a time and two days only may be taken on Saturdays.
Alternatively if an employee requests to split one week of the above 80 hours it may consist of 3 days of 12 hours + one 4 hours segment and 1 day only may be taken on a Saturday.

68
preceding shift, not scheduled to work the following shift). Operators who are on their assigned day off have no designated shift.
B)	If employee is required due to special circumstances, (i.e. Sickness with short notice given or absence with no notice.) man on duty would be obligated to stay until other operators have been contacted in order of seniority. It is to be understood that this overtime coverage will be a responsibility of all 12 hour shift employees.
C)	For training purposes employees will be scheduled on eight (8) hour shifts or a combination of eight (8) and twelve (12) hour shifts. It would be the practice to make the change, if it is possible, without the employee working a lesser number of hours then he would have, had there been no change.
