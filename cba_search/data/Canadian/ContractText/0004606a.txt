15:05- LOCK-OUTPROCEDURES
What is a Lock-out Requirement?
The lock-out requirement ,is a requirement of all employees to isolate and secure the energy source to pieces of equipment that could move or be caused to move while you are working in hazardous areas around the equipment.
Lock-out requirements apply to all personnel from clean up crews, to operators, to maintenance and contractors.
32
The main purpose for having lock-out procedures in place is to protect you and others from injury caused by moving equipment,
The “lock-out” in lock-out procedures occurs when you secure, with your lock, the switch or valve of the energy source for the specific piece of equipment you will be working on. Your lock prevents anyone from re- energizing the piece of equipment.
LOCK-OUTGUIDELINES
1.	This Lock-Out guideline is instituted to prevent accidental operation of equipment which could cause bodily injury to anyone. Written Lock-out Procedures will be reviewed with you in your “Job Safety Analysis” (JSA’s) for your particularjob.
2.	It is the duty of every person working on equipmentto "Lock-Out the equipment in a manner described in the Lock-Ouf Procedures.
3.	When any worker is required to work on or around any machine where starting of that machine could constitute a hazard, the machine shall be stopped at the control button and then “Locked-Out” at the main switch or valve controlling the flow of power, electrical, air, water, hydraulic, compressed gas, steam or gravity.
4.	After “Locking-Out” the worker must check the equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pressing the “Start” button. The worker at this point, must again press the “Stop” button. All pressurized systems must be bled down to de-energize them
33
where applicable. Install all safety pins and blocking that may be required to ensure your safety:
5.	Each worker must "Lock-Out" equipment' personally. If there is more than one lock to be put on a power source and a second worker places their lock on the power source, the second worker must ask the first worker to step back while the second worker tests the start button and so on for each additional lock placed on the power source.
6.	All locks must bear the name or number of the user. Inspection of locks will be made periodically to ensure the name or numbers are legible.
7.	Scissor clamps and cable/chains are supplied to facilitate the use of more than one lock on a "LockOut’ position.
8.	If in doubt about the location of the switch or the method of pulling it, call your Supervisor.When pulling the switch use your left hand and stand to the right of the switch.
WHEN TASKS ARE COMPLETED
1.	Make sure all tools and loose parts are cleared out, doors are closed, guards are replaced, safety pins and blocking are removed and all other workers are clear of the machine. Only then can the locks be removed and the power turned on.
2.	Locks can only be removed by the person who applied the locks, no other person can remove your locks nor can you remove theirs. The only method for lock removal other than by the worker whom applied the lock is by following the lock removal guidelines (attached).
34
3.	The last worker to remove his/her lock from the switch has the responsibility to make sure no other worker has inadvertently entered the machine and could be injured if the machine was turned on.
4.	Remove all your locksfrom the switches or valves and throw them to the “ON' position taking the same precautions you did when throwing the switches “OFF.
5.	If a machine is requiredto be test runafter cleaning, repairing or adjusting, get the operator to start up or return to the start buttons and try the machine yourself.
6.	Ifthe above procedure(#5) is not required, inform the Operator or the Supervisorthatyou have finished and the machine is safe and can be returned to production.
LOCK OUT DURING SHIFT CHANGE:
1	. Workers coming on shift shall place their own locks on all control devices before the individuals going off shift remove their locks, or the Supervisor may Lock-Out the control devices during shift changes to allow workers going off shift to remove their locks.
2	. Workers coming on shift must check equipment to ensure that it cannot be operated by pushing the start button then the stop button.
3	. Failure to comply with these rules is cause for disciplinary action by the Company. The disciplinary action for a Lock-Out Violation is an automatic suspension.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING PROGRESSIONUNEJOB BIDS
In an effort to provide relief for progression lines with minimal disruption to other areas and reduced training and related costs, the Company and the Union agree to the following:
1.	Future bids for progression line vacancies be posted as “relief bids.
2.	Employees in “key” positions will be eligible to bid. Employees in other progression lines will not be eligible to bid.
3.	Those employees who have accepted another bid within the lastfour (4) months will be ineligibleto bid, per Article 13:01(c).
4.	The incumbent to a “relief” position will automatically assume the next permanent position should a permanent vacancy occur within this progression line. In the event two vacancies should occur simultaneously within a progression line, the “relief” promotes to permanent, and another permanent bid and “relief' bid would be posted.
5.	Employees will not be allowed to hold more than one “relief” position at any one time.'
6.	This letter will supersede Schedule"L-2" Sawmill Training Program, of the Collective Agreement.
88
7.	It is understood that it is not practicalfor tradesmen to hold relief bids. In the event that a tradesman accepts a relief they will be transferredto production. If a vacancy exists at the time of the transfer the tradesman may elect to transfer to this vacancy. If no vacancy exists or if the tradesperson decides not to transfer to the vacancy they will displace the junior labourer in the mill and will be allowed to accept one job bid (relief bids excluded) in future without losing their relief status.
