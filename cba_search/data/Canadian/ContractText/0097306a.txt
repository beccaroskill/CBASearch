ADJUSTMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
In connection with the interpretation of certain clauses of the 1970-1972 Contract between IWA-Canada and certain Interior
76
Operators, the following interpretations of the Contract have
been agreed upon;
1.	With respect to the definition of the two (2) categories Lumber Grader and Boomman, the following is agreed upon:
Lumber Grader- one who grades for shipment.
Boomman - one who makes up or breaks down booms or who grades logs.
2.	With respect to the interpretation of Article VII, Section 3, the following is the interpretation:
Under Sub-Section (b) Cookhouse and Bunkhouse Employees under this Article shall be interpreted in accordance with Male and Female Minimum Wage Order No 4 (1956), and any amendments thereto, with respectto hours of work. Wages shall be those set out in the wage scale hereto.
3.	It is further understood that no new upward or downward revision of rates will be established by any operators without mutual agreement with the Local Union. Where applicable the provisions of the Plywood or Sawmill Job Evaluation Programs shall prevail.
4.	Re: ArticleX - Seniority- Section 9:
It is understood that the interpretation of this clause made by the Honourable Gordon McGregor Sloan under the Coast Agreement will apply as set out below:
“When an Employee has left, or leaves, the bargaining unit because of promotion to a supervisory position, and who later is reinstated as a member of such bargaining unit because of demotion or reduction in forces, he returns thereto with the seniority he had when an Employeewithin the bargaining unit. In other words, his seniority is “frozen” at the time he leaves the bargaining unit and ceases to run until his return thereto”.
It is agreed, however, that persons transferred out of the bargaining unit for temporary supervisory duty with the Company for a period of not more than four (4) months in
77
each calendar year shall continue to retain their seniority. Employees temporarily transferred out of the bargaining unit will be reinstated in the job they held when they left the bargaining unit without loss of seniority.
Should any special circumstances arise which will require an extension of this provision, same shall be discussed between the local. Union and Management and, if agreement is reached, the period may be extended.
It is agreed that the above understandings shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been written into the actual contract and this Section of Adjustments and Interpretations shall form Supplement No. 2 and be part of the Contract.

Interpretation of the Agreement
1. Article XI - Leave of Absence Section6 - Bereavement Leave
(c)	Add “Grandparents-in-Law’’ (This means to include your spouse’s Grandparents).
114
2.	Clarificationof Agreement
Article V -Wages - Section7 - Shift Differential Clarification
Any Employee who works more than one hour outside of the shift which is recognized as a regular day shift, should be paid night shift differential for all time worked on the overlap shift. This applies to the front end of the shift and/or the back end of the shift.
In other words, if you work a scheduled shift that is more than one hour outside of the regular day shift you should receive night shift differential for the entire hours spent on that shift.
3.	Clarification of Agreement
Article VII - Hours of Work - Double Time on Sunday
There has been considerable discussion in regards 1b the interpretation of Article VII - Hours of Work, Section l(b)(ii) and (b)(iv) as it applies to three (3) shift operations where some Employees, who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days, and regularly come in one (1) or two (2) hours early to do preparatory work prior to the start of the first shift on Monday. The pertinent clauses read as follows:
Article VII - Hours of Work
Section 1 (b) - Double straight time shall be paid for the following:
“(ii) Hours worked on Sunday by Employees who have worked five (5) shifts during the preceding six (6) days;
(iv) Item (ii) above shall not apply to Employees who work Sunday as a regularly scheduled day.”
Inasmuch as (iv) above was negotiated to apply to Employees who regularly work on a seven (7) day tour, such as Security Guards, Watchmen, Steam Plant Employees, Cook and Bunkhouse Employees, agreement has been reached on the application of Section (iv) above.
115
Where Employees regularly come in late Sunday night to do preparatory work, the Company will pay double straight time rates of pay for those hours worked prior to Sunday midnight. However, the Company reserves the right to either shorten his regular shift to parallel the normal hours of the shift or to require the Employee to work his normal shift at straight time in addition to the time worked prior to Sunday midnight.
4.	Article YU - Hours of Work- Section 10 - Hot Meals
Where Maintenance, Repair or Construction Employees are required to work two (2) hours or more overtime beyond their normal shift, the Company shall provide a hot meal, such hot meal to be consumed by the Employee on Company time before beginning the overtime work. Negotiated additions to above:

The Company will ensure that a hot meal will be provided whenever possible.
