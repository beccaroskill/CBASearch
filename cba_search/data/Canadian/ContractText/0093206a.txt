LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
KORET CANADA INC. AND
LOCAL 287 OF INTERNATIONAL LADIES GARMENT WORKERS’ UNION
CONCERNING REQUEST FOR EDUCATION LEAVE
During the 1993 negotiations the subject of education leave for the purpose of attending
classes for English as a second language was discussed. Koret endorses the concept and respects the reason behind this proposal.
Therefore, as a result of those discussions, the Company agrees to consider such unpaid leaves, without loss of seniority, for properly approved and authorized ESL courses as a means of supporting the union’s request to allow employees who have more than one year of service and whose release for a limited amount of time, to be determined by the Company, would not create a hardship or otherwise disrupt production operations. As pointed out in the meeting, the Company must also control the number of employees that could be released. Employees would not be allowed to use leaves for any other purpose other than that described above.

BETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
WEST COAST APPAREL KORET CANADA. INC.
AND
LOCAL 287 OF INTERNATIONAL LADIES’ GARMENT WORKERS’ UNION DELETIONS AND CHANGES IN CLASSIFICATIONS
CUTTER I
CUTTER II
The Company and the union have agreed that the classification of Cutter I will be deleted from the existing collective agreement. This deletion will not however effect the existence of the position or the current incumbent who now performs his duties under this classification. Under the following circumstances, continuation of the function in the plant will remain the same. The employee in the classification will not have his job altered and it is understood that the job will be “grandfathered” until such time as the incumbent is not longer employed.
VIDEO DISPLAY OPERATOR
During the 1998 negotiations the Company and the Union recognized the work now performed by the person classified as “Video Display Operator/Marker Maker” was not bargaining unit work. Therefore, it was agreed that this classification and the duties performed by this function will become non-union work and be deemed an administrative position within the term of this agreement.
This agreement includes the provision that a plan to transfer the current employee in the job will be developed by the parties. Such plan will allow for a period of time to select a suitable bargaining unit job that enables the employee to move into such job with assistance and allowances for some training in order to provide successful placement. If the transfer results in a substantial reduction in wages, then the parties will agree to a fixed amount (paid as a lump sum payment) of an appropriate differential.
