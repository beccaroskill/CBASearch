INTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM
The IRS (Internal Responsibility System) is a commitment of all employees to ensure a healthy and safe workplace. The commitment is internal, not relying on third party involvement for the resoliition of safety concerns or compliance to regulations and standards. The IRS requires all employees at all levels of the organization to take personal ownership for their own safety, the safe performance of their assigned tasks and the resolution of safety concerns. Employees taking ownership for their own safety does not absolve management, of their legislated and moral obligation to provide a safe working environment for all employees. Creating an organizational framework for safety and promoting awareness of individual safety responsibilities can be as simple as a discussion between employees to remind themselves of a hazard or reviewing a procedure.
Keys to a successful IRS - all employees must:
*	have a sincere wish to prevent incidents
*	understand safety is an essential part oftheir job
*	believe causes and risks can be eliminated
I82
Letter 13
*	avoid conflicts when trying io reduce risk
*	not be fearful of reprisals when using the IRS
*	understand their responsibilities under the act
*	take steps to make it effective
*	co-operate with others and strive to improve the process
The IRS is divided into:
1)	Direct Responsibility:	All employees
working along with their supervisor should deal with issues at the lowest level of the organization possible. This process starts with the worker and goes up the line to include immediate supervisors, second line supervisors, department heads, and nianager.
2)	Indirect Responsibility:	It provides
assistance to the operations in making the appropriate decision. This includes occupational health and safety committee members, human resources, engineering, and safety departmeni.
The “Direct” and “Indirect” responsibility will be reviewed yearly with employees.
