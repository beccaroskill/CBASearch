3.	That one (1) week notice be given in advance of taking time-off in lieu of overtime payment and that the scheduling of time-off be approved by the Company. The Company may at its discretion waive the one (1) week notice requirement if no replacement is required for the employee.

substituted for vacations except that a seniority employee may request to take banked overtime prior to using vacation time if the prior approval of the Supervisor has been obtained (i.e., if an employee wishes to take a day off and the Supervisor can operate the department without him for that day, not requiring an additional man to be called in, banked overtime may be used). If an employee is scheduled for lay-off he has the option of using his vacation or banked overtime owing during this lay-off period. However, if an employee calls in sick on a Friday or Monday, and wants to be paid for these days, vacation time must be used instead of banked overtime.

Re: Vacation Banking
The following procedure will apply to the vacation banking option referred to in Article 13 of the parties’ Collective Agreement:
1.	Elections to bank vacation should be submitted prior to the deadline for vacation scheduling requests. No additional banking of vacation will then be allowed without mutual consent.
2.	Where the Collective Agreement provides that vacation pay will be based on a percentage of the prior years earnings this aOT£iurrt«w„', '~.i«icocwfiCtert to eight (8) hour days of pay at the employee’s regular rate. The result of the conversion will be the number of days to be banked.
Example:
An employee eligible for 10% vacslfloh pay has earnings of $15,000 in the previous year. He elects to bank his “5th week” entitlement. His current rate is $12.00/hour (twelve)' The banked amount would be 2% of $15,000 divided by $l2.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount equal to 25 (twenty five) hours or 3.125 days.
3.	Employees will be advised at year’s end of the amount of vacation which has
60
been banked on their behalf. Once vacation is banked it is “locked in” until retirement, resignation or other form of termination.
4.	Payment for the banked days will be based upon the rate in effect at time of termination. The Company will cooperate to the extent practical and proper to make the payment in the manner the employee feels to be most tax effective.
5.	Where banked vacation becomes payable as a result of death the payment will be made to the deceased employee’s beneficiary as indicated by their life insurance beneficiary designation and in the absence of such beneficiary to their estate.
