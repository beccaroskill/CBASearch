(c)	New employees may be hired at a rate, five (5) percent below the applicable classification for a period not to exceed ninety (90) working days. Increases up to
2
the relative classification rate and promotions to any classification may be made on the basis of qualifications at any time during this period.
ARTICLE 2
NO STRIKE OR LOCK-OUT
(a)	The Company agrees there will be no lock-out and the Union agrees there will be no strike, so long as this Agreement continues to operate.
ARTICLE 3
RESERVATION TO MANAGEMENT
(a)	Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Union recognizes the right of the Company to hire, promote, transfer and, for just cause, to demote, suspend or otherwise discipline an employee. It shall also be considered the right of the Company to discharge any employee for good cause, upon one week's notice or one week's pay in lieu of notice, except that the Company reserves the right to discharge without notice or pay in lieu of notice, for any one of the following causes; dishonesty, absence without leave, discourtesy, direct refusal to obey orders, or flagrant violation of Company rules. In the event of a Union member being dismissed a senior member of the Union Executive is to be notified within one (1) day, or as soon as conveniently possible.
3
(b)	The Union further recognizes the undisputed right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects in accordance with its obligations and pursuant to its policies, and to make and alter from time to time, rules and regulations to be observed by employees, which rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
(c)	The Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against employees with respect to terms or conditions of employment on the grounds of race, creed, colour, age, sex, marital or parental status, union membership or activity, family relationship, political affiliation, or sexual orientation except as provided by the Ontario Human Rights Code.

equipment:
(4)	When casual performance of work expedites production or until a regular employee is available.
(5)	The Company may at any time employ men in each department who are learning the business and are bona fide apprentices for executive positions, provided, however, that such apprentices shall not displace the regular employees. These apprentices shall not be eligible to join the Union.
(e)	Prior to the initial contracting out of production related work the Company will consult with the Union to show why such work cannot be as economically performed by bargaining unit employees as by contracting out.
(9 The Company will not contract out maintenance work while suitably qualified maintenance employees are on lay-off provided that it is practical and cost-competitive to use Company maintenanceemployees.
With respect to practicality and cost-competitiveness consideration is given to such factors as:

-	is the manning required for the work in excess of the Company's manning in atrade(s).
-	is the cost with use of Company personnel lower or, if not, is the cost disadvantage marginal and therefore, offset by advantages of using Company personnel.
-	will the contractual notice requirements make the use of Company personnel cost prohibitive.

Such premiums shall not be paid concurrently with overtime worked on the premium days. When there is unauthorized absence by an employee in the particular work week, the week-end premium shall be paid at straight time for the number of
15
hours to be absorbed.
(Effective February 1, 1994) Notwithstanding the above, a continental work week may be introduced at the discretion of the Company within coffee manufacturing where production requirements require a seven day production schedule. If introduced, the continental work week will apply only to employees within coffee manufacturing and in support functions requiring a seven day work week.
Under the continental work week Saturday and Sunday will be viewed as normal working days not subject to premium payment but an employee will receive time and one-half for the sixth day they work in a week and double time for the seventh day they work in a week. When there is unauthorized absence by an employee in the particular work week, the sixth and seventh day shall be paid at straight time for the number of hours to be absorbed.
The Union will be asked to participate in the formulation of the continental work week shift patterns to ensure that the requirements of employees are taken into account as far as is reasonably practicable.
(c)	Overtime so far as practicable shall be distributed evenly among employees and shall be voluntary provided that an adequate work force is available to maintain produc-
16
tion levels. Employees may be required to work overtime and shall be given four (4) hours notice as far as possible, and when necessary employees shall be assigned to work overtime in reverse order of seniority.
(d)	The Company shall record and post the overtime hours offered each employee in the appropriate department.
(e)	An employee shall not be required to suspend work during regular hours to absorb overtime.

Time so worked shall not be included in his scheduled shift of that day for the purpose of overtime calculation.
(g)	A shift bonus of sixty (60) cents per hour effective March 10, 1993 and effective February 1, 1994 the premium is increased to sixty-two (62) cents, effective February 1, 1995 the premium is increased to sixty-four (64) cents and effective February 1, 1996 it becomes sixty-six (66) cents, shall be paid as follows and shall be added after the calculation of any overtime or premium rate:

17
scheduled afternoon or night shifts. In any case shift bonus shall not apply before 1400 hours or after 0800 hours.

FLg; Standby.
In conjunction with and further to the Agreement between Nestle Canada Inc. (Chesterville Factory) and Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 488, dated February 1, 1990 it is agreed that Standby for the Plant Maintenance Department will be in accordance with the following procedure which will not be amended or terminated without prior consultation with the Union Executive.
Plant Engineering Department Standby
These instructions are issued to cover the function of "Standby" whereby trained maintenance people are available on short notice to perform emergency type work to keep the factory in production or safe from harm. These instructions supersede any previous agreements and are as follows:
1)	The Senior Stationary Engineer (Shift Engineer) will act as co-ordinator, and as such is the representative for the Manager, Factory Engineering.
2)	The Shift Engineer will inspect all jobs, to determine which trade is required and will call the individual concerned. Minor repairs will be done by the Boiler Room personnel.
3)	Call-backs of standby personnel must
50
be made from the Boiler Room office. The standby man must telephone the Boiler Room to confirm he has received the callback and to find out what the problem is. The Shift Engineer must enter in the "callback" book, the name of the man called back, the time and the reason for the callback.
4)	The Maintenance employee on standby will be one who is capable of completing any emergency work on all of the Company's production equipment.
5)	The Maintenance man called back must make a brief note in the space provided in the call-back book, describing what was wrong and what he did to correct the situation. Any additional personnel called in (after consulting with the Shift Engineer) must also be recorded in the call-back book.
6)	No extra work shall be given to the standby man on call-back if the work can wait until the next regular shift in the estimation of the Shift Engineer in consultation with the Senior Production representative.
7)	Standby hours shall be after normal working hours Monday through Friday and during the weekend until normal starting time Monday.
8)	Changeover will be at 07:00 on Monday.
51
9)	Standby will be suspended on long weekends wherever possible and on Saturdays and/or Sundays on weekends when production or plant safety will not be compromised. The Manager, Factory Engineering shall determine when standby shall be suspended, but in any case the standby man must be available six (6) hours prior to production start-up.
10)	The standby list will be posted in the Boiler Room and in the shop.
11)	If, due to legitimate absence (i.e. sickness), a man on standby is not available during part of his standby week, his foreman will arrange for a suitable replacement and enter the replacement's name on the standby posting list in the Boiler Room and the shop.
The man normally scheduled for the week will be paid the standby premium for the week. The replacement will not be paid any premium for any time temporarily posted on standby. However, if called in, the replacement would be paid the appropriate minimum time and rate (call-back). The important thing is to have someone to contact in an emergency.
12)	Standby personnel have one half hour to report to the factory after the call is made.
13)	The penalty for not reporting or miss-
52
ing a call-back is a two-day forfeit of standby premium: a late arrival is subject to a one-day forfeit.
14)	Overtime will be done by the man on standby unless the work requires some other specialist, or continuity of work requires that men already on the job, complete the job.
15)	Standby premiums will be increased on a yearly basis according with the percentage increase of the union contract from the date of February 1, 1994.
16)	Standby premium is now$77.88/week for a two shift operation and $124.42/week for a single shift operation, February 1, 1993.

of break times or otherwise negatively
impacted on operations.

54
Alternatively, the parties may confirm that the new arrangement is preferable in which case it will be extended for the term of the current Agreement.

Re: Overtime Banking
Further to Article 8(1) of the Collective Agreement the following conditions and procedures shall govern the "banking" of overtime.
1)	That the employee advises their Supervisor that they wish to "bank" their overtime at the time of overtime assignment and that such election is irrevocable. The time eligible for banking shall be the work hours in excess of forty (40) hours in a week. The employee must bank all (both straight and premium payment portions) overtime earned on a particular shift with the additional condition that overtime on a given shift must exceed one (1) hour to be eligible for banking.
2)	That time-off in lieu of overtime may only be taken in full-work periods unless replacement is not required in the opinion of the Company.
3)	That one (1) week notice be given in advance of taking time-off in lieu of overtime payment and that the scheduling of time-off be approved by the Company. The Company may at its discretion waive the one (1) week notice requirement if no replacement is required for the employee.
4)	That banked overtime may not be substituted for vacations except that a
56
seniority employee may request to take banked overtime prior to using vacation time if the prior approval of the Supervisor has been obtained (i.e., if an employee wishes to take a day off and the Supervisor can operate the Department without him for that day, not requiring an additional man to be called in, banked overtime may be used). If an employee is scheduled for lay-off he has the option of using his vacation or banked overtime owing during this lay-off period. However, if an employee calls in sick on a Friday or Monday, and wants to be paid for these days, vacation time must be used instead of banked overtime.
5)	That time-off in lieu of overtime is not considered work time for purposes of Statutory Holiday entitlement, seniority retention, benefit extension, and other such provisions of the Collective Agreement.
6)	Unused "banked" overtime will be paid to the employee at the end of the calendar year.
7)	Pay for "banked" overtime will be at the rate in effect at the time the overtime was banked.

Re: Advance Against Weekly Indemnity or Workers' Compensation Claims
In the event of a delay of over two (2) weeks in the payment of a Weekly Indemnity or Worker's Compensation claim an employee may be provided with pay advances of $200.00 (two hundred) per week until the respective benefit payments commence, subject to the following conditions.
1)	The period of disability must be a minimum of two weeks.
2)	Two weeks have elapsed without benefits having been received from the day the Weekly Indemnity claim is submitted or the Worker's Compensation Board Treatment Memorandum is provided to the employee, and no indication that the claim has been disallowed has been received.
3)	The employee signs an undertaking to repay the advance at the rate of $200.00 (two hundred) per pay through payroll deductions and certifying that he has not received any benefit payment from the Weekly Indemnity plan or Worker's Compensation. Where an employee has received an advance, but has not returned to work prior to the commencement of benefits the advance will be repaid from such benefits. Any advances which can not be recovered from the employees will be repaid
58
to the Company by the Union in full.

Re: Vacation Banking
The following procedure will apply to the Vacation Banking option referred to in Article 13 of the parties' Collective Agreement:
1)	Elections to bank vacation should be submitted prior to the deadline for vacation scheduling requests. No additional banking of vacation will then be allowed without mutual consent.
2)	Where the Collective Agreement provides that vacation pay will be based on a percentage of the prior years earnings this amount will be converted to eight (8) hour days cf pay at the employee's regular rate. The result of the conversion will be the number of days to be banked.
Example:
An employee eligible for 10% vacation pay has earnings of $15,000 in the previous year. He elects to bank his "5th week" entitlement. His current rate is $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount would be 2% of $15,000 divided by $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount equal to 25 (twenty five) hours or 3.125 days.
3)	Employees will be advised at year's end of the amount of vacation which has been banked on their behalf. Once vacation
60
is banked it is "locked in" until retirement, resignation or other form of termination.
4)	Payment for the banked days will be based upon the rate in effect at time of termination. The Company will co-operate to the extent practical and proper to make the payment in the manner the employee feels to be most tax effective.
5)	Where banked vacation becomes payable as a result of death the payment will be made to the deceased employee's beneficiary as indicated by their life insurance beneficiary designation and in the absence of such beneficiary to their estate.

Re: Special Short Term Disability Cases
A fund of $600.00 dollars (six hundred) per year will be established by the Company to cover disability cases.
A committee formed of two Union Stewards, the Human Resources designate and the Plant Manager will review special cases to determine if there is basis for paying benefits at the standard level for those days prior to benefit entitlement under the strict interpretation of the insurance contract.
In the case of "ties" the matter will be resolved in the favour of the employee. If the $600.00 dollars (six hundred) fund is exhausted the committee will not meet until the next calendar year and no cases will be eligible for special treatment.

Re: Continental Work Week - Article 8 B>
If and when the continental work week is introduced into coffee manufacturing, all employees in the Department at that time or in supporting functions who are required to work on the continental work week shall receive a once-only payment of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) subject to normal deductions.
An employee who bids into a Department where the continental work week is in operation shall receive the fifteen hundred dollar ($1,500) payment upon successful completion of the sixty (60) day trial period.
Notwithstanding the above, no employee shall receive the fifteen hundred dollar ($1,500) lump sum more than once during their period of employment with Nestle Canada Inc., neither shall the payment be made to any employee who joins the Company after February 1, 1993.
The continental work week will not be introduced into coffee manufacturing unless and until additional volumes are introduced into the factory.
The continental work week is not designed to eliminate overtime. Overtime will continue to be required based on production requirements and employees will continue to receive time and a half for
65
working on their sixth day and double time for working on their seventh day.
The only change is that there will be no premium payments for working on Saturday or Sunday where Saturday or Sunday are not the sixth or seventh day that an employee works in the week.
The Company believes that the support functions impacted by the continental work week will be limited to the following:
General Labour	10
Lift Truck Drivers	3
Van Spotters	2
Power House	8
Shop/Line Mechanics	4
Any additions to the above will be by mutual agreement between the parties. Such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.
