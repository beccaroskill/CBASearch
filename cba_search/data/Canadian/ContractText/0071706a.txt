(A) First, to provide for:
(1)	The continuation of annuities in the form in effect with respect to them immediatelyprior to the plan’s termination for those persons who are pensioners, beneficiaries and contingent annuitants under the plan at its termination;
(2)	The payment of an immediate annuity, in an amount equal to the retirement benefit they would have received had they retired on the date of termination to each participant who on the date of termination qualifies for a normal retirement benefit under Section 5.01;
99
(3)	The payment of a deferred annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65) in an amount equal to their vested deferred retirement benefit to each person who terminated employment and is eligible for such a benefit pursuant to Section 5.04;
(4)	The payment of a deferred annuity equal to the vested deferred retirement pension to which they would have been entitled if the date of the plan’s termination were the date of termination cf their employment, to each other participant not in any class above who at the date of the plan’s termination is at least age forty-five (45) and has completed at least ten (10) years of credited service.
There shall be no priority among the above. Any person, whether in Group (1), (2), (3) or (4), stands on the same rung of the ladder with a person in any other group.
(B) Second,if any such assets remain after complete allocation for the purposes of (A) above, they shall be allocated after first establishing classes of participantswho are less than age sixty-five (65) on the date of termination and are potentially eligiblefor a normal retirement benefit by treating each successively younger five (5) year age group as a class using the age sixty-five (65) as a base. An order of allocation priority shall then be established beginning with the oldest class. The assets shall then be allocated to participants in each such class who have an interest herein on account of credited service prior to the date of termination of the plan in an amount equal to the actuarial value of such interest. The allocations of the amounts, if any, in each class for full or reduced retirement benefits for such participants shall be on the basis of annuity values providing for the payment of such benefits (commencing at the age of first eligibilityfor a normal benefit) in the form, applicableto such participants, which would have prevailed had the plan not been discontinuedwith application for reduction of retirement benefits, as in (A) above.
Such allocation shall be accomplished through the continuance of the trust fund which shall be maintained without earmark as the severable equitable interests of those having a share allocated as above. The allocation of assets in this Section is merely for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the trust fund to provide reserves for retirement benefits of a certain monthly amount, and is not intended to give any participant such
100
right, title and interest in the trust fund as to entitle them to a segregation of their aliquot share of the trust fund as a separate account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the trustees, upon finding that it is not practicable or desirable under the circumstances to continue the trust fund with respect to some of all of the groups listed above, the trustees may provide for the disposition of all or a part of the trust fund in a manner other than by the continuance of the trust fund with respect to some or all of the groups listed above, but no change shall be affected thereby in the order of precedence and basis for allocation above established.
Further, if required to dispose of the trust fund other than by its continuance because of a government rule or statute, such trust fund shall be disposed of in accordance with such rule or statute. If any allocation produces a retirement benefit cf less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per year for any person, the trustees may pay in lieu of a retirement benefit a lump sum of equivalent actuarial value,
Anything in this plan which might be construed to the contrary notwithstanding however, it shall be impossible at any time for any time for any part of the corpus or income of the trust fund to revert to the Company
8.04	AMENDMENTS
Amendments to this plan may be made in writing by mutual consent of both parties.
8.05	TERMINATION
This Agreement is effective October 1, 2001 and shall remain in full force and in effect until September 30, 2004 and shall continue in effect thereafter from year to year for further periods of one year each unless either party shall have given written notice of termination or written notice of proposals for amendment to the other party not less than two months but not more than three months prior to the expiration date or any anniversary date thereafter.
In the event of written notice of termination of proposals for amendment having been given by either party as herein provided, negotiations shall be proceeded with during the notice period with a view to completing a new Agreement. Should such negotiations extend beyond the expiration date, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until negotiations are
101

Introduction
Both the Company and the Union are committed to providing a workplace free cf discrimination and harassment. Providing fair and equitable
112
treatment for all employees is best achieved in an environment where all individuals interact with mutual respect for each other’s rights. All employees are expected to treat all persons with courtesy and consideration and must not engage in discrimination or harassment because of a prohibited ground contrary to the Ontario human rights Code (the “Code”), Prohibited grounds are race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, record of offenses, marital status, family status or handicap, as defined in the Code. This joint policy shall be interpreted in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Code.
Complaint and Investigation Procedure
If an employee believes that they has been harassed and/or discriminated against on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination the employee may:
(A)	Advise the person involved, as soon as possible, how you feel and request that they stop the conduct you find offensive.
(B)	If you feel uncomfortable approaching the person, or if the harassment continues, bring the incident forming the basis of the complaint to the attention of the supervisor and/or Union representative.
In minor cases, not involving repeat incidents, the Company and Union agree that the Union may try to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint between bargaining unit employees informally using the C2W Internal Procedure without a full investigation when so requested by the bargaining unit complainant, The outcome of this attempted resolution will be communicated to the Company
(C)	If the supervisor and/or Union representative cannot, to the satisfaction of the employee, deal with the complaint, it will then be submitted in writing to the joint committee.
The joint committee will be comprised of two (2) representativesselect-ed by the Company and Two (2) representatives selected by the Union.

These representatives must be appropriately trained regarding harassment and discriminationissues.

In conducting the joint investigation, both the Union and the Company shall, to the extent practicable, maintain confidentiality,
Records of the investigation, including interviews, evidence any recommendations made by the joint committee will be securely maintained in the offices of the Company and the Union.
Upon the completion of the joint investigation, the joint committee vil complete a written report of its findings and recommendations and submit a copy of the completed report to the human resource person and the plant chairperson. If the members of the joint committee do not agree, the report may reflect differences in the findings.
If a harassment complaint is proven valid, appropriate corrective action will be taken against the offending employees.
If, after completion of a thorough investigation, a harassment complaint can neither be proved nor disproved in the view of the investigators, the local human resource person, on consultation with the local plant chairperson, will attempt to resolve the conflict in a manner that is agreeable to ail parties.
If there is no agreement, the Company reserves the right to take such action as it deems appropriate, subjectto the Collective Labour Agreement.
In the event the complaint remains unresolved and a violation of the Collective Labour Agreement is alleged, the matter may be considered as a grievance beginning at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Nothing in this letter of understanding prevents an individual employee complaining of harassment or discrimination from filing a complaint under the Code.
