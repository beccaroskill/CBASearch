RE:		Bakers Help for the Bakerv Department
The Bakery, Confectionary and Tabacco Workers' International Union, Local 468 and Canada Safeway Limited have entered into an agreement that allows for the introduction of Bakers Helpers into the Bakery Department.
We recognize that the slicing, wrapping, packaging and overqrapping is the exclusivejurisdiction of the Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers' Union.
I will not tolerate the scheduling of Bakery Helpers in such a way that our pre-ratification employees are denied their rights under the terms of the Collective Agreement.
I have instructed our Hunan Resources Department to bring any abuses of B.C.&T jurisdictional work reported by the Union, to my personal attention.

(3.)	It is understood that the available hours of work scheduled to "Bakers Helper" shall be claimable
by employees hired prior to ratification, 1997, within each classification (except for those hours made available as a result of the Buyout).

In the event there are not sufficient available hours on the weekends and late hours, the Employer will next schedule any remaining hours during the day.
Senior employees in these classification shall be scheduled at lease as many hours as junior employees in these classifications within each work schedule.
