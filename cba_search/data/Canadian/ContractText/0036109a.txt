(a)	employment is considered or expected to be on a fifty-two (52) weeks-a-year basis; or
(b)	employment is such that an employee completes thirty-six (36) weeks and one hundred and eighty (180) full or part days' service with the Company in a twelve (12) month period.
7.2	An employee shall have no seniority until he has accumulated one hundred (100) working days of employment in a twelve (12) month period. After completion of such service his seniority shall date back to the day one hundred (100) working days preceding the date on which he completed such period of service, at which time his name will be placed on the seniority list.
7.3	The seniority of an employee shall be considered broken, all rights forfeited, and there shall be no obligation to rehire when he:
(a)	Voluntarily leaves the employ of the Company, or is dismissed for cause. (An employee who is absent for two (2) consecutive working days without good and proper reason, or without first securing permission from the Company, may be considered to have left the Company's service of his own accord).
(b)	Fails to contact the Company within forty-eight (48) hours of being notified of recall (by phone or failing contact by certified mail); or subsequently fails to report for work within seven (7) days of being recalled, unless he contacts the Company within seven (7) days of being called and secures permission to start at a later date. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Company advised, (and the Union should be advised) in writing, of his current address and telephone number, if any. Failure to do so can result in loss of seniority, since the Company's obligation to call in an employee shall cease when it has attempted to contact him at his last known address.
(c)	Is laid off continuously for a period of more than eighteen (18) months.
7.4	An employee transferred from one plant of the Company to another shall retain his seniority, subject to approval by the local union of the plant to which he is transferred. In any case such employee will not be required to serve a probationary period and for purposes of rights within this Agreement, will be considered to be a seniority employee.

7.5	Should an employee who has been promoted or transferred to a position outside the bargaining unit be subsequently transferred back, he shall be credited with all prior seniority but will not be credited with service outside of the bargaining unit.
7.6	In cases of lay-offs, recalls and transfers of one day or more, the Company agrees to give preference to employees according to seniority, provided all other qualifications are comparatively equal.
7.7	When a seniority classified employee is temporarily transferred to a higher paying job for the convenience of the Company for one day or more, he shall receive the higher rate for all such hours worked, and when temporarily transferred to a lower paying job he shall not thereby receive a change in his regular hourly rate.
7.8	When it is necessary to reduce the working force, the order of lay-off shall be as follows:
First:	Seasonal probationary employees.
Second:	Seasonal seniority employees.
Third:	Regular employees.
In carrying out the lay-off procedure the following factors will be considered by the Company:
1.	Seniority.
2.	Ability to perform the work.
3.	Proven ability to exercise their seniority for Class 2 jobs and above.
When these factors are comparatively equal, seniority shall govern.
It is understood that employees on regular classified jobs may be required to carry out any function of the operation as directed, but shall not thereby receive a change in hourly rate. Assignment to such temporary work will be made on the basis of seniority within the classification.
Recall shall work in the reverse order, for employees with seniority.

[Employees on lay-off shall be informed of any job postings.] The essential job requirements will be included on the posting. In considering qualified employees for the position, the Company agrees to give preference according to seniority, provided all other qualifications are comparatively equal. The vacancy resulting from the filling of the position posted, if to be filled, shall also be posted within a period of two (2) weeks. If a subsequent vacancy, if to be filled, occurs from the filling of the second vacancy, it shall also be posted within a period of two (2) weeks. Any subsequent vacancy caused by the filling of the first three (3), shall not be a vacancy for the purpose of this clause.
An employee who applies for a posted job and is accepted may not apply to fill a posted position within two (2) months of the promotion.
The Company agrees to furnish the Union with a copy of the job posting, the applicants, and the name of the successful candidate.
9.2	A successful candidate of a job posting will be on a trial basis for ten (10) working days. If management rates the employee as successful they will officially take the job position on the 11th working day, and the rate of pay for that position will be in effect. If they fail to meet the job requirements or decline the position by the 10th working day, they will return to their previous job. If the employee decides they no longer want the new job position after the 11th day, they will be placed as a Production Worker and would not have the right to bump back to their previous job if it was Classified.

ARTICLE 10 - REPORTING ALLOWANCE
10.1	It is the responsibility of each employee to advise the Company of any changes in address or telephone numbers. Failure of any employee to do so will negate any liability the Company has under this clause. The Company will provide the employee and the Union Office with copies of change of address/phone numbers.
10.2	A seniority employee reporting for work as scheduled, unless given at least eight (8) hours notice not to report, but for whom no work at his regular job is available, will be offered at least four (4) hours employment in any available work at his regular job rate, or at the Company's option, will be paid four (4) hours time at his regular rate of pay. This provision shall not apply if work is not available because of conditions over which the Company has no control, and the employee has not reported and is available for work at their scheduled starting time.
ARTICLE 11 - CALL-IN PAY
11.1	A seniority employee called back to do work outside his regular working hours to meet an emergency, shall be through when the emergency is over, and will be paid at his regular hourly rate or the appropriate overtime rate, but, in any event not less than four (4) hours pay at his regular hourly rate.

Renewal of such leave may be granted, provided application for renewal is in the hands of the Company at least one (1) month prior to the expiration of the leave of absence. An employee will continue to accumulate seniority during such leave of absence, except for the purpose of obtaining benefits (holidays, vacation, pension, group benefits, and etc.).
Such employees, within one (1) month's written notice of their desire to return to work with the Company, shall, subject to their seniority, providing they can perform the required work, be placed on the job previously held or one at an equal rate of pay.

Dear Shawn:
During the recently completed contract negotiations the parties agreed to renew the following which will be in effect for the life of the agreement which expires on March 01, 2005:
Three Shift Operation
The Company must maintain the right to schedule and assign work as defined in Article 2, however, if the Company finds it necessary to operate on a three-shift basis, the Company agrees to provide 8 hours of work. (In other words, no loss of pay due to a three shift operation).
O.H.I.P
The Company agrees that if the Provincial Government was to change the present payroll tax to an employee premium, then the Company would maintain the practice as defined in the agreement which expired on March 01, 1991.
Banking of Overtime
The Company and Union agree that all regular status employees will be allowed to bank a maximum of two (2) weeks of overtime which they may use to take additional time off. The banked hours may not be used between May 01 and November 30th of any year without the express consent of management. It is understood that employees may elect to use banked hours to cover absences due to illness at any time during the year.
Plant Transfers
The Company agrees to allow interested employees to apply in writing to local plant management for the purpose of expressing interest in job opportunities at other facilities. It is understood that application does not in any way guarantee employee(s) automatic access or
preferential treatment to applied for positions and any and all hiring will be at the discretion of local area management.
Vacation
a)	The Company and Union agree to allow Regular Status employees who are laid-off a minimum of eight (8) weeks in the previous calendar year to have the option of receiving their vacation pay earned in the previous calendar year in a lump sum payment.
b)	Vacation entitlement will be scheduled by March 01 of each year and employees must book all but one (1) week of their vacation entitlement by March 01 of each year. Employees who so desire may retain a maximum of one (1) week of vacation entitlement to be used on a day to day basis or as a full week as business needs permit. Employees may schedule all of their entitlement by March 01 if they so choose.
Seasonal Seniority Employee Benefits
a)	The Company agrees to allow seasonal seniority employees the opportunity to purchase major medical and/or dental benefits.
b)	The Company agrees to allow seasonal seniority employees the opportunity to participate in the Shares Program and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
