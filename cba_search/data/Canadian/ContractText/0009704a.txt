When leave of absence is granted for reasons other than sickness, the Brotherhood shall be advised of the reasons upon request.

ARTICLE 9	- HOURS OF WORK AND MONTHLY LEAVE
9.01	The Parties to this Agreement subscribe to the principle that there should be a limitation of the number of hours worked per day and the number of days worked per week but, recognizing the practical difficulty of establishing such limitation and control on the vessels covered by this Agreement, agree that a system of shore leave as established hereunder or as altered hereafter shall be in effect to compensate employees for the absence of daily and weekly control of working hours, except as is provided by Article 11:17 of this agreement.

Dispatches made under emergency conditions shall be entered as such in the vessel's log.
9.05	Differences may arise over the definition of home port for some crews which cannot readily be resolved by reference to the foregoing. Therefore, a Committee shall be established consisting of two members of the Fish Processors' Bargaining Association of B.C. and two members of the Native Brotherhood of B.C. whose duty will be to settle any differences. Based on their experience during the season, the Committee shall be empowered to bring in recommendations for amendments to this Agreement provided such amendments are not inconsistent with the general terms set out above.
