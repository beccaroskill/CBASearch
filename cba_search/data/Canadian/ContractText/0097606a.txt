It is recognized by this Agreement to be the duty of the Company and its employees to cooperate fully, individually and collectively for the advancement of said conditions.
ARTICLE 2 - RECOGNITION
2:01 The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agency for all regular employees in the Plaster Rock mills and mill yards and any employees working in any new additions to the mill (such as but not limited to, debarkers and slashers) other than the Plant Manager, Production Superintendent, Personnel Supervisor, Maintenance Superintendent, supervisors, Shipping Co-ordinator, office staff, clerks, scalers, watchmen, Fraser Woods employees who may be associated with trucking, garage, loading, unloading and piling down of logs, reclaiming logs from piles, and all short-term jobs, such as grading, snowplowing or bulldozing. The Company will not hire loaders with operators if there are regular or spare classified loader operators and/or Company owned machines available to do the work.
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3:01 It is agreed that it is the exclusive function and right of the Company to operate and manage all aspects of its business, including the limitation, curtailment and cessation of any or all operations, except where any right to do so has been specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement.
3:02 The Company reserves the right to adjust all or any of its crews arising out of any change in manufacturing process or in a change of equipment.
1
3:03 The Company agrees to review with the Union pertinent details and reasons for any major cutbacks or lumbermill shutdowns. The Company will have such review with the Union not less than two (2) weeks in advance of such contemplated change unless an emergency situation arises on short notice. Emergency situations should generally be considered as events beyond the control of local mill management.
3:04 Technological Change
a)	Technological change for the purposes of this agreement is defined as changes in the operation
resulting from the introduction of new and different equipment which will reduce labour requirements.
b)	The Company agrees to give the Union as much advance notice as possible from the decision to make a technological change and the start-up of the new equipment. If there will be a reduction of two or more regular jobs, the advance notice will be at least six weeks in advance of start-up.
c)	The notice to the Union will advise of the new equipment and the earliest anticipated start-up
date together with information as to the number of jobs to be eliminated and an offer to sit down with the Union executives to discuss the coming changes and other jobs which may be affected or training to be undertaken.
ARTICLE 4 - HIRING, SERVICE, PROMOTION, DEMOTION, TRANSFER, ETC.
4:01 When hiring new employees, the Company shall, in the first place, take into consideration the ability, both present and potential, of the prospective employees.
4:02 Recognising its obligation to help solve community problems when hiring new employees, the Management of the Company will give preference to residents of Plaster Rock, N.B., and surrounding area, provided qualifications and abilities are equal to other applicants.
4:03
a)	In cases of promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and recall, length of service will prevail when
skill and experience are relatively equal.
b)	When a permanent vacancy on a classification occurs, the job will be posted for bid unless there
is a regular spare assigned to the classification, who has been appointed to a regular spare status on that classification as the result of job bid award. If there is a permanent vacancy and there is a regular spare appointed by job bid, then the senior regular spare for that job will be the individual transferred to that classification.
2
An employee holding spare seniority to a classification as the result of a regular spare job bid award as indicated above will still retain seniority on his regular classification. The Company has the right to establish one or more spares for all regular classifications which require advance training and will post job bids for all classifications for which it determines a need for regular spares.
Temporary spare assignments on a classification may be made as necessary but will not exceed one (1) week in duration unless there is currently no available classified spare for the position. Individuals so appointed without a job bid award will gain no seniority or rights in that classification and their experience as the result of a temporary spare assignment will not be used to give them precedence in a later job bid award. Temporary assignments will not exceed four (4) calendar months.
In the event of a prolonged absence (other than vacation) exceeding two (2) weeks in duration, the resultant vacancy will be filled by the senior classified spare for the position starting no later than the first complete calendar week following notice of absence.
c)	All applicants will be advised as to the disposition of their application and in the event senior
employees are to be bypassed on a job bid selection, a Company representative will meet with the Union to review the skill, qualifications and other factors, where applicable, upon which the award is to be based.
d)	In the event of job reduction or elimination caused by lay-offs, changes in mill equipment or
operating methods and/or procedures, the following will apply:
The selection of the employees to be laid off from active mill employment will be made on inverse order of mill seniority except that the company will have the right to retain more junior employees in place of more senior employees, where the junior employees retained have special skills or licenses that the Company determines are necessary to its operations.
In determining who will fill remaining jobs after a lay-off as covered above, the Company will:
A)	In continuing classifications give preference for retention to the senior (on the basis of mill seniority) of the employees who have indicated to the Personnel Supervisor, at least 24 working hours in advance, of their desire to continue working and who have been regularly assigned to that classification. The retained senior employee may be subject to bumping as indicated in B) below.
B)	Reassign, on the basis of mill seniority, employees laid-off from their regular classification and who have indicated to the Personnel Supervisor, at least twenty-four (24) working hours in advance, of their desire to continue working to a parallel or the nearest lower rated classification for which they have the experience and/or the skill and ability to fill to the Company's satisfaction without extensive training or break in. If there is no lower rated classification for which they have the experience and/or skill and ability to fill, they will be
3
reassigned to the nearest higher rated classification for which they do have the experience and/or the ability to fill to the Company's satisfaction without extensive training or break-in.
For employees displaced as a result of technological change as described in Article 3:04 above, the training and/or break-in period may be extended to thirty (30) days as required.
C)	In repositioning employees as the result of a job reduction or lay-off as described above, the Company agrees to accept mill seniority and the Union agrees to accept the Company's evaluation of the special skills required in the mill and those possessed by individual employees.
D)	If work is not available in a given area due to unforeseen interruptions or schedule changes that involve short-term situations, employees working in the affected area in the lumbermill, at the start of their next scheduled shift, will be allowed to bump junior employees working elsewhere in the lumbermill complex provided they:
*	Report to work
*	Make their intentions clear to mill management
*	Have the necessary skills and abilities to exercise bumping rights
Mill management will be responsible to ensure that the appropriate procedures are followed in a timely and effective manner.
All employees reporting for work at the start of their shift will, if they can exercise bumping rights or if alternative work is available, be assigned to the proper work area. If no work is available, employees will be sent home without pay. If employees are bumped after the shift has started, they will be paid only for time worked.
Employees not wishing to exercise bumping rights in the event of such interruptions or schedule changes will be required to notify management, on an annual basis, of their preference. Such employees, as well as junior employees with no bumping rights, will be contacted as per Article 13:03.
E)	Give preference to senior employees without a valid M.L.B. License, who otherwise have the necessary skills and qualifications, for the positions of trimmerman, stacker operator, tallyman, strapping machine operator or stockman. Such employees will not be bumped by junior employees holding a valid M.L.B.License.
e)	The employee selected on a job bid will be subject to a maximum thirty (30) working day probationary period during which time he will be assessed for continued assignment in the department and during such period he may elect to return to his former job. Seniority on a classification will be established on the date of the job bid award. An employee being removed or withdrawing from the classification within the thirty (30) working day period will return to his previous classification without loss of seniority and will lose all seniority in the classification from which he was removed or withdrew.
4
An employee who meets the necessary requirements for a job bid (spare or regular) will participate in a review with Management and Union representatives. Purpose of this review will be to fully explain all aspects of the position to ensure the employee is completely informed prior to making a final decision.
Within the training period for groups zero (0) through three (3) an employee will have the opportunity to withdraw from the position within forty-five (45) hours actual training time, without penalty, and bid on future job postings. For groups four (4) through eight (8) the allowable withdrawal time will be extended to ninety (90) hours of actual training time.
An employee removed by the Company from a job for which he/she had been selected, will be allowed to immediately bid on another spare or regular job posting. Upon accepting a job bid award, an employee will not be eligible to bid on any (spare or regular) jobs for a period of one (1) calendar year.
f)	If the Union should question the application by the Company of this provision, representatives
of the Company will meet with Union representatives to discuss and review all the factors involved in the Company's selection of individuals affected.
g)	A Labour/Management Committee will meet every month to discuss matters of mutual interest.
The committee will consist of three (3) representatives each from the Company and the Union. A Business Representative from the Union and the Manager of Human Resources (or designated representative) from the Company may also attend these meetings.
4:04 When it becomes necessary to fill vacant jobs, preference will be given to present employees in the bargaining unit, provided they have the ability to fulfill the requirements of the job, before recruiting from outside the unit.
4:05 Service or mill seniority shall mean time from last date of hire as a regular employee. Temporary or part time student employees for vacation relief will start service or mill seniority if they become available for work on a normal basis and will immediately become eligible for Union membership if they have already worked in excess of forty-five (45) days. The effective hiring date for a student will be the date on which he/she becomes a regular employee.
4:06 Service will be broken by discharge for cause, voluntary separation or refusal of an offer of employment or absence due to lay-off, sickness or accident, in excess of the following maximum periods:
a)	Service will be broken by discharge for cause, voluntary separation or refusal of an offer of employment.
5
b)	In the event of absence due to lay-off, sickness or accident the following schedule will apply:
Employee Service	Maximum Period
1 to 12 months	1 month for each full month of service with a maximum of 12 months
1 year to 5 years	12 months
5 years to 10 years	24 months
10 years or more	36 months
4:07 Employees hired for vacation or other relief or as students will retain seniority for only forty-five (45) days after last day worked. Subsequent re-employment will be as a new employee without consecutive service.
4:08
a)	An employee is considered a new employee until he/she has completed forty-five (45) days of
work. During this period he/she will be considered probationary and will have full recourse to normal Union representation and the grievance procedure. During an employee's probationary period, the Company has, however, full and uncontestable right to terminate such employee if the Company decides, for any reason, that the probationary employee is or will prove to be unsatisfactory.
b)	Should a probationary employee be laid off before completing forty-five (45) days of employment and subsequently be rehired by the Company within ninety (90) days, his/her unbroken service with the Company prior to layoff will be counted in computing the probationary period. The employee's seniority date will be forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the date of completion of the probationary period.
c)	An employee’s seniority date will be the date of hire.
4:09
a)	List of service records will be prepared and posted at the Mill and Planer Mill twice a year
(April 1st and October 1st) and a copy will be forwarded to the Union. Such list will indicate each employee’s regular classification and effective date and also spare classification and effective date, if any. Copies of all job bid awards will be forwarded to the Union.
b)	If an employee disagrees with his/her service credit, such employee must apply for a review within forty-five (45) days of such posting.

4.	Retain Pension Accrued Before 1997
a)	Each employee who is a Member will be given the choice of retaining rights to pension benefits
accrued under the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 1996, based on the greater of formula (A) or (B) below:
A)	1.65% of the Member’s average annual earnings during the five (5) years prior to 1997 for which earnings were the highest, multiplied by the Member’s Continuous Contributory Service to December 31, 1996;
less
1/35th of the C/QPP benefits in effect in 1996, multiplied by the Member’s Continuous Contributory Service from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996, not exceeding 21 years.
Earnings for this purpose shall be the employee’s classified rate multiplied by his/her normal scheduled hours. However, in the event that an employee’s scheduled earnings in any of the five 12-month periods immediately preceding retirement do not reflect a normal annual schedule of hours for that period for reasons other than a leave of absence, the employee’s earnings for that period will be adjusted to reflect his/her normal annual schedule of hours, provided the employee has been actively at work for at least 3 months during that 12-month period. For a disabled employee, the classified rate to be used for this adjustment shall be the classified rate in effect immediately preceding the onset of the disability.
B)	The future service normal pension accrued to the Member to January 1, 1988, including the pension accrued as a result of benefit adjustments made before 1988;

and who elect to retain their defined benefit pensions will receive pensions after attaining vesting status (5 years of Continuous Service) reduced in accordance with Section 6.04(b) of the Pension Plan.
5.	Conversion Values - Pensions Accrued Before 1997
Each employee who is a Member will be permitted to elect before January 1, 1997 to convert the pension accrued to December 31, 1996 and to have the conversion value deposited to his account as of January 1, 1997 in the defined contribution pension plan. Each Member electing this conversion option shall have the commuted value of his/her pension accrued to December 31, 1996 calculated according to the following assumptions:

48
PLASTER ROCK LUMBERMILL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN Effective February 1, 1982
Bonus to be based on production per shift at sawmill as per packages completed - a control will be necessary on package content to assure that quality is maintained and that grades and dimensions are not mixed to complete packages prematurely. Package volumes to be determined on basis of saleable lumber per package coming out of planer mill i.e. if a package of rough lumber contains 1800 fbm before drying and dressing but only 1500 fbm are saleable after package goes through planer mill, 1500 fbm will be volume used for calculating sawmill production. These figures will have to be monitored closely and adjustments made monthly at first in order to reflect as closely as possible the true production situation.
Bonus to be calculated on a per shift basis and paid weekly to all employees working at the sawmill. Shift production will be calculated as the average of the two shifts when the mill is operating on a two shift per day basis.
The Company agrees to meet with a committee from the Local Union each month for the purpose of reviewing the lumber inventory, production and shipment statements and to discuss any adjustments which are to be made in the lumber package conversion factors. At such meeting the Union representatives will be free to review any questions they believe to be adversely affecting production including problems of maintenance, manning and availability of spare parts.
In the event that the sawmill schedule is changed from a two shift per day basis to a one shift per day basis, the bonus schedule for two shift basis will continue to apply during the first two weeks following the change. The one shift schedule will be applied to any subsequent weeks worked on a one shift per day basis.
The bonus schedule for a two shift basis will apply to all shifts worked on a two shift per day basis.
In the event changes in process, manning or equipment are made which affect productivity, the standard production of the mill on which incentive awards are made may be adjusted upward or downward in order to maintain as nearly as possible the same relative opportunity for incentive earnings by individual employees as existed prior to the change. Any adjustments will be phased in at the rate of 1% adjustment every three (3) weeks.
The Bonus plan will be applicable to Sawmill and Planer Mill on an independent basis as follows:
49
Sawmill
Bonus to be calculated on production per shift basis (average of two shifts when mill is operating on two shifts basis) same as at present. Hourly bonus table has been modified to reflect 1,000 fbm increments. This new table will be in effect starting the first day of the week following ratification.
Planer Mill
Applicable to all employees working at planer mill or associated with planer mill operations e.g. machine operators handling dressed lumber and/or for shipment.
Bonus to be based on production per shift at planer mill on basis of saleable output from the planer mill.
Bonus will be calculated daily and paid weekly. The hourly bonus to be paid for each day will be calculated by finding the applicable hourly bonus from the attached tables for each of the planers in operation on that day and averaging the two (e.g. Specialty operates on 1" lumber and produces 40,000 fbm results in hourly bonus of $0.66; Coastal operates on 2" lumber and produces 160,000 fbm, results in hourly bonus of $1.01. Hourly bonus to be paid to all employees working in Planer Mill for this day is ($0.66 + $1.01) + 2 - $0.835). If the Planer Mill operates on two (2) shifts per day basis, the hourly bonus to be paid for that day will be the average of the two shifts.
In the event that either line operates for less than nine (9) hours in shift for reasons other than equipment breakdowns (e.g. lack of stock, etc.), the production for the line(s) in question will be adjusted to reflect a full nine (9) hours of production.
Export Lumber
Export lumber not dressed in the Planer Mill will not be counted as planer production for bonus purposes.
Effective on the first day of the week following ratification, bonus will be paid on export lumber handled at the Planer Mill on the basis of $0.005 per hour per package handled - bonus to be paid to all employees on the day shift. (ie. no bonus to be paid if an extra crew is brought in to do export packaging on night shift or on overtime.)
50
Boiler Room Employees
Bonus for boiler room, kiln and maintenance employees will be based on sawmill production bonus. Planermill Working Foreman will be paid on planermill production bonus.
Bonus will be paid to Boiler Room employees, Dry Kiln employees working the seven (7) day kiln schedule, Lubrication Technicians working the seven (7) day schedule, Maintenance employees working shift No. 3 (Wednesday-Saturday), Maintenance employees working the Tuesday to Saturday schedule, and the Planermill Working Foreman when scheduled Tuesday through Saturday - for all hours worked at straight time each week. Hourly bonus payment for days on which the sawmill (or planermill where applicable) does not operate will be the average hourly bonus payment paid during the week in which the non-operating day occurs i.e. Saturday bonus to be based on the previous week and Sunday bonus on the following week”.

OVERTIME PROCEDURE
WEEKDAYS - Employees in regular classification will be asked first to work.
Upon regular employees declining, preference will be given to the senior (Mill Seniority) employees from the overtime list, providing they have the necessary skills and abilities.
Employees required to work at sawmill will be selected from the sawmill list; same approach applies to planermill.
Deadline for weekday overtime - 3:00 a.m. (night shift) or 3:00 p.m. (day shift).
WEEKENDS - Overtime work will be scheduled from the employees on the weekend
lumbermill overtime list, which combines the Planer and Sawmill weekend overtime lists. For weekend fuel (biomass) the senior mobile equipment operator on the weekend overtime list will be selected.
If a Holiday falls during the regular workweek, the weekend procedures will apply.
In the event that employees on the weekend overtime list are not contacted after Friday’s day shift, such employees will not be required to report to work if they are subsequently contacted (i.e. voluntary basis).
The only time seniority will be by-passed for weekends is stated on Article 23:05 of the Labour Agreement.
Deadline for weekend overtime list will be noon on Wednesday. If a Holiday falls on Friday, the deadline will be noon on Tuesday.
