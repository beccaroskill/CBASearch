20
b)	The qualifications of each employee concerned to meet the normal requirements of the job.
A reduction in the number of employees in a classifications a Department is deemed to be a workforce reduction and the process outlined in 8.05 will be followed for employees affected by such a reduction.
8.05	a) In any reductionof the workforce, for more than six days, employees with the least Company seniority will be laid off, except that the Company will not be required to retain an employee because of his Company seniority unless such employee possesses the necessary qualifications to perform, and is willing to perform the work of the employee who would otherwise be laid off in accordance with this provision.

21
c)	If there are vacancies available in departments due to the reduction of employees by Company seniority, employees who have been unable to remain in their respective Departmentswill be assigned to fill such other vacancies on the basis of qualifications and Company Seniority, except that a journeyman may displace junior employees in the same trade in another department providing they are qualified and meet the full requirements of the position.
d)	The reasonable trial or training period as referred to in Article 8.01 (d), does not apply in the case of layoff or recall. However, a senior employee will be entitled to a 3-day familiarization period in one of the existing vacancies. It is understood the Company may refuse to grant the 3-day familiarization period if it can demonstrate that the employee could not meet the requirementsof the job even if a 3-day familiarization period were granted.

22
e)	Subject to Article 17.01, and the paragraph below, when it is determined that a subsequent permanent vacancy is to be filled, qualified employees who have been displaced from the job in question, as a result of a workforce reduction, within the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date the vacancy is being filled and who are working on site on a permanent basis, will be offered the vacancy on the basis of Company Seniority.
If the vacancy is in a Line of Progression, the most senior employee who has been displaced from the job in question, or a higherjob in the Line, will be offered the vacancy. If the employee declines the vacancy, he will lose any options provided by this clause and the Company will not be required to offer him any future vacancies in that job classification. If the employee was being paid at a red-circled rate, that will cease at the time of refusal.
If the vacancy cannot be filled as above, the provisionsof Articles8.13 and 8.18 will be followed and, where applicable, Article 8.05(f). If the vacancy is in a Line of Progression, the most senior employee who has been displaced from the job in question, or a higherjob in the Line, will be offered the vacancy.
f)	Employees will be recalled from layoff on the basis of their Company seniority and
23
ability to meetthe qualifications of the job for which they are being recalled.
g)	Except for jobs of a temporary or emergency nature, an employee being recalled will be sent notice by registered mail to the employee's last known address.

The employee shall notify the Company of his intention to return to work within five (5) days and shall return to work within ten (10) days from the mailing of such notice, or on the specified date of recall, if later. The employee shall lose the right of such recall on the failure to comply with these conditions.
h)	An employee may be granted an additional ten (10) days to return to work for reasons satisfactory to the Company. If he fails to return at the end of the ten (10) day extension, the employee shall lose the right of recall. This period will be extended if disability prevents immediate return if the employee notifies the Company of the disability within the ten day period.
i)	However, an employee recalled to a temporary assignment may refuse recall without loss of subsequent recall rights.
j)	An employee who returns to work following recall and is subsequently laid off will
24
again qualify under the provisions of Article 8.03 (c).
k)	If at the time of a layoff the Company gives an employee a definite date in writing upon which he is to return to work, further notice of recall will not be required and the employee shall lose the right of such recall, subjecttoArticle8.05 (g), if he fails to returnon the date specified.
l)	An employee may elect layoff in lieu of a demotion to a Tower job classification without loss of subsequent recall rights.

In the event an employee who received a severance payment as provided above, is recalled within the period covered by the payment (maximum of thirteen (13) weeks), he shall repay a prorata amount of the severance payment based upon the date of recall. The parties agree that for the purpose of this agreement, the term "significant numbers" as referred to in the T rade Union Act shall mean one or more persons, and as such any provisions outlined in this agreement
25
or in the Trade Union Act shall apply should a technological change affect one or more employees.

An employee who is maintaining his rate in accordance with this provision shall be required to accept any higher paying permanent vacancy in the department he was demoted from providing he has the seniority and qualifications to till that classification. Failure to do so will result in the loss of these rate maintenance provisions.

8.08	a) If the transfer of an employee from one
department to another is required by the Company because of considerations of
27
health, his departmental seniority in such other department shall be deemed to be equal to his departmental seniority in the department from which he was transferred.

14.15 Overtime will be voluntary, except when an employee cannot be relieved or in the event of an emergency. Due to the length of shifts under this Addendum, overtime will remain voluntary provided there are adequate numbers of qualified employees who serve notice to the company of their availability to work in case of an operational necessity in any shift.

Memorandum Of Agreement
Between
Potash Corporation Of Saskatchewan Inc., Allan Division
And
United Steelworkers Of America, C.L.C. District3, Local 7689
This Memorandum of Agreement isdesignedforthe purpose cf re-affirmlng the basic principles of the Co-operative Wage Study Program (referred to as C.W.S.). This re-affirmation Is necessary because of recent trends within the workforce that employees feel that C.W.S. is to be used as a detailed job description, used to determine one's day-today job duties.
The following principles are statements cited form the Job Description and Classification Manual published in August 1971 by the United Steelworkersof America - AFL - C10 CLC:
A. Significant details concerning the function and requirements of each job shall be set forth in a job descriptionwhich shall:
Provide a means of identifying the job under consideration, the processes, equipment and products with which it is concerned, and shall serve only as a basis from which to classify the job.
Reflect the general details considered necessary to describe the principal functions of the job identified and shall not be construed as a detailed description of all the work requirementsthat may be inherent in the job.
105
Provide, together with the reasons for the classification, the basis from which to judge changes inthejob content which may result from new or changed conditions when such are establishedfrom time to time.
B. The job classification of a job shall serve only to assign the job into a proper job class for application of the standard hourly wage scale.
In summary, these principles outlined are designed solely for the purposes of determining wage rates and notto provide any basis for determining the day-to-day job activities of any individual employee. Referringto the term "inherent" as outlined on the bottom of each job description, this term is defined as: Job duties that have been common to a particularjob prior to the implementationof C.W.S., whether they were specifically addressedin the job description or not, shall continue to be part of that particularjob.
