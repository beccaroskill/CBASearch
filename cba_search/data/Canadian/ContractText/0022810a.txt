7.02	On the other hand, and for the same reason, the Company agrees that there shall be no lockout during the life of this Agreement.
16
ARTICLE 8
Seniority
8.01
(a)	The Company and the Union agree that, subject to the requirements of the operations, job opportunity, shift assignment and job security should increase with an employee’s length of service with the Company.
(b)	In any case of training or promotion (except to a position of which the occupant is not classified as an employee), or in demoting an employee, the qualified employee with the greatest Company seniority within the department shall be entitled to preference. In any case of layoff, or transfer in accordance with Section 10.03, the qualified employee with the greatest Company seniority shall be entitled to preference.
(c)	Notwithstanding 8.01 (b), in any case of an emergency lay off of six (6) days or less, or a Christmas layoff of six (6) days or less extending from the start, when Christmas Day is observed, through to the end of the period, when New Year’s Day is observed, the qualified employee with the greatest Company seniority within the department shall be entitled to preference.
(d)	The term “qualified” shall mean the physical fitness and the ability to meet the normal requirements of thejob.
8.02	There shall be one (1) type of seniority, namely: Company Seniority.
17
8.03	The “Company Seniority” of an individual in the employ of the Company means the length of his/her continuous service with the Company since the date of his/her last hiring, except as expressly provided herein. Where two or more employees have the same hire date, then the employee with the lowest employee number shall be presumed to have greater seniority.
8.04	Company Seniority of an employee shall be lost when:
(a)	He/she voluntarily quits his/her employment, or
(b)	He/she is discharged, or
(c)	He/she fails to return to work immediately upon completion of an authorized leave-of-absence, unless he/she gives reason satisfactory to the Company for such failure to return to work, or
(d)	He/she is laid off by the Company for a period of more than:
(i)	twelve (12) months where the employee has less than one (1) year of Company seniority at the date of layoff;
(ii)	twenty-four (24)months where the employee has one (1) year but less than five (5) years of Company seniority at the date of lay off;
(iii)	forty-eight (48) months where the employee has five (5) years or more of seniority at the date of layoff; or
(iv)	sixty (60) months where an employee has more than ten (10) years of service at the date of lay off; or,
18
(e)	he/she works for another employer while absent from his/her employment with the Company whether he/she is on approved leave-of-absence or otherwise except when the Company approves such work, or except in a case of layoff for lack of work.
8.05	Recall Procedure
(a) For the period of time for which an employee retains seniority from the date of layoff for lack of work as provided for in Section 8.04 he/she shall have preferential rights for rehiring (but only for jobs whose occupants would be classified as employees) in accordance with the following provisions:
Those most recently laid off shall be sent notices by mail by the Company stating the jobs available and the proposed time of hiring. Such notices shall be mailed by registered mail to each such person addressed to the last address which he/she shall have recorded with the Company. The persons to wham such notices are sent and who report ready for work shall, if they are qualified and physically able to fill the jobs available, be hired in the inverse order to that in which they were laid off. The Company shall not be required, however, to rehire at any time any person who shall have failed to report for rehiring in accordance with and at the time stated in any such notice sent to him/her. The employee must communicate with the Company within ten (10) days of the mailing of such notice to confirm his/her intention to return to work within fifteen (15) days from the mailing of such notice.
The above mail recall notice provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six (6)days or less.
For jobs of a temporary or emergency nature within a layoff (with work to be allocated on a weekly basis in
19
either situation), employees will be notified and
recalled by phone call by the Company in accordance
with Company seniority and qualifications.
CONCEPTS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS ARTICLE
The following procedures would form the basis of the recall to regular jobs:
(i)	If an employee does not respond to such notice, then the Company will not be required to rehire the individual.
(ii)	The notice will contain information as to the job for which it is anticipated the employee is being recalled.
(iii)	In so far as is possible the employee will be recalled to the position that he/she occupied at the time of the lay off.
(iv)	The Company will provide to the Union a list of persons to be recalled and the anticipated positions to which the employees are being recalled, and will also contain an indication as to the date on which the Company intends to issue the notices of recall. This list will be provided to the Union as much in advance as possible, and no less than five (5) days in advance of the anticipated date of the issue of the recall, so that they may cooperate to ensure the accuracy thereof.
(v)	The Union will review said list and communicate with the Company as to any employees who by virtue of unusual circumstances beyond the employee’s control in their employment history are perceived by the Union to have been inappropriately placed.
(vi)	The Company will meet with the Union to
20
consider the merits of these cases and determine if there should be an alteration made to the notices of recall. This would not preclude the Company and the Union from meeting at any time in advance of an intention to issue a recall to consider and resolve such unique circumstances.
(vii)	After such meeting the Company would issue the recalls.
(viii)	Should the Company and the Union not reach agreement on the special case,s listed in (v) above the parties may refer the matter to Arbitration.
(ix)	If, for any reason other than the operation of the above provisions it is not possible to recall the employee to the position that he/she occupied at the time of the layoff, then the Company will refer to the concepts for dislocated employees in Appendix G.
(x)	Once such a determination is made the employee will be offered in so far as is possible a position that is as near as possible to the position that he/she occupied at the time of layoff in terms of wage rate so as to ensure as little reduction in earnings as possible.
(xi)	Should an employee who is not recalled to the position he/she occupied prior to the layoff, but who does return to the position offered, has reasonable cause to believe that he/she is qualified and has greater seniority than a person who was recalled to that position, then he/she shall within ten (10) days of his/her return to work make known to the Company the person he/she believes was wrongly placed in the position.
(xii)	Upon receiving such a complaint the Company would investigate the complaint, and if there is
21
merit to the complaint the Company would return the complainant to the position that he/she occupied at the time of the layoff. The Company would then determine which position the person who has been wrongly placed should be moved to be given consideration of his/her qualifications and seniority.
(xiii)	In the case of an employee who is recalled to a position that is not the position that the employee occupied at the time of layoff, but is recalled to a position that carries a lower wage rate, and who has reasonable cause to believe that he/she is qualified and has the seniority to hold another position, then he/she shall make his/her concerns known in a fashion consistent with that set aut above.
(xiv)	The Company would respond to such a complaint in a fashion consistent with that set out above.
An employee may refuse a recall to a temporary assignment or to a job other than his/her regular job and may also elect layoff in lieu of a demotion to a lower job classification without loss of subsequent recall rights except as set out in 8.04.
An employee exercising the provisions of 8.05 (b) need not be recalled for any job other than the job he/she designated until such time as he/she notifies the Company in writing that he/she is prepared to accept any other job available to which he/she may be recalled.
During a period where the Company is in a production shutdown and layoffs have occurred,
(i)	Where an employee has been recalled for work which he/she is qualified and senior to perform
and work subsequently arises that is either work for which he/she holds a current posting or is one that the individual has held a previous posting or has been trained, the Company will re-assign that person to such work provided the work lasts for four (4) days or more.
(11)	It is recognized that particular jobs require the original crew or group of employees who have current skills and knowledge concerning such jobs. However, the Company agrees that a “core” of these employees, not to be less than 50% of the crew, would in most crews, be sufficient to ensure effective and efficient job completion. Up to the other 50% of the crew can be senior employees who have closely related skills and knowledge and who have performed closely related tasks.
(iii) Where the duration of a job is two (2) weeks or more and an employee can be trained in three (3) days or less to be qualified for the job, the senior employee will be given the opportunity to fill the job.
When the duration of a job is one (1) week or more but less than two (2) weeks and an employee can be trained in two (2) days or less to be qualified for the job, the senior employee will be given the opportunity to fill the job.
e) An employee who is demoted to a lower rated job due to a permanent reduction in the workforce or a temporary lay off will maintain his/her base rate of pay for a maximum of twelve (12) calendar months from the date of demotion provided he/she has twelve
(12)	months of service in the classification he/she was demoted from.
23
LAYOFF NOTICE
8.06
(a)	Employees shall be entitled to layoff notice in accordance with the 1994 Saskatchewan Labour Standards Act, and accordingly if the period of layoff is for six (6) days or less, notice is not required.
(b)	Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen (14) days will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than:
(i)	no notice if the employee’s period of employment is less than three (3)months;
(ii)	one (1) week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is more than three (3) months but less than one (1) year;
(iii)	two (2) week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is more than one (1) year but less than three (3) years;
(iv)	three (3)week‘s notice if the employee’s period of employment is more than three (3) years but less than five (5)years;
(v)	five (5) week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is five (5jyears or more.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six (6) days or less, or if an employee is recalled for a specified, limited period of work during a general layoff.
The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
24
ARTICLE 9
Job Posting
9*01 The Company shall determine the number of employees in each job classification and if a vacancy in a job classification is to be filled or to be left vacant and communicate such in writing to the Union.
9.02
a) Particulars of every position to be filled will be consistent with the CWS job descriptions where they exist. All job postings, other than a site-wide or temporary vacancy posting, shall be posted on the Department's bulletin board for seven (7) calendar days. This posting period shall be extended to carry beyond all periods of layoff, shutdowns and closures for the remainder of the seven <7) calendar days. An employee desiring the job shall make application within the seven (7) days by completing the application form provided by the Company.

Lines of progression for Mine Department and Mill Department postings are outlined in Appendix C.
(b) The Company will provide the Union with copies of postings.
Where so requested by an employee the Company will notify the employee, in writing, during his/her absence due to vacation or any other absences, where
25
it is anticipated that he/she will return to work within sixty (60) days, of a posting that has occurred and for which he/she may be deemed to be eligible to be awarded the bid.
The Company will accept phone calls from any employee so notified during the period of the postings and accept his/her request that his/her name be added to the posting.
9.03	If the position is not filled in accordance with Section 9,02 the particulars shall be posted on the bulletin boards in all departments. Such notice shall be posted for seven (7) calendar days. An employee desiring the job shall make application within the seven (7)days by completing the form provided by the Human Resources Department. The employee and the Union shall each receive a copy of the application. The position shall be filled by the qualified applicant employee with the greatest Company Seniority.
9.04
(a)	For positions which are posted the successful applicant will be provided reasonable training to perform the job.

The senior lower bracketed employee will be provided the training to qualify for the next higher bracketed job in their line of progression provided the employee has achieved the total time requirements in that line of progression to be awarded the next higher bracketed job.
26

(a)	the nature of the technological change;
(b)	the date upon which the Company proposes to effect the technological change, and
(c)	the names, seniority dates and classifications of the employees affected.
26.04	The Company agrees to recognize a Technological Change Committee to provide for consultation and cooperation between the parties with respect to the implementation of a technological change, retraining of employees, the introduction of new or modified equipment or changes in methods of operation. The Company agrees not more than three (3)employees will be off work for this committee at one time and they will not suffer loss of pay while attending meetings with the Company. Meetings will be held at least quarterly.
Training Benefits
26.05
(a)	All reasonable efforts will be made to provide training or retraining to an employee affected by technological change to ensure as close as possible the maintenance of the employee’s current job class. Concepts for the placement of Dislocated Employees as described in Appendix G - Section Three (3) will be used to place an employee affected by Technological Change.
(b)	An employee with one (l)year of service who is displaced to a lower rated job will be eligible for wage rate classification maintenance as follows:
(i)	For the first twelve (12) months of displacement the individual’s wage classification will be maintained.
(ii)	For the second twelve (12) months of displacement the individual’s wage classification will be reduced bv one class.
(iii)	Thereafter, the individual’s classification will be reduced by one class every six (6) months, until it is reduced to the highest Classification to which he/she could have moved by virtue of the exercise of his/her qualifications and seniority.
(iv)	If, at any time, an employee bids for and is awarded a higher classification than the one to which he/she was displaced, but lower than the classification he/she held at the time of the original displacement, the provisions of this clause will continue to apply until the reduction reaches the classification to which he/she has moved.
(v)	If, at any time, an employee fails to bid on or accept a posting in their department for a higher classification than the classification to which he/she was displaced the provisions of the clause will then cease to apply and his/her classification will be reduced to the classification of the job he/she is performing.
(vi)	Where, at the time of the original displacement the employee elected to take a job in a classification lower than the classification that he/she could have been able to take, then the classification protection program will only apply down to the highest classification that he/she could have taken. When that classification is attained by virtue of the operation of this clause the rate will be further reduced immediately to the classification to which the employee elected to move.
77
(vii)	Where an employee has elected to take a lower job as referred to in (vi) above, and then subsequently fails to bid on, or accept a posting in their department for a higher rated job, then the protection will immediately cease.
(viii)	Should an employee bid on a job lower than the classification to which he/she was displaced, then the protection will immediately cease.
(ix)	This process of wage rate classification maintenance will continue should the employee accept or reject an apprenticeship bid.
The application of this clause will not diminish an employee’s rights under C.W.S.
26.06	Should the operation of the Technological Change Provisions of this Agreement result in the displacement of an employee to a lower rated job through the elimination of a job in any job class in a Department, then determination of the employee to be displaced will be made after taking into consideration the Company Seniority of the employees so affected in the department in which the Technological Change occurs.
ARTICLE 27 Severance
27.01
(a)	This severance provision will apply to people who are severed either as a result of a permanent reduction in workforce or who are displaced from the workforce by virtue of technological change.
For the purpose of this clause ‘Permanent Reduction’
78
shall be defined as the “Sum total decrease in the workforce that the Company doesn’t anticipate replacing”.
Where an employee is displaced as a result of a permanent reduction, said employee will have twelve (12)months to elect to receive severance pay or retain the right of recall. Where an employee fails to notify the Company of the election the employee will be deemed to have elected recall rights.
(b)	Severance pay will not be paid to any employee who is terminated for just cause, or who leaves the employ of the Company prior to the effective date of his/her layoff.
(c)	An employee, upon acceptance of severance pay shall lose his/her right to recall and shall be presumed to no longer have any seniority with the Company, or be deemed to be an employee of the Company.
(d)	An employee who is laid off, will be entitled to a severance calculated at two (2) weeks’ pay, at his/her basic hourly rate, for each year of service from his/her date of hire.
(e)	Any severance to which an employee is entitled will be paid to the employee, by separate cheque, on his/her last day of employment.

APPENDIX F
APPENDIX G
Concepts for the Placement of Dislocated Employees
1.	Where employees are to be laid off the concept of last in, first out, subject to qualifications, should apply.
2.	Although the reduction could occur in one department the result of this concept could be that the person to be laid off could be in another department.
3.	To summarize, the process and steps for relocating a displaced employee based on the employee’s seniority and qualifications are as follows:
(a)	The Company will first attempt to place an employee within their own department to a job equivalent to the employee’s current job class. A familiarization and/or training period a£ up to twenty-one (21) days will apply.
(b)	If (a) fails, the Company will then attempt to place the employee in the highest previously held job in their own department. A familiarization and/or training period of up to twenty-one (21) days will apply.
(c)	If (b) fails, the Company will then attempt to place the employee in the highest previously held job in another department. A familiarization and/or training period of up to twenty-one (21) days will apply.
(d)	If (c) fails, the Company will then attempt to place the employee to a job equivalent to the employee’s current job class in another department. A familiarization and/or training period of up to twenty-one (21) days will apply.
112
(e)	If the employee’s seniority and qualifications will not allow a placement to a previously held job in another department with an equivalent job class then (a),(b),
(c)	and (d) above will be repeated with the next lowest job class. This process will be followed until the employee’s seniority and qualifications place them.
APPENDIX H
VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM
This program is in addition to, but not part of the Operational Employees Pension Plan. Permanent employees fifty-two (52) years of age or older as of May 1, 2002 will be eligible for this program.
Eligible employees will be entitled to twenty dollars ($20) per month per year of service with a maximum of thirty (30) years of service.
This bridge will be in effect from age sixty-two (62) to age sixty-five (66) if the employee so elects.
The employee must apply with the retirement effective date between ages sixty-two (62) and age sixty-five (65).
This bridge benefit will be offset by the value of both the Employee and Company account value of the Retirement Savings Plan discussed under the Pension Plan section of this Collective Bargaining Agreement.
SUMMARY OF GROUP BENEFIT PLANS
A summary of group benefit plans is set out. These plans are Life Insurance and Accidental Death and
113
Dismemberment Benefits, Sickness and Accident Weekly Indemnity Plan, Long Term Disability Plan, Pension Plan, Extended Health Benefit Plan and Dental Plan.
It is understood that the Company may change carriers which underwrite the benefit plans as long as the level of benefit coverage is maintained.
Benefit changes will be effective January 29, 2007.
Group Life Insurance and Accidental Death & Dismemberment Benefits
This plan provides basic coverage of two (2) times the employee’s basic hourly rate computed as of May 1st on the formula of basic hourly rate times 2,080 hours to the nearest thousand.
This plan provides Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance in the amount equal to that of Group Life Insurance.
