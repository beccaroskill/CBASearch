RE:	Short Term Disability
The Company and CEP agree to the following provisions as they apply to the Short
Term Disability Plan:
1.	Effective immediately, the method for calculating the first week of short term disability for sickness shall be as follows:
•	Elimination period of 22 hours (no change)
•	First missed work week is: hourly rate X regularly scheduled hours (55) X 70% to a max of $1,325.00.
•	Following full work week(s) is: hourly rate X regularly scheduled hours (77) X 70% to the weekly max of $1,325.00.
•	If part of a shift is missed the benefit will be pro-rated based on hours missed to a maximum payment of $1,325.00
•	Maximum payout of 105 days (7.5 work weeks) = $9,937.50.
2.	Effective April 9, 2008 (date of grievance), active employees as of June 1,2010 who had a disability claim between April 9, 2008 and the effective date of the new method of calculation will receive a payment for the difference resulting from the change in the method of calculating the first week of benefit. Employees laid off from date of grievance will also receive a payment for the difference resulting from the change in the method of calculating the first week of benefit.
3.	The surplus currently in the plan will be paid to all active employees as of June 1, 2010 who commenced employment prior to January 1, 2010. The payment will be made on the basis of membership in the plan. Example: an employee with 10 years of plan membership will receive 10 times more than an employee with 1 year of plan membership.
4.	Effective March 1, 2011, the premiums paid by the company will be adjusted annually to reflect the actual rate charged. As a result the 46 cents identified in appendix B wage schedule will no longer be in effect. The new rate will be communicated to employees in advance and in each year prior to March 1st thereafter.
