LILYDALE ATTENDANCE PROGRAM
Whenever an employee is unable to attend work a loss is incurred both by the employee and the Company.
We all understand that there will be occasions during everyone’s work life when they will be unable to attend work, but it would seem to make good sense to work together to find ways of avoiding the avoidable absences, or working together in a genuine attempt to create and maintain an environment both physical and social that will promote regular attendance at work, along with an understanding that we have a shared interest in lowering the incidence of absence.
The Lilydale Attendance Program was a first attempt to start down this road of cooperation. Some of the employees found the program intimidating and felt it was negative, rather than positive, as intended. Hopefully the following revisions will help to alleviate these impressions.
65
