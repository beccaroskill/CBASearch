WITNESSETH:
In consideration of the mutual terms and covenants hereafter contained, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:
ARTICLE 1 - BARGAINING UNIT AND DEFINITION
Section 1:1
The Company hereby recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees in the certified Bargaining Unit.

Section 1:3
The Bargaining Unit shall consist of all employees of Labatt Alberta Brewery in Edmonton, Alberta, excluding quality technical staff, field representatives, office staff, supervisory staff and those above the rank of supervisory staff.
Section 1:4
Wherever herein the expression "employees, journeymen, help or men” is used it shall mean the personnel in all departments of the company other than those excluded in Section 1:3.
Section 1:5
No employee of the Company other than a member of the Union shall do any of the work performed by employees in the Bargaining Unit except in cases of extreme emergencies and for training of trainers in the Bargaining Unit. "Extreme emergencies” shall not be abused by such people and at no time or point shall such emergencies be allowed to become a regular or frequent development. Supervisory managers, management trainees, could for the purpose of learning operate equipment alongside a bargaining unit employee for a maximum of thirty (30) working days per department. The Manager/trainee shall not displace an employee during this training.
Section 1:6
The Company shall designate and make known to the Union the Supervisory Employees.
ARTICLE 2 - BARGAINING AGENCY AND RECOGNITION

5
Section 2:2
The company shall be permitted to employ other employees temporarily on permit card, as long as such employment does not cause a layoff at anytime to the regular Union members.
All such extra help must obtain a permit card from the Union before starting work.
The Company may hire temporary employees for a total of forty four (44) weeks per year, allowing for temporary employees employed in the brewing department to begin up to three (3) weeks earlier than the rest of the brewery. Outside of this forty-four (44) week period, the company can use up to fifteen (15) percent of the number of full time regular employees. This 15% will be calculated on the total number of employees minus the Trades and Powerhouse employees.
A temporary employee shall not do work in the plant until he has first gone through an orientation program agreed to by the Company and the Union.
A temporary employee who is working for the first time in a new position will follow the current training guidelines set out for permanent employees.
Section 2:3
It is understood that in the event the Company needs a new temporary or permanent employee and there is no employee on layoff, the Company shall contact the Secretary of the Local Union 250 to determine if the Union can supply a competent candidate for the job vacancy. The Company will also obtain competent candidates for the job vacancy. The Company will determine who is the most suitable and qualified individual. A temporary employee will be permitted to apply for a permanent job vacancy; however, all hiring decisions remain at the sole discretion of the Company.
Temporary employees who remain on the existing temporary list (March 23, 2004) will be offered permanent employment (following the order of the list) as permanent, non-trades, job vacancies become available. Subsequent to this, all hiring decisions will remain at the sole discretion of the Company.
Section 2:4

The Company agrees to continue to supply a mutually agreeable office at no charge to the Local.
Section 2:5
Section 2:5:1 - Check-Off
All Employees, as a condition of employment, will be required to complete and sign an authorization of check-off dues when requested by the Union.
Having received signed authorization cards from employees, each month the Company shall deduct from the pay of each employee covered by this Agreement, a sum in the amount of the current monthly Union dues and assessments. A written list of employees' names and the relative amounts so deducted shall be submitted by the Company to the Union Financial Secretary not later than the 12th of each month. The Union will notify the Company of the amount of the established dues and assessments where applicable to be deducted and will further notify the Company thirty (30) days in advance of any change with respect to the amount of dues and assessments where applicable to be deducted.
2:5:2

Section 3:1 - Seniority Defined
3:1:1
Seniority is defined as the length of an employee's full-time service with the Company, calculated as the elapsed time from the date he was first employed, unless his seniority was broken, in which event such calculation shall be from the date that he returned to work following the last break in his seniority.
A new full-time employee must successfully complete a sixty working day probationary period before being placed on the seniority list. At that time, his seniority date will be the first day worked as a full-time employee.
When a temporary employee is selected for full time employment by the company, and has worked a minimum of 44 weeks, no probationary period shall apply.

If an employee is absent for five (5) consecutive working days without notifying the Company.
3:1:2:3

Section 3:3 Procedure Regarding Lay-Offs and Recalls
Plant seniority shall apply in the event of it becoming necessary to reduce staff.

3:3:1
Should it become necessary to reduce the work force, all permit card help must be laid off before any Union members are laid off.
3:3:2

VARIABLE COMPENSATION (PERFORMANCE BONUS)
Principles for the Variable Compensation Program:
This plan applies to permanent, active seniority employees only.
The performance bonus will be calculated based on the base hourly rate multiplied by the active hours worked to a maximum 2080 hours in a calendar year. For greater clarity, active hours worked does not include hours lost due to layoff, WI, WCB, LTD, sickness, or leave of absence.
Payout will be made in the form of a one-time annual lump sum coincident with payment of the salaried employee performance bonus which is presently paid in April of the following year and will be subject to normal statutory deductions.
This variable component will not be included in the base hourly rate for any calculation.
The annual amount of the percentage bonus opportunity will be as follows	
Employees with a seniority date which pre-dates March 22, 2010:	
Year starting January 1,2010	— Up to 3%
Year starting January 1,2011	— Up to 3%
Year starting January 1,2012	— Up to 3%
Year starting January 1,2013	— Up to 3%
Employees with a seniority date acquired after March 22, 2010:	
Year starting January 1,2010	— Up to 6%
Year starting January 1,2011	— Up to 6%
Year starting January 1,2012	— Up to 6%
Year starting January 1,2013	— Up to 6%
1.	For greater clarity, the following will apply for partial years of work:
(a)	Termination	— not	eligible for	any	payment
(b)	Resignation	— not	eligible	for	payment
(c)	Retirement	— pro-rated based on		number	of hours
worked (including vacation) within the calendar	year
(d) Layoff/closure — pro-rated based on hours worked within the
calendar year
2.	How the calculation works:
3.	Management will determine a list of common targets in each calendar year.
22
4.	Each target will be weighted with the sum of all targets equal to 100%.

10:4:1
First: the aggrieved employee, who may be accompanied by the Shop Steward, shall within ten (10) working days of the grievance arising or becoming apparent discuss the matter with his immediate Supervisor.

Where an arbitrator finds in favour of an aggrieved employee, such employee shall receive full back pay for the time lost arising out of the grievance, and full reinstatement in his former job, including all benefits and entitlements held prior to the grievance having arisen.
Where an employee has been suspended, dismissed, or disciplined, the arbitrator may confirm, modify or set aside the decision.
The arbitrator shall have the power to decide if a question before him is arbitrable. The Company and the Union shall share equally the cost of the arbitrator.
In the case of a grievance being filed by either the Company or the Union respecting any grievance as distinguished from the first tendered by an aggrieved employee, the parties shall commence discussions at the second step of the grievance procedure, and the grievance shall be put in writing by the aggrieved party should settlement not be reached in that step.

In addition, such employees shall receive an additional eight (8) weeks of benefit entitlement under that Plan, subject to the following conditions:
(A)	an employee may use the additional eight (8) weeks of entitlement only once during his employment, and notwithstanding Section 8 of the Plan, the eight (8) weeks can never be restored;

BANKING OF OVERTIME
It is understood and agreed that an employee may at his discretion apply all or a portion of his overtime hours towards an equivalent amount of hours of time off using the appropriate overtime rate. For example, an employee who works one hour of double time his regular rate shall be reimbursed in one of the following ways:
1)	Paid at two (2) times his regular wage rate, or;
2)	Upon Supervisor approval and provided the time off does not impact upon the operation or cause any additional costs, the employee would be granted two (2) hours time off at his regular wage rate.
The following controls will apply to the banking of overtime:
a)	The maximum number of hours that may be banked in a calendar year by any employee shall be 80 hours at any one time. Once an employee has drawn on the bank either by taking these hours as time off or cashed out, an employee will be allowed to replenish the bank to the maximum cap of eighty (80) hours. The maximum number of hours that an employee may take as time off will be limited to eighty hours (80) per year.
b)	The intent of this plan is that employees take significant blocks of time off at any one time, i.e. one (1) week. Time off for periods as short as one (1) day will be granted on occasions where reasonable notice is given and shift change premium is not required for the man's replacement and subject to point (2) above.
c)	Banked time is accumulated over a calendar year. Employees are not required to take their banked time off during the calendar year in which it was accumulated but must use their entitlement by March 31st of the following year. To qualify for using this entitlement in the period December 1 to March 31, the employee must have previously scheduled his vacation entitlements. Banked time off not taken by the March 31st deadline will be paid at the rate it was banked. Banked time off may be taken between September 1st and April 30th. Time off will be arranged by requests to the immediate Supervisor, and such requests shall be accommodated where time off does not interfere with the operation of the plant and subject to point (2) above. Following the finalization of the vacation schedule on March 31 of each year, requests for remaining vacation and banked time off will be considered and approved on a first come first served basis. The scheduling process of vacations prior to March 31 shall take preference over the scheduling process of banked
71
overtime in the event of any conflict. Requests for banked time will be approved only after the banked time has been accumulated and will be confirmed the week before by Friday 10:00 am.
d)	Maintenance department employees may not take their accumulated time off during the annual overhaul periods, but their requests for time off outside September 1st to April 30th will be granted where possible.
e)	Employees may, at their discretion, request payment in cash for overtime hours banked. All such requests must be made in writing and signed by the employee making the request. Overtime monies will be included in the employee's regular direct deposit pay following the request provided a minimum of one (1) week's notice is received prior to issuing direct deposit.

Sick Credit Top-up Bank
The following will outline how this bank will operate.
Regular status employees will on an annual basis bank all unused sick day credits in the sick credit top-up bank.

The employee is not allowed to use this bank to earn more than his regular hourly rate while on any of the programs mentioned above (for example, the employee's daily rate shall not exceed 8 hours multiplied by his regular hourly rate).
Credits that go into the bank will be valued at the employee's hourly rate as of December 31 of the year the credits are from (for example, if the employee has 8 hours of credit to go into the bank and his hourly rate is $22.10, the value that goes into the bank is $176.80).
