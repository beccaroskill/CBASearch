SECTION 3
Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment

6
Further, the Code explicitly forbids harassment in the workplace defined as follows..
... a course of vexatious comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome. Sexual solicitations or advances made by persons who can grant or deny a benefit to the person solicited are also prohibited if the person making the advance knows, or ought to know, that the solicitation or advance is unwelcome. Reprisals, or threats of reprisals, for the rejection of a sexual solicitation or advance are prohibited.
Committee:
A Joint Committee comprised of one member each from the Company and the Union, will be appropriately selected and trained to conduct investigations info complaints dealing with discrimination or harassment.

Complaint and Investigation Procedure:
If an employee believes that he/she has been harassed and/or discriminated against on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination:
• the employee should tell the person involved as soon as possible how he/she feels, and request
7
that the person stop the conduct he/she finds offensive;
• if he/she feels uncomfortable approaching the person, or if the harassment continues, bring the incident forming the basis of the complaint to the attention of the Supervisor and the Union Representative.

The outcome of this attempted resolution will be communicated to the Company within ten (10) days of the initiation of the complaint.
If the Supervisor and/or the Union Representative cannot, to the satisfaction of the employee deal with the complaint, it will be submitted in writing to the Joint Committee.

SECTION 12
Application of Seniority to Promotions or Vacant Positions
12:01 When a higher-rated job, newly established job or other declared vacancy exists within the department, it shall be filled where possible from within the department on the basis of qualifications, with preference to employees having the greatest seniority according to the Departmental Seniority List. For the purposes of this section, a “higher-rated job, newly established job or other declared vacancy” will be deemed to include a job where work is performed
----------------------- 31	-----------------------
during the day shift only, as opposed to a job where the work is performed on a rotating or alternating shift basis, provided that the Company’s right to reschedule such a job under other sections of the Agreement is not impaired.
12:02 If there are no sufficiently qualified persons within a department so that a vacancy is not filled; or as a result of a transfer or transfers as outlined in 12:01 there is a resultant vacancy; or that there is need for additional employees, they will be obtained by first resorting to the layoff list of that department.
In the event that no person with sufficient qualifications can be selected from that list for the vacancy or position or if there are no employees on the departmental layoff list, then the following procedure will be effected.
12:03 Any position not filled as the result of the operation of 12:01 and 12:02 will be posted throughout the bargaining unit for a period of three (3) working days. The Local Union Secretary and the Stewards of the department where the vacancy or open position exists will receive a copy of the posting, as well as the names of the applicants, following posting.
12:04 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no posting shall be required for a vacancy resulting from vacation, illness, absenteeism or authorized leave of absence. Nor shall a posting be required for any vacancy or job
----------------------- 32	-----------------------
which the Company announces is not expected to last for more than fifteen (15) working days; but if the position is still available at the end of fifteen (15) working days, then it shall be filled as provided in 12:01,12:02 and 12:03 above.
12:05 When considering which applicant shall be given a job which has been posted, the qualifications of the applicant shall be given consideration, but if there is any choice to be made between two or more applications having sufficient qualifications for the job, the most senior applicant shall be given the position, but exceptions may be made in favour of an applicant who needs a transfer because of his/her health or physical condition.
Employees in the bargaining unit having sufficient qualifications for the job shall receive the job in preference to persons outside the bargaining unit.
12:06 The Company may fill any position temporarily, either before or after posting, but shall not be obligated to try out all applicants, nor is the Company obligated to fill all vacancies by promotions or transfer from within the bargaining unit.
12:07 Should an employee having greater seniority than the selected applicant be absent from work during the total period of the job posting, he/she shall be permitted to apply for such job within a period of two calendar weeks after the expiry date of the job posting.
--------------------- 33	--------------------
SECTION 13 Transfers
13:01 When an employee is transferred from one department to another except in the case of layoff, his/her seniority position shall remain in the department from which he/she was transferred for a period of sixty (60) working days. If the transfer remains in effect for a period of sixty (60) working days in a particular department his/her seniority shall then be transferred to that department permanently, and he/she shall have no claim to any other department where he/she may have worked.
13:02 Employees who are transferred from departments or jobs not subject to the provisions of this Agreement shall, if transferred to a department subject to this Agreement, be placed upon the seniority list in that department to which he/she has transferred after he/she has worked in that department for a period of ninety (90) working days. This kind of transfer shall not take place during periods when seniority employees are laid off.
13:03 An employee who has been on a seniority list in any department and is promoted to a position not covered by this Agreement and later demoted shall, after ninety (90) working days in the department to which he/she has been assigned, be given seniority equivalent to his/her total service with the Company, except if the demotion occurs before he/she has
---------------------- 34	----------------------
worked for ninety (90) working days outside the bargaining unit he/she may return to his/her original department and regain his/her total seniority without delay.
13:04 Any painting work which can be done to the satisfaction of the Company by employees who are laid off will be offered to employees with seniority who are laid off at the rate of wages applicable to the Bottling and Warehouse Machine Operator, so long as they do not displace employees from their regular job.
SECTION 14 No Strike Clause
14:01 In view of the orderly procedure arranged for the settlement of complaints and grievances, it is agreed that there will be no strikes or lock outs instigated, endorsed or condoned by either party to this Agreement.

The matter may then be treated as a grievance and submitted to an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of Section 8:06 within fifteen (15) days of the date of implementation of the new classification and rate.
The arbitrators decision shall be limited to the matter in dispute and to determining the propriety of the classification and/or rate in dispute.

LETTER OF INTENT
During negotiations the Union raised, with the Company, ifs concern regarding possible future changes to the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.
The Parties understand that should changes to the Legislation and/or the Ontario Ministry of Labour's support for the subject legislation change to render inoperative the current rights of employees with respect to unsafe work, a mechanism will have to be determined to maintain the practical application of these rights.
Consequently, upon such time as the Union or the Company has a reasonable concern that such legislation could be passed which so affects the employees right to refuse unsafe work, the Union and the Company shall meet within 10 days’ notice of a written request to meet. The parties will make a good faith effort to arrive at a fair and workable solution to the problem in a forthright and expeditious manner.
---------------------- 132 --------------------------
It is agreed that any changes to the Regulations would also be reviewed by the parties in order to assess the impact on employee health and safety.
The parties agree that the Regulations in effect on the date of this agreement with respect to the employees right to refuse unsafe work would be considered a minimum standard.
Yours truly,
Manager, Human ‘Resources.
