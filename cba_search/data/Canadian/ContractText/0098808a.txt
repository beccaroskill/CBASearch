Within the Canadian Customer Business Unit of Clarica, we have consistently attracted new clients, and more importantly, held on to our existing business relationships.

Both the transfer amount and any future investment earnings must be used to purchase a retirement income, and are not available as a cash amount, now or in the future. Direct transfers allow the funds to continue to be tax sheltered.
Cash Payment
If you made voluntary contributions to the plan as outlined under ‘Contributions' you could choose to withdraw these amounts as a cash amount. As per Ontario legislation, this applies to locked-in amounts that are not morethan 2% oftheYMPE. Tax will be withheld before the amount is paid to you. Neither required member or INTERFOREST LTD. contributions may be withdrawn in cash.
Deferred Annuity Income
You may purchase an annuity from Clarica or another financial carrier. Payments from this annuity may not begin prior to your 55th birthday. The ‘Benefits On Retirement section will provide you with more information on annuities.
Note: If you are within 10 years of your normal retirement date, you may
choose any of the options available under the ‘Benefits On Retirement' section.
8
BENEFITS ON RETIREMENT
TIMING OF RETIREMENT INCOME
The normal date for retirement incometo begin is the first of the month following your 65th birthday. You can request a pre-retirement package which will outline the steps necessary to begin receiving retirement income from this plan.
You may elect to postpone receiving your retirement income beyond age 65, but no later than December 31st of the year in which you reach age 69. The earliest date you may start receiving retirement income from this plan is age 55.
RETIREMENT OPTIONS
There are a number of different forms of retirement benefits available to you under the plan. Provincial legislation has established guidelines on the types of retirement income you may choose.
Annuity Income Option
An annuity is a contract to receive a series of payments that you buy with all or part of your account. Monthly payments are the most common, and have been used in the following descriptions. However, payments may be quarterly, semiannually or annually.
a)	Joint Life Annuity
If you have a spouse or same-sex partner on the day payments begin, provincial legislation requires that you elect a pension on a joint basis. A joint life annuity is an equal amount paid to you monthly, for the entire lifetime of you and your spouse or same-sex partner. There are a number of choices you can make to add a guaranteed period. You may have all or a portion of the income continue if one of you dies, provided the payments to the survivor are not less than 60% of the original annuity.
If you want to elect another income option, you and your spouse or same-sex partner mustjointly file a written waiver within the 12 months before your annuity begins.
b)	Life Annuity
A Life Annuity is an equal amount paid to you monthly for your entire lifetime. You may select a guaranteed period.
If you do not have a spouse or same-sex partner, your normal form of pension will be payable for your lifetime with 120 payments guaranteed.
This means payments will continue for as long as you live. If you die before having received 120 monthly payments, and if your beneficiary is the estate, the value will be paid in a lump sum. If your beneficiary is an
9
individual, the remaining payments may be continued or the value of the remaining guaranteed payments may be paid in a lump sum.
Transfer
You may choose to transfer the value of your account to another registered pension plan, the Clarica AssetBuilder LIRA, another locked-in retirement account or life income fund. Both the transfer amount and any future investment earnings must be used to purchase a retirement income and are not available as a cash amount, now or in the future. Direct transfers allow the funds to be moved tax sheltered.
Life Income Fund
You may choose to purchase a life income fund (LIF) with the value of your pension account from Clarica or another financial carrier. A LIF combines the flexibility of a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) with the security of an annuity.
A LIF converts retirement savings into regular income payments. As with a RRIF, you're able to adjust how much income you receive, how often you receive it and how it's invested "At age 80, the remaining savings must be used to purchase a life annuity.
The main difference between a LIF and a RRIF is a LIF restricts the maximum amount a person can withdraw in a year, in addition to a minimum payment requirement.
Locked-ln Retirement Income Fund
A LRIF converts retirement savings into regular income payments. As with a RRIF, you're able to adjust how much income you receive, how often you receive it and how it's invested. The amount of income is subject to minimum and maximum limits.
WHAT IF YOU DIE AFTER INCOME HAS STARTED?
A post retirement benefit may be payable. Your beneficiary will receive information concerning any death benefit after notifying the company making the annuity payments of your death.
10
BENEFITS ON DEATH PRIOR TO STARTING A PENSION INCOME
If you die prior to starting an income from this plan, your beneficiary will receive any amount payable from your pension account. A detailed statement including the dollar amounts and the options available will be prepared for your beneficiary. The following is a summary of what may be available:
WHO E YOUR BENEFICIARY?
If you have a spouse or same-sex partner, provincial legislation requires that your spouse or same-sex partner receive any death benefit payable from the plan. The terms 'spouse and same-sex partner' have been defined under the General Information section at the end of this booklet. If you wish to appoint a beneficiary other than your spouse or same-sex partner, your spouse or same-sex partner must file a "Spousal Waiver of Pre-Retirement Death Benefit".
If you do not have a spouse or same-sex partner, you may name a beneficiary. Your beneficiary may be changed at any time, subject to any legal restrictions. If you do not name a beneficiary, any death benefit would be payable to your estate.
Ensure your beneficiary is aware of this plan and knows where your estate related documents are kept.
Your beneficiary will be entitled to all INTERFOREST LTD. contributions made on your behalf.
DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS
Cash Payment
Your spouse or same-sex partner, beneficiary or estate will receive a cash payment equal to the value of your pension account. All cash payments are subject to withholding tax.
Transfer
If the death benefit is payable to your spouse or same-sex partner, your spouse or same-sex partner may choose to transfer the death benefit to another registered pension plan, registered retirement savings plan or registered retirement income fund. Direct transfers allow the funds to continue to be tax sheltered.
Annuity Income
If the death benefit is payable to your spouse or same-sex partner, your spouse or same-sex partner may choose to purchase an annuity as described under the 'Benefits On Retirement' section.
11

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS
1.	What is a defined contribution pension plan?
Contributions made by or for you to a defined contribution registered pension plan are deposited directly to your account. At retirement, the accumulated contributions and investment earnings are used to purchase a retirement income.
2.	Does this plan affect my RRSP contributions?
Yes, contributions made to this plan this year will reduce the RRSP contribution room available to you next year. The amount of reduction will be reported to you each year on your T4 slip. This reduction is your Pension Adjustment (PA).
3.	What is my RRSP contribution room?
The maximum tax-deductible RRSP contribution is set by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency each year. Your ‘Notice of Assessment' sent by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency after reviewing your personal income tax filing will includethe exact amount. You may also call Canada Customs and Revenue Agency directly at 1-800-267-3100 for this information.
4.	Are my pension assets protected from creditors if I declare personal bankruptcy?
Your assets would likely be protected under the provincial pension laws, however, we can never guarantee full protection. Once your assets have been paid to you, the protection no longer applies. If you have any questions about your financial status, you should obtain legal advice.

Who is eligible for coverage?
You and your dependents (your legal spouse or common-law spouse of one year and your unmarried children) are eligible for coverage so long as you are an active, permanent employee, working full-time for at least 30 hours per week and not working as a seasonal employee.
Note for Quebec residents: A common-law spouse of at least one continuous year or a common-law spouse of less than one year with whom you have a child is an eligible dependent for RAMQ* drug benefits.
Eligible children include unmarried natural or legally adopted children and step-children under age 22 who are dependent on you for support and live with you in a parent-child relationship. An eligible child who is a full-time student and dependent solely on you for support will also qualify as a dependent until age 25 (26 for Quebec residents for RAMQ drug benefits). Health and dental coverage will be extended beyond the limiting age for a mentally or physically disabled child who depends solely on you for support. The child must become disabled before reaching the limiting age. Proof of the disability must be submitted to Aetna as required.
You and your family must be covered under your provincial health care plan.
*RAMQ means the Regie de I’assurance-maladie de Quebec.
When is coverage effective and when does it terminate?
If you and your dependents are eligible and make written request, your coverage will begin on the effective date of this plan or following the date you complete three months of employment, whichever is first. If you apply for coverage more than 31 days after you become eligible, you will be required to complete a health questionnaire and submit it to Aetna at your expense.
Your employer will deduct the required premium for weekly disability and dental care from your pay in order for your coverage to be effective on the date you become eligible. They will pay the remainder of the premium required. Coverage will start as long as the initial premium is paid.
If you are away from work due to illness or injury on the date you would become eligible for coverage, or the date of any increase in your coverage, coverage (except RAMQ drug benefits for Quebec residents) will be effective on the date you return to work for one full day. If your dependent is confined to a hospital on the date coverage would otherwise begin, the coverage (except RAMQ drug benefits for Quebec residents) will begin when the dependent is no longer hospitalized.
Note for Quebec residents: You and your dependents are covered for RAMQ drug benefits on the date you become eligible. No written request or health questionnaire is required.
Coverage for you and your dependents may be continued for all benefits (except RAMQ drug benefits for Quebec residents) if you are away from work due to illness, injury, or pregnancy or parental leave but not beyond age 65 (or for up to 12 months if you are age 64 or older and eligible for coverage); or temporary lay-off or leave but not beyond the end of the second month following the month in which your absence began. Any continuation of coverage is at your employer’s option and is subject to premium payment.
1
When is coverage
effective and when does
it terminate? (continued)
Note for Quebec residents: Coverage for RAMQ drug benefits may be continued (at your employer’s option and subject to premium payment) if you are away from work not due to termination of employment but due to illness, injury, or pregnancy or parental leave; or temporary layoff or leave but not beyond the end of the month following the month in which your absence began. RAMQ drug benefits will continue during a strike or lockout but not for more than 30 days.
Coverage for you and your dependents will end when you retire, your employment terminates, you are no longer eligible, premiums are not being paid, or this plan is cancelled, whichever is first.
If you should die while covered under this plan, your eligible dependents will continue to be covered for health benefits (as long as premium payments are made) until the date your dependents are no longer eligible, the date your spouse remarries (children will still be covered), 12 months after the date of your death, or the date this plan is cancelled, whichever is first.
If you are covered under two benefit plans...
The insurance industry has set guidelines for coordinating your health and dental benefits with another insurance program such as your spouse’s plan. Coordination of benefits (COB) allows you to claim under both plans for up to a combined maximum of 100% of the covered expense. For instance, if your plan covers 80% of the cost of prescription drugs, the 20% not covered may be claimed under your spouse’s plan (depending on their plan). Check that your spouse’s plan provides health and dental benefits for your family and allows for coordination of benefits.
Claims for dependent children are submitted first to the plan that covers the spouse whose birthday falls earliest in the calendar year. Any part of the claim not covered under the ‘first’ plan can then be submitted to the other spouse’s plan. In other words, if your birthday falls in January and your spouse’s birthday is in March, you should submit your children’s claims to your plan first. Proof of your plan’s reimbursement along with copies of any expense receipts would then be sent to your spouse’s plan for reimbursement of the balance (if the expense is covered under their plan).
Health Care Benefits
Your provincial health insurance plan provides basic health benefits such as hospital ward accommodation, fees for physicians and other hospital practitioners, and any drugs or blood products you may need during your hospital stay.
Your group plan is designed to cover many additional medical expenses on a reasonable and customary basis for you and your family (for an illness, injury that is non-occupational, or for pregnancy), over and above coverage provided by your provincial plan. Your plan pays 80% of eligible expenses unless otherwise noted, up to an overall maximum of $5,000 per person per calendar year, subject to deductibles and benefit maximums shown below.
•	Semi-private hospital accommodation payable at 100% (within your home province);
•	Glasses or contact lenses when required as a result of cataract surgery, limited to one pair per lifetime. Sunglasses or safety glasses, anti-reflective coatings, or eyeglass tints other than no. 1 or no. 2 are not covered;

Include a letter from your doctor describing the nature of your disability and its expected duration, as well as the type of equipment you require;
•	Out-of-province/country emergency expenses, while travelling or vacationing for up to six weeks, for: ward hospital accommodation (up to 14 days unless your doctor feels you cannot be moved), other inpatient/outpatient expenses, physician services, and ambulance services.

Scaling and cleaning of teeth may be done by a licensed dental hygienist. Installation, adjustment, repair, relining or rebasing of dentures may be done by a denturist, denture therapist, technician or mechanic, who is registered and practising within the scope of their license.
The plan will pay up to the least expensive service or supply that produces an adequate result. If you expect to pay over $600 for a course of treatment, you should submit a predetermination (expense estimate) to Aetna for approval prior to the start of treatment. Any x-rays submitted will be promptly returned to your dentist.
You should submit an orthodontic treatment plan before treatment begins. Aetna will review the plan and advise you of the estimated benefits. You will be reimbursed in monthly installments over the estimated duration of the orthodontic treatment plan.
Dental care coverage ceases when you reach age 70 or upon your retirement, if earlier.
Weekly Disability
Your weekly disability plan helps protect your income if you are unable to work for a short period of time solely due to accidental injury or illness as determined by Aetna.
Weekly disability payments will start from the first day you miss work due to a qualifying injury or after you have been away from work for eight days due to a qualifying illness. This eight-day waiting period will not apply if you are hospitalized and a charge is made to a provincial hospital plan, provided you are an inpatient or admitted to a day care unit in a licensed hospital.
Weekly disability benefit payments are calculated
as 66 2/3% of your average weekly earnings up to the Employment Insurance benefit maximum that applied at the start of your disability. Provided you continue to be disabled as determined by Aetna, you may receive benefits for up to 16 weeks for one period of disability.
6
Weekly Disability (continued)
Benefits are not paid for:
•	any day you do any kind of work for pay or profit
•	a disability for which benefits are payable under the Quebec Automobile Insurance Act or Workers’ Compensation law
•	a disability during maternity or parental leave
•	a disability resulting from, or contributed to by, a purposely self-inflicted injury; war, insurrection, rebellion, riot or civil commotion; or your commission of, or intent to commit, an assault or criminal offence
Important
You must be seen and treated by your doctor in order for benefit payments to begin. For benefits to continue for the benefit duration, you must continue to be disabled and under the ongoing care of your doctor.
Additional medical information shall be required from time to time. You should ask your doctor to provide detailed information on a timely basis to ensure no disruption in your benefit payment. As well, you may be required to report for a medical examination, as often as is reasonable, by a doctor of Aetna’s choice. Failure to report for a medical examination may result in termination of your benefit payments.
A new waiting period and benefit duration will start if you return to work for two weeks before becoming disabled again due to the same cause, or you return to work for one full day and then become disabled due to a different cause.
If your injury is due to a cause for which you may file a lawsuit, you will be required to complete a Reimbursement Agreement. If payment is received by you for lost income or medical or dental expenses, Aetna will be entitled to reimbursement and reduction of benefit payments made to you.
Weekly disability coverage ceases at age 70 or upon your retirement, if earlier.
Life Insurance
Life insurance provides financial protection for survivors in the event of the insured’s death. If you die while covered and the claim requirements are met, your life insurance benefit will be paid to the beneficiary you have named.
Hourly employees 3^55000
Your employee life insurance amount will reduce by 50% when you turn 65. Life insurance coverage ceases at age 70 or upon your retirement, if earlier.
Important
If your life insurance reduces or terminates, you may be eligible to convert the amount of coverage to an individual life insurance policy, without having to submit a health questionnaire or undergo a medical examination. Written application must be made to Aetna within 31 days of the date your group life coverage terminates. If you die within 31 days of the date life insurance terminates, the applicable insurance benefit will be paid even if you did not apply for conversion.
If you become totally and permanently disabled while covered for life insurance and continue to be disabled for the following six months, you may qualify to have your life insurance coverage continue free of charge until your 65th birthday. In order to apply you must submit proof of your total and permanent disability within one year of your last day at work. Aetna shall determine eligibility. Upon approval you will be required to submit proof of your continuing total and permanent disability as required by Aetna.
If you would like to change the beneficiary for your employee life insurance, contact your benefits administrator.

Making a Claim
Health and dental claim forms are available from your benefits administrator. Send your completed and signed claims forms directly to Aetna. Be sure all original receipts and other documents regarding your claim are attached. You should not submit a health care claim until the amount of your expenses is more than the amount of your annual deductible, if applicable. (Annual deductibles are shown in the sections describing each of your benefits.) Always keep a copy of all the documents you submit with your claim for your personal records.
You may request that all or part of your health or dental reimbursement be paid directly to the person or hospital providing the service or item. The request must be in writing (there is a space on standard claim forms), and it is subjectto Aetna’s approval.
Your drug plan is pay-direct meaning that when you purchase a drug, you present your AetnaScript drug identification card at the pharmacy and pay the drug deductible or co-payment. The remainder of the claim will be settled between the pharmacy and Aetna. The pharmacy must be a “participating provider” in Aetna’s pharmacy provider network.
To claim for weekly disability and life insurance obtain claim forms from your benefits administrator and submit your claims according to their directions.
Time limits for submitting claims to Aetna are as follows:
•	6 months from the date of the loss for life insurance;
•	12 months from the date the employee ceases active work because of total and permanent disability under the disability provisions for life insurance benefits.
•	6 months from the start of disability for the employee weekly disability benefit;
•	18 months from the date the expense was incurred but not more than 6 months from the date your insurance terminates, for health care and dental care benefits.
No legal action may be taken under this plan, for benefits other than life insurance, after two years from the date of loss.
Claims outside these time limits will not be considered for benefit payment.
