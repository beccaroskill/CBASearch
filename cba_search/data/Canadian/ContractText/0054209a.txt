Dear Mr. Penny:
This letter which is separate and apart from the Collective Agreement will confirm the understanding reached during the recent negotiations on the following issues:
Scheduling of Work
When business circumstances allow, the Company will schedule the shifts to provide alternatives to the split workweek. All reasonable options including alternating Saturdays and Sundays off, or, two consecutive days off will be considered. This should not be taken as a guarantee but rather as a commitment to seek solutions to the split workweek. The parties agree to meet on an annual basis on or about the week of April 15,h to discuss alternatives to the split work week.
Should the operation have a need for additional (extra) shifts on an ongoing basis, the Company will meet with the Union Committee to investigate the possibility of filling those additional (extra) shifts with Saturday, Sunday full time employees.
New Equipment
Before the implementation of any new equipment or processes, the training needs will be reviewed and agreed upon with the Health and Safety Committee.
Return to Work
It is understood that where an employee is returning to work without restriction, following a work related injury, the employee will be returned to their pre-injury job as long as the work is still available. When returning on modified work, the ability to offer their pre-injury work or any other work will be determined by the specific circumstances and the employee's restrictions. All other applicable provisions of the Workers Safety and Insurance Board Act will apply.
Familiarization Period
The familiarization period for employees whose jobs are eliminated will be a maximum of five (5) full shifts.

Dear Mr. Penny:
This letter which is separate and apart from the Collective Agreement will confirm the understanding reached during the recent negotiations on the following issue:
Placementof Spare Employees
As agreed this letter shall confirm the agreement that was reached on January 21,1994, regarding the procedure for moving spare plant employees into current scheduledjobs. The procedurewill be as follows:
1.	The spare employees will be asked, in order of seniority, to choose a job, which they can perform with a maximum familiarisation period of five (5) days. They will displace the most junior employee doing that particularjob.
2.	The remaining employees currently doing the job will be able to select their shift before a spare employee, regardless of the spare employee's seniority (as per the straight shift guidelines).
3.	In the case where more than one spare employee moves into a particularjob, the current employees on that job choose their shifts, and the spare employees would choose their preference from the remaining shifts, based on seniority.
4.	Once the spare employees with seniority are placed into jobs using the above procedure, the displaced employees, with seniority, will follow the same procedure.
5.	Once this procedure is complete, the remaining spare employees will be asked to notify the Company of jobs, which they are currently capable of doing. Every effort will be made by the Company to place spare employees into jobs, which they are capable of doing, based on seniority. However, if a spare employee is not capable of performing any of the jobs, which are vacant in a given week, that spare employee will be laid off.
