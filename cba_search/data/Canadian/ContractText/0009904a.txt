It is further understood that monies for such network shall be paid into the seine pool to which the crew belongs.

Any crew member who fails to appear on a day specified shall be charged for eight (8) hours work at the regular netman's rates which sum shall be paid to the man taking his place. If there is no replacement, then the sum shall be equally divided amongst the seine crew members who perform the work.

conditions in any area make it undesirable in the interest of conservation to continue operations, Union Headquarters and the Operators shall be informed and if mutually agreed, joint representations shall be made to the Department of Fisheries & Oceans, or if mutual agreement is not reached, the fishermen shall have the right to make their own individual representation to the Fisheries Service.
b)	Except as required	under fishery regulations
established by the Department of Fisheries & Oceans, neither the Company nor the Technician aboard a vessel shall order seiner Captains and crews to release herring in any area while engaged in the roe fishery unless the tests made by the technician or designated Company representative prior to drying up reveals the mature roe recovery rate to be less than 9%.
