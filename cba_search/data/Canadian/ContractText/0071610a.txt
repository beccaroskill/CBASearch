8:14 The Company agrees that there shall be only one personnel file for each employee.
ARTICLE IX Seniority

The President, the Vice-President, the Chief Steward, the Financial Secretary and the Recording Secretary will have super seniority for the purpose of being laid off out of the plant.
Super seniority will apply as follows:
>	1-50 1 super seniority position designated by the Union
>	51-100 2nd super seniority position designated by the Union
>	101-150 3rd super seniority position designated by the Union
>	151-200 all super seniority positions will be in the plant

9:02 No seniority rights are recognized during the first three (3) months which shall be the probationary period of the new employees. The Company shall have the right to transfer or otherwise terminate the service of new employees during their probationary period without prejudice to itself. On completion of the probationary period seniority shall extend back to date of hire.
Where warranted the probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union in advance of the scheduled expiration of the employee's probation period.
A) A probationary employee who is laid off or whose services are terminated while on leave of absence due to illness or injury and is rehired within a twelve (12) month period shall accumulate service for the time worked and it shall be credited to his probationary service.
9:03 Seniority will be broken and employment may be terminated for the following reasons:
A)	Voluntary termination of employment by the employee.
B)	Discharge for just cause not reversed by the Grievance Procedure.
C)	Failure of the employee to notify the Company of his intention to return to work within three (3) working days after notice has been sent by registered mail by the Company to the laid off employee and failure of the employee to return to work without reasonable excuse within seven (7) days after such notice has been sent by the Company. Notice to return to work shall be sent to the last address on the Company's records of the laid off employee. It shall be the employee's responsibility to notify the Company of changes in address.
D)	Accepting other employment or self-employment while on leave of absence, except due to ill health and under doctor's orders and confirmed by the Company's doctor.
E)	Out of active service with the Company for any reason beyond twelve (12) months except as otherwise provided for in this agreement.
F)	Overstaying leave of absence without a reasonable excuse.
G)	Failure to report absence from work for three (3) working days without reasonable excuse.
1)	Upon receipt of the employee's reason for absence from work and within the time period specified in this sub-section, the Company shall notify the employee at the last address on the Company's records that his reason for absence was unacceptable.
9:04 A laid-off employee with three (3) months or more, but less than two (2) years seniority shall accumulate seniority as per clause 9:05 (A) and shall be eligible for recall for two (2) years. A laid-off employee with two (2) years or more seniority shall accumulate seniority as per clause 9:05 and shall be eligible for recall for five (5) years.
9:05(A) Seniority shall accumulate for seven (7) months, provided such seniority accumulation shall not exceed his actual service at time of layoff.
9:05(B) An employee with five (5) or more years seniority at time of layoff will be entitled to accumulate seniority to a maximum period of fifteen (15) months.
9:06 The job classifications in the plant are divided into two (2) seniority groups A and B as outlined in Schedule “A” of this Agreement.
9:07 Seniority Lists shall be posted in each department of the plant every three (3) months, the Union shall be furnished with seven (7) copies of these seniority lists. Any contemplated change in the structure of a department will be discussed with the bargaining committee.
9:08 Employees who leave the employment of the Company to enter the Country's Armed Forces shall be granted a leave of absence until such time as service with the Armed Forces is terminated. Seniority will accrue under such leave, provided the employee makes application for his job within thirty (30) days after receiving Honorable Discharge, and provided the employee is capable of performing the work required of his job. The Company will make every effort to place employees who have become handicapped during such service.
9:09 If a Bargaining Unit employee accumulates more than 6 months of time in a Salary position over a 1 year period, they will not be able to return to the bargaining unit unless approved by the Union.
With respects to temporary assignments, any employee accepting a temporary assignment from the bargaining unit position into a salary position shall not work any bargaining unit overtime during the assignment
ARTICLE X Layoff and Recall

10:02 Employees will be laid off and recalled based on plant-wide seniority. In a temporary layoff situation, with the manager's approval, preferential layoffs will be allowed within the affected department for a period not to exceed 3 months. In respect to the layoff period, if an employee chooses to take a preferential layoff the employee must stay out for the designated time period. Upon return the employee will return to his/her prior job and shift in accordance with their seniority.
10:03 When due to job abolishment or curtailment of production necessitating a reduction of an employee on a job the employee affected and qualified shall be given the following choice of jobs but only in the order listed below:

Should a vacancy exist at the time of layoff it shall be posted, however, no subsequent vacancies will require posting.
10:05 The employee subsequently affected shall have the right to the job held by the employee with the least seniority in the plant.
10:06 When it becomes necessary to lay off employees in the plant in accordance with this Agreement, the Company will give the employees three (3) normal days notice or a maximum or three (3) normal days pay in lieu of notice. The Company will post a notice stating the names of the employees being placed on layoff within the first hour of the shift on day one of the three (3) day notice period, which will then constitute the three (3) days of notice. During that shift the Company will have all employees affected by said layoff to acknowledge the layoff notice as posted.
10:06(B) Should any employee be declared surplus and forced to leave his classification or department in accordance with the layoff procedure, it is understood that the employee may at his discretion displace a weekend work shift employee only if he/she is fully qualified.
10:07 In the process of recalling after a layoff, the employees having the greatest plant-wide seniority shall have the first privilege of being recalled, providing the laid-off employee has the necessary qualifications to meet the requirements of the job.

10:08 A laid-off employee who fails to report for a work assignment without a reasonable excuse when recalled will be considered a voluntary quit.
10:09 If, due to job abolishment or curtailment of production, the employee is transferred to a job for which he is qualified to perform, and he refuses to accept such job, he will be considered a voluntary quit. If a laid-off employee is recalled to a job for which he is qualified to perform, and he refuses to accept such job, he will be considered a voluntary quit.
10.10 An employee's plant wide seniority shall be transferred with him from job to job.
10:11 For a period of twelve (12) months following an employee's transfer to another job within his department or to another department or recall to a job other than the one held at the time of his layoff shall, consistent with his seniority, have the preference to return to his former job before any job vacancies are posted provided that he has a minimum of six (6) months seniority and his application to return to his former job is on file. This application to return to his former job shall remain on active file for a period of one (1) year.
To qualify for this preference the employee must make written application to the Personnel Department within fourteen (14) days of his transfer or recall or prior to the expiry date of the first posting of his former job if such posting is earlier.
10:11 (A) Employees will have a maximum of one active preference bid on file. Preference bids will remain active for a period of one year from the date of transfer from the previous job. This includes employees recalled from layoff

10:13 Until all employees on layoff are offered recall, the weekend crew will not be utilized in a department unless the department is being worked to capacity on a five (5) day basis.
There will be a meeting to notify the Union President when weekend crew will be implemented. This meeting may involve the following departments: Human Resources, Material Control, Production, and Industrial Engineering. Capacity levels will be used in this analysis.
Employees on layoff who refuse an offer of weekend crew work will retain their seniority rights on all recall lists. These employees will not be offered weekend crew work again unless they give thirty (30) days notice that they wish to be considered again for weekend crew.
Employees on layoff who accept an offer of weekend crew work, will regardless of any other language, retain their seniority rights to return to the regular work force.
10:14 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Collective Agreement to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that the Company can recall employees out of seniority order in urgent situations for a period of up to 30 days. In the event that the Company utilizes this clause, it is understood that any employee who is recalled out of seniority will not gain any seniority benefit, by way of adjustment to eligibility for future recall, or otherwise. If any employee should turn down an urgent recall, such employee will maintain his current recall rights status as if the request for urgent recall did not take place.
The Company may utilize this urgent recall option six (6) times per calendar year, it being understood that each of the said six (6) times may involve the recall out of seniority order of any number of employees.
The Company will advise the local Union President, in writing, stipulating the nature of the urgent situation and which employees will be recalled out of seniority and the date of the out of seniority employees will commence work.

The senior applicant with basic minimum qualifications will be selected. The successful applicant shall be moved to his new classification within twenty (20) working days, (provided the replacement(s) is/are fully trained on the job(s) being vacated). An employee not moved to his new classification within the time period noted above shall be paid the rate of the new job.
In the event that new jobs are created employees will be notified as soon as possible. The Company will provide the employees with a description of the necessary qualifications and skills. If additional educational requirements are a pre-requisite, tuition funding will be provided for both night school or day release classes under the Co-operative Education Program.
11:02(A) Notices of job vacancies will be posted for three (3) calendar days, unless at the time of the posting, employees are working alternative schedules involving weekend shifts only, in which case postings will be put up on Thursday for five (5) calendar days. Only written applications made by the employees and submitted to the Company Human Resource Department during the time the jobs are posted will be considered. When multiple jobs are posted, employees may indicate on the job posting form, their choice of jobs in the order of preference. It is further agreed that an employee on layoff at the time the posting is initiated will not be able to utilize a bid or preference bid. Employees on preferential layoffs are entitled to bid, if the employee is successful, the employee may have to return to work.
11:02(B) In the week immediately preceding an employee's vacation period or authorized leave of absence an eligible employee may file a written application and submit it to the Company Personnel Department for a job that may be posted during the period of absence specified in this paragraph. Upon the employee's return to work such written application shall be automatically cancelled.
11:03 Temporary jobs will not be posted. Temporary jobs are:
1.	Jobs of three (3) weeks duration or less, unless the Union agrees to an extension.
2.	Vacancies created by Article XII - Leave of Absence.
3.	Vacancies created by Article XVIII - Vacations.
When it becomes necessary to temporarily transfer an employee under the conditions of 11:03, the Company will transfer employees qualified to perform the work required. It is understood temporary transfers are voluntary in nature. Should the Company fail to fill the temporary vacancy from qualified volunteers the low seniority employee in the department qualified to do the work required shall be transferred. An employee temporarily transferred shall be paid the higher of the employee's hourly rate or the rate of the job to which the employee is transferred. An employee transferred at the request of the Company shall return to the job from which he transferred upon completion of the job required.
11:04 Job vacancies created by requested transfers must not exceed two transfers in any one (1) chain within the department or plant. Any vacancy created after two (2) transfers shall be filled at the option of the Company.
A)	An employee refusing to accept the job assigned to him as a result of his request for transfer shall forfeit all right to the job from which he transferred. He will be sent to the Personnel Department and given his choice of available jobs that he is qualified to perform. If no jobs are available, he will be laid off.
B)	An employee assigned to a job as a result of a requested transfer, who fails to perform satisfactorily on the new job or who is determined unqualified shall be given his choice of available job openings if he is qualified to perform the work required, or he may be returned to his former job or placed on another job in accordance with the seniority regulations of this agreement, if qualified, otherwise, he shall be laid off.
C)	An employee shall be limited to two (2) requested transfers in a two (2) year period.
D)	If an employee requests a transfer in accordance with the Job Bidding Procedure outlined in this paragraph and the employee withdraws his request to transfer before the job is awarded or the job is curtailed or abolished before the employee is transferred, this job bid shall not constitute a bid as defined in Paragraph 11:04 (C).
E)	An employee recalled to other than his original group or who was forced into the other group because of a layoff shall have the right to bid back to his original group and this will not constitute a bid as defined in Paragraph 11:04 (C).
11:05 In the event a job is reassigned from one department to another, the employees affected will be given a choice to transfer with the job or remain in the department. Should the job be a combination job, and the major portion of the combination job is reassigned to another department, the employees affected will be given a choice to transfer with the job or remain in the department. Should insufficient qualified volunteers transfer with the job to the new department then the Company has the right to transfer the low seniority employees from the old department classification to the new department classification.
11:06 Temporary transfers are exempt from the provisions of Article IX, X, XI of this Collective Labour Agreement.
For a period of up to one (1) work week, in case of temporary curtailment of production necessitating a reduction of an employee or employees on a job the employee or employees affected, shall, if qualified, be temporarily transferred on the following basis:
1.	For the first work day or balance of the shift, the employee or employees affected on the job on that shift, shall, if qualified, be transferred to available jobs in the department or plant on that shift.
2.	For the second work day or shift and for the balance of that workweek, the employee with the least seniority on the job in the department on that shift, shall, if qualified, be transferred to available jobs in the department or plant.
3.	If the curtailment of production continues into the following workweek the provisions of Article X shall apply to the employee with the least seniority in the department or plant.
4.	The employee transferred under Section 1 and 2 above shall be paid the higher of the employee's hourly rate or the rate
of the job to which the employee is transferred.

The Union recognizes the importance of maintaining productivity, quality and safety standards. Accordingly within this understanding the Company will make every reasonable effort to minimize this problem.

comparable work provided he is able to do the work. In both cases upon reinstatement, he shall receive credit for seniority for the time he was on such leave of absence provided, however, that so much leave of absence as exceeds five (5) years shall not be credited to his seniority.

16:08 Work performed by an employee in excess of eight (8) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period will not be paid for at time and one-half when:
A)	Such overtime is caused by a personal arrangement made between two (2) employees, that is, where one employee works for another.
B)	A change is made in an employee's working hours at his own request.
C)	It is caused by the regular weekly shift change.
16:09 Compensation for overtime work shall not be paid twice for the same hours of work.
16:10 It is understood and agreed that every reasonable effort will be made by the Company to distribute necessary overtime work in a fair and equitable manner.
To accomplish this undertaking the following steps shall determine the employees who are eligible to work the required overtime. A refusal at Step 1 will nullify an employee's eligibility for any required overtime for that day, except for a continuation of a shift from the day before. A refusal at any other step will nullify an employee's eligibility for any required overtime for that day, other than an overtime opportunity arising under Step 1.
It is understood that the employee must be qualified to perform the available work.
STEP 1: The employee(s) in the departmental job classification or the Labour Pool employee scheduled at the beginning of the week, on the shift, on the equipment or equipment grouping.
STEP 2A:The senior employee in the departmental job classification scheduled on the shift.
2B: Senior qualified Labour Pool employee scheduled on shift.
STEP 3: The senior employee in the departmental job classification on other shifts.
STEP 4: For twelve-hour coverage on the weekend use the weekend overtime schedule. If the entire eight hours cannot be covered proceed to Step 5.
STEP 5: The senior departmental employee scheduled in another job classification on the shift involved.
STEP 6: A senior departmental employee scheduled in another job classification on other shifts.
STEP 7: Employee from another department.
Note: When an employee is asked to work weekend overtime or holiday overtime in accordance with Article 16:10, an answer must be given at the beginning of their next scheduled shift. If they are asked after 11:00 p.m., Wednesday, an answer must be given immediately. If the above is not followed, the employee will nullify themselves for overtime.
When asking to stay over, each step refers to the shift prior to the required overtime. When asking to come in early, each step refers to the shift after the overtime required.
When asking to cover the last four hours on a Friday afternoon shift, the senior employee in the departmental job classification scheduled on the day shift will be asked to return for the last four hours before the senior employee in the departmental job classification scheduled on other shifts.
When asking to cover the Sunday or Holiday Monday night shift at the commencement of the week, the senior employee in the departmental job classification on the afternoon shift will be asked before the senior employee in the departmental job classification on other shifts.
Weekend overtime eligibility for shift changes - Both parties must be equally eligible and both parties have agreed for weekend overtime. They would assume the overtime in the swapped shifts.
All Sick & Vacation employees will be asked for overtime after Step 3 and before Step 4 in accordance with Article 16:10.
It is further understood and agreed by the Union that certain emergency conditions may occur that may preclude the above procedure being followed. It is the intention of both parties to minimize this type of case.
16:11 It is agreed that in an emergency situation the Company can require employee(s) to work up to eight (8) hours overtime in any work week on a mandatory basis, provided that the said employee(s) has not worked ninety-six (96) hours or more in the previous two weeks. In the event that the Company finds it necessary to enforce this mandatory overtime provision, the overtime
required will be filled from low seniority employees that are qualified to do the job. It is understood that 16:10 will be exhausted before the company will implement this clause.
16:12 Notwithstanding any other provision of this article 16 to the contrary, any employee on a leave of absence will not be eligible to work overtime and will not be called.
16:13 Any errors made in the distribution of overtime will be redressed in the two (2) weeks following the day the mistake was made. The redress will be an offer of equivalent hours of non-productive work. If the Company cannot schedule the redress in this two (2) week period because the employee is working overtime, the Company will continue to try to schedule the redress during the next two (2) weeks. If, after the additional two weeks, the Company continues to be unable to schedule the redress because the employee is working overtime during this period as well, then the employee will be paid for the overtime hours that were improperly not offered.
ARTICLE XVII

C)	Employees who due to an approved leave of absence leave work or return to work during the work week in which the holiday falls shall be paid for such holiday, provided such employees work their last full scheduled shift prior to and their first full scheduled shift after the holiday.

17:03 Should such a holiday as defined in this Article fall during any employee's vacation period, such employee as eligible under Paragraph 17:02 shall be paid for such holiday on the basis of one (1) normal day at the employee's straight time hourly rate in addition to vacation pay or they may take the next scheduled work day immediately prior to or following their scheduled vacation period as the holiday.
17:04 Should a holiday occur within the annual plant shutdown, the holiday will be taken on the Friday preceding the annual shutdown.
17:05 With respect to holidays outside the annual plant shutdown that fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the Friday preceding or the following Monday in conjunction with customer and production requirements, unless otherwise designated in this Agreement. The Company agrees to give at least thirty (30) days notice of the designated holiday.
ARTICLE XVIII Vacations
18:01 All employees who prior to December 31st of the current year have been continuously employed for the following periods will receive vacation with pay as follows:
1 - 5 years: two (2) weeks vacation with pay
-	four percent (4%) of total earnings
5 - 10 years: three (3) weeks vacation with pay
-	six percent (6%) of total earnings
10 - 20 years: four (4) weeks vacation with pay
-	eight percent (8%) of total earnings 20 - 30 years: five (5) weeks vacation with pay
-	ten percent (10%) of total earnings
30 years and over: six (6) weeks vacation with pay
-	twelve percent (12%) of total earnings
A)	An employee with less than one (1) year's continuous service with the Company shall receive four percent (4%) of his total
earnings for his service prior to January 1st of the current year.
B)	“Total Earnings” shall be the gross earnings from the Company including Worker's Compensation payments for lost time during the twelve (12) months prior to January 1st of the current year and short work week benefits paid under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefits plan. This is intended to bring all employees to a standard vacation period for the express purpose of computing vacation pay during their employ with the Company. The vacation pay therefore will be computed on the gross earnings in the previous calendar year starting on January 1st and ending on December 31st. Commencing with the vacation year 1979, weekly accident and sickness benefits as defined in Section 2, A, (1) of the Welfare and Insurance Agreement, paid to an employee in the preceding calendar year, shall be included as part of “Total Earnings” as defined above.
C)	When an employee has been unable to work during a portion of the preceding year owing to sickness, pregnancy, Parental
leave or injury not covered by the Worker's Compensation Act and for these reasons only, his vacation pay calculated in accordance with this clause is less than four hundred dollars ($400.00) per week the vacation pay to which he is entitled will be increased to the above minimum, provided he has worked a minimum of three (3) months in the vacation year.
D)	The fifth and sixth weeks of vacation in each year are optional to any employee entitled to receive them and in order to be eligible to take and observe such additional weeks of vacation in the current year the employee must notify the employer that he will be observing such additional week or weeks of vacation by not later than June 1. Failure by the employee to notify the employer in accordance with this section will deprive the employee of the right to take time off to observe such additional weeks of vacation but will not deprive him of his vacation pay for the additional week or weeks. Employee wishing payment for the fifth and sixth weeks of vacation not to be taken, must notify the Company in writing two (2) weeks prior to payment.
18:02 An employee whose employment with the Company is terminated for any reason (other than lay-off) and who has not received his vacation payment in the current calendar year shall receive with his last pay cheque, a vacation payment based on the applicable percentage defined in Paragraph 18:01 of his total earnings for the preceding calendar year. Vacation pay awarded under this section will be for services rendered in the prior year. In addition, he shall receive vacation pay based on the applicable percentage as defined in Paragraph 18:01 of his total earnings from January 1st of the current calendar year until his termination date. Vacation pay awarded under this section will be for services rendered in the current year. An employee who has received his vacation pay during the current calendar year will have his vacation pay calculated using the applicable percentage as defined in paragraph 18:01 of his total earnings from Jan. 1 of the current year until his termination date. He will receive this cheque one week following his last paycheque. Vacation pay awarded under this section will be for services rendered in the current year.
The estate or beneficiary of a deceased employee shall be paid a vacation payment in accordance with the provisions of this section.
18:02(A) A laid-off employee shall receive prior to the plant vacation period a vacation payment based on the applicable percentage defined in Paragraph 18:01 of his total earnings for the preceding calendar year.
18:03 All employees will receive their vacation pay prior to the vacation period. The Company will provide the employees with their vacation pay for the period of the vacation to be taken on the last pay period prior to the commencement of their vacation. The employee will give two weeks written notice, if possible. However, single day(s) vacation will be paid with the regular pay for the week in which the single day(s) is taken.
18:04 Vacations shall be granted at such time between June 1st and September 1st inclusive as the Company finds most suitable considering the wishes by seniority of the employees and the efficient operation of the plant.
The Company may schedule a shutdown for vacation period. The Company will make reasonable effort to post the time of such vacation period by March 1st of the current year. Vacation dates, however, may be changed by the Company in cases where it is found necessary for the efficient operation or due to emergency conditions.
18:05 Vacations may not be postponed from one vacation period to another and will be forfeited unless completed during the vacation period, except when an employee is required to work during the vacation period, then such employee's vacation shall be completed by December 31st of the current year.
18:06 At the option of the Company any employee or employees may be asked to work during the vacation period and if the employee or employees work during this vacation period they shall be entitled to vacation pay in addition to their regular pay, as provided in Paragraph 18:01 of this Article, except in cases falling under Paragraph 18:05 of this Article.
18:07 The Company will allow employees to utilize their preference bids in the following classifications and in any new classifications subject to preference bids before we recall from lay off or hire for sick and vacation relief:
•	Banbury Operator
•	Banbury Mill Man
•	Mixing Trucker
•	Banbury Compounder
•	Extruding Machine Operator
•	Department Set-Up
•	Line Technician
•	Material Service Trucker
These employees will assume the classification for the designated period and upon completion of the said assignment the employees shall be eligible to put in their preference bid again, but the subsequent preference bid will only be for purposes of vacation replacement in the months of May through September. The Company will utilize sick and vacation replacement employees when there are insufficient employees with preference bids to choose from the finishing and miscellaneous areas.
At the Company's request, when there are no preference bids on file, employees trained and qualified to work in the above positions may volunteer for the purpose of vacation replacement during the months of May through September.
18:08 An employee is entitled to break up all weeks of vacation in (8) hour increments outside the plant shut down.
ARTICLE XIX
Miscellaneous
19:01 Bulletin Boards - The Company agrees to post notices of meetings and other Union business and affairs on bulletin boards provided for such purpose. There shall be one (1) such bulletin board at the north gate and one (1) at the main gate. It is agreed, that such notices must be approved by the Manager of Employee Relations of the Company, or his designated representatives.
19:02 It is understood that where the masculine pronoun is used in this agreement it shall refer to both genders unless the contents of the clause require otherwise.
19:03 No employee shall be recognized by the Company as a steward, a member of the Grievance Committee, a member of the Bargaining Committee, or as a member of the Executive Board of the Union until the Manager of Employee Relations has been notified in writing of his status and jurisdiction, by the President, Vice-President, or Secretary of the Union. Each member of the Executive Board shall have at least one (1) year's seniority with the Company and shall be regular employees of the Company during their time of office.
19:04 Members of factory management shall not do the work which is normally assigned to direct workers, except for temporary periods in emergencies or in relieving employees for personal time or in instructing employees or in carrying out functions necessary to the fulfillment of their supervisory responsibilities, such as checking workmanship, and quality and running equipment to check on operating problems or maintenance needs. It is recognized that in the performance of experimental and development work on production equipment, it is sometimes necessary for supervision or technical personnel to perform operations for occasional short periods of time in order to “get the feel” of the operation. Direct work by supervisors and technical personnel shall be for the purpose stated above and shall not be for the purpose of displacing direct workers.
19:05 The Company shall have the right to place a number of trainees throughout the plant, not to exceed two percent (2%) of the factory enrollment. These trainees will be used for educational and self-training purposes and may be assigned to production equipment for these purposes. The trainee(s) shall not displace a direct worker and may be retained on any one job classification for a maximum period of three (3) months.
19:06 The Company agrees to provide adequate relief for normal personal needs in any department where the work requires continuous operation.
19:07 An employee will be given a copy of any discipline notice concerning his conduct at the time it is placed in his personal record. A copy of every discipline notice will be forwarded to the secretary and to the Union President's designated representative by the Manager of Human Resources. Disciplinary notices for offenses not repeated within a one (1) year period will be cancelled and not used for disciplinary action, however, they will remain a part of the employee's record for a period of five (5) years and then will be removed and destroyed.
19:08 The term “Working Days” whenever it appears in the Agreement shall be interpreted to mean normal working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and paid holidays unless such specified days are scheduled and worked by a majority of employees.
19:09 It is the intention of the Company that multiple absentees who are unable to provide satisfactory explanation to the Medical Centre or Human Resource Department for their absences will be required to report to the Medical Centre or Human Resource Department after each subsequent absence prior to commencing work.
In the event of an employee being told to report to the Medical Centre he will be paid from the time he was scheduled to report provided he is ready and willing to return to work.
The purpose of this visit is to provide an adequate follow up and control of absenteeism.
Multiple absentees will be reviewed with the Union. A “Multiple Absentee” is defined as an employee who has three (3) separate unexcused absences during a seven (7) month period. The multiple absentee who does not lose unexcused time over a seven (7) month period (the “Clean Period) will move down one level from his or her then current positioning this Multiple Absentee Program (W.S.I.B. cases will be excluded). Any unexcused leave early during this seven (7) month Clean Period will count as unexcused time and as an unexcused absent and will prevent movement down one level in the Program. If a Multiple Absentee is successful in having no unexcused time for a seven (7) month clean period, such employee will move down one level in the Program. The Multiple Absentee program will now have four (4) levels of counseling, prior to the termination step, with the fourth (4th) level being the final counseling step. The third and forth level counseling will be conducted with the Union President, Vice President, or a member of the Union Grievance Committee, or their designate, being present. If an employee becomes a Multiple Absentee again, after receiving the fourth step final counseling and before being successful in moving down one level, such employee will be terminated. Save and except the reduction in levels of counseling to four (4) from five (5), with termination now at the fifth (5th) step, the Arbitration decision of November 12, 1986, will continue to be part and parcel of this Article 19:09.
19:10 The Company will reimburse employees for the cost of short term and long term disability forms and any additional doctor's notes required by the Medical Department for clarification on specific information relating to a medical problem.

Master overtime list will be posted, and updated weekly. A new list will be posted at the anniversary date of each contract year, and the overtime of the employee with the lowest amount of hours will be reduced to zero, and all other employees hours to be reduced correspondingly.
To accomplish this undertaking the following sequential procedure shall determine the employee(s) eligibility to work the required overtime.
STEP 1: The employee(s) in the job classification who normally works that shift with the lowest overtime hours recorded.
STEP 2: The employee(s) in the job classification who normally works that shift with next lowest overtime hours recorded, and so on.
STEP 3: The employee(s) in the job classification with the lowest overtime hours recorded and so on.
STEP 4: The employee(s) in the job classification with the lowest hours recorded who previously refused an overtime shift will be offered uncovered shifts. Apprentices who are able to do the work in question will be eligible for weekend overtime work where insufficient tradesmen and probationary tradesmen are available and willing to work before proceeding to Step 5.
STEP 5: Should there be insufficient maintenance employees available and willing to work on a scheduled weekend overtime shift of eight (8) hours the Company shall offer weekend overtime on the basis of twelve (12) hour shifts to the individuals with the lowest overtime hours who are already working prior to and after the open shift.
Overtime hours will be recorded and charged as follows:
1.	All overtime hours, either worked or refused will be charged on the basis of hours paid (ie. eight (8) hours at time and one half posted as twelve (12) hours, twelve (12) hours at time and one half posted as eighteen (18) hours, eight (8) hours at double time posted as sixteen (16) hours, twelve (12) hours at double time posted as twenty-four (24) hours).
2.	The employee in the job classification with the lowest number of hours will be offered all overtime hours available to him up to
four (4) working days in advance of the overtime opportunity.
3.	In the case of employees in the same job classification having equal overtime hours, seniority will determine entitlement.
4.	An employee who refuses overtime work will be charged with the overtime hours available.
5.	A new employee, transferred employee, or an employee recalled from extended layoff will be charged with the average number
of overtime hours within the job classification.
6.	Employees shall be charged a maximum of twenty-eight (28) overtime hours worked per weekend and forty-four (44) overtime hours worked per holiday weekend in their classification.
7.	If the employee is not given twenty-four (24) hours notice for weekend work, they will not be charged for hours refused but will only be charged for hours worked.
8.	Employees absent for one week or more, including vacation, will have their hours adjusted up to be equal to the person with the lowest hours in the classification. Employees who are absent for less than one week who fail to respond when contacted will have their hours adjusted up to be equal to the person with the lowest hours in the classification.
9.	An employee scheduled to work overtime who goes home at his own request prior to completing the shift will be charged for the
shift. If he goes home at the Company's request he will be charged with the actual hours paid.
10.	All designated holidays under this agreement shall be considered overtime and shall be offered and charged as above.
11.	In the case of an employee absent for any reason (ie. Vacation, approved leave of absence) prior to an overtime opportunity the employee must inform supervision if they are available for overtime should it be required.
12.	Call in procedures for emergencies, and all overtime hours worked during the regular five day week will remain outside the
overtime procedure, (ie. hours will not be charged). The current method of calling in by seniority and classification will remain in effect.
13.	Weekend overtime which carries to the next shift or the next day will be offered to the man on the job regardless of hours. If that individual declines, the overtime will be offered to the high seniority on the shift that the work is carried over from, all hours either worked or refused to be charged at the applicable rate.
14.	A tradesmen in the rotation that has not been offered any overtime shift shall be offered available shifts before probationary
tradesmen and apprentices.
15.	Notwithstanding Step 4, where additional tradesmen are required on the Saturday day shift (7-3) probationary tradesmen and
apprentices will be eligible before an employee who previously refused an overtime shift.
16.	Daily overtime will be offered to the employee on the shift on the job regardless of his overtime hours and will not be charged and then by seniority for the shift on which the overtime occurs.
17.	In the case of a shift change overtime goes to the shift worked three (3) days or more.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
Subject: Week-End Work Crew
This Memorandum of Agreement is supplemental to the Agreement entered into by and between United Steelworkers of America, Local 455, and Henniges Automotive, Welland, Ontario.
The parties agree that it is in their mutual interest to ensure that the Company remains competitive and reaches the highest levels of productivity possible. To this end the following understanding is entered into.
The signing of this Memorandum of Agreement and the understandings contained therein shall supersede certain provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement only as they apply to employees employed as part of the week-end crew. It is understood that this Agreement is necessary to clarify the conditions and terms of employment under which individuals will work on week-end crews.
It is the Company's intent to employ the week-end crew for the shifts outlined below. If a week-end crew employee is to be transferred to a Monday to Friday operation, the Company will discuss the reason for the transfer with the Union. No transfer shall take place without the Union Bargaining Committee's agreement.
The Company at its sole discretion may institute week-end work shifts. The Company may unilaterally at any time discontinue such week-end work shifts. The normal hours of work for individuals assigned to these shifts would be twelve (12) hours per day and twenty-four (24) hours per week. Employees who work their normal workweek would earn twenty-four (24) hours pay per week and such pay would be calculated as follows:
Twelve (12) hours straight time pay for Saturday work.
Twelve (12) hours straight time pay for Sunday work.
Probationary Period
No seniority rights are recognized during the first six (6) months which shall be the probationary period of the new employees. On completion of the probationary period seniority shall extend back to date of hire.
A)	Where warranted the probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union in advance of the scheduled expiration of the employee's probation period.
Due to the unique character of the week-end crew, certain benefits and provisions of the Agreement between the parties will be applied in a different manner as regards to week-end crew employees.
Week-end work crew vacancies shall be posted for bid, but openings will be awarded to the most senior qualified employees in each classification. Under the terms of this Agreement it is understood that “qualified” shall be interpreted to mean fully qualified for pay purposes, therefore, only fully qualified employees may exercise a shift bid or preference to the week-end work crew.
Due to the unique character of the week-end work crew employees, those employees assigned to the week-end crew will be so assigned for a minimum period of one year and will not be allowed to exercise bid rights or shift rights for that period. Employees may exercise shift preference or bidding rights within the week-end crew or when vacancies occur providing they have one year of seniority. If they exercise these bid rights within the week-end crew they must remain in the new classification for a minimum of 12 months.
Employees may exercise shift preference or bidding rights when vacancies occur. Such employee will have first right to transfer to the regular shift schedule. If a transfer of an employee occurs from the week-end operation to the regular Monday to Friday operation he will accrue pro rated credited service for pension benefits while on week-end crew and full credited service for pension benefits while on full time from the first of the month following his date of transfer. Week-end Crew employees will not be eligible to transfer to the Monday to Friday operation while Monday to Friday employees are waiting recall from layoff except where their seniority is greater than employees hired without a job posting (full time temporary employees) to replace fulltime employees who are off work due to i.e.: illness, vacation, leave of absence.
Due to the character of the work involved, it is anticipated that no inexperienced personnel will be assigned to the week-end work crew. Employees on the week-end crew will be permitted to trade shifts with other week-end crew personnel only with the permission of the supervisor.
Should an employee be declared surplus and forced to leave his classification or department in accordance with layoff procedure, it is understood that the employee may at his discretion displace a week-end work shift employee only if he/she is fully qualified.

4.	There will be no duplication in whole or part in payment of benefits under the terminated Insurance Program and the Insurance Program of June 1,2010.

Life	One Hand and One Foot
Both Hands One Hand and Sight of One Eye Both Feet One Foot and Sight of one Eye Sight of Both Eyes
One-half of such amount shall be payable if a non-occupational accident causes the loss of one hand, one foot, or the sight of one eye; provided, however, that the full amount will be paid only once to or on account of any employee. The loss must occur within six (6) months after the accident to qualify for benefits.
C.	Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Paragraph C, all insurance coverage under this Section 1 shall cease on the date of termination of an employee's regular active employment with the Company regardless of the reason therefore. Exceptions shall be made with respect to such cessation of coverage only in the following cases to the extent indicated:
1.	During an authorized leave of absence, except for military service coverage under this Section 1 will be continued for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, except that coverage under this Section 1 shall be continued in force during the period of any leave of absence granted by the Company for Union activities for those employed by a local Union in an official or representative capacity.
(A)	In the event of layoff:
(I)	An employee who is not eligible for Supplemental Unemployment Benefits will have his Life Insurance Coverage and Non-Occupational Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Coverage continued to the end of the calendar month following the month during which layoff occurs and
(II)	An employee who is eligible for Supplemental Unemployment Benefits will have his Life Insurance and NonOccupational Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Coverage continued until the last of the weekly Supplemental Unemployment Benefits with respect to such layoff is paid or until the expiration date of six (6) months from the date of the layoff whichever is the shorter period.
(III)	If an employee is laid off and is already in receipt of weekly accident and sickness benefits under this Agreement, the Life Insurance and Non-occupational Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance in respect to such employee, shall continue for the period to which he is entitled under Article 1-Section II of this Agreement but he shall not be entitled to any additional extension of his coverage during the period of layoff.
(IV)	An employee will have the privilege of continuing his Life Insurance and Non-occupational Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Coverage at his expense at the prevailing group rates for a period of twelve (12) months from the date his coverage would otherwise have been discontinued.

Evidence of continued total disability must be provided by the employee at any time. If an employee completes at least five (5) years but less than ten (10) years service, Life Insurance coverage will be continued in the amount of $2,500.
4.	The Life Insurance (but not the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance) coverage of a covered employee who is retired on his normal retirement date or special early retirement or on early retirement under the Company's Pension Plan and is entitled to a pension thereunder will be continued thereafter only in the amount of $8,000.

The Life Insurance (but not the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance) coverage of a covered employee who is retired under the Company's Pension Plan before his normal retirement date because of permanent disability (as defined in said Pension Plan) will be continued in the full amount until the employee attains his normal retirement date: thereafter his Life Insurance (but not the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance) coverage will be continued in the amount of $8,000.
6.	The terminated Life Insurance is continued for a thirty-one (31) day period during which application and payments of required premiums by the employee can be made to the Insurance Company to convert any part but not less than $500 of the full amount of terminated Life Insurance. The converted policy will be the type customarily issued the insurance carrier, except term insurance or a policy containing Disability Benefits.
D.	Optional Contributory Life Insurance - to be effective
(A)	Employee Life Insurance.
In addition to the Company-provided Basic Life Insurance, an eligible employee may elect, in writing an additional $13,000 of Life Insurance on his life. Such Life Insurance shall be on a contributory base. The current rate of weekly contributions, which will be deducted from an employee's earnings is $2.10. Should the rate charged by the Insurance Company for this contributory benefit be altered, the employee's contribution will be altered accordingly. An election to participate must be made within thirty-one (31) days of becoming eligible or evidence of insurability will be required before coverage can become effective.
Once an election to participate has been made, an employee may cancel his optional coverage at any time, in writing, but evidence of insurability will be required if he subsequently decides to reapply for Optional Life Insurance and any insurance would take effect the first of the month following election and acceptance by the insurance company of evidence of insurability.
The cost, if any, of providing evidence of insurability will be the responsibility of the employee.
The details concerning total and permanent disability are the same as those pertaining to the Company's Basic Life Insurance Plan as set out in Article 1, Section 1, A-2, of this Insurance Program Agreement.
Eligibility to participate in this Optional Life Insurance Plan ceases upon termination of employment, retirement, or attainment of age 65 whichever occurs first, except that the conversion provisions outlined in Article 1, Section 1-C-7 of this Agreement will apply.
The Optional Life Insurance described above shall be provided conditional upon at least 50% of eligible employees applying for such coverage on or before April 1, 1987.
A medical examination at the employee's expense may be required to provide evidence of insurability satisfactory to the carrier: if the employee does not enroll during the enrollment periods described in (A) above; if an employee hired after the effective date does not enroll within thirty-one (31) days after becoming eligible; or if the Optional Contributory Life Insurance previously terminated because an employee revoked the required payroll deduction authorization or failed to make the required contribution.
(B)	Dependent Life Insurance.
Provided that an eligible employee has applied for or maintained the coverage described in (A) above, he may elect in writing Dependent Life Insurance on a contributory basis, in the amount of $5,000 for a spouse and $1,000 for each dependent child. Spouse and dependent child are as defined in Section III, (5) of the Insurance Program Agreement.
The current rate of weekly contribution, which will be deducted from an employee's earnings is $.58. Should the rates charged by the insurance company for this contributory benefit be altered, the employee's weekly contribution rate will be altered accordingly. An election to participate must be made within thirty-one (31) days of becoming eligible, or evidence of insurability at the expense of the employee, will be required before coverage can become effective.
Section II Accident Sickness Benefits for Employees
A.	The Company will provide without cost to the employee:
1.	Weekly Accident and Sickness Benefits at the rate of 66-2/3% of the employee's average hourly earnings times 40 hours to a maximum of $447.00, with a minimum payment of $250.00 a week.
2.	General.
Benefits will be paid to employees for accident or sickness not covered by a Worker's Compensation Act, while under the care of a doctor licensed to practice medicine. For purposes of a preceding sentence, a doctor licensed to practice medicine means either a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or a Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) or a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.). Benefits will be payable from the first day of disability due to an accident, or the equivalent where 5 shifts exists (the Company will allow a reasonable minor delay of 48 hrs. for seeking medical attention), or the eighth day of disability due to sickness except that the disability results in the confinement to hospital of the employee or out patients surgery performed in a hospital, or for surgery performed by a specialist in a recognized heath facility (surgical testing has not and will not be paid for), the benefits will be paid as, from and including the first day of such hospitalization. Benefits will be paid for the duration of the disability but not exceeding fifty-two (52) weeks of any such disability for an employee.
Benefits for disabilities due to pregnancy will be available only if the pregnancy commences while the employee is insured under this program, and are payable from the time the employee ceases work.
"Disability" for the purpose of this benefit will be defined as in the contract between the Company and the insurance company with which the Company contracts to provide the benefits described herein. There will be no limit to the number of different periods of disability for which benefits will be paid.
Periods of disability due to the same cause will be considered the same period of disability, unless separated by a return to full-time work for at least fifteen (15) working days. Periods of disability due to different causes will be considered different periods of disability if separated by a return to full-time work. Disabilities giving rise to claims for any accident and sickness benefits may be verified by the Company by medical examination at any time. Benefits may be suspended if the claimant fails to have such examination made. It is understood that benefits shall not be suspended until satisfactory proof that the claimant is not cooperating. Employees who become disabled shall notify the employing Company's insurance department of such disability not later than ten (10) days following the first day of the period for which benefits under this Section II are claimed, and shall give new notice thereof at intervals of no more than thirty (30) days thereafter for the duration of such disability. If any such notice is not timely filed, no benefits will be paid for periods previous to such notice unless the delay shall be shown to have been unavoidable and satisfactory evidence of physician's care and disability is furnished.
In the event an employee's Workers Compensation claim is delayed for a period greater than six (6) weeks or is rejected and such claim is appealed the employee shall be provided with the weekly Sickness Indemnity Benefits provided for under this Section. If and when the Worker's Compensation claim is allowed for the accident the Worker's Compensation Board will first reimburse the Company to the extent of the payments made before any payment is made to the employee.
3.	Should the earnings index under the Unemployment Insurance Act change the criteria for maximum benefits, the Company will adjust the weekly benefit to the extent of maintaining the minimum qualification requirements of the weekly indemnity plan for premium reductions under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
4.	Eligibility for Insurance.
A.	A regular full-time employee will receive coverage under this program on the effective date or the date following the date on which he completes the required period of eligibility, whichever is later, provided that an employee not actively at work on the date his coverage would otherwise become effective, would immediately become insured upon his return to active employment with the Company. Employees already covered under the terminated insurance program shall be insured hereunder for benefits in effect under the terminated plan, but there will be no duplication in whole or part in payment of benefits under the terminated insurance program. The foregoing shall not be construed to exclude employees from coverage who are on vacation, or leave of absence for local Union activities.
B.	Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Paragraph B, all insurance coverage, under Section II shall cease on the date of termination of an employee's regular active employment with the Company, regardless of the reason therefore. Exceptions shall be made with respect to such cessation of coverage only to the extent indicated.
1.	Accident and Sickness Benefits will be continued in force during a period of any leave of absence granted by the Company for Union activity for those employed by the local Union in an official or representative capacity.
2.	If an employee is re-employed with credit for prior service, coverage under the plan will be reinstated immediately, provided the probationary period had been completed prior to lay-off.
C. An employee hired after the date this program becomes effective will become insured on the date following the completion of three (3) months of accumulated service, provided he is actively at work on the effective date. Employees not actively at work on the effective date will become insured immediately upon return to active employment with the Company.

Eligibility for Insurance.
1.	An employee will receive coverage under this program on the effective date or the date following the date on which he completes the required period of eligibility, whichever is later, provided that an employee not actively at work on the date his coverage would otherwise become effective, would immediately become insured upon his return to active employment with the Company. Employees already covered under the terminated insurance program shall be insured hereunder for benefits in effect under the terminated plan, but there will be no duplication in whole or part in payment of benefits under the terminated insurance program. The foregoing shall not be construed to exclude employees from coverage who are on vacation, or leave of absence for local Union activities.

3.	If an employee is re-employed with credit for prior service, coverage under the plan will be reinstated immediately, provided the probationary period had been completed prior to layoff.
4.	Coverage for an employee's dependents will become effective on the same date as the employee's coverage except that if a dependent is confined in a hospital (other than by reason of birth) when the insurance for that dependent would otherwise become effective, the insurance will become effective upon final discharge from the hospital.
5.	An employee's dependents are:
(A)	Spouse.
Spouse is defined as a person legally married to the employee or a person not married to the employee who is publicly represented as the employee's spouse and has been living with the employee for a period of at least one (1) continuous year.
(B)	An employee's unmarried children less than twenty-one (21) years of age. The word “child” in addition to the employee's own children includes such step-children, foster children, or other children (all unmarried) as depend wholly upon the employee for support and maintenance and live with him in a normal parent-child relationship.
If an employee acquires a child dependent other than by birth, legal adoption, or marriage, such dependent shall not become eligible until three months have elapsed from the date such child was added to the employee's insurance record.
The employee shall complete proper insurance forms to be made available to him for the recording of eligible dependents. The employee shall promptly advise the Company of any change in eligible dependents.

If the spouse or other dependent of an employee is employed and, by reason of such employment, is covered by another employer-furnished non-contributory Ontario Health Insurance Commission Plan and Blue Cross Comprehensive Extended Health Care Plan or its equivalent, for himself or dependents, the amount payable under this Section III shall be reduced by the value of any benefits which are provided under such other plan. In those cases where both spouses are employed and covered by the same benefit plan, the employee whose birthday occurs first in the calendar year shall be covered by the primary insurance and include the dependent children of both spouses. The other employee shall be covered as a single individual with no dependents.
In those cases where both spouses are employed, but covered by different benefit plans, the employee with the most comprehensive plan will be deemed the primary insured, with the spouse and dependent children covered as dependents, under the primary insured's plan.
If the spouse or other dependent of an employee is employed and, by reason of such employment, is covered by another employer-furnished non-contributory Ontario Health Insurance Commission Plan and Blue Cross Comprehensive Extended Health Care Plan or its equivalent, for himself or dependents, the amount payable under this Section III shall be reduced by the value of any benefits which are provided under such other plan.

The provisions of Section III, A-1 shall cease when the pensioner reaches his normal retirement age at which time hospital-medical coverage will be as provided under the terms of the Ontario Health Insurance Act.
2. The benefits provided under this Welfare and Insurance Agreement will not be applicable either before or after an employee's normal retirement date for any employee who terminated employment and is eligible for a deferred vested pension, or who is entitled to early retirement as a result of complete and permanent closure of the Company's factory in accordance with the terms of the Agreement for Pensions as amended December 17, 2007.
Section IV. - General Provisions
A.	It is further agreed between the parties that, so long as the employee is on the active payroll of the Company, wherever Ontario Health Insurance Commission rules and regulations conflict with the provisions of the Welfare and Insurance Agreement, the rules and regulations of the above-named Commission will supersede the applicable provisions of the Welfare and Insurance Agreement.
B.	Medical Examination by the Company.
1.	Disabilities giving rise to claims for any benefits under this Insurance Program may be verified by the Company by medical examination at any reasonable time. Benefits may be suspended if the claimant fails to have such examination made.
2.	If any dispute shall arise concerning the disability of any employee, such difference shall be resolved as follows:
The employee shall be examined by a physician appointed for the purpose by the Company. If the employee's physician and the Company's physician should disagree concerning disability that question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by such two physicians. The medical opinion of the third physician after examination of the employee and consultation with the other two physicians shall decide such question.
It is agreed and understood that when a third (3rd) physician's medical opinion is required, the Company will absorb the cost.
C.	Definition of “Physician”.
1. Wherever the word “Physician” or “Doctor” is used in this Insurance program it shall mean either a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or a Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) or a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.).
D.	There will be no duplication in whole or part, in payment of benefits under the terminated insurance program.

The employer shall be liable for benefits described in this Insurance Program which are not provided in said insurance contracts. In the event any dispute shall arise based on the question whether the insurance contract provides the insurance coverage hereinabove described, such dispute shall be subject to the grievance procedure of the Labour Agreement, including arbitration; omitting, however, all steps preceding presentation of grievance to the Industrial Relations Department of the Company.
1.	The benefits provided by this Insurance Program in lieu of any and all similar benefits which are or may be provided by any law or laws. Any amounts required to be paid by the Company as contributions, taxes or benefits under any law or laws providing non-occupational Insurance Benefits shall reduce to the full extent thereof the amounts the Company shall be required to pay hereunder, and appropriate adjustment shall be made in the benefits available hereunder.
I.	Premium reductions brought about by the introduction on January 1, 1972 of the Ontario Health Insurance Organization Act, (1971) combining Ontario Hospital Services Commission and Ontario Health Insurance Plan shall be retained by the Company to pay the increased premiums for improved benefits and refunds outlined in this memorandum.

(A)	An employee who has attained age sixty-two (62) and has ten (10) or more years of continuous service or an employee who has attained age fifty-five (55) but not age sixty-two (62) and who has thirty (30) or more years of early retirement eligibility service may retire at the option of the employee on or after the effective date of the pension plan and prior to his normal retirement date and shall be entitled to a pension upon his retirement. Such pension shall be an immediate pension, the monthly amount of which as to the basic and supplementary pensions shall be computed as if he were a pensioner entitled to a pension at normal retirement date and with the credited service which he has at the date of such early retirement. The payments shall be subject to the deductions provided for in Article IV and shall continue as to the basic pension to be paid monthly throughout the lifetime of the early pensioner but the supplementary pension will be reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth in Paragraph 3:01 of Article III.
(B)	An employee who has thirty (30) or more years of early retirement eligibility service, may retire on or after the 1st day of June 2004 and is eligible for a Special Early Retirement Pension upon his retirement.
Such Special Early Retirement Pension is to be calculated as to the basic portion and the supplementary portions, in the same manner as for normal retirement, provided that such pensions may not exceed the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as summarized in Article IX hereof.
Paragraph 3:04 - Early Retirement
(A)	The pension payable upon an early retirement in accordance with subsections (A) and (B) of Paragraph 3:04 of this Article III shall consist of either:
(I)	A deferred monthly pension based upon his credited service at the date of such early retirement and computed as to the basic and supplementary pensions in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3:01 of Article III, the payment of which shall commence with the first day of the month coincident with or next following the month in which the employee attains sixty-two (62) years of age, provided that the lifetime and the Supplementary pensions may not exceed the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as summarized in Article IX hereof, and payments of which shall be subject to the deductions provided for in Article IV and shall continue as to the basic pension to be paid monthly throughout the lifetime of the early pensioner, but the supplementary pension will be reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth in Paragraph 3:01 of Article III, or
(II)	An immediate pension, the monthly amount of which as to the basic and supplementary pensions shall first be computed as if he were a pensioner entitled to a pension at normal retirement date not subject to the deductions provided for in Article IV and with the credited service which he has at the date of such early retirement but each payment of such pension, whether becoming payable before, during, or after the month in which he is first eligible for any statutory benefit, shall be reduced, for each complete month to elapse from his retirement until the earlier of the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the month in which he attains sixty-two (62) years of age or the first day of the month coincident with or next following the month in which he would have completed thirty (30) years of early retirement eligibility service had he not retired, by 4/10ths of 1% of the amount so computed for the first monthly payment before deductions and the payments as so reduced shall then be subject to the deductions provided for in Article IV and shall continue as to the basic pension to be paid in the reduced amount monthly throughout the lifetime of the early pensioner, but the supplementary pension will be reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth in Paragraph 3:01, of Article III.
The above deductions, other than those provided for in Article IV, shall not apply to the basic pension of an employee who has attained age fifty-five (55) but not age sixty-two (62) and who has thirty (30) or more but less than thirty-seven (37) years of early retirement eligibility service.
(C)	An employee who has attained age fifty-five (55) but not age sixty (60) and has ten (10) or more years of continuous service, may be retired at the option of the company or under mutually satisfactory conditions and in either such event shall be entitled to a pension upon his retirement. Such pension shall consist of an immediate pension, the monthly amount of which as to the basic and supplementary pensions shall be computed as if he were a pensioner entitled to a pension at normal retirement date and with the credited service which he has at the date of early retirement, and will be subject to a reduction of 0.25% for each month that his age at retirement precedes the earlier of his age 60, or the month in which his combined years of age and years of early retirement eligibility service (computed to complete months for a fractional year in each case) equal eighty (80), in accordance with Regulation 8503(3)(c) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). The payments shall then be subject to the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as summarized in Article IX hereof, and to the deductions provided for in Article IV and shall continue as to the basic pension to be paid throughout the lifetime of the early pensioner but the supplementary pension will be reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth in Paragraph 3:01 of this Article III.
Paragraph 3:05 - Deferred Vested Pension
(A)	Any employee with continuous service with the Company whose services with the Company are terminated after the effective date of this Pension Plan, and who has two (2) or more years of continuous service at the date of termination of employment, but is ineligible for a pension shall, upon application with at least thirty (30) days notice prior to his normal retirement date, be considered a pensioner for the purpose of the Pension Plan but for no other purpose and shall be entitled to his vested interest in the Pension Plan (but no other benefits), commencing with the later of (1) the month following that in which he attains age sixty-five (65), or (2) the month following that in which application is made therefore.
"Nevertheless, if application for pension is made after the former employee has attained age 65 and such former employee had attained age 45 prior to terminating employment, he will also receive retroactive monthly pension payments for the period from his normal retirement date to the date his application is received."
There will be no liability for the payment of interest or for any delay in payment unless and until application has been made. The monthly amount of such payment shall be computed as if he were a pensioner entitled to a pension at normal retirement date, based on the benefit rate in effect at termination of employment, with the credited service which he had at the date of the termination of his service with the company and shall apply only to the basic pension described in Paragraph 3:01 of this Article III and the payments as so computed shall then be subject to the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) as summarized in Article IX hereof, and to the deductions provided for in Article III.
Alternatively, the terminated employee may elect to have his deferred vested pension commence from the first day of any month within the 10 years immediately preceding his normal retirement date, in which case the amount of his deferred vested pension will be reduced to its actuarial equivalent to reflect the earlier commencement date subject to the minimum reduction required under the Income Tax Act (Canada). The Company will require at least thirty (30) days written notice in order for the terminated employee to have his deferred vested pension commence earlier than his normal retirement date.
In lieu of taking a deferred vested pension from the plan, a terminating employee may require the Company to transfer the commuted value of his deferred vested pension as of the date of termination of employment to:
(a)	a prescribed registered retirement vehicle; or
(b)	another registered pension plan if the administrator of that other pension plan agrees to accept the transfer; or
(c)	a person licensed to carry on an annuities business in Canada for the purchase of a life annuity that will not commence prior to age fifty-five (55), provided that the transfer is administered in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act, including the locking-in provisions, and with the Income Tax Act (Canada), and provided further that the terminating employee notifies the Company of his election of one of the above portability options on the prescribed form and within the time period required under the Pension Benefits Act.
Notwithstanding the above, if the amount of the annual deferred vested pension at the date of termination of employment is less than 2% of the YMPE for the year of termination, or such other amount as may be permitted under the Pension Benefits Act, the commuted value of the deferred vested pension may be paid out as a lump sum refund without being locked-in. Such a request for a refund of a small pension will be in lieu of retaining his right to the deferred vested pension from the plan.
(B)	If such employee has retained a deferred vested pension from the plan, and is subsequently re-employed by the Company and subsequently becomes eligible for a pension on retirement the amount of his benefit including deferred vested pension will not exceed the amount he would have been entitled to, had his credited service with the Company both before and after reemployment been continuous. In any other circumstance, a terminated employee who is rehired by the Company will be treated as a new employee for all purposes of the plan.
(C)	The provisions dealing with deferred vested pension in each previous Pension Plan Agreement between the Company and the Union shall continue to apply to an employee whose employment was terminated during the currency of each such Agreement.
Paragraph 3:06 Normal Form of Pension
Each pension payable under this plan shall be paid in monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month following or
coincident with the date of retirement, and shall continue on the first day of each month thereafter as follows:
(a)	The basic monthly pension is payable for the life of the employee with the guarantee that 60 such monthly payments shall be made. If the employee dies before the sixty (60) month guaranteed period expires, the remainder of the sixty (60) monthly payments shall be made to the spouse or the eligible dependants each month as they fall due, or if none, the commuted value of the remaining guaranteed payments shall be paid to any other beneficiary or estate in a lump sum.
(b)	The Type A supplementary pension is payable for the life of the employee but not beyond the normal retirement age of sixty-five (65), and without any guarantee as to the number of payments to be made.
Notwithstanding the above, the Pension Benefits Act requires that if the retiring employee, or former employee with a deferred vested pension from the plan, has an eligible spouse at the date of commencement of pension payments, and provided that no waivers in the prescribed form exist, the basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06(a) above, must be converted and paid as a joint and 60% survivor pension.
For these purposes, the value of the lifetime basic monthly pension with the 60 month guaranteed period will be converted on an actuarially equivalent basis to provide a joint and 60% survivor pension for a different amount without a guaranteed period. Under the joint and 60% survivor pension, the adjusted monthly amount will be paid to the pensioner for as long as he lives, and upon his death 60% of the adjusted amount will be continued to that spouse, if she is then living, for the remainder of her lifetime.
The last monthly installment is the one that is due at the beginning of the month in which the pensioner dies or the guaranteed period expires, whichever is applicable. At the discretion of the Pension Board, the last monthly installment of a pension payable under this Plan may, in the event of death of a pensioner prior to receipt of such installments, be paid to the surviving spouse or other dependents of such pensioner.
Paragraph 3:07 - Optional Forms of Pension
An employee may, by written application on forms supplied by and submitted to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the actual commencement date of pension payments, elect to convert the normal form of his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06 (a) above to one of the optional forms of pension described below, on an actuarially equivalent basis. The election of an optional form of pension does not apply to any supplementary pensions payable at normal retirement, special early retirement, early retirement or disability retirement. Where the employee has an eligible spouse at the date pension payments are to commence, the right to elect an optional form of pension may only be exercised if the employee and the spouse both sign the prescribed waiver forms as required by the Pension Benefits Act. In addition, in no event may an election of an optional form of pension be made after pension payments have already commenced.
Guaranteed Options
The employee may elect that his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06 (a) above, before the deductions in Article IV and excluding any supplementary pensions, be paid for his lifetime with the guarantee that payments will be made for sixty (60) months, or one hundred and twenty (120) months or one hundred and eighty (180) months as the case may be. For the purposes of this paragraph, the lifetime basic monthly pension will be adjusted on an actuarial equivalent basis and paid in the same or a different amount as the case may be, with the condition that if the pensioner dies before the selected guarantee period had expired, the remaining payments will be made to the spouse or eligible dependants monthly as they fall due, or if none the commuted value of such remaining guaranteed payments will be paid to any other beneficiary or estate in a lump sum. No optional form of pension will be permitted which would result in a guaranteed period exceeding fifteen (15) years.
Joint and Survivor Options
The employee may elect that his lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06 (a) above, before the deductions in Article IV and excluding any supplementary pensions, be adjusted on an actuarially equivalent basis and paid as a joint and survivor pension without any guarantee as to the number of payments to be made. Under this option, the same or a different amount of monthly pension, as the case may be, will be payable during the lifetime of the pensioner and upon his death 50 %, or 60%, or 100 % as elected of the adjusted monthly pension then payable to him will be continued to the spouse, for as long as that spouse shall live.
Should the spouse die after the pensioner had elected the option but before his adjusted lifetime basic monthly pension had commenced, the election shall be void and the lifetime basic monthly pension will not be adjusted and will be paid to him as if he had made no election.
Once an election of this option and the designation of a joint annuitant have been made and accepted by the Company, it may be rescinded or changed prior to the actual commencement date of pension payments only with the written consent of the Company in accordance with the rules of uniform application to all persons similarly situated.
The Company may adopt or establish other optional forms of pension in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act and any other applicable legislation from time to time. The amount of any such optional form of pension shall be the actuarial equivalent of the pension payable in the normal form as described in paragraph 3:06.
An election to receive an optional form of pension may be revoked or changed provided written notice of such revocation or change is received by the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement date of pension payments to the pensioner.
Paragraph 3:08 - Beneficiary
(A)	Subject to the provisions of this Section, an employee or pensioner who has attained the age of twenty-one (21) years, who is domiciled in and ordinarily a resident in the Province of Ontario, may designate a beneficiary or a new beneficiary to receive the payments, if any, to be made under this plan after his death. An employee or pensioner who has designated a beneficiary or a new beneficiary pursuant to this Article may revoke any such designation.
(B)	The right to designate or to revoke a designation of a beneficiary pursuant to Paragraph 3:08(A) of this Article is to be exercised by the execution by the employee or pensioner and by delivery to the Board of an instrument in writing which expressly provides that the designation or revocation whichever is the case, is made with reference to this Plan.
(C)	Upon delivery to the Board, prior to or on or after the death of the employee or pensioner, of a designation or revocation of a designation of a beneficiary made pursuant to Paragraphs 3:08 (A) and (B) of this Article, the designation or revocation, even if it is contained in a will or in an instrument purporting to be a will, relates back to and has effect as and from the date of its execution but without prejudice to this Company on account of any payment or payments made under this plan prior to such delivery.
(D)	Where an employee or pensioner is not permitted to make a designation under the provisions of this Article, any payments to be made with respect to him after his death, will be made to his estate. No provision of the Pension Plan is to be construed as taking away any rights of such an employee or pensioner to direct how his monies received by his estate are to be distributed or otherwise dealt with by his personal representatives.
(E)	Notwithstanding the designation or rights of any beneficiary, where the employee has a spouse at the date of death, any benefits payable under the Plan shall be payable to the spouse and the administrator of the Plan shall be fully discharged of all liabilities for benefits paid to that spouse, subject only to any other claims by a former spouse which has been previously recorded with the Plan Administrator.
Paragraph 3:09 - Pensioner Unable to Care for his Affairs
If the Board finds that any pensioner to whom a pension is payable from the Pension Fund is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been made, by a duly appointed guardian, committee or other legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the Board to have incurred expense for such pensioner. However, the Board shall endeavor to give effect to the wishes of the pensioner in this respect when such wishes shall have been expressed in writing by the pensioner before he shall have become unable to care for his affairs. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of the pensioner and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan therefore.
Paragraph 3:10 - Pre-Retirement Death Benefit
(A)	If an employee dies before becoming entitled to a deferred vested pension from the plan, no death benefit is payable from the plan.
However, if the employee dies after becoming entitled to a deferred vested pension but before becoming eligible for special early retirement, early retirement or disability retirement, his surviving spouse, or if none the beneficiary or estate shall receive a death benefit from the plan equal to the commuted value of the lifetime basic monthly pension as described in paragraph 3:06 (a) above, excluding any supplementary pension, which the employee had accrued to the date of death.
The lifetime basic monthly pension accrued to the date of death is determined as the basic monthly pension accrued by the employee at the date of death, calculated in accordance with Paragraph 3:01 as if the date of death were his normal retirement date using the provisions of the plan in effect at the date of death, and his years of credited service at that time. The above death benefit shall be paid as a lump sum payment, or the surviving spouse may elect to purchase an immediate or deferred life annuity from an insurance company with the proceeds, whichever the spouse elects. If the spouse does not elect within the time prescribed under the Pension Benefits Act, the spouse will be deemed to have elected to purchase an immediate pension from an insurance company of the Company's choice.
(B)	If the employee dies while accumulating continuous service, while eligible to retire under the special early or early retirement rules and prior to the employee's retirement, the spouse may elect to receive a spouse option pension from the plan, in lieu of the lump sum settlement in paragraph 3:10 (A) above. The spouse option pension shall be payable to the said spouse, provided such spouse is then living, commencing with the month following the month of the employee's death and each month thereafter during such spouse's lifetime. The amount of the spouse option pension shall be equal to sixty (60) percent of that lifetime basic monthly pension amount which would have been payable to the employee if the employee had actually retired immediately prior to death and the employee's basic monthly pension had been converted to the joint and survivor (60%) form described in paragraph 3:06.
(C)	If a deferred vested pensioner, who terminated his employment on or after January 1, 1988 and did not elect a portability transfer under Paragraph 3:05 of this Article III but instead retained a deferred vested pension from the plan, dies prior to the actual commencement date of his deferred vested pension, his surviving spouse, or if none the beneficiary or estate shall receive a death benefit from the plan equal to the commuted value of his deferred vested pension as described above. Such death benefit shall be paid as a lump sum payment or may be used by the spouse to purchase an immediate or deferred life annuity from an insurance company, whichever the spouse elects. If the spouse does not elect within the time prescribed by the Pension Benefits Act, the spouse will be deemed to have elected the immediate lifetime pension.
ARTICLE IV
Deductions
Paragraph 4:01
(A)	There shall be deducted from the amount of pension payable to each pensioner and each recipient of a total and permanent disability pension under the provisions of Articles II and III, a sum equal to the full amount of any benefit, annuity, pension or payment of similar kind payable of such person after retirement for any period of credited service covered by this plan, under any other plan of the Company or its parent or any affiliate or subsidiary of either to which the person is or shall be or, upon application would become entitled; provided that, if such person shall have contributed to the source or fund from which any such benefits, annuity, pension or payment shall be paid or become payable, such full amount of the deduction for such benefit, annuity, pension or payment shall be decreased by the amount which shall be attributable to the contributions which such person shall have made to such source or fund.
(B)	The deductions from pensions referred to in Paragraph 4:01 of this Article IV shall not be made from the monthly or lump sum payments to a beneficiary or the estate of a pensioner where an employee has elected an optional form of pension in accordance with Paragraph 3:07 of Article III.
(C)	There shall be deducted from the amount of Type A supplementary pension payable to each recipient of a total and permanent disability pension under the provisions of Article III or to the recipient of an early retirement pension under the provisions of Article III.
The sum equal to the amount of statutory benefit to which the pensioner shall or could be entitled to receive upon application.
Paragraph 4:02
Each person who retires under the plan shall furnish to the Board proof satisfactory to it of the amount of any such benefit, annuity, pension or payment to which he is or shall be or upon application would become entitled and, upon request of the Board, will authorize the Board to obtain information relating to such benefit, annuity, pension or payment from any government agency. If any applicant for a pension or pensioner shall fail to furnish any such proof or authorization, the Board may compute his pension and deductions on the basis of estimates which in its judgment are reasonable. The deductions which are provided for in this Article III shall be made not only with respect to any of the above-mentioned payments which shall actually be received by a pensioner, but also with respect to any such payments to which he would be entitled, except for some act or failure to act by him or on his behalf, such as leaving Canada, failure to make application therefore or failure to notify the proper authority of his address.
Paragraph 4:03
If any of the payments which are deductible from pensions under this Article IV shall be paid in the case of a pension from a pension plan established by the General Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Limited or its parent or otherwise paid or payable to a pensioner in a lump sum, it shall be prorated on a monthly basis from the date on which it shall be paid in the case of a pension from a pension plan established by the General Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Limited or its parent or otherwise paid or payable (at a rate each month equal to the entire amount of pension otherwise payable to such pensioner from the pension fund in such month) and no pension shall be payable to such pensioner under the plan until said payment, as thus prorated shall be exhausted.
Article V
Application For Retirement
Paragraph 5:01
Each application for retirement shall be in writing on the form or forms provided by the Pension Board and shall be made to the Pension Board and shall be filed in such manner and with such person as the Pension Board may specify. The Pension Board may require that there be furnished to it in connection with any such application for retirement proof of age and any other information as may reasonably be required. If an applicant fails to furnish such information or proof, the Pension Board may compute his pension, if any, on any basis by it deemed reasonable.
ARTICLE VI Administration
Paragraph 6:01
The administration of this Plan shall be the responsibility of the Company and shall be carried out by a Pension Board, which shall consist of three (3) or more persons from the management of the employing Company to be appointed annually by the Board of Directors of the employing Company and to serve until their successors shall have been appointed in like manner. At the time of their appointment, the Board of Directors shall designate one (1) of the members of the Pension Board as its Chairman.
Paragraph 6:02
The Pension Board Shall Have Authority:
(A)	To grant pensions in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions provided for under this Plan; provided such action as shall be taken is in no way inconsistent with any applicable laws, rules or regulations that may have been or shall be adopted or promulgated by a government authority having jurisdiction over the Fund or Plan;
(B)	To interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan, to resolve ambiguities and to correct errors, and to make, amend, repeal, and enforce such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or proper for the efficient operation of this Plan;
(C)	From time to time, to adopt mortality tables and the interest rate to be used as the basis for all actuarial calculations;
(D)	To appoint an actuary who shall recommend to the Pension Board the mortality tables and interest rates, and shall make actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the Plan; and
(E)	To perform such other duties as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Board of Directors of the employing Company.
Paragraph 6:03
The Pension Board shall hold meetings upon such notice, at such place or places, and at such time as the members of the board shall determine from time to time. A majority of the members of the Pension Board at the time in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; but a majority of those present, though less than a quorum, may adjourn any meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. Any action approved by the vote of a majority of those present at any meeting, if those present constitute a quorum, shall be the action of the Pension Board, the Pension Board may take action without meeting if approval of the action is in writing by all members at the time in office.
Paragraph 6:04
The Pension Board shall prepare or cause to be prepared, an annual report within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year after the effective date setting forth in reasonable summary the operation of the Plan for such year.
Paragraph 6:05
The Company shall provide to each member a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the Plan and amendments thereto applicable to him, together with an explanation of the rights and duties of the employee with reference to the benefits available to him under the terms of the Pension Plan.
ARTICLE VII
Payment of Pensions
Paragraph 7:01
The Company is free to determine the manner and means of making provisions for, and paying, the pension benefits set forth in this Plan; however, the Company agrees to reserve or set aside each year the amount required on a sound actuarial basis to pay the pension benefits provided by the Plan for the life of each pensioner retired under the Plan during such year, in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act and the Income Tax Act (Canada).
Paragraph 7:02
For the purpose of this Plan, the Company may establish or cause to be established, alone or in conjunction with other employing Companies, a pension trust or trusts. Any employing Company may pay, or cause to be paid, into such trust or trusts such amounts as the Company shall approve.
Paragraph 7:03
The funds of any such trust or trusts may be invested, reinvested and used for the payment of or making provisions for pensions granted in accordance with this plan and for the payment of such costs and expenses, including taxes, of operation and administration of this plan as may be required by law or as may from time to time be directed or approved by the Pension Board; but in the discretion of the Company such funds or any part or parts of them may be commingled with any other fund or funds established for use in connection with the payment of pensions to any employees of any employing company. No part of the assets of the trust or trusts may be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of employees at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities to employees covered by the trust or trusts.
Paragraph 7:04
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Article, payments to the Fund, the investment and loan of monies constituting said Fund, and the payment of pensions, shall be made in such manner as to comply with legislation that may have been or shall be adopted or promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Fund or Plan. Appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Plan where necessary.
ARTICLE VIII General Provisions
Paragraph 8:01
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give any employee the right to be retained in the service of an employing Company or to interfere with the right of the employing Company by which he shall then be employed to discharge any employee at any time. The foregoing shall not be deemed to modify the provisions of any Agreements which may be made by any of the employing Companies with the recognized Collective Bargaining representative of any of their employees.
Paragraph 8:02
No benefit, right or interest under the Plan may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, charged, anticipated, given as security or surrendered under any circumstances. Neither pensions, nor any payment on account thereof, shall be subject to seizure or attachment or other legal process for or against a pensioner, except with respect to the interests of a Spouse in the event of marriage breakdown as described below.
Subject to the Act, when an order from a court of competent jurisdiction or a valid written domestic contract requiring division of an employee's or former employee's benefits under the Plan due to marriage breakdown or dissolution of a common-law relationship has been received by the Administrator, such division shall be made in accordance with such order or contract, as determined by the Administrator and subject to any requirements prescribed under the applicable legislation. Any necessary adjustments shall be made to the employee's or former employee's benefit entitlement to reflect such division, provided that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefits payable to the employee and the Spouse shall not exceed the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefits payable to the employee had the division not occurred.
A spouse, on whose behalf an order or domestic contract is filed with the Company, has the same entitlement with respect to the spouse's interest in the pension benefits of the employee as the employee has under the plan in the event of his termination of employment.
Paragraph 8:03
Subject to the provisions of any Agreements which may be made by any of the employing Companies with the recognized Collective Bargaining representatives of any of their employees, the Company reserves the right to modify, amend or terminate this Plan, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason. The Plan may be amended by joint agreement between the Company and the Union so as to reduce benefits of an employee in order to avoid revocation of the Plan's registered status under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations. On and after termination of this Plan, no further pension rights or obligations shall accrue under this Plan to any employee who has not retired thereunder prior to such termination provided, however, that no pension granted prior to the date of such termination shall be reduced, suspended or discontinued, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.
Paragraph 8:04
In the event of termination, all assets of the Plan shall be used for the exclusive benefit of the participants and no part thereof shall be returned to the Company, except the excess, if any, which may exist because of erroneous actuarial computation.
Paragraph 8:05
No employee prior to his retirement under the conditions of eligibility for pension benefits as provided by this Plan shall have any rights or interest whatsoever in or to any portion of any funds which may be paid into any pension trust or trusts established for the purpose of paying pensions and no employee or pensioner shall have any right to pension benefits except to the extent provided in this Plan.
Paragraph 8:06
The Company may act for and on behalf of any or all of the employing Companies in all matters pertaining to the operation and administration of this Plan.
Article IX Conditions
Paragraph 9:01
The Plan and all of the Company's obligations and employee's rights thereunder are conditioned on and subject to the approval of the relevant governmental tax authorities.
The Company shall contribute to the Fund such amounts, as determined by the Actuary and taking into account the assets of the Fund, as are necessary to maintain the Plan on a sound actuarial basis, provided that those contributions are eligible contributions under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Such contributions shall meet the minimum funding standards prescribed under the Act and shall include any amounts required to amortize any unfunded liability or solvency deficiency. Where applicable, Company Contributions shall be made at a time and in a manner which are in accordance with the Pension Benefits Act.
If on the effective date of the Pension Plan the Company has not all the approvals which it may deem necessary to establish that it is entitled to deduct the amount of its contributions to the Pension Plan as an expense before taxes under the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada), or any other applicable tax laws, as now in effect or as hereafter amended or adopted, the Plan shall not become effective.
Furthermore, employees are not required and are not permitted to make contributions of any kind to the plan.
Paragraph 9:02
In the event of refusal by the Board of Directors or by the relevant authorities, to approve this Agreement on or before the 1st day of December 2004 or in the event of the government tax authorities refusing to approve this Agreement, as defined in Section 9:01 hereof, after such date or of their withdrawal after such date of approval of this Agreement previously given, either the Union or the Employer may apply to the Ontario Labour Relations Board for permission to terminate any Collective Labour Agreement then in effect, and the other party shall join in such application. If subsequent to notice of termination of such Collective Labour Agreement, or subsequent to termination of this Agreement, the parties settle any difference between them and this Agreement is reinstated or a successor Agreement is made, then such Collective Labour Agreement if terminated, shall be reinstated to continue in full force until subsequently terminated according to its provisions as contained therein.
Paragraph 9:03
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the amount of lifetime basic annual pension, and/or any supplementary pensions provided under the Plan to any employee or to a spouse, if applicable, shall not exceed the maximum amounts payable under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the Regulations thereunder. The following paragraphs provide a simplified summary of the main income tax limitations on pension amounts payable under the Plan, but in the event of any dispute regarding the application of these maximum limits, the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations will govern.
A:	Maximum Lifetime Pension
The maximum lifetime annual pension amount for the year in which the pension commences to be paid is the lesser of the defined benefit limit for that year (currently $1833.33) and 2% of the employee's highest indexed average compensation, multiplied by the employee's years of credited service. This maximum amount shall be reduced in accordance with section 8503(3)(c) of the Income Tax Regulations if payment of the pension commences before the date when the employee reaches age sixty (60), attains thirty (30) years of Early Retirement Eligibility Service, or age plus Early Retirement Eligibility Service equals eighty (80).
For the purposes of calculating the limitation in this paragraph, an employee shall not be considered to have more than thirty-five (35) years of credited service in respect of periods prior to January 1, 1992, and the terms "defined benefit limit" and "highest average compensation" shall have the meanings ascribed to them under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the Regulations thereunder.
B:	Maximum Type A Supplementary Pension
Where the employee retires early and is entitled under the Plan to a Type A supplementary pension such pension shall not be payable beyond the payment for the month in which the employee attains age 65, and the maximum amount of such supplementary pension under subparagraph 8503(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations shall be determined as described below.
(i)	If the employee has attained age sixty (60) at the early retirement date and completed at least ten years of credited service, the maximum amount shall be the maximum Old Age Security benefit payable to a person aged sixty-five
(65) on the date that the employee retires, plus a proportion, based on his earnings history, of the maximum Canada/Quebec Pension Plan retirement benefits that would be payable to a person aged sixty-five (65) on the date that the employee retires.
(ii)	If the employee has attained age sixty (60) at the early retirement date and has not accrued at least ten years of credited service, the maximum amount determined pursuant to paragraph (i) above shall be multiplied by the ratio of the employee's credited service to ten (10) unless the employee retires early as a result of a permanent disability under the Plan
(iii)	If the employee has not attained age sixty (60) at the early retirement date the portion of the maximum benefit in (i) above, attributable to credited service after January 1, 1992, shall be reduced by 0.25% for each month that the commencement of the Type A supplementary pension precedes age sixty (60). This percentage reduction is waived if the employee retires early as a result of a total and permanent disability under the Plan.
C:	Maximum Combined Lifetime and Type A Supplementary Pensions
Where the employee retires early before age 65 and is entitled to receive a Type A supplementary pension at early retirement, the sum of his lifetime pension and his Type A supplementary pension in respect of credited service after December 31, 1991 and payable from the time the benefits commence to be paid to the time the employee attains 65 years of age or death, if earlier, may not exceed in the year of commencement the defined benefit limit for the year (currently $1,833.33) times his years of credited service, plus 25% of the 3 year average of the YMPE for that year and the preceding two years, prorated if the credited service is less than 35 years.
D:	Maximum Deemed Credited Service during Temporary Absences
For certain eligible periods of temporary absences, the Plan may be required to continue the accrual of credited service and benefits in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement between the Union and the Company, the Employment Standards Act (Ontario) and/or the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act (Ontario).
For eligible temporary absences, other than absences when the employee is permanently disabled (as defined in paragraph 1:07 of Article I), credited service may not be deemed for more than the full-time equivalent of 60 months in respect of all such periods of eligible temporary absences, plus an additional full-time equivalent of thirty-six (36) months during which the employee has taken one or more periods of eligible parental leave, subject to a maximum of the full-time equivalent of twelve (12) months with respect to any one period of eligible parental leave as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada) and its Regulations.
