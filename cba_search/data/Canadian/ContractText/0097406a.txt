ADJUSTMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
In connection with the interpretation of certain clauses in the contract between IWA-CANADA and certain Interior Operators, the following interpretations of the Contract have been agreed upon:
Section 1:
With respect to the definition of the two categories Lumber grader and Boomman, the following is agreed upon: Lumber Grader:	One who grades for shipment
Boomman:	One who makes up or breaks down booms or who grades logs.
Section 2:
a)	With respect to Call-time as covered in Article VII, Section 8 or Section 9, the following understanding has been reached.
If workers present themselves for work, and due to any conditions beyond their control, there is no work available they shall receive two hours’ pay unless sufficient warning has been given cancelling the work call for that day. However, if there is a possibility that work may be available within two (2) hours of the regular starting time, the employer may request employees to stay at their place of employment during the call-time period.
In the case of logging camp employees, the interpretation of call-time shall be as follows:
Employees will not be deemed to have been called for work if they do not leave the camp or the assembly point except those employees using their own means of transportation who present themselves for work not having sufficient warning.
Sawmill employees being transported by Company vehicle shall be covered by the above clause.
b)	It shall be deemed that sufficient notice has been given cancelling the work call for the first or day shift, provided notice has been given over the local radio station (s), wherever possible the previous evening but not later than one and one-half ( 1 U) hours before shift commences with two (2) broadcasts within a half-hour period. It shall be deemed sufficient notice cancelling call for work for night-shift when notice has been given over the appropriate radio station (s), during the hours 12 noon to 1 p.m., but not later than three (3) hours before shift commences with two (2) broadcasts within a half (1/2) hour period. The above shall apply only within a thirty (30) mile radius of Prince George.
Section 3:
Interpretation of Article VIII, Section 2 c)
This section means that the application of seniority as it is presently applied in the individual plant would remain in effect unless it is or has been changed by agreement between the Company and the Union.
The word ‘plant’ in this section means a sawmill, a planer mill or a logging operation.
It is agreed that the foregoing understanding shall be of the same force and effect as if they had been written into the actual contract and this Section of Adjustment and Interpretation shall form Supplement No. 2 and be part of the Contract.

INCENTIVES AND REHABILITATION
Council on Northern Interior Forest Employment Relations and I.W.A. Canada will jointly consider plan modifications that will both improve the delivery of Rehabilitation within the Long Term Disability Plan, and will encourage and facilitate the development and establishment of Disability Management systems in participating employers’ operations.
