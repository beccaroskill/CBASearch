Letter of Understanding Re: Skilled Trades
During negotiations the parties had considerable discussions pertaining to Job Security and Outside Contracting language currently contained in Article 19.04 of the Collective Agreement. These discussions included but were not limited to planning, advance notice cf outside contracting activities, scope cf the work to be contracted, full utilization of skilled trades employees in their respectivetrades and the installationof new or existing equipment.
While the parties agree that the language in the Collective Agreement currently provides for a mechanism to ensure that there is full input and communications between the parties relat-
53
ing to the issues noted above, it was recognized that there may be times where due to the excessive workloads that they may have been lax in exercising their responsibilities to ensure the most effective use of the article.
The Company and the Union therefore agree upon ratification of this agreement to work more closely together to open up the lines of communications through meaningful dialogue to ensure language in Article 19 is being fully taken advantage of in the most efficient manner for the benefit of each side.
It is the parties expectationsthat if the current language is made use of in an proficient manner that many of the current difficulties relating to this article can and will be avoided.

8.03	Procedure for allocating the pension fund upon termination of

In the event of termination of the plan, the assets then remaining in the trust fund, after providing the expenses of the plan, shall be allocated by the committee,to the extent that they shall be sufficient for the purpose of paying retirement benefits (based on credited service to the date of termination of the plan),to participants, former participants and retired participants in the following order of precedence:
(A) First, to provide for:
(1)	The continuation of annuities in the form in effect with respect to them immediately prior to the plan’s termination for those persons who are pensioners, beneficiaries and contingent annuitants under the plan at its termination;
(2)	The payment of an immediate annuity, in an amount equal to the retirement benefit they would have received had they retired on the date of termination to each participant who on the date of termination qualifies for a normal retirement benefit under Section 5.01;
(3)	The payment of a deferred annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65) in an amount equal to their vested deferred retirement benefit to each person who terminated employment and is eligible for such a benefit pursuant to Section 5.04;
(4)	The payment of a deferred annuity equal to the vested deferred retirement pension to which they would have been entitled if the date of the plan’s termination were the date of termination of their employment, to each other participant not in any class above who at the date of the plan’s termination is at least age forty-five (45) and has completed at least ten (10) years of credited service.
There shall be no priority among the above. Any person, whether in Group (1), (2) ,(3) or (4), stands on the same rung of the ladder with a person in any other group.
107
(B) Second,if any such assets remain after complete allocation for the purposes of (A) above, they shall be allocated after first establishing classes of participants who are less than age sixty-five (65) on the date of termination and are potentially eligible for a normal retirement benefit by treating each successively younger five (5) year age group as a class using the age sixty-five (65) as a base. An order of allocation priority shall then be established beginning with the oldest class. The assets shall then be allocated to participants in each such class who have an interest herein on account of credited service prior to the date of termination of the plan in an amount equal to the actuarial value of such interest. The allocations of the amounts, if any, in each class for fill or reduced retirement benefits for such participants shall be on the basis of annuity values providing for the payment of such benefits (commencing at the age of first eligibility for a normal benefit) in the form, applicable to such participants, which would have prevailed had the plan not been discontinued with application for reduction of retirement benefits, as in (A) above.
Such allocation shall be accomplishedthrough the continuance cf the trust fund which shall be maintained without earmark as the severable equitable interests of those having a share allocated as above. The allocation of assets in this Section is merely for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the trust fund to provide reserves for retirement benefits cf a certain monthly amount, and is not intended to give any participant such right, title and interest in the trust fund as to entitle them to a segregation of their aliquot share of the trust fund as a separate account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the trustees, upon finding that it is not practicable or desirable under the circumstances to continue the trust fund with respect to some of all of the groups listed above, the trustees may provide for the disposition of all or a part of the trust fund in a manner other than by the continuance of the trust fund with respect to some or all of the groups listed above, but no change shall be affected thereby in
the order of precedence and basis for allocation above established.
Further, if required to dispose cf the trust fund other than by its continuance because of a government rule or statute,such trust fund shall be disposed of in accordance with such rule or statute. If any allocation produces a retirement benefit of less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per year for any person, the trustees may pay in lieu of a retirement benefit a lump sum of equivalent actuarial value,
Anything in this plan which might be construed to the contrary notwithstanding however, it shall be impossible at any time for any time for any part of the corpus or income of the trustfund to revert to the Company,
8.04	AMENDMENTS
Amendments to this plan may be made in writing by mutual consent of both parties.

(B)	If you feel uncomfortable approaching the person, or if the harassment continues, bring the incident forming the basis of the complaint to the attention of the supervisor and/or Union representative.
In minor cases, not involving repeat incidents, the Company and Union agree that the Union may try to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint between bargaining unit employees informally using the CAW Internal Procedure without a fill investigation when so requested by the bargaining unit complainant. The outcome of this attempted resolution will be communicated to the Company.
(C)	If the supervisorand/or Union representativecannot, to the satisfaction of the employee, deal with the complaint, it wil then be submittedin writing to the joint committee.

121
plaint. The joint investigation will include interviews cf the complainant, any employee accused in the complaint,witness-es and other persons named in the complaint.Any Union members interviewed by the joint committee may, if they so wish, have Union representation present during the interview.
It is the intention of the Union and the Company that, where practical, the j oint investigationwill begin within five (5) working days of the lodging of the written complaint and shall be completedwithin fifteen (15) calendar days after the lodging of the written complaint.
In conducting the joint investigation, both the Union and the Company shall, to the extent practicable, maintain confidentiality. Records of the investigation, including interviews, evidence any recommendations made by the joint committee will be securely maintained in the offices of the Company and the Union.
Upon the completion of the joint investigation, the joint committee will complete a written report of its findings and recommendations and submit a copy of the completed report to the human resource person and the plant chairperson. If the members of the joint committeedo not agree, the report may reflect differences in the findings.
If a harassment complaint is proven valid, appropriate corrective action will be taken against the offending employees.
If, after completion of a thorough investigation, a harassment complaint can neither be proved nor disproved in the view of the investigators, the local human resource person, on consultation with the local plant chairperson, will attempt to resolve the conflict in a manner that is agreeable to all parties.
If there is no agreement,the Companyreservesthe right to take such action as it deems appropriate, subject to the Collective Labour Agreement.
In the event the complaint remains unresolved and a violation of the Collective Labour Agreement is alleged, the matter may
be considered as a grievance beginning at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Nothing in this letter of understanding prevents an individual employee complaining of harassment or discrimination from filing a complaint under the Code.
