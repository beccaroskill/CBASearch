An employee may be assigned to do other duties during his shift, so long as he/she is capable and available to do the work, and additional overtime in the department is not incurred as a result of the assignment. This provision is not meant to create job
35
loss but rather to operate the Brewery more efficiently and cost effectively. The intent of this Article is:
(a)	to allow qualified personnel to perform "non regular” job duties during his/her shift. For Example a Packaging Employee who is capable can operate a forklift to assist in clean up or production, or a maintenance employee could receive parcels on the off shifts or Saturday;
(b)	to eliminate unnecessary overtime connected with "calling in" an employee from a specific department when a qualified employee is already onsite and available.

APPENDIX "C" VARIABLE COMPENSATION
Purpose:
To have hourly & salaried employees seek to achieve results by sharing common targets
To provide a market competitive base hourly rate of pay to be combined with an opportunity to supplement this base hourly rate of pay based on achievement of targets
Pay for performance Principles for the Variable Plan:
This plan applies to full-time, active employees only
The variable component will be calculated based on the base hourly rate multiplied by the active hours worked to a maximum 2080 hours in a calendar year. For greater clarity, hours worked does not include hours lost due to layoff, WI, WCB, LTD, sickness, or leave of absence.
Payout will be made in the form of a one-time annual lump sum payment no later than March 31 of the following year and will be subject to normal statutory deductions.
This variable component will not be rolled into the base hourly rate.
For greater clarity, the following will apply for partial years of work:
(a)	Termination - not eligible for any payment
(b)	Resignation - not eligible for payment
(c)	Retirement - pro-rated based on number of hour worked (including vacation) based on the calendar year
(d)	Layoff/dosure- based on hours worked
Flow the calculation works:
Management will set a list of common targets (combined Brewery and Logistics) each year and the percentages for each
Each target will be weighted and the sum of all targets will be 100%
Results will be based on full calendar-year performance and will be either achieved in full or considered not achieved (no partial completion)
The sum of the achieved targets will determine the overall percentage achievement for the entire brewery and logistics group

This pension will be temporarily supplemented by an amount necessary to provide a monthly pension of $3443, from Company Plans payable until the member would have first become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (Age 65).
Thereafter, the supplement shall be recalculated as the amount required to be added to the member's accrued pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits determined at the date of his retirement to produce a monthly pension of $3781; which supplement shall become his lifetime supplement. In addition to the recalculated lifetime supplement, a member who retires before December 31, 2018 will be paid a further supplement, if necessary, to produce a total pension from company Plans equal to the pension that would be payable if the member were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, his accrued pension including any escalation thereof and his related credited service. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of the member's lifetime supplement.
(c)	85 Point Retirement
A member retiring after having attained age 55 and whose age plus years of credited service total 85 or more (but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement) is entitled to an immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of accrued vested pension to his credit for service to date of early retirement.
In addition, such member shall be entitled to a lifetime supplement calculated as if the member had attained age 65 on his date of retirement but using his current unreduced vested accrued pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum Pension all determined as of the member's actual date of retirement.
(d)	85 Point Early Retirement Window
A member retiring on or after January 1, 2012, but before December 15, 2018, after having obtained age 55 with 85 points (service and age combined) but prior to having qualified for special early retirement under section (b) above is entitled to an additional supplement of $300 per month, payable from general revenues until the age of 65.
This provision ((d) above) expires on December 15, 2018.
50
(e)	Other Early Retirement
A member retiring on or after January 1, 2012 and after having attained age 55, with two years of credited service, but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement is entitled to an immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of accrued vested pension to his credit for service to date of early retirement reduced by a factor of one-third (1/3) percent for each month he is under Age 65 when his pension commences.
In addition, such member shall be entitled to a lifetime supplement calculated as if the member had attained age 65 on his date of retirement but using his current unreduced vested accrued pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum Pension all determined as of the member's actual date of retirement.
The lifetime supplement so calculated will then also be reduced by a factor of one third (1/3) percent for each month the member is under Age 65 when his pension commences.
7.	Termination of Employment
A member's accrued pension and lifetime supplement shall completely vest upon the completion of two (2) years of credited service.
The pension benefits accrued for service from January 1,1974 will be paid as a deferred pension commencing at normal retirement date, or;
Instead of the deferred pension entitlement, the member may elect to transfer the commuted value of his pension to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial Locking-in requirements,
8.	Joint and Survivor Pension
A member with an eligible spouse who takes Normal, Special Early, 85 Point, or other Early Retirement on or after January 1, 2012, shall receive a joint and survivor pension unless the persons entitled to the joint and survivor pension deliver to the Plan Administrator a written waiver of such entitlement in the prescribed form within the period of twelve months immediately preceding the commencement of payment of the pension benefit.
Unless waived, the member's accrued pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be reduced by 10% during his lifetime. Upon his death, his eligible surviving spouse shall receive a pension of 60% of the member's reduced accrued pension and lifetime supplement, if any, (subject to actuarial reduction if such spouse is more than 10 years younger than the member).
9.	Death Before Retirement
If a member dies after having met the eligibility requirements (Age 55 and 10 Years of Service) for a pre-retirement spousal pension, his spouse shall receive
51
an immediate pension equal to the amount payable had the member retired on the date of his death with the Joint and Survivor Pension described in item 8 above, plus the same percentage of his lifetime supplement. The lifetime supplement will be calculated as if the member had attained age 65 on his date of death, but using his current unreduced accrued pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of the member's actual date of death.
If a member should die before his pension commences and does not have a spouse who is entitled to a pension as explained in the preceding paragraphs, a death benefit shall be paid to the member's beneficiary equal to the lump sum amount described in Item 7 above as if he had terminated on the date of his death.
Escalation of Pension after Retirement only for service accrued before December 31, 2011 (in accordance with definitions outlined below).
If a member retires from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, his pension will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows his retirement date.
The accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement accrued before December 31, 2011, if any, shall be increased on each January 1st following his retirement by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year, with a maximum escalation of 2%. Any spousal pension will also be escalated applying the same formula, with the first increase occurring on the January 1st following death (in accordance with definitions outlined below).
Definitions:
For those employees with 30 years or more of service on December 31, 2011, they have reached full accrued service and if escalation is identified as outlined above when they retire those employees will receive the full escalation identified for that year up to a maximum of 2%.
Example: An employee has 33 years of accrued service effective December 31, 2011 and retires on June 1, 2016, in accordance with the rules outlined in Appendix "D". If escalation is identified, after his retirement, at 1.5% in a particular year, this employee will receive 1.5% escalation for that year (30 / 30 x 1.5% = 1.5%).
For those employees who already have 15 years, but less than 30, years of accrued service for pension on December 31, 2011, the accrued time for escalation will stop effective December 31, 2011. When they retire and escalation is identified, as outlined above, they will receive a pro-rated amount of the escalation by taking their years of accrued service effective December 31, 2011 divided by 30 years times the escalation amount identified for that year.
Example: 1- An employee has 25 years of accrued service effective December 31, 2011 and retires on June 1, 2016, in accordance with the rules outlined in Appendix "D". If escalation is identified, after his retirement, at 1.5% in a particular year, this employee will receive 1.25% (25 / 30 x 1.5% = 1.25%).
2- An employees has 15 years of services effective December 31, 2011 and retires on December 1 2016, if escalation is identified, after is retirement, at 1,5% in a particular year, this employee will receive 1.125% (15/20 x 1.5% = 1.125%)
(c) For those employees with less than fifteen years of accrued service effective December 31, 2011, they will continue to accrue services for indexation (escalation of pension) until they reach fifteen years of accrued service for indexation or the expiry of this Collective Agreement on December 31, 2018, whichever comes first.
Example: 1- An employee has 13 years of accrued service effective December 31, 2011 and retires on June 1, 2028, in accordance with the rules outlined in Appendix "D". If escalation is identified, after his retirement, at 1.5% in a particular year, this employee will receive 0.75% (15/ 30 x 1.5% = 0.75%).
2- An employee has 13 yeas of accrued service effective December 31, 2018 and retires on Jun 1, 2028, in accordance with the rules outlines in Appendix "D". If escalation is identified, after his retirement, at 1.5% in a particular year, this employee will receive -.43% (13/ 30 x 1.5% = 0.43%).
11. Previous Plan Benefits
Benefits accrued by a member of a previous Oland Breweries Limited Pension Plan have been determined and fixed to the credit of the member for service to December 31, 1973 and will be payable in accordance with the provisions of that plan except:
(a)	The death benefit provided in a previous plan will be deleted and the contributory pension accrued to December 31, 1973 will be subject to the Survival Benefits as described in Item 10 and 11 above.
(b)	On other early retirement described in Item 7 above, the contributory pension accrued for service to December 31, 1973 will be reduced by one-third (1/3) percent for each month that the member is under age sixty-five (65) when pension commences.
12.	Disability Retirement (Before Age 65)
As long as a member is eligible to receive disability benefits under the Group Insurance Plan he will receive service and basic pension credits under the Retirement Plan and will not be retired. However, if a member becomes partially disabled and does not qualify for insurance benefits he may qualify for Disability Retirement. Retirement under this provision requires that:
53
(a)	He is at least age 50 and has completed 10 years of service, and
(b)	He is certified to be partially disabled and thereby prevented from performing any work available with the Company, and
(c)	It is mutually agreed by the member and by the Company that he be retired under the Disability Retirement provision.
On retirement under the disability provision a member is entitled to an immediate pension equal to the amount of basic pension to his credit for service to his date of disability retirement without reduction for his earlier age of retirement. In addition, until he qualifies for the earlier of receipt of C.P.P. disability benefits or the attainment of age 65, he will receive a monthly disability supplement equal to $14.00 multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to 30 years.
At age 65, he will then receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if he had reached age 65 on the date of his retirement, but using his current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the Normal Retirement minimum pension determined as at his actual date of retirement. ■

APPENDIX 'I' WAREHOUSE AND BREWING RELIEF
This letter will serve to document the agreement reached during the 1993 Negotiations on the issue of department staffing and plant rightsizing. In these discussions, it was agreed that to initiate, all relief postings will be re-posted January, 1994. Successful candidates will relieve in their respective positions for vacations and sickness. (It should be noted that during low production periods, relief may not be required).
It is further agreed that when a full time posted position becomes available, the most senior person holding the relief position moves into that position. This creates a natural flow from the relief position to the full time posted position. The vacant relief position would be posted as per our usual method.
In addition, when Logistics relief positions are not required within Logistics department, they will be utilized in packaging or other departments. Brewing relief positions will be drawn from a specific group to be called "E Group" in packaging.
Finally, it was agreed that the plant relief positions would be as follows:
Relief Warehouse	2
Relief Forklift	2
Relief Receiver	1
Relief Drivers	1
Relief Cellars	1
Relief Fermenting	1
Relief Brewhouse	1
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
1.	During calendar 1994, greaser relief will be covered by those individuals currently trained and capable of doing the job. With improved operator training and auto lub systems, this short term requirement will be eliminated.
2.	Any additional relief for the plant will be supplied by students during the time periods of April 1 to September 15 and November 15 to December 31. (Assuming no regulars or preferred temporaries are on layoff.)
Yours truly,
Kirby Dumaresque General Manager Oland Brewery

5.	WEEKLY INDEMNITY BENEFIT
If you become totally disabled and are prevented from working due to a nonoccupational accident or a sickness not covered by Worker's Compensation, you will receive Weekly Indemnity benefits provided you are under the care of a licensed physician.
If disability commences during a period of layoff, you will be eligible for Weekly Indemnity benefits from the date you are recalled to work only if you have 10 or more years of seniority and you are recalled within a period of two weeks from the date of layoff and you are totally disabled on that date.
The amount of your Weekly Indemnity benefit is 70% of your basic weekly earnings rate as of the date disability commences. When a general change in wage rates takes effect under the terms of the labour agreement, the amount of your Weekly Indemnity benefit from the effective date of such change will be 70% of the basic weekly earnings rate to which you would be entitled if you were at work. The benefit payment is based on a 7 day week. For each day of absence for which a benefit is payable, you will receive one-seventh of the weekly benefit. Benefits are payable from the first day of absence of disability due to accident, or from the fourth day of disability due to illness.
92
Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of 26 weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks.)
A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation of the disability unless you have completely recovered an have been back at work for at least 14 days.
Your Weekly Indemnity insurance will be cancelled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your Weekly Indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received Weekly Indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received Worker's Compensation payments for a continuous period of 26 weeks. Your LTD benefit will be payable at the end of each month at 66 2/3% of your basic monthly earnings rate as of the date your LTD benefit commences. For example, if your hourly earnings rate in the 26th week after you become disabled is $26.45 per hour:
(a)	Your Weekly earnings rate is 40 X $26.45 = $1,058.00
(b)	Equivalent monthly earnings rate is ($1,058 X 52 weeks) divided by 12 = $4,584.66
(c)	Monthly LTD benefit is 66 2/3% of $4,584.66 = $3,056.13
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker's Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
In order to qualify for LTD benefits, you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first 2 years of LTD benefits, be unable to perform the duties of your normal occupation or any other job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or a related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least six (6) months.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
93
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefits will continue for up to 24 months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $3,056.13 and you earn $800 in rehabilitative employment:
Provided your employment with the Company has not been terminated, while you are in receipt of LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits.
Your LTD insurance will be cancelled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the company.
NOTE: You may not receive wages or other allowances such as Holiday pay, vacation pay, weekly indemnity, long term disability, Worker's Compensation or similar benefits from more than once source for the same day or part day.
7.	SUPPLEMENTARY HOSPITAL BENEFITS
Your provincial hospital plan provides basic benefits for you and your family but generally limits benefits for room charges to the amount payable for ward accommodation. Insured benefits under the Company's plan for you and your covered dependents supplement the provincial plan benefit and provide payment for room charges up to semiprivate accommodation in a licensed hospital. If you or your dependents are confined on the recommendation of a medical practitioner because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, benefits will be paid as follows:
(a)	Semiprivate Accommodation - if you or your dependents are
Confined in a semiprivate room, the plan provides for payment of an amount equal to the difference between the normal daily room and board charges made by the hospital for semiprivate
