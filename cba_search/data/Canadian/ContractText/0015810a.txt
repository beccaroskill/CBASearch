(a)	Length of continuous service.
(b)	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern.

7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be employed as probationaty employees for a period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked).

Students hired temporarily will be paid at job class one (1). However, if a student works overtime, they will be paid time and one-half the normal rate for the job in question.
7.04	(a) (i) Plant progression lists now in operation may remain in operation, but
10
shall be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any changes to progression lists will be made in consultation with the Union.
(ii)	When plant progression lists are not in effect, permanent occupational vacancies above the beginner level will be bulletined within the department or filled by a job request system. A job request system may be put into a department if mutually agreed between the Union and Company. A department job request system will require employees to outline in writing requests for job moves. Departments utilizing job request systems will fill vacancies by selecting from amongst those who have submitted written requests for the job in question from within the department. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days ofthe expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be pested on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the appropriate local Union. With respect to vacancies so filled, the seniority date of the successful applicant shall be noted.
(iii)	However, nothing in this article shall be read or construed as preventing the Company from hiring skilled employees to fill such vacancies where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness. Before hiring an employee into a position above entry level in a department, discussions will take place with the Union President or his designate to review possible alternatives to hiring, such as training.
(iv)	For Mine Department operations, where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness to fill a vacancy, the Company will not hire skilled employees to fill such vacancies with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience if there are current employees that have on file a written request for a job move to the Mine Department in question and who have been deemed acceptable for transfer to the Mine Department in question.
The foregoing shall not apply in circumstances where the Company is opening a new mine or is required to hire fifteen (15) or more Mine employees and the efficiency of operations would be impacted if the Company did not hire skilled employees with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience. The Company shall consult with the Union prior to hiring skilled employees with less than two (2) years of underground mine experience well in advance of hiring any such individuals.
(b)	Preference shall be given to an employee according to his seniority, subject
to the requirements and efficiency of operations and the ability and skill of
11
the employee to fill the normal requirements of the job.
(c)	Successful bidding on bulletins under this clause shall be limited to three (3) per calendar year.
(d)	In the event the Company is unable to place the successful applicant in a vacancy within twenty-one (21) calendar days of being awarded a bulletin, the employee will be paid the higher of the regular hourly rate of the bulletin job or the rate of the job he is performing until he is placed in the vacancy.
7.05	The Company shall maintain seniority lists for the department. A copy of such list shall be posted every three (3) months. Two (2) copies shall also be provided to the Union.
7.06	Where a Statute of Canada so provides, an employee shall maintain and accumulate seniority during service in the Armed Forces of Canada.
7.07	Before filling vacancies in a department/section or a plant with new employees, full consideration shall be given to any qualified employees who have filed a Job Transfer Request to the department/section in which the vacancy exists.
An employee wishing such transfer shall file a Job Transfer Request with the Human Resources Department. An employee's application shall lapse one (1) year after the date of filing but may be renewed from year to year at his request. The Company shall maintain a file of such forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, a Human Resources representative shall meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
If there are no lob Transfer Requests on file from employees deemed acceptable for transfer and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before filling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.
7.08	If an employee is transferred from one section to another within the same department there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former section and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to
12
his former job. Past practice with respect to moves within plant progression lists shall remain in effect.

(ii)	by leaving a message at the home of the employee, or (iii) by mailing it to him at his last known address by registered mail. The Secretary of the Union will be advised ofthe method used to try to contact the employee and whether or notthe method was successful. Employees who, because of their seniority have been identified for layoff but at the time of layoff are entitled to or are in receipt of Workers' Compensation benefits or sick benefits under the Sick Benefit Plan, will be laid off.

use his Company seniority to apply for bulletins, transfers or progression moves.
(c)	If a staff employee has never worked in the bargaining unit, he will only be able to enter the bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. That is, he will not be able to displace a bargaining unit employee or be placed in a vacancy ifthere is notice of impending layoff. Such employee will not be able to utilize his Company seniority for the purpose of answering bulletins, progression moves or transfers for three (3) months from date of placement.

(a)	When it is necessary within a department to remove an employee covered by this Agreement from a bulletin job or progression for technological change as defined in the Canada Labour Code, he shall be assigned to the highest permanent occupation covered by this Agreement in which he has previously held the card rate or the next higher job in that progression if his seniority so dictates or, at the employee's option, to an entry level job or, at the employee's option, bump down in his present progression. All employees so affected shall be red circled. All moves will be done in consultation with the Union.
(b)	In all other cases other than technological change an affected employee, to retain a position, must first bump within his progression. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump within his section. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, then the employee will bump to another section within his department. If unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump to a position outside his department in the section or progression in which he previously held the highest card rate. It is understood that an employee, in bumping, cannot bump into a job paying a higher card rate than the one he presently holds, nor can he bump into a job he has not previously held.
(c)	If an employee is unable to retain employment by the above methed and he has the skill and ability to do a job at a higher rate, he will only then be allowed to bump up, if he so chooses.
18
8.12 An employee displaced from their job may elect "voluntary layoff'' instead of a job in another operating department or severance under Article 8.09 (h). It is understood between the parties that an employee electing "voluntary layoff'' will do so under the following terms:

Article 19
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
19.01	(i) The Company agrees that the Unions have an understandable concern over "contracting out” by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the employees.
The Company will continue to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Unions agree that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1.	The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of oporations and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
2.	The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the Presidents or their designate of the affected Unions prior to awarding
41
a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside Company property. The Company will also consult with the appropriate Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the affected Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the parties to assess whether thework was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
5.	It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date ofthis Agreement, the Unions and Senior Management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
6.	The Company agrees that no employee shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
7.	Notwithstanding any of the above, the Company agrees to have their department representatives meet with the Union on a monthly basis concerning contracting out. A significant purpose of these meetings is to have meaningful discussions on contracting out issues including but not limited to any
42
potential movement of manpower and other issues to assist in the alleviating of contracting out.
19.02	The Company will continue its present practice- of supplying free transportation to and from a Company designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.09.

Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the 30 minute portion will be paid. Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
19.03	Without restricting Management Rights as set out in Article 3 ofthis Agreement, all working conditions now established by practice and negotiation and now in effect shall remain in force insofar as they are consistent with this Agreement.

Article 23
DISCIPUNE PROCEDURE
23.01	The following procedure shall govern in all cases of discipline:
(a)	The Company shall have the right to discipline any employee for sufficient and just cause.
(b)	Employees will be advised of any discipline as soon as possible following the incident giving rise to the discipline.
(c)	When an employee is formally disciplined while at work, a steward will attend. Every reasonable effort will be made to have the attending steward be from his own jurisdiction. An opportunity will be given to the steward to discuss the circumstances surrounding the discipline with the superintendent or his representative during the discipline procedure. The employee and his Union will be made aware of any information which is being considered for use in the discipline and informed of any information which is being placed in the employee file that could be used for discipline; and
(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, there will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts. It is understood that any discipline stemming from the investigation will be solely determined by management. Every reasonable effort will be made to have this investigation completed within seven (7) calendar days. Suspensions will be administered at the end of an employee's shift whenever appropriate and possible, it being understood there are circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the workplace immediately following the incident. Except in those circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the property immediately, when a suspension is impesed the suspension will not be served, ifthe employee decides to file a grievance on the matter, until Step 2 of the grievance prooedure has been completed. Union President or designate will attend (including teleconference or videoconference) all joint investigations and may request to bring stewards for training purposes. Teleconference or videoconference ^sesions will not be recorded.
(e)	The employee and the steward in attendance will receive a written copy of the suspension slip or discharge letter. Also, the appropriate Union shall be advised promptly in writing by the Company of the reason or reasons for such suspension or discharge.
23.02	There may be situations outside of the formal discipline procedures in which an
employee may feel that he would be more comfortable with a Union Steward
present when he is called into a meeting with management. Such request for a
45
Union Steward will not be unreasonably denied. If either party feels the intent of this clause is not being followed, the parties will meet to resolve the matter.
23.03	Ifany employee feels that he has been unjustly disciplined, he shall have the right of appeal through the grievance procedure at Step 2. Such appeal must be filed in writing by the Union with the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of notification of discipline and, unless so filed, the right of appeal shall be lost.
23.04	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay poriod next preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
23.05	All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed for just cause. The Probationary Employee may grieve the dismissal under this clause. However if Management has acted in good faith in assessing the employee the grievance shall be dismissed.
23.06	Any employee with more than one (1) year’s seniority may once annually request a formal evaluation from his supervisor. In addition, once yearly an employee may request to review his departmental employee file. The written evaluation will include items such as attendance, disciplinary action, promotability and attitude to work and safety.
An employee wishing to review his departmental employee file shall make such request to his department superintendent or designate. All of the material in the file will be reviewed with the employee. If the employee disagrees with the factual nature of any material in his file and the superintendent or designate is unwilling to remove the material from the file, such employee will be entitled to write a note to the file explaining his disagreement. Such note will become part of the file.
Article 24

Every reasonable effort will be made to schedule Step 1 and 2 grievance meetings during the griever's working hours. Failing that, every reasonable effort will be made to hold the meeting immediately before or after the griever’s working hours.

The griever and/or a department representative may also be in attendance. Such meeting with the manager or hisdesignated representative shall take place within seven (7) calendar days of notification or at a time mutually agreed upon.
24.05	Step 4 -- If settlement is not made within seven (7) calendar days under Step 3, the Grievance Committee may refer the grievance to an Arbitration Board within thirty (30) calendar days after the answer in writing in Step 3 has been given, but not later.

24.06	Grievances other than a personal grievance that concern the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement may be initiated by the Union and shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this article beginning at Step 3. Also grievances on termination will begin at Step 3.
24.07	(a) Personal grievances shall be presented in writing to the department
superintendent in Step 2 in Article 24.03.
47
(b)	The department superintendent's reply to the Step 2 grievance shall be in writing.
(c)	Grievances other than personal grievances shall be presented in writing by the Grievance Committee to the appropriate manager in Article 24.06.
24.08	If it should be found inexpedient to carry out promptly the clauses of this article, due to absence of a Company official from the vicinity, a substitute may be appointed by the Company with full power to effect settlement of grievances, or the step of grievance procedure in which said official is concerned may be eliminated from the procedure.

RE: PARTNERING
The Company and the Unions are committed to a successful profitable operation founded on principles of respect and tolerance between the Unions and the Management of the Company.
Both the Company and the Unions share common objectives relating to achieving the ongoing viability of HBMS and in turn providing greater employment security and improved working life for employees. The parties recognize that change and involvement is required on the part of all levels of Management, Unions, and employees in order to achieve these objectives.

Hudbay will be safe, profitable, customer-focused and environmentally responsible. We, as individuals and organizations, are committed to:
1.	Treating everyone with dignity, demonstrating respect for individual differences and porspoctives and communicating openly and honestly.
2. Recognizing the importance ofand accepting the responsibility for effective job training, education on our processes and business, and individual development.
3.	Empowering employees at all levels of our organization to become highly involved and to significantly share in the decision making process.

RE: BANKED OVERTIME PAY
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties that during the term of the Collective Agreement, the Union and individual departments may enter into agreements to "bank" overtime pay. Any agreement reached will contain the following provisions:

LETER OF UNDERSTANDING - #8 To the Union:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments
74
will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
If an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee's request).
b)	Employee would only be required to take an unboked "regular” vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this reqard would not be considered a split).
c)	Employee would take a "special” vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6)	In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
ft was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

LONG TERM ABSENTEEISM
Employees off work on Sick Benefit and/or Workers' Compensation will cease accruing regular and special vacations on being off work for twelve (12) months. Accrual of regular and special vacations will restart once an employee has returned to work on a full time basis for a minimum of three (3) months (accrual from date of return to work).

RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB
FLEXIBI^UTY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:	.
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company's Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate.
b)	Trades - In order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
c)	Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient oporation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBMS Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one (1) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (1) representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the
82
necessary knowledge and skills required to perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1, 1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid off unless such layoffs are the result of the following:
a)	Layoffs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Layoffs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	Layoffs of any employee hired after the effective date of the collective agreement then in force.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	Layoffs due to closure, sale or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It is understood that any layoff resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterizod as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

Standby allowance will be paid to hourly employees working extended hours if the department requires such an arrangement. The allowance payable will be one-half (1/2) hour’s pay at straight time at the employee’s applicable hourly rate.
For areas which work four on/four off with 12-hour shifts and do not use a swingman, the basis for their scheduled overtime pay will be as follows:
(i)	2.3 hours at 1/2 regular rate will be paid for each 48-hour working set of shifts which are worked as scheduled.
(ii)	Employees who miss a shift(s) due to sickness or AWOL during a 48-hour set of scheduled shifts will not receive the payment outlined in (i) for that 48-hour set.
(iii)	Forthe purpose ofdetermining the payment in (i), shifts of paid leave such as vacation and bereavement leave will be considered as shifts worked.
(iv)	Payment under (i) will be prorated for shifts missed in the 48-hour set for shifts of unpaid leave- (i.e. if there is one shift of unpaid leave in the 48-hour working set, the payment would be 36 + 48 x 2.3 hours x 1/2 regular rate).

(ii)	the primary function(s) of the terminated job(s) become part of the primary function(s) of the remaining job(s), and
(iii)	as the result ofthe amalgamation less employees are required to do the work.
It is understood that if technological change were to eliminate most of a job’s duties and the remaining duties were added to another occupation, or a job were terminated and its duties spread amongst a large number ofjobs or incumbents, the special allowance would not apply.'
The special allowance will not form part of the CWS evaluation or classification but will remain a separate allowance.

RE: MINE DEPARTMENT TRAINING
Further to the 1993 negotiations, the following practices were agreed to regarding Mine
Department training:
1)	Vacancies for development miners and blasthole drillers will be bulletined within the department prior to hiring. If no qualified development miners or blasthole drillers apply, the Company will commit to training up to two (2) employees as development miners or blasthole drillers, at any one time, at each of the 777, Trout Lake and Snow Lake mines. Provided there are two (2) such trainees (two (2) development miners, two (2) blasthole drillers or one (1) ofeach) established at the mine with the vacancy (or vacancies), the Company may fill the vacancy (or vacancies) at that mine. In the event a situation arises which will cause the Company to increase its need for new development miners or blasthole drillers beyond the two (2) per mine outlined, the Union will be consulted as far in advance as possible to discuss alternatives to hiring. One potential alternative to hiring would be to recall qualified development miners or blasthole drillers from other departments or from the recall list out of seniority.
2)	If there is a requirement to bring additional employees into the mines to fill temporary vacancies created as a result of the training program, such employees will be required to return to their original department or return to layoff once the training has been completed.
3)	After completion of the training, if no permanent vacancy exists, the person trained will return to his former job.
4)	During the training period and until the person trained is placed in a permanent development miner or blasthole driller position (as applicable), he shall be paid at the rate of his former job.
5)	Anyone who receives training as a development miner or blasthole driller as outlined above will be unable to bulletin to any other position in the mine for a two (2) year peried after completion of the training.
6)	After the signing of this agrement employees who enter into a development miner or blasthole driller training program will be required to fill vacancies for development miner or blasthole driller positions respectively, either temporary or permanent, regardless of whether such vacancies are at Trout Lake, 777 or Snow Lake.
7)
Employees who receive development miner training under this^ program must be
91
prepared to qualify for all development miner jobs including drift mining and conventional raise mining.
8)	The Company shall establish selection criteria to assist with the selection process of
development miners and blasthole driller trainees.

Greetings:
As President of the United Steelworkers, Local Union 7106, I wish to welcome you to Flin Flon.
The Steelworkers are involved in many and varied activities. Information can be obtained by visiting us at our office, 86 Main Street, Flin Flon.
I would like to extend a hearty welcome to you to visit us so that we can get to know each other.
Good luck in our community.
Please find below the United Steelworkers Anti-Harassment Policy.
UNITED STEELWORKERS ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Steelworker members are entitled to a harassment free environment at all union activities, events and meetings.
There are two principles fundamental to the labour movement: human rights and solidarity. Harassment strikes at the heart of both.
Steelworkers will nottolerate nor condone behaviour that is likely to undermine the dignity or self-esteem of an individual, or which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. As Steelworkers we must speak out against harassment and stand together to protect human rights.
93
Harassment is not a joke. It is an expression of perceived power by the harasser over another person, usually for reasons over which the victim has little or no control. Prohibited grounds under Human Rights Codes across Canada can include sex, race, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, political or religious beliefs, and place of national origin.
Harassment can be defined as any action (verbal, psychological or physical) on a single or repeated basis which humiliates, insults or degrades and is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the victim of the harassment.
Harassment can include but is not limited to: unwanted comments, slurs, racist or sexist jokes, pictures or posters, bullying or intimidation, graffiti, physical contact of any kind, remarks abeut a person's appearance or personal life, unwelcome sexual advances or demands, suggestive looks or gestures.
Steelworkers take harassment complaints seriously. Complaints of harassment at Steelworkers activities will be investigated by one of our anti-harassment complaints counsellors and reported to the Canadian National Director for any necessary follow-up. A substantial complaint will result in action by the Union, which could include the removal of the harasser from the event. A letter outlining the reasons for the removal will be sent to the local union.
"We can't make people like each other. But we can, through concrete action, promote tolerance and mutual respect in our Union."
Solidarity,
Tom Davie President
