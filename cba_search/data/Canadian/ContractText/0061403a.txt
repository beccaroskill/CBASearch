If an Employee does not work the reguired 32 regular hours in a particular calendar month, then expenses incurred in that month only will not be paid.
Eligible dependents may claim expenses as well, providing that the employee has met the requirements outlined above. Eligible dependents are defined as spouse, and dependent children up to age 19 if not a student, or up to age 25 if a full-time student.
It is important to note that because we must wait until the end of the month to determine if the 32 hours have been worked by each employee, and advise the Benefits Carrier accordingly, that expenses not be submitted until the month following. In other words, eligible expenses for June should be submitted in July; July's expenses submitted in August, and so on.
