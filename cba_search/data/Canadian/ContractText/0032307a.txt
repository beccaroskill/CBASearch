29
SHOREWORKER MASTER AGREEMENT
22.03	It is the general interest of both parties to prevent the elevation of minor questions into formal grievances and, as a possible means to this end, employees are urged to raise grievances imagined or otherwise with their foreman as quickly as possible. Employees have the right to go directly to their departmental Shop Steward if they wish to do so.
22.04	The successive steps to be taken in the handling of any grievance until it is settled shall be set forth as follows:
Step One:
The employee shall notify the departmental Shop Steward of any incident which gave rise to the grievance as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the incident which gave rise to the grievance. The Shop Steward shall immediately approach the Departmental Supervisor, Plant Manager or Personnel Manager (which ever is appropriate) to resolve the grievance with or without the employee in attendance.
At this time, the shop steward may request additional time to investigate the grievance. The company will not unreasonably refuse to grant this request.
Step Two:
If the grievance remains unresolved at Step One, the departmental Shop Steward shall apprise the plant’s Chief Shop Steward of the details of the grievance, The grievance shall be placed in writing and include details of the alleged violation and reference to the pertinent section(s) of the Agreement. Upon receipt of the written grievance, a meeting shall be arranged between the Grievance Committee and Plant Management in a further attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is one that is complex in nature or involves the operation of a seniority plan, either party may request the assistance of, and where necessary, the attendance of, a representative from their respective Headquarters.	___
Step Three:
If the grievance remains unresolved, the Union may provide any additional information deemed necessary in writing to the Company. The Company shall place in writing its reasons for rejecting the grievance. When the exchange of written positions is complete, a meeting shall be arranged between representatives from Headquarters of the Union and Headquarters of the Company for a final attempt to settle the grievance. Should this meeting fail to settle the matter in dispute, step four may be invoked.
Step Four:
If the grievance remains unresolved each party shall appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to nominate a third impartial arbitrator who shall act as Chairperson of the Arbitration Committee. Failing to agree upon such an impartial arbitrator within three (3) days of their appointment, either party may request the Honourable Minister of Labour to appoint such an impartial arbitrator. In the case of a grievance or dispute involving interpretation of this Agreement, the majority decision of arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, no decision of such Arbitration Board shall change this agreement in wording or format. Where the parties mutually agree, a single arbitrator may be used.
30
SHOREWORKER MASTER AGREEMENT
22.05	Where, alter exhausting the first three steps of the grievance procedure of this agreement, a difference remains between the parties relating to callouts, seniority issues, pay issues (individual cases), leaves of absence, vacation issues, bereavement issues. the discipline of an employee (other than discharge), or any other matters the parties may mutually agree to, including any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable. The parties may appoint Mr. D. McPhillips or Mr. B. Greyell, in rotation, or a substitute agreed to by both parties, shall at the mutual request of both parties:
a)	Investigate the difference,
b)	Define the issue in the difference, and
c)	Make an order in writing, with reasons, for final and binding settlement of the dispute within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of the request, or such extension of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
d)	Notwithstanding (c), where the parties have mutually agreed before the request is submitted, the arbitrator shall make written recommendations to resolve the difference within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of request, and for those twenty (20) days time does not run in respect of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
As the process is intended to be non-legal, the parties will present their own arguments.
All presentations are to be short and concise and are to include a comprehensive opening “statement”. The parties agree to make limited use of authorities and such witnesses as are necessary during the presentation of their cases,
Prior to rendering a decision, the arbitrator may assist the parties in mediating a resolution to the grievance.
All decisions of the arbitrator are to be limited in application to that particular dispute and are without prejudice. These decisions shall have no precedential value and shall not be referred to by either party in any subsequent proceeding.
The parties shall jointly apply to the Minister of Labour for payment of remuneration and expenses of the arbitrator to be made in accordance with S. 104 of the BC Labour Code. Any remuneration and expenses not paid under that section shall be borne equally by the parties to this agreement.
If both parties agree, other matters may be referred to the troubleshooter for either recommendations on how to resolve the dispute or for resolution, depending on the particular dispute.
22.06	If, after ninety (90) calendar days of its instigation, the grievance has not been settled, either party may refer the matter to arbitration or the grievance shall be deemed abandoned. If either party decides to go to arbitration, they
must advise the other party of their nominee within ten (10) calendar days of the decision to go to arbitration or the grievance will be deemed abandoned. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent of both parties, it being
31

agreed both parties are interested in and will strive to achieve settlement of all grievances or disputes in the shortest possible time.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY STATEMENT X
The Company and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers’ Union - CAW recognize and support the right of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment, and to that end, are committed to providing a workplace free of sexual harassment and making every reasonable effort to ensure that no employee is subjected to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment shall be defined as “any unwanted sexual comments, looks, suggestions, or physical contact, directed at an employee, which creates an uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, or defensive working environment.”
The offence need not necessarily infer “compliance” as a condition of employment, or the offer and/or maintenance of some benefit in exchange for sexual favours. Sexual advances outside of normal working hours and away from the working environment may be construed as harassment where there is a critical link to employment.
This policy applies to all employees, both in and outside of the bargaining unit, recognizing that the alleged perpetrator or harasser, and the harassed, may represent any level of the organization. Harassment as defined is not limited to male-
female, but also includes female-male, male-male and female-female incidents. Harassment need not be accompanied by threats or rewards to be termed such.
Any employee who feels his or her rights under this policy have been violated is encouraged to report the incident to. his or-her supervisor either verbally or in writing. The employee may be accompanied by another person of their choice during this process if they deem this necessary. The supervisor will advise the Personnel/Human Resources Department of the complaint and all pertinent information.
The Company and the Union shall each appoint a designate to conduct a joint investigation and each designate must have experience and/or training concerning sexual harassment. The joint investigation shall be a fact-finding investigation and the designates shall submit a report, detailing their findings and recommendations, to the Personnel Human Resources Department and Union headquarters as soon as possible after receipt of the complaint. Management will take immediate action if necessary. Nevertheless management shah within thirty (30) days of receiving the report, give such orders as may be necessary.
Nothing shall preclude an employee from involving a Shop Steward outside official or a union official at any stage of the investigation.
No complainant shah be transferred to positions against his or her will.
Anyone who is found to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. The amount and form of the discipline will depend upon the circumstances of the harassment, whether the person
