ARTICLE 5 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
5.01	The grievance procedures herein provided for are among the most important matters in the successful administration of the Agreement. The Company and the Union therefore agree that the designated grievance procedure as hereinafter set forth shall serve as and constitute the sole and exclusive means to be utilized by the grievor for the prompt disposition, decision and final settlement of a grievance arising with respect to the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement and the specifically designated grievance procedure shall be strictly followed. Wherever the term “grievance procedure" is used in this Agreement it shall be considered as including the arbitration procedure.
5.02	"Grievance" shall mean a complaint or claim concerning improper discipline or discharge or a dispute with reference to the interpretation, application, administration, or alleged violation of this Agreement.
5.03	The Company shall be under no obligation to consider or process any grievances unless such grievance has been presented to the Company at Step 1 of the grievance procedure, within (5) five days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based, were known or should have been known by the grievor. However, if the Company does consider or process a grievance, which has been presented late, the Company shall not be estopped or precluded at any stage from taking the position that the grievance is late and not arbitrable.
The Company will notify the Union, as to what disciplinary action will be taken within five (5) days after the circumstances given rise to it are known or ought to have been known by the company. The employee shall remain working until the investigation is completed unless the employee is an endangerment to himself, the
7
company or co-workers. If a supervisor fails to reply to the Grievance, the Grievance will proceed to the next step.
5.04	All time limits referred to in the grievance procedure herein contained shall be deemed to mean "working days", i.e. exclusive of Saturday, Sunday or the holidays set out in Article 16 hereof.
5.05	An employee who has a complaint or a grievance will ordinarily discuss the matter with his immediate supervisor and if the matter is not resolved in that discussion he may refer the question to his steward for consideration. However, should the nature of the complaint or grievance be such that the employee prefers to refer it to his steward first, then he may do so.
STEP NO. 1
If an employee has a grievance, the grievance shall, within the five (5) days referred to in Article 5.03 hereof, be presented to his Departmental Supervisor. The employee will have his Steward or the Chief Steward, as the case may be, accompany him to see the Departmental Supervisor. The Departmental Supervisor shall give the grievor a written reply as soon as possible but not later than three (3) days after such discussion. If the Departmental Supervisor's reply is not satisfactory to the Grievor, the next step must be taken within five (5) days of the Departmental Supervisor's answer, but not thereafter.
STEP NO.2
At this step the grievance shall be reduced to writing and presented to the Plant Manager or designate, within the aforesaid five (5) days of receipt of the Departmental Supervisor's written reply, but not thereafter.
The written grievance referred to above shall identify the facts giving rise to the grievance, the section or sections of the Agreement claimed violated, the relief requested and shall be signed by the employee and counter signed by his Union.
A meeting will be held between the Steward and Chief Steward together with the Grievor involved and the Plant Manager or designate, together with other representatives of management within three (3) days of the presentation of the written grievance to the Plant Manager or designate. The Plant Manager or designate, shall give his written reply to the Chief Steward within five (5) days of such meeting. If the Plant Manager's or designates’ reply is not satisfactory to the Chief Steward, the next step must be taken within five (5) days after the delivery of the Plant Manager's or designates’ reply to the Chief Steward but not thereafter.
8
STEP NO. 3
If the grievance is not settled or withdrawn at Step 2, then the grievance will be scheduled at Step 3.
Within ten (1 O) days thereafter, a meeting will take place between the grievance committee (which may be accompanied by the Union representative) and a Management Committee. The Grievor shall be present if requested by either party. The Company shall deliver its decision in writing to the Chief Steward within ten (10) working days of such meeting.
STEP NO. 4
In the event the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the party having carriage of the grievance shall request arbitration of the grievance by giving notice in writing to the other party within sixty (60) days from delivery of the decision at Step 3 to the Chief Steward, but not thereafter.
The notice to arbitrate shall contain the name and address of the moving party's nominee to the Board.
The recipient of the notice shall within sixty (60) days advise the other party, in writing, of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. The two (2) appointees so selected shall, as soon as possible, appoint a third person who shall be a chairman. If the two (2) appointees fail to agree upon a chairman, within the time limit the Minister of Labour for Ontario shall, if requested within ten (10) days from the expiry date upon which the two (2) appointees are to appoint a chairman (but not thereafter), forthwith appoint a qualified person to be chairman.
5.06	The arbitration board shall hear and determine the matter and shall issue a decision, which shall be final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee affected by it. The decision of the majority shall be the decision of the arbitration board, but if there is no majority decision, the decision of the chairman shall govern.
5.07	The board of arbitration shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify or amend any part of this Agreement, not to adjudicate any matter not specifically assigned to it by the notice to arbitrate specified in Step 3 of Article 5.05 hereof.
5.08	Each party hereto shall bear its own costs incidental to any such arbitration proceedings. The fees and charges of the chairman of the board of arbitration shall be borne equally by the two (2) parties hereto.
9
5.09	No matter may be submitted to arbitration, which has not properly been carried through all specified previous steps of the grievance procedure within the times specified.
5.10	A grievance which has been disposed of pursuant to the grievance provisions of this Agreement shall not again be made the subject matter of a grievance. This clause shall not preclude a different grievance from being filed respecting similar but different circumstances. The Union shall have the right to withdraw the grievance at any stage of the proceedings.
5.11	A decision or settlement reached at any stage of the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto, including the complaining employee, and shall not be subject to reopening by any party except by agreement in writing. If the grievance is settled at any step of the grievance procedure both the Company management and the Union Representatives who pass on the same as provided herein shall, after ratification, sign the settlement as endorsed upon the written grievance so that no question or argument may arise as to what the settlement was. Either party shall have the right to require the attendance of the Grievor at any meeting held pursuant to the grievance procedure.
5.12	When an employee's grievance is settled by the parties or determined by a board of arbitration on the basis that the employee is entitled to be reimbursed for wages lost as a result of action on the part of the Company in violation of this Agreement, such reimbursement shall be at the employee's straight time day work hourly rate exclusive of any premiums, for such hours as the employee would have worked for the Company or for the holiday pay to which he would have been entitled if the violation had not occurred, but there shall be subtracted there from any monies the employee received during such period.
5.13	Union Policy Grievance Or Company Grievance
A Union policy grievance or a Company grievance may be submitted to the Company or the Union, as the case may be, in writing within ten (10) days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known. A meeting between the Company and the Union shall be held within five (5) days of the presentation of the written grievance and shall take place within the framework of Step 3 of Article 5.05. The Company or the Union, as the case may be, shall give its written decision within three (3) days of such meeting.
If the decision is unsatisfactory to the grieving party, the grievance must be submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) days of the delivery of such written decision and the arbitration sections of this Agreement shall be followed.
It is expressly understood that the provisions of this paragraph 5.13 may not be used by the Union to institute a grievance directly affecting an employee or
10
employees, which such employee or employees could themselves institute and the provisions of Article 5.05 hereof shall not thereby be bypassed.
ARTICLE 6 - NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
6.01	The Union undertakes and agrees that while this Agreement is in operation neither the Union nor any employee shall take part in or call or encourage any strike, picketing, sit down, slowdown, or any suspension of or stoppage of or interference with work or production which shall in any way affect the operations of the Company, nor shall there be any sympathy strikes and the Company agrees that it will not engage in any lockout during the term of this Agreement.
6.02	Any employee who participates in any of the foregoing conduct shall be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
6.03	The Union agrees that no strike vote of the employees will be taken during the term of this Agreement or during the course of negotiations with the Company for renewal or extension thereof until all of the conciliation provisions of the Ontario Labour Relations Act have been fully exhausted.

7.02	The Company agrees to deduct regular monthly union dues, special assessments uniformly and non-uniformly levied in accordance with the Constitution and By-laws of the Union, upon written notification from the Union.

8.02	The Company agrees to permit the Union to post notices of meetings and legitimate Union business but not political matters on bulletin boards in four (4) locations as designated and mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Company for such purposes. These will be separate bulletin boards for Union purposes only. The Company will provide the Union glass covered bulletin boards with locks and keys.
ARTICLE 9 - SENIORITY
9.01	An employee will be considered a probationary employee until he has been employed by the Company for ninety (90) calendar days. During such probationary period he will have no seniority rights but once seniority is acquired it will be regarded as having started from the date upon such probationary period commenced. During the probationary period, the Employer shall have the right to discharge a probationary employee with or without written just cause. Such discharge shall not be subject to the terms of the grievance procedure.
9.02	The Company will furnish the Union with a seniority list of all union employees. Such list will show the employee's seniority and the department in which the employee holds such seniority. The seniority list shall be revised once every two (2) months and a copy supplied to the Union.
9.03	In case of job posting in work force the following factors will be considered:
(a)	Seniority;
(b)	Reliability;
(c)	Capability.
If (b) and (c) are reasonable the senior employee will be given the opportunity to qualify for the job as outlined in Article 9.08 (c), (d), or (e).
13
9.04	An employee shall lose all seniority and service rights if:
(a)	an employee voluntarily quits;
(b)	an employee is discharged for cause and is not reinstated under the provisions of the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement;
(c)	a person on layoff fails to return to work within ten (10) days after the Company’s notice of recall is sent by registered mail or telegram to the last address of the person shown on the Company’s records, or if the person within two (2) working days after such notice of recall is received fails to notify the Company of his intention to return to work;
(d)	an employee is laid off for a period in excess of two (2) years;
(e)	if an employee absents himself from work for three (3) consecutive working days without a justifiable reason.
(f)	if an employee fails to return to work promptly after the expiration of any leave granted to him unless he is excused by the Company.
9.05	The appointment or selection of employees for supervisory positions, full-time Union positions or for any position which is not subject to the provisions of this Agreement is not covered by this Agreement. If any employee on the seniority list is so transferred or appointed and later, within ninety (90) days for supervisory positions and one (1) year for a full time Union position of the Company or the employee’s request, is transferred back to the position which is governed by this Agreement then he shall be credited with seniority based upon his total length of service with the Company from the date on which he was last hired. A vacated position will be posted on the 31st day. If the employee who has been transferred does not return to the bargaining unit within thirty (30) days he forfeits the right to his existing job and may only return to a job vacancy that he may be able to attain by the posting system.
9.06	Sick Leave
An employee who, because of illness or injury requiring an absence from his job for more than two (2) work days, shall upon furnishing evidence satisfactory to the Company of such illness or injury be granted a sick leave for the duration of the period of his disability due to such sickness or injury except that at the end of twelve (12) months in the case of an employee with less than three (3) years’ seniority, or twenty-four (24) months in the case of an employee with three (3) years or more seniority, of continuous absence because of such illness or injury the employee's employment and seniority may be terminated. The employee shall furnish supplementary medical evidence of disability from time to time as
14
required by the Company. Failure to furnish such evidence of disability as required will result in the termination of the employee's employment and seniority. Before any employee on sick leave may return to work he must present a doctor's certificate stating that he has recovered sufficiently both physically and mentally, to be able to return to his regular job classification or other available work and perform such job in accordance with the Company's quality and production standards. The Company reserves the right to have any employee examined by a Company physician in connection with sick leave.
9.07	It shall be the duty of the employee or laid off person to notify the Company promptly, in writing, of any change of address. If an employee or laid off person should fail to do this, the Company will not be responsible for failure of a notice to reach him and any notice sent by the Company by registered mail to the address which appears on the Company's personnel records.
When an employee is notified that he is being laid off he shall, at that time, attend at the Company’s office and ensure that the Company’s records correctly set out his address and telephone number.
9.08	(a) The Company agrees to give seniority employees five (5) working days
notice of lay-off or pay for that portion of such five (5) working days for which notice is not given except in cases of machinery or equipment breakdown.
(b)	(i) Lay-off
In the event of a layoff, employees shall be laid off in the reverse order of Plant seniority, providing the senior employee has the skill and ability;
If the incumbent is removed from his position due to job elimination because of a layoff, then the Company shall place him into a vacant position and his rate of pay shall be maintained for one year. During the time of layoff, the Company will allow employees the opportunity to post into a new position, or he can return to his previous position when it becomes available;
(ii) Employees shall be recalled in order of their Plant seniority, providing the senior employee has the skill and ability.
(c)	Job Posting
All Jobs will be posted including Class 7, but Class 7 will only be posted twice to prevent the domino effect. This posting will be posted within three (3) working days for a period of three (3) working days. The job will be awarded within three (3) working days. The notice shall set out a job
15

Flexible workers are Cargill employees within the bargaining unit that work year round and may be required to fulfill vacancies such as vacation, sickness, STD, Ex STD and LTD, Leave of Absence, MAT/PAT leave and/or any other temporary staffing gaps with the business. Flexible workers will also be used based on production needs to address temporary demand increases in the business even if there is no full-time void and are exempt from the weekly guarantee. Flexible workers fulfilling vacancies may or may not actually fulfill the actual vacancy as it will depend on operational needs to skill-set requirements within the business. The number of flexible workers shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the number of full-time workers on any given work day or week.
1.	Flexible workers will only receive the benefits required by employment standards. Flexible workers are eligible for the ninety dollars ($90.00) for boot allowance paid based on receipt once per year to those with at least 500 hours of service in the previous year as of January 1.
2.	Flexible workers start at the same start rate as a full-time probationary employee and after sixty-five (65) shifts will go to a fixed base rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour.
3.	Flexible workers will be paid a premium of $0.50 per hour for every class worked above Class 7 providing they work a minimum of two (2) hours at a time in that Class.
4.	The base rate increases for Flexible workers will match with the negotiated general pay increase throughout the duration of the contract.
5.	Once a Flexible worker has worked sixty-five (65) shifts, they may sign full-time postings.
6.	If a Flexible worker is awarded a full-time job, his or her seniority (start date) is adjusted to reflect the time spent as a Flexible worker based on the hours worked as a Flexible worker.
