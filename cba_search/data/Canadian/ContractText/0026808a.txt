15.01
15.02
15.03
When layoff of more then one (1) hour but less then one (IfQH shift occurs within Skill Grades I or II the most junior employee in the skill grade where the layoff occurs will be laid off. The employee laid off may elect to go home or bump the most junior employee in the other skill grade who has less seniority if he has the skill and the ability to perform the job.
In case bumping affects raw boning (which falls within skill Grade II or portioning of meat Skill Grade I),jhe employee bumping must have passed the necessary skill test application to either raw-boning or portioning of meat as the case may be within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the layoff.

15.04	(i) Layoffs shall be based upon the following factors:
(a)	seniority; and
(b)	skill and efficiency
Where the qualifications in factor (b) are relatively equal, seniority shall govern.
Bumping may occur in only the following circumstances: an employee who has completed the probationary period and who is faced with the loss of his normal job as a result of the permanent elimination of the operation he normally performs, may, where skill and efficiency are relatively equal displace the most junior employee in an equal rate skill grade if available, or, if not available, then in the next lower skill grade level.

(c)	when absent on vacation or on plant holidays;
(d)	when actually at work for the Company.

(e)	fails to return to work upon the termination of an authorized leave of absence unless a reason acceptable to the Company is given; and
(f)	accepts gainful employment while on a leave of absence without first obtaining the consent of the company in writing.
In the event that an employee covered by this Agreement should be promoted to a supervisory or confidential position beyond the scope of this Agreement, and is later placed in a position within the scope of this Agreement, he shall retain the seniority previously acquired and shall have added thereto the seniority accumulated while serving in such supervisory or confidential capacity up to a maximum of six (6) months.
It shall be the duty of each employee to notify the Company promptly of any change in address. If an employee fails to do this, the Company will not be responsible for failure of a notice to reach such employee.
