-	On approved leave of absence (other than disability leave of absence). The Company pays the entire premiums for 30 days from the date the leave commenced, and the employee pays the entire premiums for the duration of his leave (maximum of 11 months).

2)	Subject to Article 6.10, for Christmas, Boxing and New Year’s Day, the Company will poil the employees involved to determine the numbers that are willing to work. Where practical, other employees will be utilized and crews reduced in order to accommodate those who do not wish to work cn those days.
124

Employees will indicate whether they are available to be on call during their days off by listing their names and phone numbers on the callboard.

5)	It is also agreed and understood that excessive overtime costs incurred by the Company will
125
be just cause for cancellation of the compressed work week schedules.
6)	It is further agreed that the 10-hour and 12-hour day compressed workweek schedules should provide benefits for the Company and the employees.At the same time it also recognized that the Ten-Hour Day or Twelve-Hour Day should not increase costs or be used by employees to gain financially.
7)	It is also agreed that the various modifications to relevant articles within this collective agreement for the purpose cf accommodating the 10-hour or 12-hour day compressed work week schedules are subject to modification or amendment should the parties recognize that some of the changes are not desirable and should be modified or dropped and that other clauses may require modification.
8)	The Company, Employees and the Union agree to cooperate fully in the successful implementation and operation of the compressed workweek schedules. However, the parties also agree that either the Company or the Union may terminate the compressed work week schedules within seven days notice if it is believed to be unsatisfactory to either party.
126
9)	The parties further understand that the Company reserves the right to schedule all of its employees on an eight-hour day schedule whenever it is deemed that an emergency exists.
10)	For employees on twelve-hour shifts, the traditional lunch and/or coffee breaks will be substituted and three breaks of 20-minutes each will be permitted at approximately three-hour intervals. These may be deferred or rescheduled in order to comply with emergency or urgent operational needs.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN
POTASH CORPORATION OF SASKATCHEWAN, INC., CORY DIVISION AND
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, C.L.C., LOCAL 7458
This letter of intent is designed for the purpose of reaffirming the basic principles of the Cooperative Wage Study Program (referred to as C.W.S.). This re-affirmation is necessary because of recent trends within the workforce that employees feel that C.W.S. is to be used as a detailedjob description used to determine one’s day-to-dayjob duties.
The following principles are statements cited from the Job Description and Classification Manual published in August 1971 by the United Steelworkers of America - AFL - CIO CLC:
a) Significant details concerning the function and requirements of each job shall be set forth in a job description, which shall:
Provide a means of identifying the job under consideration, the processes, equipment, and products with which it is concerned, and shall
139
serve only as a basis from which to classify the job.
Reflect the general details considered necessary to describe the principal functions of the job identified and shall not be construed as a detailed description of all the work requirements that may be inherent in the job.
Provide, together with the reasons for the classification, the basis from which to judge changes in thejob content which may result from new or changed conditions when such are established from time to time.
b) The job classification of ajob shall serve only to assign the job into a proper job class for application of the standard hourly wage scale.
In summary, these principles outlined are designed solely for the purposes of determining wage rates and not to provide any basis for determining the day-to-day job activities of any individual employee. Referring to the term “inherent” as outlined on the bottom of each job description, this term is defined as: Job duties that have been common to a particular job prior to the implementation of C.W.S., whether they were specifically addressed in the job description or not, shall continue to be part of that particular job.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN
POTASH CORPORATION OF SASKATCHEWAN, INC., CORY DIVISION AND
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, C.L.C., LOCAL 7458
This Letter of Agreement outlines the basis and procedures for evaluating candidates for Apprenticeships at PCS Potash - Cory. Pursuant to exhibit 8, senior bidders for Apprenticeship vacancies will be evaluated utilizing an aptitude test battery to assess their potential for successful completion of an Apprenticeship Program.
1,	The evaluations will be performed by SIAST -Kelsey Campus or other education consulting service agreed upon by the Company and Union.
2,	All employees who take part in the evaluation must sign a release allowing the institution conducting the evaluation to release information to the Company and the Union. The only information to be released to the Company and the Union is whether or not the employee is deemed to have the potential required to successfully complete the Apprenticeship
156
program. This information will only be required at the time an employee is the senior bidder on the apprenticeship posting.
3.	All employees who participate in this process will be given a breakdown of their evaluation in a confidential follow-up interview conducted by those responsible for the evaluation.
4.	An employee deemed not to have the potential for the Apprenticeship Program will be advised what he/she can do in order to meet the required criteria. Subsequent testing will not be considered unless satisfactory proof is supplied to the Company and the Education Consultant to demonstrate the employee has taken the necessary steps, as identified by the Educational Consultant, to warrant a re-evaluation.
5.	The Company plans to offer the Education Consulting Service evaluation on site in advance to senior employees. The Company will endeavour to offer these evaluations on an employee’s day shift and they will not lose any paid time. If a qualified bidder is senior on a posted apprenticeship bid, and has not yet been evaluated, the Company will schedule that employee an opportunity to be tested on their own time as soon as possible.
157
6.	The Company will be responsible for the cost of the Education Consulting Service. Other costs, such as time (outside the scheduled on site testing) and travel costs, will be the responsibility of the employee.
This Agreement will expire on April 30, 2005, or until a new Agreement is signed.
