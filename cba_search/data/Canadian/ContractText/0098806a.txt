ATTENTION: Mr. Dennis Byers
RE: Letter of Understanding-Absentee Incentive Program
This Is pursuant to the 1991 Collective Agreement
negotiations and is subject to the agreement of the principals of each of the parties.
The Absentee Incentive Program was put into effect on July 1,1990 on a trial basis for one (1) year. If the Company finds at the end of the year we have not reduced out absences it will be discontinued. We also reserve the right to discontinue the program at any time.
The only acceptable reasons for any absence is time off paid for by the Company such as vacation, statutory holidays, bereavement leave and jury duty.
It is also agreed that employee attendance at the mass monthly union meeting will not constitute an absence in regard to our Absentee Incentive Program.
Yours truly,
Inter-forest Ltd.
Sidney Krull
Director, Human Resources
