During this training period, the operators shall be paid their hourly rate. It is the operators’ responsibility to apply themselves, and to make every effort to achieve quota and the Union will co-operate in this regard. If after the new rates have been in effect for a period of thirty (30) calendar days any operator questions the fairness of a time value, she/he may request a review of the time standard in question, and the Union may call upon the Union Time Study Engineer to examine the standard in dispute.
The Company shall be notified of the name and qualifications of such Time Study Engineer. He shall be accompanied during his studies by one of the Company’s Industrial Engineers. The motion and time study analysis summaries for the time standards in dispute will be made accessible to the Union Time Study Engineer on the Company’s premises.
In the eventthat the parties cannot agree upon a time standard within thirty (30) days after the review, the employee may thereafter file a grievance with the Plant Manager, If no such grievance has been received within a further thirty (30) day period, then the standard shall be deemed final and shall be accepted by both parties.
