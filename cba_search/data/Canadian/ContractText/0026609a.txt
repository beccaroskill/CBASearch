ARTICLE 5 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
5.01	The grievance procedures herein provided for are among the most important matters in the successful administration of the Agreement. The Company and the Union therefore agree that the designated grievance procedure as hereinafter set forth shall serve as and constitute the sole and exclusive means to be utilized by the griever for the prompt disposition, decision and final settlement of a grievance arising with respect to the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement and the specifically designated grievance procedure shall be strictly followed. Wherever the term "grievance procedure'' is used in this Agreement it shall be considered as including the arbitration procedure.
5.02	"Grievance" shall mean a complaint or claim concerning improper discipline or discharge or a dispute with reference to the interpretation, application, administration, or alleged violation of this Agreement.
5.03	The Company shall be under no obligation to consider or process any grievances unless such grievance has been presented to the Company at Step 1 of the grievance procedure, within (5) five days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based, were known or should have been known by the griever. However, if the Company does consider or process a grievance, which has been presented late, the Company shall not be estopped or precluded at any stage from taking the position that the grievance is late and not arbitrable.
The Company will notify the Union, as to what disciplinary action will be taken within five (5) days after the circumstances given rise to it are known or ought to have been known by the company. The employee shall remain working until the investigation is completed unless the employee is an endangerment to himself, the company or co-workers. If a supervisor fails to reply to the Grievance, the Grievance will proceed to the next step.
5.04	All time limits referred to in the grievance procedure herein contained shall be
deemed to mean "working days", i.e. exclusive of Saturday, Sunday or the holidays set out in Article 16 hereof.
5.05	An employee who has a complaint or a grievance will ordinarily discuss the matter with his immediate supervisor and if the matter is not resolved in that discussion he may refer the question to his steward for consideration. However, should the nature of the complaint or grievance be such that the employee prefers to refer it to his steward first, then he may do so.
STEP NO. 1
If an employee has a grievance, the grievance shall, within the five (5) days referred to in Article 5.03 hereof, be presented to his departmental supervisor. The employee will have his steward or the Chief Steward, as the case may be, accompany him to
5
see the departmental supervisor. The departmental supervisor shall give the griever a written reply as soon as possible but not later than three (3) days after such discussion. If the departmental supervisor's reply is not satisfactory to the griever, the next step must be taken within five (5) days of the departmental supervisor's answer, but not thereafter.
STEPNO.2
At this step the grievance shall be reduced to writing and presented to the Plant Manager or designate, within the aforesaid five (5) days of receipt of the departmental supervisor's written reply, but not thereafter.
The written grievance referred to above shall identify the facts giving rise to the grievance, the section or sections of the Agreement claimed violated, the relief requested and shall be signed by the employee and counter signed by his Union.
A meeting will be held between the Steward and Chief Steward together with the griever involved and the Plant Manager or designate, together with other representatives of management within three (3) days of the presentation of the written grievance to the Plant Manager or designate. The Plant Manager or designate, shall give his written reply to the Chief Steward within five (5) days of such meeting. If the Plant Manager's or designate's reply is not satisfactory to the Chief Steward, the next step must be taken within five (5) days after the delivery of the Plant Manager's or designate's reply to the Chief Steward but not thereafter.
STEPNO. 3
At this step, the Union shall within the aforesaid five (5) days, notify the President or designate in writing of its desire to appeal the decision of the Plant Manager or designate to Step 3,
Within ten (10) days thereafter, a meeting will take place between the grievance committee (which may be accompanied by the Union representative) and a management committee. The griever shall be present if requested by either party. The Company shall deliver its decision in writing to the Chief Steward within ten (1 0) working days of such meeting.
STEPNO. 4
In the event the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the party having carriage of the grievance shall request arbitration of the grievance by giving notice in writing to the other party within ten (10) days from delivery ofthe decision at Step 3 to the Chief Steward, but not thereafter.
6
5.06
5.07
5.08
5.09
5.10
If a request for arbitration is not so given within such ten (10) day period, the decision at Step 3 shall be final and binding upon both parties to this Agreement and upon any employee involved.
The notice to arbitrate shall contain the name and address of the moving party's nominee to the Board.
The recipient of the notice shall within ten (10) days advise the other party, in writing, of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. The two (2) appointees so selected shall, as soon as possible, appoint a third person who shall be a chairman. If the two (2) appointees fail to agree upon a chairman, within the time limit the Minister of Labour for Ontario shall, if requested within ten (10) days from the expiry date upon which the two (2) appointees are to appoint a chairman (but not thereafter), forthwith appoint a qualified person to be chairman.
The arbitration board shall hear and determine the matter and shall issue a decision, which shall be final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee affected by it. The decision of the majority shall be the decision of the arbitration board, but if there is no majority decision, the decision of the chairman shall govern.
The board of arbitration shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify or amend any part of this Agreement, not to adjudicate any matter not specifically assigned to it by the notice to arbitrate specified in Step 3 of Article 5.05 hereof.
Each party hereto shall bear its own costs incidental to any such arbitration proceedings. The fees and charges of the chairman of the board of arbitration shall be borne equally by the two (2) parties hereto.
The time limits and other procedural requirements set out in this Article 5 are mandatory and not merely directory. Therefore, failure to put a grievance in writing at the proper step in accordance with the requirements hereof shall be deemed a complete waiver and abandonment of the grievance by the griever. Any grievance not appealed from one (1) step of the grievance procedure to the next within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be abandoned. No matter may be submitted to arbitration, which has not properly been carried through all specified previous steps of the grievance procedure within the times specified.
A grievance which has been disposed of pursuant to the grievance provisions of this Agreement shall not again be made the subject matter of a grievance. This clause shall not preclude a different grievance from being filed respecting similar but different circumstances. The Union shall have the right to withdraw the grievance at any stage of the proceedings.
7
5.12
5.13
ARTICLE 6 6.01
A decision or settlement reached at any stage of the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto, including the complaining employee, and shall not be subject to reopening by any party except by agreement in writing. If the grievance is settled at any step of the grievance procedure both the company management and the union representatives who pass on the same as provided herein shall, after ratification, sign the settlement as endorsed upon the written grievance so that no question or argument may arise as to what the settlement was. Either party shall have the right to require the attendance of the griever at any meeting held pursuant to the grievance procedure.
When an employee's grievance is settled by the parties or determined by a board of arbitration on the basis that the employee is entitled to be reimbursed for wages lost as a result of action on the part of the company in violation of this Agreement, such reimbursement shall be at the employee's straight time day work hourly rate exclusive of any premiums, for such hours as the employee would have worked for the company or for the holiday pay to which he would have been entitled if the violation had not occurred, but there shall be subtracted there from any monies the employee received during such period.
Union Policy Grievance Or Company Grievance
A Union policy grievance or a Company grievance may be submitted to the Company or the Union, as the case may be, in writing within ten (10) days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known.

The Company or the Union, as the case may be, shall give its written decision within three (3) days of such meeting.
