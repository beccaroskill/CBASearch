September 13, 1994 Dear Ross Stryvoke;
Forest Renewal BC (FRBC) has approved the expenditure of approximately $52 million during 1994/95, Those funds are divided between the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks (MELP) and the Ministry of Forests (MoF) with a split of $20 million and $30 million respectively. Contracts are awarded according to criteria established by these agencies. Forest Companies can obtain information from MoF district offices.
The Forest Sector Strategy Committee reviewed the proposed spending program and was advised by FRBC that it was our intention that, where possible, tenure holders should complete this work. We have also stated this intention to MELP and MoF. In addition, we advised both groups that we expect tenure holders to use their own employees and/or regular contractors where possible, and companies from outside the area would agree to hire locally when not possible. These preferences are for 1994/95 work and FRBC will develop criteria for future work with the understanding that the promotion of community stability is a major concern.
In addition, the issue of employment adjustment is one which FRBC will be addressing.
In order to accomplish our goals as they will be determined by our Board of Directors, we will require input from a variety of industry stakeholders, labour/management. Therefore I propose we plan on meeting at the conclusion of your negotiations.
Sincerely,
“ROGERSTANYER"
Roger Stanyer Chief Executive Officer
