LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #9 BETWEEN
ELKVIEW COAL CORPORATION (the Company)
AND
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA LOCAL 9346 (the Union)
The purpose of this letter of understanding is to acknowledge the discussion we had at the bargaining table regarding Article 1.04 of the Collective Agreement. The company recognizes the Union's concerns on this matter and is prepared to address this issue at the workplace.
The Union brought several examples forward regarding certain supervisors performing work that goes beyond what the parties discussed at the collective bargaining table. Both parties understand the necessity of having language in the Collective Agreement that gives supervisors the flexibility to assist bargaining unit employees for short periods of time. It is also understood that supervisors may perform certain tasks normally done by bargaining unit employees when it is necessary to ensure work is being done safely and production is not interfered with.
The Company recognizes that certain supervisors and shop stewards may have a difficult time understanding the limitations of this language. To this end, we commit to joint discussions with all of our supervisors and shop stewards with the intent of giving everyone a clear understanding of what the language means. The Company is committed to making this process work as the flexibility provided under Article 1.04 is cornerstone to our ongoing success.
The parties will review this issue during our Joint Labour Management meetings with the intent of resolving problems as they occur. If the Union notes any specific problems in the workplace, they will communicate this immediately to the Company for investigation and resolve. This
76
is intended to include shop stewards and their res, .dve supervisors having ongoing discussions of any concerns that arise on a day to day basis.
On each anniversary date of this Agreement, the parties will meet with the specific intent of discussing the progress as related to the specific problems of Article 1.04. If the parties conclude the problem has not been addressed, the Company commits to discuss and agree to an alternative means of resolving this matter.

Such alternatives may include but are not limited to the following:
1.	the hiring of special assignment employees which will be over and above the limits established in Letter of Understanding#13;
2.	utilizing summer students as per Letter of Understanding #12;
3.	the temporary transfer of employees from other crews or other departments.
If no practical alternatives can be found, any vacation time allotted to other employees on the crew may by canceled
78
to facilitate the legislated leave. It B understood V. the Company will meet with the Union before any such vacation is canceled to discuss the particular situation.

OVERTIME BANKING
Banked time is established to allow employees the opportunity to take time off without loss of pay. It is available to those employees who have completed their probationary period.
Employees working overtime may elect, at the time the overtime is worked, to bank the overtime instead of receiving payment.
Overtime hours worked will be banked at the applicable overtime rate (ie. two (2) hours overtime worked at one and one-half (1 1/2) times = three (3) hours banked at straight time).
Only overtime worked over and above your normal work schedule, overtime worked on a Statutory Holiday, or overtime which is paid at overtime rates under 8.05 (a), may be banked. (Training hours, all hours described in Articles 8.08 (a) i), 8.08 (b) and 8.10 cannot be banked).
Employees may accumulate a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours straight time at any given time.
Employees may take a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours banked time off in any calendar year. Banked time off may be broken into blocks of hours at a time, provided it is mutually agreed to between the parties. Accrued banked overtime hours may be carried over into the next calendar year, but the maximum of forty-eight (48) hours banked time off in any calendar year applies.
80
If the scheduling of banked time off conflicts witn the scheduling of vacation, vacation requests received priorto February 15 will be given preference.
Preference for banked time off will be determined on the basis of department seniority of those employees whose applications for banked time off are received by February 15th in each year. Banked time off requests received after February 15th will be allocated, based on the dates they are received, on a first received, first scheduled basis.
The Company will grant banked time off at times most preferable to employees, provided that such requests do not unreasonably interfere with the requirements of operations.
An employee may request one (1) pay-out of banked time per calendar year.
All banked time will be paid out upon termination.
Hours will be banked at the employee's base hourly rate and hours will be paid out at the rate they were banked. Any rate overrides associated with working in a higher classification associated with the overtime hours banked will be paid in the pay period earned.
