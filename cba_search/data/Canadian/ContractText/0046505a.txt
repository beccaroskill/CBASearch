NOTES APPLICABLE TO JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
1.	Employees in any job classification will perform any jobs or duties to which they may be assigned. Each “job classification” may include a wide variety of different jobs, tasks and duties, some of which may cross job classification lines. Maintenance, housekeeping and lubrication duties may be required of any employee. Employees who either perform maintenance duties or assist in performing maintenance duties will be paid at the rate of their own regularjob classification. There is no contractual obligation for establishing light duty job classifications.
2.	There are no minimum crew or job manning requirements. The Company has the sole right to determine the number of employees in any job classification as well as the right to determine crew size in the plant or any portion thereof, provided there is no violation of the Canada Labour Code. Classified jobs may be filled, vacated or permanently discontinued at the Company’s discretion.
3.	If employees within the bargaining unit do not possess the necessary skills to fill a vacancy, the Company may fill such vacancy by hiring from outside.
4.	Non-employee, contract labour may be used to supplement the Company’s workforce.

Leadman Rates
ocCtion 4.02
In the event the Company selects an hourly-paid employee to act as a working Leadman in addition to his regular duties, his hourly rate of pay shall be 800 higher than his classified rate. The Leadman rate shall be paid only for those hours during which the employee performs the Leadman function. He may simultaneously perform both his regular duties and his Leadman duties.
Section 4.03	Shift Differentials
A - 2nd or 3rd Shifts - A shift differential is paid in addition to an employee’s regular straight time hourly rate if he is scheduled and working on either the 2nd or 3rd shift. The 2nd shift differential is 500 per hour. The 3rd shift differential is 600 per hour.
Note IA: If an employee is scheduled on a 2nd or 3rd shift and is involved in a continuous work period requiring him to work on more than one shift, then the shift on which he has been scheduled establishes the shift differential, if any, for all hours worked during the continuous work period. An employee who is scheduled on the day or 1st shift does not qualify for shift differential pay even though he works on the 2nd or 3rd shifts. Shift differentials are not applicable to call-ins or call-backs unless such an assignment continues on into the employee’s regularly scheduled 2nd or 3rd shift. If an employee is on a regular schedule which requires him to overlap 2 shifts, then the shift on which he is scheduled the greatest number of hours determines the shift differential, if any. Should he be scheduled an equal number of hours on 2 shifts, then the higher shift differential will apply.
Note 2A: Shift differentials are not added to an employee’s base rate for purposes of computing overtime or for any unworked hours for which the employee is paid such as holidays, jury duty and funeral leave.
B- Two Rotating 12-Hour Shifts-A shift differential is paid in addition to an employee’s regular straight time hourly rate if he is scheduled and working on either of 2 rotating 12-hour shifts. Such shift differential is 450 per hour.
Section 4,04	Pates Of Pay - Temporary Transfers.
A - If an employee is temporarily transferred for Company convenience to a lower-rated job classification, he will continue to receive the rate of pay for his regular job classification.
B- If an employee is temporarily transferred by the Company to a higher-ratedjob classification, he will receive the higher rate of pay for all hours worked that day provided he works on the upgradedjob for 4 hours or more. This provision applies only when the employee is specifically assigned to fill a temporary vacancy created by the absence of an employee from work. However, it does not apply to employees who may relieve for breaks or who may be supplementing the workforce performing various tasks or jobs performed by employees in other job classifications.
•5'
section 4.05	Permanent Transfers
An employee who is permanently transferred to a lower-rated job classification will receive the lower rate at the time he begins work in the lower-rated job. If he is permanently transferred to a higher-rated job classification, he will receive the rate of the higher-rated job after he has completed his training and trial period and can satisfactorily perform the duties of the job with no more supervision than is required by other employees on the same job.
Section 4.06	Temporary Vacancies
To provide for flexible and efficient operations, temporary vacancies which the Company determines are necessary to fill may be filled with any employee by temporary transfer or through the overtime provisions of this collective Agreement.
Section 4.07	Creation Of New Job Classification
A - If the Company creates a newjob classification, the Company will establish a rate for such classification and, if requested by the Union, shall after no more than 120 days of job experience, negotiate with the Union a permanent rate for such classification. If a new job classification is created, the Company will notify the International Union Representative in writing of such creation.
B - Such negotiated rate will be retroactive to the date that the job was established. If the negotiation of such rate reaches an impasse, there shall be no arbitration of such wage rate. In the event of such impasse, the rate negotiation will be deferred to the next regular negotiation of the contract and the provision of retroactivity shall be as provided in this Section.
ARTICLE V	HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 5,01	Intent And No Pyramiding
This Article is intended to set forth the normal hours of work and to provide a basis for computing overtime and premium pay, and shall not be construed as a guarantee or limitation on overtime hours or on hours of work per day or per week, nor shall anything in this Agreement be so construed as to permit the pyramiding or duplicating of overtime or premium payments. Hours for which overtime or premium payments are made shall not be used to compute overtime or premium pay for any other hours.
