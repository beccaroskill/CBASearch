LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Union Local 612	April 2, 1991
CBRT & GW	Date
Dear Sirs:
Reference:	Article 13.07 - Overtime Distribution
This will confirm the Agreement reached during negotiations that, when the Company deems it necessary to perform work on overtime within a Department, the following basic procedure will be used.
(a)	Overtime opportunities will be first offered to employees in the job classification who normally perform the work on the shift required to work, commencing with the employee who has on record the least amount of overtime credits. An employee shall be recorded on the overtime list within his .job classification as having worked the overtime when he has worked the overtime; when he is absent from work on his shift when overtime would have been offered to him; when he has been offered voluntary- overtime and declines; when he is absent and, as a result of his absence, overtime is required, except when he is on vacation; and when the Company is unable to contact the employee after reasonable attempts to do so.
(b)	After all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response by employees from within the job classification are exhausted, overtime opportunities will be offered to employees outside the job classification. Overtime
worked by an employee outside his job classification shall be recorded with the overtime credits on the overtime list as having worked within his job classification. If such an employee declines an overtime opportunity outside his job classification, no overtime credits will be recorded.
(c)	If the balance of overtime hours among employees who
normally share overtime work is not properly maintained because of an improper allocation and a grievance is filed, and as a result, an employee is found not to have had his fair share of overtime, the off-balance condition shall be identified and preference given to the aggrieved employee over the other employees involved as soon as is reasonably possible until a fair balance in the overtime distribution is re-established.
(d)	The Company agrees to post overtime lists showing
overtime credits of employees, These lists will be
revised each week and total credits shall be carried forward from week to week during the calendar year.
(e)	Overtime credits will be recorded on the overtime list
as follows:	For example, eight (8) hours worked at time
and one half will be recorded as twelve (12) credits and eight (8) hours worked at double time will be recorded as sixteen (16) credits.
(f)	An employee who is transferred from one job
classification to another .job classification through a job posting, will, upon transfer, be credited with the average	of	the	overtime credits in the	job
classification within the departmental shift to which he is transferred, except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(g)	Aa employee who is absent from work for one week or
more, except when he is on vacation, will upon return to work, be credited with the average of the overtime credits	in	the	.job classification within	the
departmental shift to which he returns except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(h)	An employee on temporary transfer under Article 10.16 (b) shall be considered in his regular job classification for the purpose of overtime distribution.
This letter of understanding shall remain in effect for the life of this Agreement unless changed by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
