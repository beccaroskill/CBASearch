■ 13 -
(9.5)	Rates - Changes in Method of Production
Where changes in method of production or new jobs are introduced, the Company will determine the new rates of pay and classification after the staff has gained experience on the new method or job. This review will be completed within six (6) working weeks of the agreement to conduct said review. New rates of pay established will be effective the date an acceptable degree of proficiency is attained by the worker. If a lower rate of pay has been established, the employee shall retain his rate of pay until the next contractual wage increase (or until he transfers to another job) at which time the adjustment will be made.
If a new or changed rate of pay is in dispute, a qualified Industrial Engineer, who is a member of the Association, shall review the process by which the rate of pay was set in accordance with the established procedure agreed to by both parties for determining rates of pay.
Should the rate of pay for a new or changed job remain in dispute after all relevant factors used in the determination of the rate of pay have been examined, it may be introduced as a grievance entered at the third step of the grievance procedure.

(9.8)	Work Measurement and Job Standards
The following procedures will apply during all work studies performed by Company and Association representatives.
a)	Only qualified full time employees with appropriate skills and ability will be studied for the purpose of establishing permanent work standards. Whenever possible, this will be an employee(s) who normally performs the work.
b)	A reasonable number of cycles and a majority of the total will be taken during a work study in order to ensure that all elements of the job(s) are included and to improve statistical accuracy.
c)	Stan and stop times will be recorded along with the name of the individual studied.
d)	All strike-outs on a time study must have a recorded reason.
(9.9)	Job Standards Disputes

If after the fair and just trial period, the Association is still not satisfied that an average qualified worker, working conscientiously can maintain a performance of 100%, a re-check study will be made by the
15
Company when requested.

The individual affected may exercise his/her seniority rights, to bump downward, to junior seniority positions. The only purpose of the bumping procedure is for job security. If bumping applies it will be after the 20 day notice.
Job Elimination
A job elimination occurs in the following circumstances:
-the job is permanently transferred to a different shift
- the work required to be performed is discontinued
NOTE:	A job is not eliminated by reason of the start
time changing within the same shift. (Shift meaning days=3 a m.-I 1:59 a m., afternoons=1 2:00 noon-6:59 p m., nightshift=7:00 p.m.-2:59 a m.
Job Combination Procedure
A job combination occurs when two (2) jobs or more on the same shift are combined, and in such case the employee(s) with the least seniority will be bumped.
The bumped employee(s) will proceed through the bumping procedure under job elimination.
Bumping Procedure
28
1)	The employee must fill any job vacancy in the Plant that has not been filled under Article 18. If the job vacancy is on a diff erent shift, the employee may displace the most junior employee on his shift, in his department. If he is unable to perform the vacant job or the job of the most junior employee, he may displace the second least senior employee on his shift and so on until he reaches a job he can perform consistent with his seniority rights in his department. This paragraph will also apply to the bumped employee.
2)	The junior employee bumped in his department, will have the option of bumping the junior employee on his shift in the Plant. If he is unable to perform this job, he can move up the seniority list as described in item #1.
3)	The employee bumped off his shift plant wide will have the option of bumping in his department on the remaining shifts. If unable to bump in his department will bump plant wide on the remaining shifts. Shift preference will be at the employees option, if the elected shift has a vacancy, must be filled before a bump occurs. If unable to perform this job he can move up the seniority list as described in item #1.
4)	When a number of employees are displaced due to job elimination, the corresponding number of least senior jobs in the department and/or plant, whichever is applicable, will be identified and the most senior of the displaced employees can choose the job he wants. In the event that two or more of the same job classifications are identified within this group of least senior jobs, the junior man in the job classification will be the first to be displaced. This process will continue in order of
- 29 -
seniority until all employees are assigned job ownership. If one of the displaced employees is unable to perform the job to which his seniority entitles him, he may move up the seniority list until he reaches a job he can perform consistent with his own seniority rights.
5)	If the employee is unable to bump in accordance with the above steps, he/she will be laid off.
6)	An employee whose job was eliminated or the bumped employee will have recall rights to his department and/or job if that job is reinstated as follows: twelve (12) months if the employee has less than fifteen (15) months seniority; twenty-four (24) months seniority from the date of displacement if additional full time staff is required as determined by the Human Resources Manager following discussion with the S.E.A. President or his delegate. Recall shall be by seniority.
7)	Employees who do not have plant seniority can exercise their seniority rights in accordance with steps 1,2 and 3.
8)	When a Maintenance job is permanently transferred or eliminated, the employee has the option of applying for the job. If the employee does not apply for the job, he will bump the most junior employee within his job ownership. The employee who is bumped off their job ownership, will have the right to bump the most junior employee whose job he qualifies for, within the Maintenance department.
The employee bumped out of the Maintenance department, will proceed to step #1 of the procedure.
NOTE - The Company and the Chief Steward and/or delegate plus the department steward will mutually
- 30 ■
determine if any employee is able to perform any job to which his seniority entitles him. Any disagreements regarding an employee's ability to perform a job may be entered as a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
Job Transfers
i)	When a job is transferred to another department, the employee who has job ownership has the option of moving with the job. If the employee elects not to follow the job, the following procedure will apply:
ii)	A) If no employee volunteers to move with the
job to the new department, the job will be posted in accordance with the job posting procedures.
B) The employee who had job ownership and who elected not to move with the job, will exercise his seniority rights and follow the bumping procedure as described in Article 16.3.
(16.4)	S.E.A. Stewards
For the purpose of vacations and lay-off only, stewards of the Association shall, for the term of their stewardship, be granted top seniority on their respective shifts, and will remain on their shift during the lay-off.
The Company will provide up to six (6) working days per year for the purpose of furthering the formal education of the Association Stewards. The educational days utilized shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the S.E.A. Additional educational days, at the expense of the Association, may be taken when the dates are mutually agreed upon in advance.
- 31 -
(16.5)	Absence Due to Accident or Illness
An employee with seniority, absent due to accident or illness, shall continue to accumulate seniority and to be credited with service. An employee will have job ownership protection for two (2) years.
An employee who will be unable to return to work within the two (2) year limit will forfeit job ownership after it has been concluded by the Committee not to extend the time limit. This review will be done no later than the last month prior to the expiration of the two (2) year limit.
When an employee returns to work in less than the two (2) years, and medical information indicates he will be unable to perform the regular duties of his job, he will be temporarily assigned within his department or Plant to a job he can perform until such time as a job vacancy becomes available that he can perform. This employee will then apply for the job vacancy under Article 18 or whichever is applicable.
Where the employee provides medical information that indicates he is unable to perform the regular duties of his job within the two (2) years, he may voluntarily relinquish job ownership and be assigned to best advantage.
A Committee of four (4) equal in numbers between the Association and the Company will deal with the process of extending the two (2) year limit and assigning such employees to modified work. If the employee is in disagreement with the decision of the Committee, he may appeal this decision to the Committee, provided such appeal is filed within seven (7) working days.
An employee may enter a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure if the Committee fails to reach an agreement on extending the time limits.

Leave of Absence for reasons other than emergency, compassionate grounds, S.E.A. business or pregnancy may be granted subject to the requirements of business and other reasons at the discretion of management to an employee who has completed two years of service.
Applications for Leaves of Absence under this clause will normally only be considered for the months of October to June, inclusive. Weeks which include or precede or immediately follow a Statutory Holiday usually require our entire work force, therefore, Leaves of Absence will normally not be granted during those periods. Leaves of Absence under this clause will normally not exceed three weeks.
When planning activities for which a Leave of Absence is anticipated, employees are expected to make maximum use of vacation schedules to which they are entitled. Employees are expected to exercise discretion in judgement when submitting requests for Leave of Absence. Absences should be planned as far in advance as possible.
Management's decision in granting or refusing such leave will not be arbitrable. In the event that absence is granted under the provisions of this article seniority shall continue to accumulate.
