OF THE SECOND PART
ARTICLE 1 - SCOPE AND RECOGNITION
1.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all of its employees at Port Hope, Ontario, save and except foremen, supervisors, persons above the rank of foreman or supervisor, office staff, clerical staff, sales staff, students, security guards, full-time first aid staff, part-time temporary persons employed for not more than twenty-four (24) hours per week.
1.02	The Company agrees that in the event it decides to transfer all or a major part of its manufacturing operations from the Port Hope plant to another plant, which results in the permanent layoff of full-time employees it will meet with the Union within fifteen (15) working days of that announcement. Any permanent Port Hope TEXTRON Automotive Interiors employee laid-off as a result of the transfer of work to any other TEXTRON facility which might be established within the Durham or Northumberland Counties will be offered work within that new facility. Any such job offer would be subject to qualifications for the available job.
4
ARTICLE 2 - RELATIONSHIP
2.01	The Company and the Union agree that there will be no discrimination,
interference, restraint or coercion exercised or practised by the Company or the Union, or by any of their representatives, with respect to membership or nonmembership in the Union. The Union agrees that no Union member will conduct Union activities on the premises of the Company except as specifically permitted by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3 - RESERVATION OF MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3.01	Except as, and to the extent specifically modified by this Agreement,
all rights and prerogatives which the Company had prior to the execution of this Agreement are retained by the Company and remain exclusively and without limitation within the rights of the Company and its management. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company's rights shall include:
a)	the right: to maintain order, discipline and efficiency; to make, alter, and enforce, from time to time, reasonable rules and regulations, policies and practices, to be obeyed by its employees; to discipline and discharge employees for just cause. In the event the Union disputes the reasonableness of such rules and regulations, the Union shall have the right to file a policy grievance in respect hereof pursuant to the provisions of Article 7.11 of this Agreement. Such grievances shall specify the rule or rules being disputed.
b)	the right: to select, hire and control the working force and employees; to transfer, assign, promote, demote, classify, lay-off, recall, suspend and retire employees pursuant to the provisions of any pension plan; to plan, direct and control operations; to designate, establish, revise or discontinue departments; to select and retain employees for positions excluded from the bargaining unit and to transfer employees into the bargaining unit.
5
c)	the right to determine: the location and extent of its operations and their commencement, expansion, curtailment, or discontinuance, the direction of the working forces; the products to be manufactured; the standards of production; the subcontracting of work; the schedules of work and of production; the number of shifts; the methods; processes and means of performing work; job content and requirements; quality and quantity standards; the qualifications of employees; the use of improved methods, machinery and equipment; whether there shall be overtime work and who shall perform such work, the number of employees needed by the Company at any time and how many shall operate or work on any job, operation, machine or production line; the administration of the Company's pay system; which jobs shall be incentive jobs and which jobs shall not; the number of hours to be worked, starting and quitting time, and generally, the right to manage the enterprise and its business without interference are solely and exclusively the right of the Company.
d)	Supervisors and other excluded personnel will not perform work which supplants any other production, maintenance or warehouse employee except for purposes of instruction, inspection or in cases of emergency.
e)	The Company may from time to time appoint an employee to act as a "Group Leader".
Group Leader is not a separate classification as such and persons appointed as Group Leaders are expected to perform their regular duties.
A Group Leader shall guide, aid and instruct a designated group of employees and will be responsible for coordinating the work of the group and for the quality and quantity of their work.
Group Leader appointments shall not be subject to the provision of Article 8.08 of this Collective Agreement. An employee designated as a Group Leader, will be paid, while serving as a Group Leader, fifty cents (.50) per
6
hour more than the job rate of the highest classification held by anyone in the group he/she is leading. The fifty cents (.50) per hour premium will not be subject to overtime or shift premiums.
Group Leaders do not have any disciplinary responsibilities and may not enter any dispute between the Company and any of its employees.
ARTICLE 4 - CHECK-OFF OF UNION DUES
4.01	The Company and the Union agree that all present employees, transferred employees, and new employees must as a condition of employment have their regular monthly Union dues deducted in accordance with the Constitution of the Union and as determined by the Local Union No. 889 for the life of this Agreement. Such deductions shall be in respect of regular monthly Union dues only including first month's dues, and shall not apply to any levies or special assessments.
The Company agrees to meet with the Union between January 1 and July 1, 2000, for the purpose of implementing the United Steelworkers’ union dues structure. As part of the new dues structure, the Company will make provisions for weekly dues deductions.
4.02	The amount to be deducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.01 hereof shall be in an amount provided by the Union Constitution. The Company shall remit the dues as aforesaid not later than the tenth day of each month following the month of such deduction to a designated Union officer. The Company will supply the Union with a list of the employees from whom deductions were made.
4.03	The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless against all claims, demands and expenses, should any person at any time contend or claim that the Company has acted wrongfully or illegally in making such deductions.
7
ARTICLE 5 - NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
5.01	The Union undertakes and agrees that while this Agreement is in operation neither the Union nor any employee shall take part in or call or encourage or support or condone any strike, picketing, sitdown, slowdown, or any suspension of or stoppage of or impeding of or curtailment of or interference with work or production, which shall in any way affect the operations of the Company, nor shall there be any sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts and the Company agrees that it will not engage in any lockout during the term of this Agreement.
5.02	Any employee who participates in any of the foregoing conduct shall be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. Such employee may have recourse to the grievance procedure and a board of arbitration shall have jurisdiction to determine if the grievor did, in fact, improperly participate in the foregoing conduct. If the arbitration board determines that the grievor did, in fact, improperly participate in the foregoing conduct, the board of arbitration shall not have jurisdiction to interfere with such discipline or discharge.
ARTICLE 6 - REPRESENTATION
6.01	Bargaining Committee
The Company acknowledges the right of the Union to appoint or otherwise select from the Union membership in the Company's Port Hope, Ontario plant, a Bargaining Committee comprised of not more than four (4) seniority employees in good standing of the Company. The Local Union President shall be Chairman thereof. The Company will recognize the Bargaining Committee for the purpose of handling any grievance or discussing a matter properly arising during the continuance of this Agreement. Wherever in this Agreement the term "committee" is used, it shall be deemed to mean "Bargaining Committee."
8
The Company agrees to recognize eight (8) stewards, who shall be seniority employees.
When there are fifty (50) or more employees on the night shift, the Union shall be entitled to an additional steward on that shift.
When there are more than five hundred (500) employees in the Bargaining Unit, the Union shall be entitled to two (2) additional stewards and when there are more than seven hundred and fifty (750) employees in the Bargaining Unit, the Union shall be entitled to one (1) additional steward.
The Company agrees to recognize one (1) additional steward as a Chief Steward.
The bargaining committee shall have the option of being placed on day shift throughout the life of the agreement providing:
a)	There is productive work to be done within their qualifications and ability.
b)	Such option is exercised within two weeks of ratification or a new bargaining committee member taking office.
c)	That a bargaining committee member returns to their home shift upon leaving office.
6.02	Not more than two (2) International Representatives of the Union may be present and participate in any meeting of the Bargaining Committee and the Company. The Company will not be required to meet a total of more than four (4) Union representatives at any time in addition to an International Representative of the Union.
6.03	One (1) member of the Bargaining Committee will be permitted to leave his work and unit when notified by his supervisor that he has been summoned for the purpose of handling grievances. A member of the Bargaining Committee
9
will be permitted to leave his work and unit when notified by his supervisor that there will be a meeting with representatives of the Company. A Shift Steward may be permitted to leave his work when he has been notified by his supervisor for the purpose of handling a grievance at the first or second step of the grievance procedure. Such employee shall report to his supervisor upon his return to work. Time away from work for the purpose herein specified shall not on the aggregate exceed three (3) hours per week for any one individual.
6.04	A Committeeman or Shift Steward required under the grievance procedure to enter another unit must inform the supervisor of that unit which he enters of the reason for his presence. Committeemen or Shift Stewards, as the case may be, shall expeditiously attend to the grievance so that no unnecessary loss of time or interference with production will result therefrom.
6.05	The Union recognizes and agrees that members of the Bargaining Committee and Shift Stewards have their regular duties to perform in connection with their employment. The Company will compensate such Committeemen and Shift Stewards for time spent at the plant during their regular working hours in handling grievances of employees pursuant to the grievance procedure at their regular straight time base hourly rate of pay, provided this privilege is not abused by the Committeemen or Shift Stewards. Committeemen or Shift Stewards will not be compensated for time spent prior to or beyond their regular working hours on Union business unless at the request of the Company.
6.06	Notwithstanding anything otherwise contained in this Agreement, the Company may delay or defer permission to a Steward, Committeeman, or other Union official who wishes to leave his work pursuant to the provisions hereof, if such leaving would interfere with the efficient operation of the Plant.
6.07	The Union agrees to supply the Company with the names of Committeemen and Shift Stewards and to keep such list up to date at all times and the Company shall not be obliged to recognize such personnel until it has been so informed.
10
6.08	The employees shall be represented by stewards upon their shift as set out in Article 6.01 hereof, not more than two (2) of whom shall be from any single department with fewer than thirty (30) employees per shift.
For the purposes of this Article, areas of coverage, by stewards will be mutually agreed upon by the parties during January of each calendar year.
Exceptions to the above due to transfers, reassignments, shift changes and layoffs may be mutually agreed upon by the parties as the need arises.
6.09	For the purpose of this Agreement, the Bargaining Committee and the stewards, together with the officers of the Local Union, shall be deemed to be officials of the Union. The parties hereto agree that the Union officials occupy positions of leadership and responsibility to see that this Agreement is faithfully carried out.
6.10	The Company will recognize a bargaining unit employee, who has received training in time study methods, as an observer in cases where a work standard becomes the subject of a grievance. The observer shall have the right to be present during a review of work method, time study and calculations necessary to check the general standard.
11
ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.01	The grievance procedures herein provided for are among the most important matters in the successful administration of this Agreement. The Company and the Union therefore agree that the designated grievance procedure as hereinafter set forth shall serve as and constitute the sole and exclusive means to be utilized by the grievor for the prompt disposition, decision and final settlement of a grievance arising in respect of the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement, and the specifically designated grievance procedure shall be strictly followed. Wherever the term "grievance procedure" is used in this Agreement it shall be considered as including the arbitration procedure.
7.02	"Grievance" shall mean a complaint or claim concerning improper discipline or discharge, or a dispute with reference to the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement.
7.03	The Company shall be under no obligation to consider or process any grievance unless such grievance has been presented to the Company in writing at Step 1 of the grievance procedure within five (5) working days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known by the grievor. However, if the Company does consider or process a grievance which has been presented late, the Company shall not be estopped or precluded at any stage of the grievance procedure from taking the position that the grievance is late and not arbitrable.
7.04	All time limits referred to in the grievance procedure herein contained shall be deemed to mean "working days", ie., exclusive of Saturday, Sunday or the holidays set out in Article 12 hereof.
7.05	No employee or group of employees shall have a grievance until they have discussed their complaint with their immediate supervisor. If the employee wishes, he/they may be accompanied by their steward. If the immediate supervisor does not promptly settle the matter to the employees’ satisfaction an employees’ proper grievance shall be processed as follows:
12
STEP No. 1
If an(y) employee(s) have a grievance the grievance shall, within the five (5) working days referred to in Article 7.03, be reduced to writing and presented to the Shift Coordinator. The steward will present the written grievance to his Shift Coordinator. The Shift Coordinator shall give the grievor(s) a written reply as soon as possible but not later than five (5) days after such discussion. If the Shift Coordinator's reply is not satisfactory to the grievor(s), the next step must be taken within five (5) days of the Shift Coordinator's answer, but not thereafter.
The written grievance referred to above shall identify: the facts giving rise to the grievance; the section or sections of the Agreement claimed to be violated; the relief requested; and shall be signed by the employee(s) and countersigned by their steward.
STEP No. 2
At this step the written grievance shall be presented to the Manager concerned within the aforesaid five (5) days of receipt of the Shift Coordinator's written reply, but not thereafter.
A meeting will be held weekly for each shift between a Member of the Bargaining Committee together with the steward involved, and the Manager concerned together with other representatives of management. This meeting will be held at a mutually agreeable time and location and shall address all grievances referred from Step 1 of the grievance procedure and shall provide responses to all grievances addressed in the previous weekly Step 2 meeting.
If such Manager's reply is not satisfactory to the member of the bargaining committee the next step shall be taken within five (5) days after the delivery of such Manager's reply to the member of the bargaining committee, but not thereafter.
STEP No. 3
13
At this step, the Union shall, within the aforesaid five (5) days, notify the General Manager in writing of its desire to appeal the decision of the Manager concerned at Step No. 2. Shortly thereafter, a meeting will take place between the Bargaining Committee (which may be accompanied by the International Representative of the Union) and the General Manager and any other representatives of management. The grievor shall be required to be present at the request of either party. The Company shall deliver its decision in writing to the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee within ten (10) working days of such meeting.
STEP No. 4
In the event the grievance is not settled at Step No. 3, the party having carriage of the grievance shall request arbitration of the grievance by giving notice in writing to the other party within thirty-five (35) days from delivery of the decision at Step No. 3 to the Chairman of the Bargaining Committee, but not thereafter.
If a request for arbitration is not so given within such thirty-five (35) day period, the decision at Step 3 shall be final and binding upon both parties to this Agreement, and upon any employee involved. The notice to arbitrate shall contain the name and address of the moving party's nominee to the Board and shall also specify all of the outstanding issues of the written grievance to be dealt with by the Board and the remedy sought. The party giving such notice shall be bound by the same and shall be restricted at arbitration to the issues presented by the notice.
The recipient of the notice shall within five (5) days advise the other party, in writing, of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board.
The two appointees so selected shall, within five (5) days of the appointment of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be chairman. If the recipient of the notice fails to appoint an arbitrator, or if the two appointees fail to agree upon a chairman, within the time limited, the Minister of Labour for Ontario shall, if requested within the five (5) days from expiry of the date upon which the two appointees are to appoint a chairman (but not hereafter), forthwith appoint a qualified person to be chairman.
14
7.06	The arbitration board shall hear and determine the matter and shall issue a decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee affected by it. The decision of the majority shall be the decision of the arbitration board, but if there is no majority decision, the decision of the chairman shall govern.
7.07	The Board of Arbitration shall not be authorized to make any decision inconsistent with provisions of this Agreement, nor to alter, modify or amend any part of this Agreement, nor to adjudicate any matter not specifically assigned to it by the notice to arbitrate in Step. No. 4 of Article 7.05 hereof.
7.08	Each party hereto shall bear its own costs of and incidental to any such arbitration proceedings. The fees and charges of the chairman of the board of arbitration shall be borne equally by the two parties hereto.
7.09	The time limits and other procedural requirements set out in this Article 7 are mandatory and not merely directory, and no matter may be submitted to arbitration which has not properly been carried through all specified previous steps of the grievance procedure within the times specified. The parties recognize that in some departments and on some shifts "immediate supervisor" and "Shift Coordinator" shall be the same person, and the grievance shall be filed with such person after being discussed with him as a complaint, pursuant to the provisions hereof. The provisions of this clause shall not be considered to have been waived by the parties or either of them unless they expressly provide a waiver thereof in writing, signed by both parties.
7.10	A decision or settlement reached at any stage of the grievance procedure shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto, including the complaining employee, and shall not be subject to reopening by any party except by agreement in writing. If the grievance is settled at any step of the grievance procedure, both the Company management and the Union representatives who pass on the same as provided herein shall sign the settlement as endorsed upon the written grievance, so that no question or argument may arise as to what the
15
settlement was. Either party shall have the right to require the attendance of the grievor at any meeting held pursuant to Steps 1, 2, or 3 of the grievance procedure.
When an employee's grievance is settled by the parties or determined by the board of arbitration on the basis that the employee is entitled to be reimbursed for wages lost as a result of action on the part of the Company in violation of this Agreement, such reimbursement shall be retroactive to the date of the presentation of the grievance to the Company in writing. Such reimbursement shall be at the employee's regular straight time earnings for such hours as the employee would have worked for the Company if the violation had not occurred, but there shall be subtracted therefrom any monies the employee received during such period and any Unemployment Insurance benefits received by the employee during such period.
7.11	Union Policy Grievance or Company Grievance
A Union policy grievance or a Company grievance may be submitted to the Company or the Union, as the case may be, in writing, within seven (7) days from the time the circumstances upon which the grievance is based were known or should have been known by the grievor. A meeting between the Company and the Union shall be held within five (5) days of the presentation of the written grievance and shall take place within the framework of Step No. 3 of Article 7.05. The Company or the Union, as the case may be, shall give its written decision within three (3) days of such meeting.
If the decision is unsatisfactory to the grieving party, the grievance may be submitted to arbitration within thirty-five (35) days of the delivery of such written decision and the arbitration sections of this Agreement shall be followed.
It is expressly understood that the provisions of this paragraph 7.11 may not be used by the Union to institute a grievance directly affecting an employee or employees which such employee or employees could themselves institute, and the provisions of Article 7.05 hereof shall not thereby be bypassed.
7.12	(a) DISCHARGE CASES
16
A claim by a seniority employee that he has been discharged without just cause shall be treated as a grievance and shall commence at Step No. 3 of Article 7.05 provided a written grievance signed by the employee and his Department Steward or Bargaining Committee is presented to the General Manager within five (5) days after the discharge. The International Representative of the Union will be permitted to attend the meeting held pursuant thereto, with the General Manager. The Union will not question the discharge of any probationary employee nor shall such discharge be the subject of a grievance unless such discharge was for unjust cause.
A seniority employee who is discharged while on the Company premises shall have the right to confer with his steward for up to fifteen (15) minutes, in a place designated by the Company, before leaving the Plant.
7.12	(b) Should the parties agree or should the grievor satisfy the arbitration board that an employee has been discharged without just cause, such employee shall be reinstated as an employee without loss of seniority and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7.10 hereof.
ARTICLE 8 - SENIORITY
8.01	An employee will be considered a probationary employee until he has been employed by the Company for sixty (60) calendar days within a twelve (12) month consecutive period. During his probationary period he will have no seniority rights but when such rights are acquired, seniority will be regarded as having started from the date sixty (60) days immediately prior to acquiring such seniority. The employee shall carry such seniority in his unit.
8.02	The Company will post seniority lists once every six (6) months and such list shall show the employee's seniority and unit in which the employee holds such seniority. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, seniority shall be by
17
unit and plant-wide. The Company shall furnish the Union with a copy of the seniority list.
8.03	For the purpose of applying the seniority provisions of this
Agreement, which seniority provisions shall be applied only to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, the present units are as follows:
Unit No. 1
Unit No. 2 Unit No. 3
Unit No. 4
Production operations including Labour Grade 99s, Compounders, Shell/Foam/Injection/Brown Technicians, and Paint Technicians
Warehouse and Production Drivers Maintenance Mechanic/Millwright, Maintenance Fabricator, Industrial Instrument Electrician, Refrigeration/Air Conditioning Mechanic, Tooling Mechanics,
Modular Tooling Specialists, Mould Repair, Mould Maker, Apprentices
Colour, Physical/Chemical, Development, Foam/Shell, Auditors, Process Verifier
New product lines or changes in existing product lines may require additions to or changes in the foregoing unit structure. The Company will notify the Union of any such additions or changes. Should the Union, after being so notified, wish to discuss any such additions or changes, the Company will meet with the Union and explain or otherwise discuss the additions or changes.
8.04	A seniority employee who is transferred to another unit by seniority on
an indefinite lay-off (ie. lay-off for a period longer than a temporary lay-off as defined herein), or on recall therefrom, shall lose seniority in his former unit (ie. in which he held unit seniority) after thirty (30) days worked and attain seniority in the new unit, after thirty (30) days worked in the new unit. During such thirty day period he shall continue to accumulate seniority in his former unit and when he attains seniority in the new unit he shall be credited with the seniority which he had in his former unit. However, if such employee's former job re-opens within such
18
thirty days in the new unit the employee shall return to his former job. An employee shall hold seniority in only one (1) unit at any one time.
A seniority employee who has held a job classification for a period of 30 days or longer, and who is reclassified due to a work shortage to a lower rated job classification, shall have the right to return to the job from which he was displaced provided that such job reopens within a period of 60 days.
In the event that the original job does not become available within 60 days then the job will become the subject to the job posting procedure as described in Article 8.08.
8.05	The selection of employees for supervisory positions or for any position not subject to the conditions of this Agreement is not covered by this Agreement. A non-bargaining unit person with less than one (1) year of service in a salaried position who is transferred to a position within the bargaining unit shall be credited with seniority equal to his full accumulated service with the Company excluding the time worked outside the bargaining unit. Upon such transfer into the bargaining unit, the employee shall exercise his seniority to bump the least senior employee in the bargaining unit. Should such job not be available the employee shall exercise his seniority under the provision of Article 8.07. Employees with more than one (1) year of service in a salaried position shall not be transferred back into the bargaining unit.
8.06	In filling permanent job vacancies (except those in respect of positions excluded from the bargaining unit) and in cases of decrease or increase of the working force, the following factors shall be considered.
a)	length of seniority;
b)	experience, efficiency and qualifications;
c)	ability to perform the essential duties of the job and reliability.
Where the qualifications in factors (b) and (c) are relatively equal in the judgement of the Company, factor (a) shall govern.
19
Where educational requirements are specified they shall be interpreted to mean either actual academic qualification or proven and demonstrated ability to perform work requiring similar qualifications.
8.07	When there is to be a lay-off in a unit the junior employees in the
classification affected shall be subject to be laid-off provided the remaining employees are, in the judgement of the Company, of relatively equal skill, competency, efficiency and qualifications. The Company will furnish the Union with a list of those employees who are to be laid-off and will discuss the list with the Union prior to notifying the individual employees affected by the lay-off.
An employee so subject to lay-off will be assigned by the Company to work being performed by another employee with less seniority in the plant, subject always to the provisions of Article 8.06 hereof.
i)	an employee shall have the option of being placed in a job within his own classification on his own shift, provided such a job exists and is held by another employee with less seniority, or if no such job exists,
ii)	the employee will be placed in a job within his own classification but on another shift, provided such job exists and is held by another employee with less seniority. If no such job exists, then,
iii)	the employee will be placed in a lower-rated job, held by a less senior employee, which he formerly held for a period of at least thirty (30) days. Such assignments will be made whenever possible to provide the employee with the least wage loss practicable. If no job exists,
iv)	the employee will be placed in a labour grade 99 position, held by a less senior employee.
v)	an employee transferred to labour grade 99 under the provision of Article 8.06 and 8.07 will transfer at the step achieved in his prior classification.
20
Within one year from date of transfer, the employee must attain the skill level commensurate with the step transferred to, or drop to the step that equates to the skill level achieved.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the employee shall not use his seniority to be assigned to a higher labour grade than his current labour grade.
Wherever used in this Agreement, the word "qualified" or the like, shall mean presently possessed of the accomplishments which enable the person to perform the work required in accordance with the Company's quality and production standards so that the person performs such work after being given general information concerning it, but does not require a trial period or a training period.
In administering Article 8.06 and the foregoing paragraphs of Article 8.07 hereof, the following will apply:
a)	"promotion" shall be defined as a permanent transfer to a classification carrying a higher rate of pay than the employee's rate or a classification which carries a higher range of rates than the range of rates in the employee's classification.
b)	Time spent on lay-off will not count towards qualifying for incremental wage increases.
c)	In all cases of temporary layoff (ie. up to two hundred and forty (240) full regular working hours) seniority need not be considered. No employee may be laid off under this provision for more than a total of two hundred and forty (240) working hours during the life of this agreement. No employee may be laid off under this provision for more than a total of one hundred and sixty (160) working hours in any calendar year. No Absentee Pool employees will be retained when permanent employees, who are on temporary layoff, are available, willing, and qualified to do the work.
21
d)	In the event that a vacancy exists at the time of reduction of force the Company shall have the right to assign an employee affected by such a reduction of force to such vacancy, provided he is qualified to perform the work in accordance with the Company’s quality and production standards after having being trained to the those standards.
e)	In the case of reduction in force involving a number of employees in one (1) week, employees affected may be laid off for a period of one (1) week without regard to seniority to allow time to make reassignment on the basis of the provisions of Articles 8.06 and 8.07 hereof.
f)	When the company implements the provisions of paragraphs (c) or (e) of this Article 8.07 the Company will, upon request of the Bargaining Committee, advise the Bargaining Committee of the reasons thereof.

The Company agrees to advertise all permanent job vacancies for three (3) days. All job postings shall state openings by shift. During the posting period the Company may temporarily fill the job as it deems proper. The Company will consider applications and apply the provisions of Article 8.06 hereof. All employees interested in the job vacancy must make application within three (3) working days.
Such job posting shall apply in respect of the original vacancy and the next two (2) vacancies resulting from the filling of the original vacancy. If the bid of an employee for a particular job vacancy hereunder is accepted, such employee shall be ineligible to bid under this Article 8.08 for any job vacancy for a period of at least six (6) calendar months from the date of such successful bid and related job

transfer. An employee transferred under the provisions of this Article 8.08 who in the judgement of the Company is subsequently unable to meet the Company's standards of quality and production within the first thirty (30) days of such transfer, will be transferred back to his/her former position without loss of seniority or bidding rights.
An employee transferred under the provisions of this Article 8.08 who during the first thirty (30) days following such transfer makes request to return to his/her former position may do so. An employee electing to return to his/her former position under this provision shall forfeit any right under the job bidding procedure for six (6) months from the date of the bid closing.
The purpose of the job posting procedure is to provide employees with the opportunity to bid on jobs in a higher labour grade. In certain circumstances an employee may wish to bid on a job at the same or lower labour grade than the employee's existing job. In order to be eligible to bid on a job at the same or lower labour grade than the employee's current job, the employee must have held the current position for a period of not less than six (6) months.
The foregoing provision shall not apply to employees exercising their bidding rights under Article 8.08 for the first time, nor employees making a bid to transfer from a position to which they were appointed.
When new jobs are created or existing jobs are open the Company shall be able to fill such jobs for a period of thirty (30) days during which such jobs shall be posted. Employees working during the first thirty (30) days shall not have such time taken into consideration for qualifications.
When an employee is successful in obtaining a higher rated job through the bidding provisions of Article 8.08, he shall be placed in the job within forty-five (45) days of being awarded the position. In the event that the employee is not placed in the new job within the thirty (30) day period, he shall be paid at the rate for the new job from the thirty-first (31st) day until such time as the transfer is effective provided that the new job is still available.
23
8.09	LOSS OF SENIORITY
An employee shall lose all seniority rights and service rights if:
a)	he quits his employment;
b)	he is discharged for just cause not reversed through the grievance procedure;
c)	an employee with less than four (4) years seniority is laid off for a period in excess of one (1) year; an employee with four (4) years or more of seniority is laid off for a period in excess of two (2) years.
d)	a person on lay-off fails to return to work within five (5) working days after the Company's notice of recall is sent by registered mail or telegram to the last address of the person shown on Human Resources Office records, or, if the person within three (3) working days after such notice of recall is so sent fails to notify the Human Resources Office of his intention to return to work.
The foregoing provision may be waived by the Human Resources Manager in writing if the person furnishes reasons satisfactory to the Human Resources Manager for such failure on his part. In such cases of waiver, the person will not be permitted to displace another employee with less seniority who has been employed in the meantime, but will be rehired with seniority intact when employment for which he is qualified and for which he has the necessary seniority is available.
e)	an employee fails to return to work promptly after the expiration of any leave granted to him unless he is excused by the Human Resources Manager.
It shall be the duty of the employee or laid-off person to notify the Company office promptly, in writing, of any change of address or telephone number. If an employee or laid off person should fail to do this, the
24
Company will not be responsible for the failure of a notice to reach him and any notice sent by the Company by registered mail or telegram to the address which appears on the Company's personnel records, or telephoned to the telephone number which appears on the Company's records shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by the employee or laid off person.
8.10	PREFERENTIAL SENIORITY

If the employee is a mother planning to take both pregnancy and parental leave she must give notice to the Company’s Human Resources Department that she will be taking both leaves for a total leave time of 35 weeks. This notice must be given at least two (2) weeks before her pregnancy leave ends, or it can be given at the same time as she gives notice for pregnancy leave.
For the purpose of this clause a parent is a man or woman who:
•	is the birth parent of a child
•	adopts a child
•	becomes a step-parent
•	is in a long-lasting relationship with the parent of a child and intends to treat the child as his or her own.

leaves.
Before returning to work the employee must provide the Company with a physician’s certificate stating she is fit to perform her normal duties.
26
If the employee fails to report to work promptly after the expiration of the leave, she shall be considered as having voluntarily quit.
9.05	SICK LEAVE
Any employee who, because of illness or injury requiring an absence from his job for more than two (2) working days, shall, upon furnishing satisfactory evidence to the Company of such illness or injury, be granted a sick leave for the duration of the period of his disability due to such illness or injury, except that at the end of twelve (12) months in the case of an employee with less than four (4) years' seniority, or twenty-four (24) months in the case of an employee with four (4) years or more seniority, of continuous absence because of such illness or injury the employee's employment and seniority shall be terminated. The employee shall furnish supplementary medical evidence of disability, from time to time, as required by the Company. Failure to furnish such evidence of disability will result in the termination of the employee's employment and seniority. Before any employee on sick leave may return to work he must present a doctor's certificate stating that he has fully recovered both physically and mentally and is able to return to his regular job classification and perform such job in accordance with the Company's quality and production standards. The Company reserves the right to have any employee examined by a Company physician in connection with a sick leave.
The Company reserves the right to refuse or terminate a leave of absence under this provision if the record of the employee indicates an excessive amount of time off or recurring or repetitive time off. The determination as to what constitutes excessive, recurring or repetitive time off will be negotiated and mutually agreed upon between the Union and the Company.
For Worker's Compensation cases the maximum allowable leave of absence for seniority employees shall be forty-eight (48) months.
With respect to work-related injuries or illnesses, the parties agree that they will allow one another to review relevant files upon request.
27
9.06	Employees returning from authorized leave of absence will be returned to the same job, providing such job exists, or a comparable job with a comparable rate of pay providing such a comparable job exists for which the employee is qualified.
An employee returning to work under the provision of this Article may be placed back in the work force under the provisions of Article 8.07 if his former job does not exist.
9.07	Application for leave of absence shall be made in writing to the employee's immediate supervisor and it will then be referred for final approval in accordance with Company policy; however, no leave will be granted for a period greater than an employee's accumulated seniority and in no case, other than as specifically set out in Article 9.05 hereof, in excess of two (2) years.
9.08	If an employee overstays his leave of absence he is presumed to have severed employment with the Company unless he can give an explanation satisfactory to the Company for his inability to return to work on the expiry date of his leave of absence.

A work day shall consist of the twenty-four (24) hours from midnight to midnight.

An employee whose scheduled shift starts on or after 5:00 a.m. but before 12:30 p.m. shall be deemed to be working on the first (day) shift; an employee
30
whose scheduled shift starts on or after 12:30 p.m. but before 9:00 p.m. shall be deemed to be working on the second (afternoon) shift; and an employee whose scheduled shift starts on or after 9:00 p.m. but before 5:00 a.m. shall be deemed to be working on the third (midnight) shift.
When a third shift is scheduled, such shift shall normally be of eight (8) hours' duration.
The Company will give the Union and the employees affected as much notice as reasonably possible of any change in normal shift schedules.
Employees working on the second (afternoon) shift shall not be scheduled to work overtime on weekends with a starting time less than eight (8) hours following the completion of their regular shift.

32
completing at least four (4) hours of work the employee shall be given four (4) hours of alternate work or shall be paid sufficient to bring his earnings for the day to the equivalent of four (4) hours at his regular straight time rate. Where an employee reports for work on his regular shift and is sent home with instructions to report on a later shift, he shall be paid for two (2) hours subject to the same exceptions and conditions as set forth in this section.

10.05	When overtime is scheduled to be performed by employees in a unit the Company will endeavour as far as practicable to equitably allocate the overtime among qualified employees of the unit who presently and normally perform the major or dominant portion of the work required. However, the Company shall not be required to interrupt production lines or group operations. An employee on an individual operation or assignment will not be displaced for overtime occurring at the end of a regular shift. Employees who are absent from work for any reason shall be considered not available for the allocation of overtime and shall not be entitled to be called in.
10.06	It is not the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the Company shall be held to an obligation of equal allocation of overtime but is only intended to be a general rule for the guidance of the Company in allocating overtime. An employee who is justifiably aggrieved as a result of the Company's failure to follow this general rule shall not be entitled to money payment for overtime which has not been allocated to him in the past but shall be entitled to be allocated future overtime to restore him to a relatively equitable position with those other qualified employees in the department who presently and normally perform the operation upon which the aggrieved employee is involved.

United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 889 Attention: Bargaining Committee Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Grievance Meetings
The Company and the Union agree that from time to time, meetings between the parties, for reasons of resolution of a grievance, may extend beyond the normal working hours of the persons involved. The Company will, in attempting to schedule such meetings, endeavour to hold them at times most convenient to the employees involved and to minimize the amount of time spent outside of regular working hours. However, in cases where a meeting extends beyond the normal working hours of the participants or is held at a time other than one which falls within the employees' regular shift, no compensation will be made to the employee for such time.

Attention: Bargaining Committee
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Shift Changes
1.	The Company and the Union agree that seniority employees who wish to change shift other than as a result of bidding pursuant to Article 8.08 shall place their name on the shift transfer request list, indicating what shift they wish to transfer to. When a vacancy occurs in the same classification on the desired shift, the transfer will be effected on the basis of the employee’s seniority. If no such vacancy exists, but a vacancy exists in LG 99 on the desired shift, the most senior employee will be assigned to the job providing he has so indicated on the shift transfer request list. This procedure shall take place prior to the posting of vacancies.
2.	Employees who exercise their right to transfer on to an alternative shift forfeit the right to bid under the provisions of Article 8.08 for a period of six months from the date of transfer.
3.	If honouring a shift transfer results in an opening on the day shift only, one additional shift transfer will be honoured.
4.	The shift transfer list will be reviewed once a month for compatible moves by seniority. A compatible move is one in which two seniority employees on the shift transfer list who desire transfers to each other’s shift, change positions. To be eligible, employees must hold the same job classification and be capable of performing the essential duties of the other’s job. Up to three compatible moves may be effected during each month.
50
5.	Employees may turn down two offers to transfer before their name comes off the transfer list and are not eligible to request another transfer for six months. Employees who accept a transfer may not make another transfer request for six months.
6.	Employees who transfer shifts will be given the training on the new job specified by the QS 9000 on-the-job training schedule. Employees who fail to meet the Company’s standards for production and quality in the time specified by the training schedule will be returned to their previous shift and will have forfeited one of their offers to transfer specified in paragraph 5. If the employee was transferred as part of a compatible move, both employees affected will be returned to their previous shift.

United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 889 Attention: Bargaining Committee Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Absentee Pool Employees
The Company may utilize an Absentee Pool of temporary part-time personnel in the Labour Grade 99 classification. With the exception of the initial training/orientation period, Absentee Pool employees will be used to cover for the absences of full-time employees only.
The pool will have a maximum number of participants equal to 7 percent of the fulltime workforce. Participants will consist of:
1.	Regular full-time employees on indefinite lay-off who elect to participate in the absentee pool;
2.	Part-time employees as defined in Article 1.01.
In the event of a temporary layoff, full-time employees will be canvassed as to their availability for temporary work. Full-time employees who place their names on the temporary work list will be called in, as needed, on their requested shift providing they are qualified to perform the work available. Such employees are expected to be available for call-in during the following times: 1st shift (6-8:00 am); 2nd shift (2-4:00 pm); 3 shift (10:00 pm - 12:00 am) and report to work promptly when called. An employee’s name will be removed from the temporary work list if he/she is unavailable for work on two occasions during the duration of the layoff. No Absentee Pool employees will be utilized when permanent employees, who are on the temporary work list, are available, willing, and qualified to do the work.
For absentee coverage required on weekends, the Company will make a reasonable effort to contact full-time employees who are qualified to perform the work available. If this effort is not successful, absentee pool employees may be utilized.
57
On a weekly basis, the Union will receive an accurate list of Absentee Pool employees as well as records of hours worked each week.

Attention: Bargaining Committee
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
Re: Temporary Job Postings
This letter outlines the policy to be followed when posting a temporary job vacancy arising from an approved leave of absence, other than a personal leave.
The purpose of the policy is to provide a system that allows employees to return to the same job classification and shift following an approved leave of absence, other than a personal leave.
This policy is applicable to all seniority employees in labour grades 11-21 and labour grade 99 inspector at Textron Automotive Company, Port Hope, Ontario who are granted a leave of absence, other than a personal leave.
Procedure:
1.	The Company shall be able to fill a temporary job vacancy for a period of thirty (30) days during which time the job shall be posted. Employees working during the first thirty (30) days shall not have such time taken into consideration for qualifications.
2.	The temporary job will be posted for three (3) days. The posting will state:
a)	the fact that the job is temporary;
b)	the expected term of the position;
c)	the shift;

5.	In filling a temporary job vacancy, Article 8.06 will apply.
6.	If the employee awarded the temporary job bid holds a bid position, that job will be filled at the company’s discretion for the remainder of the leave. If the leave extends beyond six months, or if the company has knowledge that it will extend beyond six months prior to that date, those positions filled at the company’s discretion will be posted as temporary. Employees placed at the company’s discretion shall not have such time in the job taken into consideration for qualifications.
7.	All employees on temporary assignment will retain their rights to apply for permanent positions and their rights to permanent shift transfers in their permanent classification that may become available during the term of the temporary assignment.
8.	If the employee awarded a temporary job vacancy is successful in bidding on a permanent position or accepts a permanent shift transfer, the temporary job will then be filled at the company’s discretion for the remainder of the leave.
9.	At the end of the approved leave, the incumbent on leave will be placed back in the work force following the provisions of Article 9.06, providing they are able to perform the essential duties of the job. The employee awarded the temporary job bid along with all employees temporary assigned will be placed back in his/her previous classification, if the classification still exists; otherwise, the provisions of Article 8.07 apply.
10.	If the incumbent on leave quits or loses seniority while on leave, the position will be rebid as a permanent job vacancy.
11.	Employees awarded a temporary bid job shall have such time in the job taken into consideration for qualifications.
