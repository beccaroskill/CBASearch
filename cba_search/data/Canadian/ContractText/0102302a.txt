APPENDIX -B - WEEKLY INDEMNITY PLAN
AMOUNT OF DISABILITY BENEFITS:
The amount of disability benefit shall be 70% of an employee's wage up to the maximum as detailed in the Collective Agreement immediately preceding the date of disability.
DESCRIPTION OF PLAN:
The plan will be for a period of fifty-two (52) weeks payable on the first day of disability resulting from a non-occupational accident and after three (3) continuous working days from the commencement of disability due to a sickness. Where sickness causes an employee to be hospitalized, benefits will be paid from the first day of such disability. Weekly indemnity payments shall be paid every two weeks.
ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT:
In order to be eligible for weekly indemnity payments an employee must be actively employed by the Company at the onset of the disability and must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician. In cases of disability due to mental illness, certification of said illness and disability must be by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. Also the employee must notify the Company immediately of his/her disability and ensure that the proper forms are completed by his/her physician and promptly returned to the Company. Benefits under this plan shall not be paid in the event the absence is a result of;
a)	Any injury arising out of or sustained while doing any act or thing pertaining to any occupation or employment for renumeration or profit, or
b)	during normal maternity leave or,

g)	Disability for which the physician has determined that the employee can perform light work, yet the employee refuses to perform such light work.
Benefits under this plan will not be payable following the normal retirement date or early retirement date of an employee, if early retirement was approved prior to the onset of disability.
GOVERNMENT DISABILITY PLANS, INCLUDING W.C.B.
The amount of disability benefit under this plan will be reduced by the amount of primary benefits for which an employee is eligible under the disability benefits provisions of Government plans including, Canada or Quebec Pension Plans, Quebec Automobile Insurance Act or W.C.B. . The Company and/or insurer may require certification or verification of the amount of income from such Government plans.
DISPUTED W.C.B. CLAIM
If an employee covered by the W.I. Plan suffers a disability for which payment is in dispute with the W.C.B W.I. payment will be made retroactively if requested by the employee and provided he has been off work for at least one month due to disability without W.C.B. having accepted the claim and provided the employee is subject to the rules and regulations covering the W.I. plan. If the dispute is over a claim that involves a previous employer the Company will have to be satisfied that the employee is actively pursuing his W.C.B. claim to be eligible to the above.
If the W.C.B. claim is subsequently established, the employee will then repay the W.I. payment(s) received to the appropriate fund or insurance company.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
The Company and/or insurer reserves the right to require periodic physical examinations throughout the duration of the employee's absence due to disability. Such examinations shall be conducted by a physician designated by the Company and/or insurer.
