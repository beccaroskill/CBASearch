LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #9
TEMPORARY VACANCIES AND JOB QUALIFICATIONS
The following Letter of Understanding applies to the Mining Department only, unless otherwise indicated. As the Temporary Vacancy System and the Job Qualifications System represent two new systems that are being tried, and all the circumstances cannot be foreseen, both parties reserve the right to bring forward amendments at any time for discussion and review by the other party. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, the previous system of filling temporary vacancies will be reverted to.
The implementation of the points listed as Part B - Job Qualification System will be determined at a later date, once the Miner Training Committee has addressed the issues raised by the Job Qualifications System.
PART A
Temporary Vacancy System
1.	Employees will be allowed by seniority to fill temporary vacancies which cover the complete work weeks.
The Labour Group shall normally be used to fill vacancies of less than one (I) work week. For example, if there is a ten (10) day vacancy starting on the second working day, a labourer fills in during the first week, the second week is filled through the Temporary Vacancy System, and a labourer fills in for the remainder of the
•91 •
vacancy during the third week. In cases of vacancies of undetermined length, the information that is provided to Management shall be used to fill thejob.
The temporary vacancy roster for any given week will be completed by a predetermined time in the preceding week. Employees already committed on the roster will not be permitted to make changes.
The Supervisor will use labourers and/or the preferred list to fill temporary vacancies arising after that date. If the position cannot he tilled using the above procedure, the Supervisor will designate a qualified employee to fill the position(s).
2.	Employees will indicate their preference(s) in order of priority in writing for » maximum of three (3) classifications they would like to fill in for on a temporary basis. Employees can change their prefcrence(s) by advising the foreman in writing on the form provided. When an employee changes his preferenee(s), the revised form must be given to his Supervisor by Monday to be eligible for vacancies that occur one week from that Monday.
When a temporary vacancy becomes available the foreman will assign thejob by seniority tor a one (I) week period, based on the preferences that employees have indicated. The foreman will exhaust the senior employee’s tlirce (3) preferences first, before going on to the next
•92 •
senior employee’s first choice and so on.
An employee will be limited to vacancies occurring on his shift. An employee will only be assigned to a vacancy if there is a qualified replacement available on his shift to fill his position. Once an employee has been assigned to a temporary vacancy, he will not be entitled to change to another opening until the one (1) week assignment has been completed.
Note: Miscellaneous crew vacancies will be filled by qualified employees with a comparable shift schedule for the purpose of this fetter of Understanding, and will exercise their temporary job fill-in options on that shift.
Regardless of the length of the temporary vacancy, the employees will be assigned on a one (1) week basis. At the end of that period the foreman will reassign, if the vacancy continues for another full week.
Temporary vacancies of less than one (1j week will normally be filled by labourers.
This Letter of Understanding does not impact on leadhands or the employees being assigned to the surface.
The number of moves on a shift will not be limited at this time, however it will be monitored and reviewed if necessary.
3.	For vacancies involving an extensive period of absence, the parties will continue to review each case on an individual basis, and determine the
• 93*
best procedure to fill the vacancy PART B
Job Qualifications System
1.	The Job Qualification List (J.Q.L.) will be updated monthly.
The Job Qualification List will be posted in the area of the punch clock.
The Job Qualification List will include those (rained and tested, or tested by demonstrating their ability on a job classification.
It is the employee’s responsibility to report any errors in the list to the Employee Relations Superintendent.
Note: A statement of qualification will be developed for distribution to employees once qualified on cachjob. These qualifications will be registered with the Ontario Ministry of Skills Development.
2.	As of April 1. 1993. the Job Qualification List will be the only information used to fill temporary vacancies. Employees will be able to demonstrate their ability on jobs they are considered capable of performing.
Until the JOL is established, if the Company decides to train employees, where practical and with the exception of the training outlined in Article 6.02 bhfiftv (50) per cent of the employees trained will be chosen on a seniority basis.
.94.
Once an employee has completed classroom and hands on training with a posted operator, equipment will be designated for training with the purpose of allowing the employee time to refine his skills on the job. This period of time will be determined by the Miner Training Committee, but will not exceed five (5) shifts. Employees who arc displaced through this training will fall to the labour group and exercise their seniority within that group.
3.	All employees at the Mine will receive training when required to decrease the likelihood of being laid off out of seniority, for a layoff of more than five (5) days. The amount of training possible will be determined by the severity of the layoff, and will not necessarily be for the job classification the employee would prefer to be trained in. For a planned layoff of more than five (5) days, training will be done to ensure senior employees are not laid off out of seniority due to lack of qualifications. For an unplanned layoff, training will start as soon as it is known that the layoff will be more than five (5) days.
4.	By seniority all employees (in the Mining Department) will list three (3)jobs they would like to receive training for, in order of preference. Employees will be asked by seniority if they want to receive training for thej ob classifications in the order that the training becomes available. These employees will be trained when regular training is in progress. Training will continue to be on an as needed basis, depending upon budget, and requirements. (1992)

•98 •
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING# 11 PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT/RELATED LAYOFFS
The Company and Union have agreed to establish a productivity committee composed of three (3) Company and three (3) Union representatives. Further, the parties recognize that productivity improvements resulting from the work of the Productivity Committee will have the potential to reduce the number of employees required to work at the mine.
To address this concern, arid recognizing that the work of the Productivity Committee may dovetail with management initiatives, the Company agrees that no layoffs will occur as a result of any productivity related improvements which ate implemented either through the Productivity Committee, or by Management. This guarantee will apply only to those employees on the seniority list as of April 1. 1990.
Layoffs resulting from volume variation or production interruptions are excluded from this letter of understanding, and will be handled through the provisions contained in the Collective Agreement. Further, employees can still be terminated by the Company, subject to the Union’s right to grieve any dismissal.
This letter limits Article 3.01 (f) of the Collective Agreement insofar as any workforce reductions resulting from technical or process improvements must be handled through attrition rather than layoff. (1992)
•99*
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING# 12
SPECIAL EVENTS
The parties agree that, where mutually agreed to through the negotiating committee, the shift schedule of some or all employees can be altered to accommodate special events. Employees will be paid shift, underground and weekend premiums applicable to the shill that would have normally been worked. No overtime premium or call out pay will be applicable to employees whose shift is changed during the first eight hours worked on this shift, except as outlined inArticle 13.05 (a). (1990)
