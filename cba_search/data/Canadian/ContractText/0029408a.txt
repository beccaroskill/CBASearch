THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN:
Maple Leaf Consumer Foods - Lethbridge Pork
Lethbridge, Alberta
(hereinafter called “the Company”)
AND
United Food and Commercial Workers Canada Union, Local No. 401, Lethbridge, Alberta (hereinafter called “the Union”)
Recognition
The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency. The Company will not bargain collectively with any other labour organization affecting employees in the bargaining unit.
Article 1 - Purpose
The purpose of this Agreement is to maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees, consistent with its leadership values; to provide an amicable method of settling any grievances or differences which might possibly arise; to promote the mutual interests of the Employer and the employees. The Company and the employees jointly recognize the continuing need for maintaining efficient production in the packinghouse industry at all times and the necessity of rendering efficient service to the producers and consumers and realizing their mutual responsibility pledge full cooperation to that end.

Article 2 - Bargaining Unit
2.1	The bargaining unit is comprised of all the employees on the plant payroll, as distinguished from the office payroll, with the exception of:
(a)	Watchmen.
(b)	Assistant Forepersons and those above the rank of Assistant Foreperson.
(c)	Employees represented by any certified bargaining agent other than the Union.
(d)	Lead Hands.
2.2	It is generally the practice of the Company to have work within the plant performed by employees of the Company. However, because of reasons such as the availability of skilled employees, complexity of the work, the cost of equipment required to do the work in relation to its use, the scope of the work, the duration and frequency of the work, the cost to have the work performed by employees as compared to other alternatives, it may become necessary to have the work within the plant performed by outside contractors.
Where outside contractors perform work within the plant and such work represents a material change in practice creating an adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such material change in practice, the matter may be processed as a grievance under Article 4 of this Agreement. Should the grievance be referred to an Arbitration Board as provided under Article 5, the Arbitration Board will consider the reasons mentioned in the first paragraph of this article in its determination of the use by the Company of such outside contractors and
2
where the Arbitration Board determines that the use of such outside contractors does create such an adverse effect, the Company will, within a reasonable period, either discontinue the work or have it performed by employees.
The foregoing shall not apply to the cafeteria and to construction and installation work.
The Company may introduce work utilizing Company employees on a trial or test basis. If the result of such an experiment indicates that, for reasons set out in the first paragraph of this article, the work should be transferred to an outside contractor, this shall not be construed as being a change in general practice.
2.3	The Company agrees that Forepersons and those above the rank of Foreperson and, unless otherwise mutually agreed, an Assistant Foreperson, appointed to a newly created Assistant Foreperson position on or after October 28th, 1966, shall not assume duties that are normally performed by employees except where such duties are limited to occasional work, negligible in amount, but such Foreperson or Assistant Foreperson shall in no way be restricted from work which:
(a)	Is of a confidential clerical nature;
(b)	Is for the purpose of instruction, experimentation, demonstration, investigation, and replacement of an employee absent from his/her job during the day, sharpening knives or coping with an emergency. An emergency as herein contained shall not be construed as including work resulting from additional volume;
(c)	Is to overcome production difficulties caused by the absence of an employee. In such cases, the
3
Company will advise the Union as to the absence of the employee and will obtain a suitable replacement within one half (1^) day.
Article 3 - Management
The Union recognizes the sole right of the Company to manage the plant and direct the work of the employees including the right to hire, promote, demote, suspend, discharge for cause, lay-off, assign to jobs and shifts, transfer employees from department to department, increase or decrease the working forces, determine the products to be handled, processed or manufactured, the schedule of production and the methods, processes and means of production and the handling of same. The Company shall not discriminate against present and prospective employees whether or not they are members of the Union. This article shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the other provisions of this Agreement.
Article 4 - Grievance Procedure
4.1	Should any difference arise under this Agreement between the Company and the employee members of the Union, it shall be settled by the following method, each step to be taken progressively without delay unless the difference has been settled in an earlier step. All employees are encouraged to talk directly with his/her Foreperson in attempt to resolve any potential issue.
First Step
The employee and the Steward of the department shall take the question up with his/her Foreperson. In respect to any settlement effected by the employee without the Steward, the Steward may re-open the question by
4
discussing same with the employee and the Foreperson. Grievances may be submitted in writing if either party considers it necessary. If the question is not settled by the end of the next work day; then
Second Step
The Chief Steward, or his/her designated representative, both of whom shall be employees of the Company and members of the bargaining unit as defined under Article 2, with or without the Steward of the department, shall present the question in writing to the Plant Superintendent, or in his/her absence, the Company’s designated representative. If the question is not settled by the end of the next two (2) working days; then
Third Step
Within five (5) working days, the question shall be presented in writing to the Plant Management by the Grievance Committee of the Union which may be accompanied by a full-time staff member of the Union (not necessarily an employee), a decision to be rendered within five (5) working days of the date of discussion.
The wording of grievances may be changed or amended for the purpose of clarification at any time up to and including the third step of the grievance procedure.
Fourth Step
If the difference remains unresolved, then within one (1) calendar month of the date of the decision under the third step of the grievance procedure, and the grievance remaining outstanding, measures shall be taken under the procedure outlined in Article 5.
5
For the purpose of this article, the term “working days” shall not include Saturday, Sunday or any paid holiday referred to in Schedule “B”.
4.2	The Grievance Committee, comprised of regular employees of the Company who have attained seniority, shall be elected by the Union and the Company shall be kept informed of the employees on that committee. The number of employees on the Grievance Committee at the plant shall not exceed three (3).
4.3	It is understood and agreed that the time limits set out in Article 4 may be extended as agreed between the parties provided that such agreement is in writing and signed by both parties.
4.4	The employee may be present if he/she so desires in any of the steps outlined in Article 4.1. Where the grievor is on a shift differing from that in which the grievance meeting is held, he/she will be paid, along with the Grievance Committee, at his/her regular job rate for time spent with Plant Management at such grievance meeting. The Company will make every reasonable attempt to hold grievance meetings during regular working hours.
4.5	When a decision is reached under any one of the methods outlined in Article 4.1, such decision shall be final and binding and shall be retroactive to the date of the original submission in writing unless otherwise directed in such decision. If the grievance affects a rate of pay, it shall be retroactive to the date it was first submitted in writing or if the cause of such grievance arose prior thereto, then the adjustment will be made retroactively to the date the error was made or such other period as may be agreed upon.
4.6	Except as provided under the first paragraph of Article 10.1, if an employee deems he/she has been unjustly
6
suspended, unjustly discharged or unjustly laid off from the service of the Company, he/she shall submit his/her difference in writing through the Grievance Committee of the Union, within five (5) working days after date of separation, and the difference will be considered commencing at the Second Step of Article 4.1. In the event of such employee being reinstated, he/she shall be paid for the period during which he/she has not worked as if he/she had not been suspended, discharged or laid off, subject to such adjustment as the settlement may determine.
4.7	Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union as to the meaning and application of the provisions of the Agreement, the question shall be taken up commencing at the Third Step of Article 4.1.
4.8	Pending settlement of a difference as outlined in Article 1 and 7 hereof, an aggrieved employee shall perform the duties assigned to him/her by the person in charge of the department, provided, however, where such duties involve a transfer, reasonable consideration shall be given to ability and in the case of an immediate transfer, extreme changes in temperature. Where an employee has a question concerning his/her transfer and the department Steward is not available for consultation, he/she will register the question with the Foreperson. The Foreperson will arrange to have the department Steward discuss the matter with the employee within one (1) hour of such transfer.
4.9	Shop Stewards and Assistant Shop Stewards, all of whom shall be regular employees of the Company who have attained seniority, the number to be decided by negotiation between the Union and the Company, shall be elected by the Union and recognized by the Company. A list of all such Stewards stating the department or groups
7
each represents shall be supplied to the Company. The Company shall be advised immediately by the Union in writing of any change in this list. The Assistant Shop Steward will act only when the Shop Steward is absent from the plant.
4.10	Before a Steward, or an Executive Officer, (or a member of the Grievance Committee in case the grievance has reached the Third Step) leaves his/her job or his/her department, he/she shall first notify the person in charge of that department of the difference he/she wishes to investigate or process and shall then, within one (1) hour, be granted permission to leave. Should the Steward or Executive Officer of the Union go into any department, he/she shall first report to the person in charge of that department, provided that he/she is available, giving the difference he/she wishes to investigate or process.
4.11	If an employee is being interviewed privately by his/her Foreperson about a matter that knowingly could result in his/her discipline, he/she may, if he/she desires, request that his/her department Steward be present as a witness. If such interview is conducted by the Superintendent, or in his/her absence the Company’s designated representative, the employee may request the presence of the Chief Steward, or his/her designated representative, or the Assistant Chief Steward, or his/her department Steward as a witness. If the employee in question is the department Steward, then he/she may request the presence of the Chief Steward or the Unit Chairperson of the Local Union as the witness.
If an employee is discharged, suspended or issued a written reprimand, the Company shall notify the Union in writing within two (2) working days stating the reason for such discharge, suspension or reprimand.
8
4.12 No Cessation of Work
There shall be no strikes or lockouts during the term of this Agreement and thereafter while negotiations are under way for a renewal or extension thereof, and the Union and its members shall not during the aforementioned period authorize, call, encourage, support or take part in any strike, walkout, stoppage, slowing down or other cessation of work in or on the Company’s plant or property which shall in any way affect the operations of the Company.
The Union agrees that no strike vote of the members of the Local Union will be taken during the term of this Agreement.
The Union agrees that no strike vote of the members will be taken during the course of negotiations with the Company for renewal or extension of the Agreement until an attempt has been made in good faith to settle any differences arising in such negotiations by conciliation or some other form of mediation.
4.13 Employees who have developed a disciplinary record may have that record removed providing they are able to maintain a discipline free performance period of two (2) years from their last disciplinary infraction. During this two
(2)	year period, the employee must have an eighty (80%) percent attendance record in each of the years to qualify for amnesty.
Article 5 - Arbitration
5.1	Any disagreement, grievance or dispute arising under this Agreement which is not settled to the satisfaction of either the Union or the Company under the provisions of Article
9
4 shall, upon the written notice of either party, be submitted to a single arbitrator, provided the grievance involves the interpretation or alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement. No later than one (1) calendar week from the date of written notice of its intent to arbitrate the grievance, each party will nominate their choice for a single arbitrator. In the event that the Company and the Union fail to agree on the selection of a single arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed as provided by the Alberta Labour Act.
5.2	Where appropriate, the parties may mutually agree to an Arbitration Board consisting of three (3) members, one (1) nominated by each party, and a Chairperson to be selected by the two (2) nominees.
5.3	The matters and things to be considered and the decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement.
5.4	It is agreed that neither the Company nor the Union will prevent the other party from referring a difference to arbitration to determine if the difference is arbitrable. A question of arbitrability need not be raised during the grievance procedure. If the arbitrator determines the grievance is arbitrable, the same arbitrator shall then consider the grievance itself.
5.5	The decision of the single arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.
5.6	The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the Company and the Union.
10
Article 6 - Union Security
6.1	Any employee who on the date hereof was a member of the Union in good standing or who becomes a member after that date shall maintain such membership as a condition of employment.
6.2	A new employee shall become a member of the Union within thirty (30) calendar days following his/her date of hire. The Company agrees to obtain applications for membership in the Union at time of hire from such employees and membership in the Union will be granted within thirty (30) calendar days.
6.3	Employee Union members shall be considered to have maintained membership in the Union in good standing so long as they pay the regular Union dues, initiation fees and special assessments uniformly required of all members of the Local Union.
6.4	No employee shall be subjected to any penalties against his/her application for membership or for reinstatement as a member of the Union, nor shall any discrimination of any kind whatever be practiced or permitted with respect to employees who are or who become members of the Union.
Article 7 - Check-Off
7.1	The Company agrees to deduct the monthly Union dues from each employee’s pay on his/her first pay day in each calendar month during the term of this Agreement and in the case of a newly hired employee, on the first pay day in the same month the employee was hired.
11
(a)	Twice the regular monthly Union dues shall be deducted in any one check-off where the employee was absent or had insufficient pay in the check-off immediately preceding.
(b)	The Union may convert the monthly Union dues referred to in this section to weekly Union dues by:
(i)	Advising the Management at least sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the weekly check-off, which must commence on the first day of any week, and;
(ii)	In writing confirming the amount of the weekly dues.
7.2	Upon receipt of written authorization signed by the employee, the Company will deduct the initiation fee from the pay of employees joining the Union and such deduction will be made from the employee’s pay in the payroll week next following the week in which such authorization form is received by the Company.
7.3	The Company will deduct a special assessment uniformly required of all members of the Union and such deduction shall be made from the employee’s pay commencing on his/her first pay day next following the date on which notice of such authorization is received from the Union.
7.4	The Union shall advise the Company in writing of the amount of the initiation fee, dues and assessments authorized by the employees in keeping with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union.
7.5	The Company will transmit the total amount so deducted from all such employees, complete with an alphabetical listing of those employees who had Union dues deducted,
12
to the Financial Secretary of the Union on or before the fifth (5th) day of the following calendar month. In addition, the weekly and monthly statements will be included.
Article 8 - Hours of Work and Overtime
8.1	For the purpose of calculating if overtime is payable, the Company shall set out in Schedule “C” the hours of work, which may vary from department to department and between employees within a department. The hours set out in Schedule “C” shall total not more than eight (8) in any day or forty (40) for any payroll week, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
The Company and the Union may from time to time enter into an agreement to modify the hours of work outlined in this article so long as those employees affected agree to the modified hours of work.
At the commencement of each year, but in any event no later than January 15th, the Company will provide the Union with copies of all current Schedules “C”. Further, any Schedule “C” revised as provided under Article 2, immediately following, will also be provided to the Union.
8.2	Schedule “C” may be changed from time to time as required to meet the needs of the business, but such changes shall not be made effective until seven (7) days notice has been given in the case of a gang, or twenty-four (24) hours notice in the case of individual employees. When an individual employee is required, before the expiry of the said twenty-four (24) hours notice, to work before or after his/her scheduled hours, he/she shall receive overtime for such work. Similarly in the case of a gang, when an employee is required, before the expiry of the said seven (7) days notice, to work before or after
13
his/her scheduled hours, he/she shall receive overtime for such work. Provided however, when the only change is that the starting time is set back by the Company to a later hour, such change shall not be regarded as a change in the scheduled hours under the provisions of this article but overtime shall commence after the normal end of the shift. Changes contemplated in a gang schedule will be discussed with the Union before they are made and, where feasible, contemplated changes in the schedule for any individual will also be discussed.
8.3	The Company and the Union recognize that it may be necessary for employees to work in excess of their regular number of hours due to fluctuating livestock receipts and variable volume, but the Company will limit the hours of work beyond such regular number of hours to what is reasonable.
Should overtime be required, the Company shall, whenever practicable, notify the Steward of the department where the overtime is required. Overtime will rotate on the basis of the senior qualified employee, or employees, within the department being provided the first opportunity to work the overtime through to the junior qualified employee, or employees, within the department. When the rotation is complete, another rotation will commence and continue on such basis. If a qualified employee is inadvertently missed in the rotation, he/she shall be given the first opportunity to work the next time overtime work is required. When overtime is required on non-scheduled days or shifts, the Company will discuss the call-ins, where practicable, with the department Steward.
Consideration will be given to individual circumstances which may make it difficult for an employee to work the required overtime.
14
In order to ensure that overtime is managed in a cooperative and consistent manner, the following process will be followed:
•	Necessary overtime will be posted as early as possible within the given day, and no later than lunch. Employees, who will not be available for overtime that has been posted by lunch, will be responsible to inform their Supervisor in person that they are not going to work.
•	On days when the necessary overtime has not been posted by lunch, those employees who are needed to stay will be asked individually by their Supervisor if they will be available. Each such employee will only be asked once. Employees who decline will be expected to provide a reason. Based on the stated reason, if the Supervisor can accommodate the employee’s restrictions on overtime, the Supervisor will endeavour to do so. If not, then the Supervisor will move on to the next employee.
•	In the event that there are not enough available employees to complete the necessary overtime, the Supervisor will have to re-canvas the junior qualified person for positions needed in the presence of a Steward.
8.4	For all hours worked in excess of the number of hours set out in Schedule “C”, an employee, other than a continuous shift operator, shall be paid overtime at one and one half (11^ X) times his/her regular rate or temporary rate whichever is being paid when overtime commences. For all hours worked in excess of thirteen (13) continuous hours, twice (2X) such rate shall replace one and one half (11^ X). After thirteen (13) hours of continuous work, a second meal will be
15
furnished by the Company, to be eaten on Company time, not to exceed twenty (20) minutes.
8.5	An employee, who has left the Company’s premises, specially called outside his/her scheduled hours for emergency work shall be through when the emergency is over. For such emergency work, being that outside of scheduled hours, he/she shall be paid four (4) hours at his/her job rate or for the hours actually worked at the overtime rate, whichever is the greater.
8.6	An employee who works more than one and one half (IT) hours overtime after the end of his/her regular shift will be furnished a meal by the Company, to be eaten on Company time, not to exceed twenty (20) minutes.
Employees other than those who eat their meal on the job, if required to work in excess of five (5) hours on non-scheduled days, (not to include paid holidays falling on scheduled workdays), will be provided with a meal, but will not be entitled to pay for the meal period.
When a meal is not furnished by the Company, a meal allowance of five ($5.00) dollars will be paid in lieu.
8.7	Sunday Work
Double (2X) the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees for work performed on Sunday except where the work regularly falls on Sunday, in which latter case the employee shall be paid double (2X) the regular hourly rate if he/she works on his/her day off in lieu of Sunday. In the case of employees starting a night shift prior to midnight Sunday, the hours worked before midnight will not be considered as Sunday work as these hours are part of their Monday shift.
16
Where an employee’s scheduled days off do not include an actual Sunday, then the second day off shall be deemed to be his/her Sunday.
8.8	Employees, when called for work, shall be guaranteed four (4) hours pay for that day at the regular hourly rate. Employees who leave of their own accord when work is available will not receive this guaranteed minimum four (4) hours pay. Where less than four (4) hours work is regularly scheduled, such scheduled hours shall constitute the guarantee.
8.9	An employee shall not be required to work more than five (5) hours after the scheduled starting time without a lunch period, or more than two and one half (2 ^) hours after the scheduled starting time without a fifteen (15) minute rest period, nor more than two and one half (2 ^) hours after a lunch period without such rest period. An employee who works more than five (5) hours after the lunch period will be granted a further fifteen (15) minute rest period except where the Company furnishes a meal as provided under Article 8.6.
(a)	The Union agrees that except in cases of personal necessity, employees shall not ask for additional time off during the working day.
(b)	The Union agrees that rest periods must not be abused.
(c)	When a transfer occurs during working hours that necessitates a change of work clothing, employees will not be expected to utilize their fifteen (15) minute rest period in the forenoon or afternoon.
17
These provisions shall not be applicable in cases of emergency nor to continuous shift operators such as Firemen or Engineers.
8.10	During a mechanical breakdown, time shall continue to accumulate to an employee transferred temporarily to other work or instructed by his/her Foreperson to wait on the premises of the Company.
8.11	The payment of overtime, holiday or Sunday rates in this Article 8 shall not be construed to require duplication of overtime, holiday or Sunday pay involving the same hours of work. More particularly, it is understood that no unforeseen or unexpected costs, above and beyond the actual premium rate provided for herein because of conflicting provisions elsewhere in the Collective Agreement, will be incurred to the Company.
Article 9 - 37 Hours Pay Guarantee
9.1	Based upon the present prevailing hours of work, as outlined in Article 8 hereof, if a regular employee’s weekly earnings, excluding overtime and night premium, do not amount to the equivalent of thirty-seven (37) hours pay at his/her job rate, hereinafter called the “guaranteed payment”, the Company shall make up the difference subject to the following provisions:
(a)	The provisions of Article 9 shall not apply to:
(i)	Employees hired on a casual basis for such work as snow shovellers, wreckers, and;
(ii)	Employees discharged for cause, suspended, or voluntarily leaving the service of the Company.
18
(b)	Overtime payments made to an employee under Article 8.2 shall not be deemed to be “overtime” for the purposes of Article 9.1.
(c)	The guaranteed payment shall be reduced one quarter (%) hour for each quarter hour or fraction thereof that an employee is absent from work during scheduled working hours.
(d)	For purposes of the thirty-seven (37) hours pay guarantee, if an employee does not perform the work assigned to him/her, the guaranteed payment for the payroll week in which such absence occurs shall be reduced by the number of hours he/she missed.
(e)	An employee who is employed after the first of the payroll week shall be guaranteed, for such week, that fraction of the guaranteed payment which the normal hours remaining of the payroll week are of forty (40) hours.
(f)	Employees on lay-off notice shall be entitled to their guaranteed payment for the week in which notice is given and should the notice extend into a subsequent week, then the guaranteed payment for such week shall be that fraction of thirty-seven (37) hours pay which the normal hours for those days of the notice occurring in such week are of forty (40).
(g)	Where the observance of a holiday other than any of the stipulated paid holidays, leaves less than thirty-seven (37) scheduled hours in the payroll week, the guaranteed payment shall be the number of scheduled hours available for work.
(h)	If only part of the employees in any gang receiving guarantee pay can be used on other work, they shall
19
be entitled to any guarantee pay due their gang, plus whatever they earn on the other work, provided they have been present each work day and worked all hours as ordered.
Notwithstanding all of the provisions of Article 9.1 set out above, the Company may reduce an employee’s “guaranteed payment” from thirty-seven (37) hours pay at his/her job rate to thirty-two (32) hours pay at his/her job rate in a maximum of ten (10) weeks in a calendar year provided that the Company informs the Union by Friday of its intent to reduce the guarantee in the following week.
9.2	Notwithstanding Article 9.1, the Company may employ part-time employees for twenty-four (24) hours or less in a payroll week provided that the Union is notified when a part-time employee is initially hired. The weekly limit will not apply to part-time employees who are students.
Part-time employees will accrue seniority only within the part-time group. Seniority will apply within the part-time group for the purpose of scheduling, subject to ability, to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours (other than part-time employees who are students) in a payroll week.
In the event of a lay-off of full-time employees with seniority, no full-time employee with seniority will be laid off until all part-time employees have been laid off provided that full-time employees with seniority being laid off are willing and have the necessary qualifications to perform the required work of laid off part-time employees.
All part-time employees will be paid the Level 1 start rate per hour and will be granted and paid for General Holidays and vacations in accordance with the provisions of the Alberta Employment Standards Code and not Schedule “B” and Article 15 of the Agreement.
20
Part-time employees will not be entitled to any benefits or pension coverage under the Agreement.
9.3	Subject to other provisions of Article 9, in a payroll week containing a recognized paid holiday or holidays, the “guaranteed payment” shall be the employee’s job rate multiplied by hours as follows:
Hours set out in Schedule “C” less three (3) hours for days apart from recognized paid holidays plus eight (8) hours for each such holiday in that week.
Article 10 - Seniority
10.1	Seniority is defined as the length of an employee’s service with the Company determined by inclusion on the plant payroll, referred to herein as “plant work”, provided however, that an employee will be on probation and not subject to the seniority provisions contained herein, until he/she has completed sixty-five (65) scheduled days of employment, on plant work, within a consecutive nine (9) month period and has received pay for each such day at least equal to the minimum provided under Article 8.8. Until a probationary employee has acquired seniority, he/she may be separated from the Company’s employ at any time without reference to the grievance procedure and the Company shall be under no obligation to rehire. Upon completion of such probationary period, the employee’s name will be placed on the seniority list. An employee’s service shall be calculated as the elapsed time from the date he/she was first employed on plant work, unless his/her seniority was broken, in which event the calculation shall be from the date he/she returned to plant work following the last break in seniority, subject to the following:
21
(a)	An employee returning to plant work from another part of the Company’s service will be credited with his/her previous service in plant work, notwithstanding any of the provisions of the article relating to seniority.
(b)	On April 1st each year, the Company will issue a seniority list showing those persons who have attained seniority. The list shall be posted in conspicuous places throughout the plant, and a copy delivered to the Chief Steward, Stewards and three
(3)	local officers at the plant, with a supplementary correction list each three (3) months thereafter. When an employee completes the probationary period and attains seniority as defined under Article 10.1, the Union will be advised by the end of the payroll week next following.
10.2	The seniority of an employee shall be considered broken, all rights forfeited and there is no obligation to rehire when he/she:
(a)	Voluntarily leaves the service of the Company or is discharged for cause; or
(b)	Fails to return to work when called or cannot be located after a reasonable effort on the part of the Company. A registered letter directed to his/her last known address, with a copy to the Union, shall constitute reasonable effort on the part of the Company. The employee shall, within five (5) working days (if the address is in Lethbridge) or seven (7) days (if the address is outside Lethbridge) of the date of such notice, notify the Company with respect thereto and in such event, the employee shall return to work within a reasonable time to be determined by the Company and the Union.
22
(This clause shall not apply to work of a temporary nature of less than ten (10) days duration.)
(i)	In cases where it is necessary to secure workers in less time than the required notice, the Company, if unable to make contact with the senior eligible employee, may recall the next senior employee, and so on down the list, until the vacancies are filled. However, should the senior employee subsequently report within the required time, he/she shall be given the work for which the next senior employee was recalled; or
(c)	Has been on lay-off for a period longer than the time allowed in the following schedule:
Length of Seniority	Length of Allowable
at Date of Lay-off	Time Off
Company Payroll
Less than two (2) years Equivalent to length of
seniority at date
10.3	If an employee is absent from work because of accident or sickness, he/she shall accumulate seniority while off work, up to the time limits set out under Article 10.2 (c), except that an employee with two (2) or more years service shall accumulate seniority for a period equivalent to his/her length of service up to a maximum of four (4) years and shall be returned to the job previously held or to a job carrying a rate equal to that previously held, subject to seniority, providing that he/she can perform the required work satisfactorily. If the employee would not otherwise have retained his/her previous job and is not placed on a job carrying an equal rate of pay, he/she shall, subject to seniority, be placed on a job that he/she can satisfactorily perform. Application for reinstatement after the expiry of
23
the allowable period shall be considered on its merits. Prior to the expiry of the allowable period, the parties will meet to review options for accommodating the employee with existing work.

When an employee has been transferred out of a department, he/she may within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of four (4) months from date of transfer, signify in writing to the Superintendent that he/she wishes to return to the original department. When a vacancy occurs in the original department, the senior employee who has signified his/her wish will be returned.
11.2	Temporary Transfer
When a temporary transfer is made from one department to another or to an off shift from within the same department, the Company will transfer the employee with the least seniority, always having regard to the requirements of the business and the ability of the employee to do the required work satisfactorily.
24
Where an employee is permanently transferred to another department and is consistently thereafter returned temporarily to perform the job in his/her previous department because of his/her qualifications to perform the work, he/she may express his/her dissatisfaction with such transfers and the Company will, subject to seniority, make a reasonable effort to obtain a replacement who can satisfactorily perform the work or train another employee who possesses suitable qualifications and can qualify within a reasonable period for such temporary transfer.

When a suitable opening arises, consideration of transfer will be based on seniority for applications that have been on file for one (1) month or more, always having regard to the ability of the employee to perform the available work and the requirements of the Company to conduct its operations in an efficient and orderly manner.
11.4	When there are shift changes in the plant, senior employees shall be given preference having regard to the ability of the employee to perform the available work.
11.5	When there are temporary departmental transfers made to higher classifications, the most senior, available, qualified employee will be transferred. In the event of extenuating circumstances, the Company will not be expected to apply the above process.

Those applying within six (6) working days from the date of posting along with those with applications on file as provided under 12.1 (c) below will receive consideration on the basis of seniority, provided the employees possess suitable qualifications for the jobs and can qualify within a reasonable period. Employees selected to fill such jobs temporarily shall receive equal consideration with such applicants. The accepted applicant shall be assigned to the vacancy on a trial basis until he/she has demonstrated that he/she can qualify.
(c)	An employee with seniority who wishes to transfer to another department may submit a written application to the Plant Superintendent.

26
applications on file provided the employees applying possess the necessary qualification for the vacancy and can qualify within a reasonable period of time, and further provided they have not been transferred under the provisions of this article within the previous twelve (12) month period. Such transfers will be affected as quickly as a suitable replacement can be obtained.
Employees who do not accept a transfer, when an opening has occurred in the department they have indicated on their application, shall not be eligible to apply for another transfer until twelve (12) months has elapsed.
(d)	Preferred vacancies referred to in 12.1 (b) will be determined by agreement between Management and the Union.

27
Level 1 and Level 2 Classification jobs will not be posted.
(g)	It is agreed that jobs will be posted within five (5) working days from the day it is confirmed vacant. The Company will post all such vacancies as well as a list of successful candidates when confirmed.
12.2	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Article 12 and of Article 11, two (2) lists of jobs shall be created through consultation between Management and the Union and will be designated as jobs which are not to be filled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 11 and 12. If such persons are available, such jobs will be filled as follows:
(a)	The first list - jobs will be filled by employees who can perform them satisfactorily and who are unable to perform their regular duties.
(b)	The second list - jobs will be filled by employees who
can perform them satisfactorily and who are temporarily unable to perform their regular duties due to	a temporary disability. An	employee
accommodated under this provision will return to his/her regular job when physically able.
The lists of such jobs may be altered from time to time by agreement between the Company and the Union.
(c)	It is also agreed that employees with occupational and non-occupational disabilities will be given equal consideration when filling (a) and (b) above.
28

12.4	The Company will continue with its current practice of job rotation.
12.5	The word qualified throughout this Agreement shall mean to be able to perform the job within an uninterrupted six (6) week period without instruction or assistance.

Article 13 - Leave of Absence
13.1	Leave of absence may be granted to an employee who provides written request:

The Superintendent shall decide as to the availability of a job and the qualifications of an employee, subject to the right of appeal by the Union under the provisions of the Grievance Procedure.
14.2	In the event of reduction of staff and rehiring of employees, seniority shall apply, provided the employee with the greater amount of seniority can satisfactorily perform the job he/she is assigned to, or can learn the job within a reasonable time. However, in the rehiring of employees if the job is one requiring immediate
33
qualifications, then the Company may recall the senior employee possessing the necessary qualifications.
14.3	The Company shall advise the Union when a lay-off is about to occur and shall on the day of issuance of lay-off notice give the Union a list indicating the name and department of all employees affected. Similarly, the Company shall on the day of rehire give the Union a list of all those employees to be rehired.

14.4	In the case of lay-off, employees shall be given one (1) working day’s notice for every completed six (6) months seniority, with a maximum notice of five (5) working days and with a minimum notice of two (2) working days. If the Company determines that additional work is available at the time any lay-off notice is to become effective, the layoff notice shall be extended to senior employees then on lay-off notice provided they have the necessary qualifications to perform the required work satisfactorily. If the extension of the lay-off notice exceeds seven (7) working days, it will be cancelled.
In the case of recall of an employee for work of less than ten (10) days duration, the requirements in respect of notice of lay-off shall not apply provided the employee and the Union are given notice at the time of recall that such work is of a temporary nature. Employee shall be laid off from such work in order of seniority.
14.5	Employees whom the Company wishes to train for supervisory, technical or commercial positions outside of the bargaining unit may be retained in employment without being subject to the lay-off provision of the Agreement for a period of two (2) years.

15.8	Vacation pay for each week of vacation shall be the basic weekly hours at the regular rate pro-rated on the number of weeks of earnings for which vacation pay has not been granted in the twelve (12) months (for first vacation the full period of service) immediately preceding the cut-off date. Leave of absence not exceeding four (4) weeks shall be regarded as weeks of earnings. In the case of illness, an employee, upon his/her return to the service of the Company, shall receive vacation credit due to illness up to four (4) weeks annually or such longer period as an employee may be entitled to receive Weekly Indemnity under the Sickness and Accident Plan. An employee upon his/her return to the service of the Company after a compensable accident shall be granted up to one (1) year’s vacation credits as if earnings had been received.
15.9	Except where otherwise provided by legislation, an employee who is discharged for cause forfeits his/her vacation privileges accumulated since his/her last cut-off date, but in the case of an employee who leaves the service of the Company for reasons other than being discharged for cause, and he/she has had more than four
(4)	months service, he/she shall receive vacation pay up to the date of leaving calculated back to the last cut-off date for which he/she has already received vacation pay. (For an employee who leaves before his/her first cut-off

15.10	When an employee leaves the service at the normal retirement age before the cut-off date in that year, the period between retirement and the cut-off date shall be regarded as weeks of earnings for purposes of Article 15.9.
15.11	If vacation with pay is greater under provincial legislation, it shall replace the foregoing.
15.12	When an employee is injured in a non-occupational accident or becomes sick while on vacation, he/she can become eligible for the Weekly Indemnity benefit as set out in the Sickness and Accident Plan provided:

Bargaining Committee:

This Agreement was ratified on July 31st, 2012.
61
Schedule “A” - Application of Rates
1.	Employees will be paid the class level rate or job rate, whichever is applicable, for the job that they regularly perform, when they become qualified. “Qualified” shall be interpreted to mean able to regularly perform the job without instruction or assistance. Except by agreement with the Union, the period of qualifying shall not exceed six (6) weeks, after which the rate shall be paid. Prior to becoming qualified, a new employee or a recalled employee will be paid the Class 1 rate.
2.	When an employee regularly performs more than one job, he/she will be paid a rate calculated by taking the actual percentage of time worked on the highest rated job and the remaining percentage of time worked on the second highest rated job. When the two (2) highest rated jobs are at the same rate, the employee will be paid the highest rate. Where an employee regularly performs fifty (50%) percent or more of his/her time on the highest rated job, the employee will be paid the highest rate.
3.	Permanent Transfer
Form 300 shall indicate a permanent transfer and a copy of same shall be given to the Chief Steward immediately after the employee is advised. If an employee is transferred permanently to work where the job rate is higher, he/she shall receive the higher rate when he/she becomes qualified, as defined in Section 1 above. While an employee is attempting to qualify on a higher rated job, he/she will continue to be paid the rate of the job from which he/she transferred, not the Class 1 rate. If an employee is permanently transferred to work where the job rate is lower, such lower rate shall start twelve (12) weeks, including lay-off, after the date of such transfer.
62
The twelve (12) week period set out in the foregoing paragraph shall be extended one (1) day for each day the employee is required to return temporarily to his/her previous higher rated work. Where the employee returns temporarily to his/her previous higher rated work for a period in excess of three (3) consecutive weeks, the twelve (12) week period set out in the foregoing paragraph will recommence when the employee is again transferred to the work where the job rate is lower.
4.	Temporary Transfer
When an employee is required temporarily to fill a higher rated job, he/she shall receive the higher rate provided however that such higher rate shall not be used as part of the job rate referred to in Sections 1,2, and 3 above. The employee’s regular job rate (Form 300) shall apply immediately after such temporary assignment ceases. Form 301 shall indicate a temporary transfer and a copy of same shall be given to the department Steward. Where an employee is kept on the same temporary assignment for a period of three (3) months, the rate for such assignment shall be regarded as a permanent transfer under Section 3 above.
If an employee works in a higher classification on the day before and the date after a Statutory Holiday, he will be paid for the Statutory Holiday at the higher rate of pay.
If an employee works in a higher classification for four (4) consecutive weeks immediately prior to his/her vacation, the employee will be paid at the higher rate for that vacation.
5.	If an employee at his/her own request is transferred permanently from work where the job rate is higher, the lower rate shall prevail immediately upon transfer.
63
6.	Where an employee is transferred to work where the job rate is lower as a direct result of the introduction of new equipment or where an employee remains on a job reduced in value following a technological change, his/her rate shall not be reduced for a period of three (3) years, including lay-off, provided that the employee accepts all opportunities for transfer to work where the job rate is higher. Such employee will not be paid a rate greater than the rate paid at the time of transfer except for reasons of a general wage increase after the date of transfer.
7.	An employee whose schedule calls for work to commence at any time other than between 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. inclusive, shall receive a night shift premium of fifty ($0.50) cents per hour for all hours worked between 4 p.m. and 7 a.m. Such premium to be continued for hours worked after 7 a.m. where the employee was entitled to the premium for hours immediately before 7 a.m. Such premium shall not be a part of his/her regular rate.
8.	An employee, designated by the Company as a Corporate Trainer, will be paid a premium of fifty ($0.50) cents per hour above his/her regular rate for the duration of the assignment. No Corporate Trainer shall hire, layoff, suspend, discharge, exercise other discipline or except on direction from a member of Management, transfer employees to other departments. A Corporate Trainer will not be retained in his/her department under Article 11.2, solely because of his/her duties as a Corporate Trainer.
9.	In the case of an employee who has signified his/her wish to return to his/her original department under Article 11.1, but is prevented from returning solely because of the lack of a qualified replacement, he/she shall be paid the job rate to which he/she would be entitled in his/her original department or the rate he/she is paid on the date he/she is
64
prevented from returning to his/her original department, whichever is greater.
65
SCHEDULE “B” - PAID HOLIDAYS
1.	Paid Holidays
(a)	Eleven (11) paid holidays shall be recognized as follows:
New Year’s Day Alberta Family Day Victoria Day Labour Day Christmas Day
First Monday in August (usually referred to as Civic Holiday).
