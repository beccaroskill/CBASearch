THIS AGREEMENT made as of the 16th day of September 2005;
BETWEEN:
INCO LIMITED,
MANITOBA OPERATIONS, (hereinafter called “the Company”) OF THE FIRST PART
and -
UNITED STEELWORKERS,
LOCAL 6166, (hereinafter called “the Union”)
OF THE SECOND PART
WHEREAS by certificate of The Manitoba Labour Board dated the 31st of May, 1962, it was certified that the Union is the properly chosen bargaining agent for all employees of the Company in the Thompson, Manitoba operations except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, foremen, shift bosses and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
AND WHEREAS it is the intent and purpose of the Union and the Company to further harmonious industrial relationships between the Company and those employees:
NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS
1.01	The expression “basic rate” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean at any time with respect to any employee that straight time rate per hour, (exclusive of all premium pay such as holiday pay, shift premium, Sunday premium and overtime) to which such employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement in respect of the work which he is performing at such time.
1.02	The word “department” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean the departments as set forth in Schedule “A” hereto.
Page 9
1.03	The word “employee” or "employees” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean all employees of the Company in its Thompson and other operations north of the 53rd parallel of latitude in Manitoba except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foremen and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
1.04	Until an employee has worked at least three hundred and thirty-six (336) hours since the date of his most recent hiring he shall be a “probationary employee” and the words “probationary employee’ wherever used in this Agreement shall have that meaning.
1.05(a) The word “seniority” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean an employee's length of continuous employment with the Company since the date of his most recent hiring, less the periods to be subtracted under Clause 15.20.
1.05(b) The word “seniority ranking” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean the relative seniority of an employee to others in the department in which he is then employed.
1.06 Whenever the masculine gender appears in this Agreement it shall also mean the feminine gender, unless the context requires otherwise.
ARTICLE 2 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
2.01	The Union recognizes that it is exclusively the function and right of the Company to direct the working forces and to hire, promote, demote, transfer, suspend or lay off employees, and also the right of the Company to discipline or discharge any employee for just cause.
2.02	The Union further recognizes the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole and exclusive prerogative of the Company to decide on the location of its plants and mines, the products to be mined and/or processed, the schedules of production, the methods of mining and processing used, the number of employees needed by the Company at any time, operating techniques, methods, machinery and equipment, and to exercise jurisdiction over all operations, buildings, machinery and tools.
2.03	The Company agrees that any exercise of rights and powers under this Article in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
Page 10
ARTICLE 3 - UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes that the Union is the bargaining agent of the employees and has the exclusive authority to bargain collectively on their behalf with respect to rates of pay, hours of work, and terms and conditions of employment of employees as set out in The Labour Relations Act.
3.02	Subject to the requirements of operations, (including necessary instruction of employees and any cases of an emergency nature) Foremen, supervisors, and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement shall not perform work which is normally done by employees, where employees are reasonably available to do such work.
3.03	The Company understands that the Union has a legitimate concern about contracting out because of its effect upon such matters as job security and job opportunity and will therefore use its best efforts to minimize the amount of production or maintenance work to be contracted out.
The Union understands that the Company has a legitimate concern about the efficiency of the operation and that sometimes it is necessary to contract work out.
Accordingly, work may be contracted out if:
(a)	it has been consistently performed by contractors in the past; or
(b)	qualified Company employees are not available in sufficient numbers to perform the work or when special skills, equipment or tools are required to perform the work; or
(c)	it is work of an emergency nature provided, however, that in the case of work of an emergency nature, the Company will, where practicable, give reasonable consideration to the use of employees who have the necessary skills to perform such work.
Some examples of work which will be contracted out are major capital projects, major construction, shaft sinking and related development, and specialized work such as stack inspection and repair.
A joint "Contracting Out Committee” will be established for the purpose of reviewing work currently contracted out and any planned contracting out of work. The Union representatives on the Committee may make recommendations which must be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in its decision making process.
Page 11
The Contracting Out Committee will consist of the Contracting Out Coordinator from the Local Union who will Co-Chair the committee, a designated management Contracting Out Co-Chair, and one (1) management representative and one (1) Union representative from each of the areas as set out in Schedule "H”.
The Contracting Out Committee will meet as often as it deems necessary but not less than once each calendar quarter. In addition, the management and Union representatives from each area will provide a monthly update to the Executive Steering Committee which will consist of the President of the Local Union, the President of Inco Manitoba Operation, the Union Contracting Out Coordinator and the designated Company Contracting Out Co-Chair.
The Company will inform the Union Contracting Out Coordinator as soon as possible that work of an emergency nature is being contracted out. The Company will use its best efforts to keep such work to a minimum.
The Company agrees to provide the Contracting Out Committee with the following information regarding work that is contracted out or work planned to be contracted out: location of the work; type of work to be done; crafts or occupations involved; expected duration; numbers of both contract employees and bargaining unit employees to be used.
The Company will use its best efforts to:
(a)	give the Union thirty (30) days notice of work to be contracted out; and
(b)	hold a meeting in the first quarter of each year to review contracting out activities from the previous twelve (12) month period and major contracts to be awarded or renewed in the current year; and
(c)	review with the Contracting Out Committee vacation and shutdown work to be contracted out prior to a vacation or production shutdown.
If ongoing, sustained need for new skills, not currently available in the Company, is identified, the Company will use its best efforts to train sufficient employees in such skills.
The Union and the Company agree that they will jointly examine means, including but not limited to training, to increase mine development efficiencies by Inco employees, with the intent of increasing the potential for reducing the amount of mine development work to be contracted out.
No employee will be demoted or laid off as a direct result of work being contracted out by the Company.
Page 12
The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to members of the joint Contracting Out Committee.
3.04	Except with the consent of the Union, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, during the last thirty (30) days of the term of this Agreement the Company will not transfer any member of the bargaining unit to office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foreman or any position in which the individual is not an "employee” within the meaning of The Labour Relations Act.
ARTICLE 4 - UNION SECURITY
4.01	The Company shall, during the life of this Agreement, deduct as a condition of each employee's continued employment, Union dues in the amount certified by the Union to the Company to be currently in effect according to the Union Constitution, and remit the same in the week following the pay period in which such deduction is made to the International Treasurer, United Steelworkers accompanied by a completed form R-115 except that the line "3. Earnings $” shall not be completed. The Company will, at the time of remittance, name the employees from whose pay such payment has been deducted and name the employees whose employment has terminated in the period for which payment is being made.
4.02	The said deductions shall commence, in the case of each employee who is in the employment of the Company at the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of September, 2005 and, in the case of each employee entering the employment of the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of hire if five (5) or more days are worked. In the event five (5) or more days are not worked in the month of hire, the said deductions will commence with the month following the month of hire.
4.03 Commencing March 1, 2006, the Company will on or before March 1st in each year furnish to each employee a statement of the total Union dues which have been deducted from such employee's pay cheques and remitted to the Union during the preceding calendar year.
4.04	In Clause 4.05 "Temporary Staff Employee” means an employee who is temporarily transferred to office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, or Foreman.
4.05	In the week following each pay period that would have been a pay period for a Temporary Staff Employee if he had not been a Temporary Staff Employee, the Company shall remit to the Financial Secretary of the Union an amount equal to the Union dues that would have been remitted to the Financial Secretary of the Union under Clause 4.01 with respect to that Temporary Staff Employee if he had not been a Temporary Staff Employee in that pay period.
Page 13
ARTICLE 5 - NO DISCRIMINATION
5.01	The parties mutually agree that any employee of the Company may become a member of the Union if he wishes to do so, and may refrain from becoming or remaining a member of the Union if he so desires.
5.02	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in the Union or by reason of the employee's sex, race, national origin, colour, religion, political belief, age, sexual orientation, family status, marital status, mental disability, physical handicap, or because an employee has or has not engaged in lawful union activity specifically provided for under this Agreement. The parties also agree that no employee should be subjected to sexual harassment.
5.03	The parties mutually agree that employees have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. The Company will take whatever action it deems necessary to maintain such a working environment. The action taken by the Company may include discipline and/or the termination of the employment of any person engaging in the sexual harassment of another person.
An employee may initiate a grievance alleging sexual harassment under the grievance procedure.
Where the alleged harasser is the person who would normally deal with the grievance, the complaint will automatically be advanced to the next stage of the grievance procedure.
Complaints of alleged sexual harassment will be handled with all possible confidentiality.
ARTICLE 6 - HOURS OF WORK
6.01	Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a guarantee of work or of hours of work per day or per week.
6.02	Time worked will be calculated in units of one-half (%) hour.
6.03	For shift work -
(a)	a day will consist of a series of shifts as scheduled.
(b)	a work week will commence with the day shift on Monday and end with the night shift on the following Sunday;
Page 14
(c)	on continuous shift operations each employee not be required to work longer than five (5) consecutive hours without a thirty (30) minute period to eat any meal which period shall be considered as time worked. Such meal may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.04	For work other than shift work, a work week will commence with the beginning of a day worker's hours on Monday and terminate at the same time on the following Monday.
6.05	Employees who are not regularly employed as shift workers and are working as day workers shall normally begin work at 8 a.m. However, it is recognized that in order to maintain efficient operations, certain day workers must begin work earlier or later than that hour. Day workers will be given a lunch period of one-half (%) hour per day, but such lunch period shall not be considered as time worked. The lunch may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.06	Hoisting and lowering schedules at the Company's mines will be arranged to provide approximately the number of hours he was scheduled to work on that day, from collar to collar for each shift, but variations which do not occur consistently from such schedules, not exceeding ten (10) minutes, shall be disregarded. Delay time in such schedules in excess of the first ten (10) minutes shall be considered time worked, but not for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Agreement.
6.07	When an hourly paid employee, because of failure of the Company to inform him by notice or otherwise that no work will be available, reports for work on schedule, in good faith, and is advised that there is no work available, he shall receive four (4) hours pay at what would have been his basic rate without being required to work the said four (4) hours, but such four (4) hours shall not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of Article 7. The provisions of this Clause shall not apply when an employee has been absent from his regular work period and has failed before reporting for work to inform his Foreman or such other supervisor designated by the Company for this purpose of his intention to return.
6.08	A "call-out” shall mean a request by the Company to an employee to work any time outside such employee's regularly scheduled working hours other than time immediately following or time (not to exceed one (1) hour) immediately preceding a shift worked by such employee unless he shall have received such request at least sixteen (16) hours before such work is to commence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement an employee reporting for work on a "call-out” shall be entitled to be paid for work so performed as follows:
Page 15
(a)	if the “call-out” occurs on a day other than a general holiday, or occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is within the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater;
(b)	if the “call-out” occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is outside the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at two and one-half (2 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater.
6.09	Transportation to and/or from call-out work will be provided by the Company when public transportation is not reasonably available or when in the opinion of the Company the urgency of the call-out work so requires it.
6.10	An employee who continues working after completing his regular shift and then works more than two (2) hours overtime, shall be provided by the Company with a lunch. Should such employee work for more than five (5) hours overtime, he shall be provided by the Company with an additional lunch, which lunch or lunches may be eaten in a lunchroom.
The Company will use its best efforts to supply a hot lunch for the first lunch. The additional lunch will consist of a sandwich/beverage combination.
Extended Shift Schedules
6.11	Subject to Clause 6.12, the Company and the Union mutually agree that the Company may give effect to shift schedules which alter or exceed the daily and/or weekly hours of work described elsewhere in this agreement. These schedules shall be termed Extended Shift Schedules and are defined as:
A schedule of shifts in excess of eight (8) hours each, but not to exceed twelve (12) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period, without the payment of wages at overtime rates provided, however, that the average weekly hours worked over the cycle of the schedule of shifts will not exceed forty (40) and if it does the hours in excess of forty (40) will be paid at overtime rate. The “cycle of the schedule of shifts” means the number of weeks that pass before the schedule repeats itself, which number of weeks shall not exceed eight (8) without prior consultation with the Union.
An hourly-paid employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule pursuant to this Clause 6.11 shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of his Extended Shift Schedule hours at his basic rate in his work day, except where such excess time is worked by him due to his regularly
Page 16
scheduled change of shift and, where applicable shall be entitled to off-shift premium in accordance with Clause 8.04.

When the Company plans to implement an Extended Shift Schedule, the Superintendent of the Department or his designate and no more than two (2) other individuals appointed by the Company shall present to the Shift Schedule Committee, and to the employees involved, information pertinent to the planned implementation.
Within one (1) calendar week of such presentation, the Shift Schedule Committee shall advise the Superintendent or designate of specific concerns relating to the implementation plan. The Company shall give substantial weight and careful consideration to the concerns in its decision making process.
Provisions of Clause 19.04 shall apply to the Union representatives of the Shift Schedule Committee.

ARTICLE 7 - OVERTIME
7.01	An hourly-paid employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the number of hours he was scheduled to work at his basic rate on that day.
7.02	Where the average weekly hours worked by an employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule exceeds forty (40) hours over the cycle of the schedule of shifts as defined in Clause 6.11, he shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for the hours in excess of forty (40), except that:
(a)	when a general holiday occurs in his regularly scheduled work week but does not occur on his regular day off he shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the difference between forty (40) and the number of hours he was scheduled to work on that general holiday, and
Page 17
(b)	when two general holidays occur in his regularly scheduled work week but neither occurs on what is a regular day off for him, he shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the difference between forty (40) and the number of hours he was scheduled to work on both of those general holidays
Amounts paid to an employee pursuant to Clause 6.08 and/or Clause 7.01 shall be deducted in computing amounts payable pursuant to this Clause 7.02.
7.02A Subject to Clause 7.02 and Clause 7.06, an employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked outside his regularly scheduled work hours in any week provided that any time not worked during his regularly scheduled work hours;
i)	is due to a death in his immediate family as defined in Clause 8.09; or

iii)	is pursuant to leave of absence granted by the Company; or
iv)	is due to vacation granted pursuant to Article 12 ; or
v)	is due to Special vacation granted pursuant to Article 13; or
vi)	is due to a holiday with pay granted pursuant to Clause 14.03.
7.03	When the Company requires overtime work to be performed, other than work pursuant to a "call-out”, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the requirements and efficiency of operations, distribute such work as evenly as practicable among the employees in the working group which normally performs the work, who are qualified to perform the work, considering the availability and wishes of employees who have the necessary qualifications.
Prior to the offering of overtime the Company will make temporary promotions in accordance with Clause 15.09.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 an overtime opportunity shall be any time, except a "call-out”, outside an employee’s regularly scheduled working hours regardless of the rate of pay the employee receives for working or would have received had he worked such time.
Preference in the offering of overtime will be given first to the qualified employee in the working group with the least overtime recorded, if he is readily available, and, if he is not, or if he is not contacted for any reason, preference in the offering of overtime will be given to him at the next opportunity. If any employee refuses to
Page 18
work overtime offered to him, he shall not receive any pay for those overtime hours but they shall be added to his record of accumulated overtime hours for the purpose of overtime distribution.
In the event of overtime work being required in a trade the work will first be offered to employees in that trade in the working group (which is the trade that normally performs the work) and then to employees in the required trade in the Departmental Working Area listed in Schedule "E” before being offered to other qualified employees.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 "working group” is generally defined as that group of employees reporting to a first line supervisor. However, where shift sequences or supervisory coverage requires otherwise, the employees reporting to a first line supervisor may constitute two (2) or more working groups. The Company and the Union will agree on any working groups which do not conform to this definition.
Upon request to his immediate supervisor, an employee, accompanied if he so desires by a Union Steward, may examine the record of his immediate supervisor pertaining to overtime distribution within the employee's working group.
The record pertaining to overtime distribution for each working group will be posted each month in a suitable location.
Once a month during the first year of this Agreement and once a quarter thereafter, at the request of the Union, the Manager of Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment and/or other designated officials of the Company from the relevant department shall meet with two (2) representatives of the Union to review the records of overtime distribution. The Union shall notify the Company at least five (5) working days prior to any such meeting of the particular records to be considered thereat. The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to time lost shall apply to the two (2) representatives of the Union in attendance at such meetings.
If an employee has a complaint with respect to the record of overtime distribution which he has been unable to resolve with his supervisor and where there is mutual agreement, the parties will discuss the matter at the aforementioned meeting prior to such complaint being advanced through the grievance procedure.
7.04	Except as provided in Clause 6.08 or Clause 14.02 under the provisions of which an employee may be entitled to be paid at two and one-half (2%) times his basic rate, no employee paid on an hourly basis shall be entitled, apart from off-shift premium and Sunday premium, to more than one and one-half (1%) times his applicable basic rate for any hours worked by him.
Page 19
7.05	Any change in an employee's regular day off schedule or shift schedule shall be posted, or an employee instructed to that effect, not later than the end of his shift on the Friday prior to the work week in which the change is to take effect.
7.06	Should an employee be instructed by the Company, during his work week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week, to change his day off or days off in that work week to another day or days in that work week, he shall be considered as having worked his normal working hours on the previously scheduled day or days at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
Any change or changes to an employee's normal shift schedule at the Company's instruction given during his work week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week will entitle the employee to be considered as having worked the originally scheduled hours that were changed in that work week at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
This Clause 7.06 does not apply to changes of shift schedules made to accommodate employee training.
Banking of Overtime
7.07	Each employee who works overtime has the option of receiving pay for such work at the applicable overtime rate, or banking the time worked at the applicable basic rate and receiving pay for one-half (%) of the time worked at the applicable basic rate, provided that he does not have sufficient vacation entitlement to cover the vacation shutdown period.
Such time will be taken in conjunction with the next vacation shutdown and, if applicable, the Company will deduct from the pay for such time an amount equal to the employee’s contribution to the Security Fund Plan and the Company shall contribute to the Security Fund Plan an amount in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in such Plan.
If for any reason the employee is not required to use the banked time to cover the vacation shutdown period he will receive payment for such banked time at the applicable basic rate.
Subject to Clause 7.02A, such time off will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Article 7.

During the above three (3) month period:
(a)	he may be required by the Company to accept any training in any occupational classification which is offered to him,
(b)	he shall be reassigned, subject to Clause 15.27 and subject to the wishes of employee, to his regular occupational classification in the event of a vacancy, and

If he refuses to accept such training, or to accept any reassignment or to accept any job offered to him by the Company, he shall forthwith cease to be entitled to the benefits of this Clause 8.07.
Where an employee is reassigned under subclause (b) of this Clause 8.07 the provisions of Article 15 with respect to job posting shall not apply to the vacancy to which he is reassigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing an employee will not be paid for work performed during a shift or day at a rate less than that applicable to the occupational category in which he commences work on such shift or day.
8.08	An employee who serves as a juror will be paid his basic rate for the number of hours he was scheduled to work during the period he serves as a juror, less any fees paid to the employee under The Jury Act or The Queen's Bench Act. In order to receive pay pursuant to this Clause, the employee must notify the Company within three (3) working days after receipt of his jury summons, present to the Company satisfactory proof of service and attendance, notify the Company of the date on which he will be released from jury duty immediately after such information is provided to the employee and report for work on his first scheduled shift immediately following his release.

Page 42
transfer. The Company shall maintain a file of such applications for transfer and shall consult such file when considering hiring new employees.

(i)	who is in an occupational classification different from that of the posted job, or
(ii)	who is in the same occupational classification but is assigned to shift work while the posted job is for day-time work or vice-versa, or
(iii)	who is in the same occupational classification as that of posted job but is assigned to a different level, mining complex, or stope, or
(iv)	who is in the same occupational classification that of the posted job but is assigned to a different shift,
may apply in writing for such job within the said seven (7) days. In considering which applicant is to fill such vacancy, the Company shall give preference according to the seniority ranking of the employees affected, subject to Clause 15.02. Where the factors described in Clause 15.02 are to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more employees, their relative seniority ranking shall govern.
An employee who is the successful applicant for a job in accordance with (iii) or (iv) above will not be eligible to make application under the terms of (iii) or (iv) for a period of six (6) months from the posting of his name as the successful applicant.
Nothing in the foregoing provisions shall limit the right of the Company to assign any employee in any occupational classification from day-time work to shift work or vice-versa in the same occupational classification.
15.10A An employee in a Mine Department may apply in writing to fill a vacancy posted pursuant to Clause 15.10 in another Mine Department providing he has not been employed in an occupational classification in such other Mine Department in the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date of the posting.
Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, an employee who has been transferred, pursuant to Clause 15.04 from the Mine Department in which the vacancy exists shall be permitted to make application for such vacancy.
Page 47
15.11	The Company shall, without delay after a notice of a vacancy has been posted for seven (7) calendar days, post for at least seven (7) calendar days the name, employment number, and seniority of the successful applicant. If there shall have been no applicant, or no successful applicant for such job, such fact shall be posted. Except in the case of the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department, the Company, if it fills such job from within the department, shall within four (4) weeks from date of posting and subject to Clause 15.02, select from among the employees therein, that employee having the lowest seniority ranking.
The Company shall, without delay after a notice of a vacancy has been posted for seven (7) calendar days, post for at least seven (7) calendar days the name, employment number, and seniority of the successful applicant. An employee who is a successful applicant in Clause 15.10 (i), (ii) or (iii) above will, except in unusual circumstances, be transferred by the Company to his new position within sixty (60) calendar days of the posting of his name as the successful applicant.
The Company will promptly send to the Union, a copy of the notice of vacancy showing the disposition thereof. When a vacancy has been filled, the name, employment number and seniority of the successful applicant or the employee who has been appointed, as the case may be, shall be shown on the notice.
Layoff
15.12The Company and the Union agree that employment security, though not a guarantee, should increase according to seniority.
When employees are laid off for more than thirty (30) days, either for lack of work or in order to create vacancies for employees with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, the Company shall, subject to Clause 15.02, lay off employees in the reverse order of their seniority.
When employees are to be laid off other than in reverse order of seniority, the senior employee who is to be laid off will, where practicable, be given the opportunity to acquire through training the qualification necessary to fill the vacancy that would have been created had the employees been laid off in reverse order of their seniority.
Where it is practicable to give a senior employee such training the length of the training period shall be in proportion to his seniority and each such employee will be given a maximum of one week of training for each complete year of continuous service.
Page 48
15.13	Subject to Clause 15.19, an employee who
(a)	has at least one (1) year of seniority,
(b)	is laid off either for lack of work or in order to create a vacancy for an employee with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, and the Company considers such lay off to be permanent, and
(c)	notifies the Company in writing, within one hundred and twenty (120) days of being so laid off, that he relinquishes his right of recall under Clause 15.15 and wishes to terminate his employment,
shall be paid as severance pay an amount equal to
(i)	one hundred and sixty (160) times his basic rate, plus
(ii)	forty (40) times his basic rate multiplied by a number which is the number of his "Years of Service” as defined in Clause 10.01(b) but disregarding any fraction of a year, minus
(iii)	any amount paid to him under Clause 10.05(a).
15.14	When employees are temporarily laid off for thirty (30) days or less, either for lack of work or in order to create vacancies for employees with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, the Company shall, subject to Clause 15.02, lay off employees in the reverse order of their seniority ranking, except in cases of breakdown or other emergency or other circumstances beyond the immediate control of the Company.
Recall
15.15	During a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of a lay off of any employees having seniority rights, if the Company shall require workers the Company shall determine which individuals who were so laid off are qualified to fill the normal requirements of the jobs then available. From among such qualified individuals and to the extent of the number of workers required, the Company shall select those most recently laid off and a notice stating the title of the job for which such individual is considered qualified and the proposed time and place of hiring shall be sent to each such selected individual by registered mail addressed to the last address recorded by the individual with the Manager, Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment of the Company at Thompson, Manitoba. The time of hiring specified in the notice shall be not less than ten (10) days later than the date on which the notice would, in the ordinary course of mail, be received at that address.
Page 49
15.16	Individuals reporting for work pursuant to such notices shall, if they are then qualified to fill the normal requirements of the jobs available, be rehired in the inverse order to that in which they were laid off, and on such rehiring the seniority of such individual shall be computed as though he had continued in the employment of the Company instead of being so laid off and rehired.
15.17	The Company shall not be required to rehire at any time any individuals who shall fail to report for rehiring pursuant to such notice. The Company may fill any jobs available on a temporary basis pending rehiring of those having recall rights as hereinbefore set forth.
15.18	When the individual to whom such a notice has been sent is unable to report for work on the day specified in such notice by reason of sickness, then such individual shall not lose his recall rights by reason only of his failure to report for hiring pursuant to such notice if he shall have notified the Manager, Human Resources, Health, Safety & Environment of the Company at Thompson, Manitoba, in writing on or before the day specified in such notice of his sickness together with a satisfactory medical certificate. In such event, the name of the individual in question will be placed at the top of the recall list, provided that there shall be no right of recall after twenty-four (24) months from the date of layoff.
15.19	An employee who is employed by the Company in the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department may, within five (5) working days of transfer or demotion to another classification due to lack of work, elect to be laid off and governed by the recall provisions set out in this Article 15. In addition, any such employee laid off either by his own election or for lack of work shall not lose his recall rights by reason only of his failure to report for rehiring in a job other than one in his former classification. An employee who elects to be laid off under this Clause 15.19 shall not be entitled to any severance pay under Clause 15.13.
Loss of Seniority
15.20	When an employee is granted leave in excess of two (2) weeks for reason other than disabling accident or illness or other compassionate grounds, no such period of leave shall be counted in determining the seniority of any such employee. Provided, however, that when an employee is granted leave of absence pursuant to Article 17 or Article 24 or Article 25 or Article 26, the period of such leave of absence shall be counted in determining the seniority of such employee.
15.21	An employee shall lose his seniority whenever any of the following shall occur:
(a)	when he voluntarily terminates his employment;
(b)	when he is discharged for cause;
Page 50
(c)	when he is absent without leave for ten (10) or more consecutive working days, unless excused by his Foreman or the Human Resources Department;
(d)	when he fails to report to the Manager of Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment within the time specified by any notice of recall, subject to Clause 15.18 hereof;
(e)	when he fails to report to the Manager, Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment on the expiring of an authorized leave of absence;
(f)	subject to Clause 15.16, when he is laid off.
General
15.22	The Company shall post seniority lists for each department showing the seniority ranking of each employee in such department. No complaints concerning the seniority lists shall be dealt with under the provisions of this Agreement concerning the adjustment of grievances. The seniority lists for each department shall be revised by the Company and brought up to date at least once during each three (3) month period. The Company will provide the Union with a copy of such lists.
15.23	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from transferring to the category of an employee any individual employed by the Company in another category, and (except where such transfer is temporary only), the length of such individual's continuous service with the Company shall be deemed to be accumulated seniority and shall be transferred and placed to his credit.
15.24	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from assigning individuals (including students in any part-time employment) to any job to try out their capabilities and/or to provide them with special training or experience in preparation for broader assignments with the Company or with associated companies, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from promoting, demoting, engaging or dispensing with the services of any such individuals or from directing their efforts from time to time, provided, however, that no such individual shall be assigned to take over the job occupied by an employee if such an assignment would result in the demotion of such employee.
Page 51
Training obtained under this Clause 15.24 subsequent to September 16, 1999 will not be considered in the application of Clause 15.02.
Individuals training under this Clause 15.24;
(i)	will not be considered to be performing work which is normally performed by employees, and
(ii)	will not be considered for temporary promotions or overtime during the day (as defined in Clause 6.03(a)) on which he has been receiving such training.
The provisions of Clause 15.08A(i) shall not apply to individuals training under this Clause 15.24.
The Company shall, from time to time, provide the Union with a list of such individuals, not exceeding at any one time fifty (50) or five per cent (5%) of the employees, whichever shall be greater.
15.25	The Company will endeavour, subject to the requirements of operations, to find employment in his department (or failing his department, another department) which is suitable (in the opinion of a duly qualified medical practitioner) to any employee who has been temporarily or permanently incapacitated by age, disease or occupational accident and is therefore unable to perform his regular work. In the event such employment is not available, the Company may provide training opportunity for a permanently incapacitated employee where he can be qualified for a vacancy in a reasonable period of time. In assigning any such employee to any such employment the Company may disregard the seniority provisions of this Agreement except that such incapacitated employee shall not be assigned to take over a job occupied at the time by another employee unless such other employee is occupying a reserved job on a temporary basis pursuant to Clause 15.27.
15.26	The Company will grant sick leave of up to one (1) year's leave of absence without pay to any employee having seniority rights and seniority of less than nine (9) years and up to two (2) years' leave of absence, without pay, to any employee with seniority

The Company may extend such leaves for such further period as it may decide. The Company when granting any such leave will require the production of satisfactory medical evidence of sickness.
Page 52
15.27	A "reserved job” shall mean any occupational classification identified by the Joint Rehabilitation Committee and mutually agreed by the Company and the Union as being suitable for an employee who, in the opinion of a duly qualified medical practitioner is permanently incapacitated and unable to perform his regular work. In the event of a vacancy in a reserved job, the Company will fill the vacancy in accordance with Clause 15.25. If there are no incapacitated employees capable of fulfilling the requirements of the vacancy, the Company will fill the vacancy on a temporary basis from among the employees regularly working in the department where the vacancy exists, subject to Clause 15.02. Where the factors described in Clause 15.02 are to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more employees, their relative seniority ranking shall govern. Where a reserved job occupied on a temporary basis by another employee is to be filled by an incapacitated employee pursuant to Clause 15.25, the employee occupying the job on a temporary basis shall be reassigned to his regular occupational classification.

18.03	Any Warning, Written Reprimand, Suspension or Notice of Discharge given to any employee shall be given in writing, in duplicate. Where practicable it shall be given within two (2) work days of the time when the incident giving rise to the discipline comes to the attention of the Company.

ARTICLE 20 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Stage One

Prior to setting a date for such meeting, the Company will discuss the matter with an officer of the Union to determine if the matter should be first returned with guidance to the parties involved at an earlier stage for further attempt at resolution. Such meeting will be held within seven (7) days of the date upon which such representations were presented to the Human Resources Representative for Stage Three and, except in unusual circumstances, be scheduled during the working hours of the assigned members of the Grievance Committee. The Grievance Committee shall be represented by not more than three (3) of its members, accompanied, if
Page 59

Every effort will be made to give the decision in writing on behalf of the Company within seven (7) days from the date upon which such meeting is held except in the case of discharge where every effort will be made to give the decision of the Company in writing within seven (7) days from the date upon which the written notice was received by the Human Resources Representative for Stage Three.
20.04	Saturdays, Sundays and general holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action is to be taken in each of the foregoing Stages One to Three.
20.05	Any difference arising between the Union and the Company with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, instead of following the procedure hereinbefore set out, may be submitted in writing by either of such parties to the other, with opportunity for oral discussion between the officers of the Union and the President or his designated representatives. Failing settlement, a date will be agreed upon at this meeting for a further meeting between such senior officials of the Company as the Company may designate for this purpose, and the officers of the Union, who may be accompanied by a representative of the United Steelworkers.
In any event, the parties shall within twenty-one (21) days from the giving of notice as aforesaid, sign a memorandum of settlement, or, if the matter has not been satisfactorily adjusted, the party to whom the matter was submitted shall deliver to the other party a reply in writing to such submission.
20.06	Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union or any employee as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of the Agreement, or should any employee believe that his discharge is a violation of the provisions of this Agreement, and should any party desire to take advantage of the procedure provided for in this Agreement, each step in such procedure (up to and including the appointment of a Board of Arbitration) required to effect a satisfactory disposition of the matter shall be taken by such party within the time limits set forth, or the matter shall be deemed to have been abandoned, unless the time limit applicable has been extended by written agreement between the Company and the Union.
Page 60
20.07	The Company will post notices for each department indicating from time to time the Management Representative for each department designated to handle matters in such department at Stage One of the grievance procedure, and, if no Management Representative shall have been designated, the matter may proceed to Stage Two.
ARTICLE 21 - ARBITRATION
21.01	Where a violation of this Agreement is alleged, or a difference between the parties to this Agreement relating to the meaning or application of the Agreement (including a difference relating to whether or not a matter upon which arbitration has been sought comes within the scope of the Agreement) arises, either party thereto, within fourteen (14) days from the giving of the decision of the Management Representative at Stage Three (or in the event of a difference between the Union and the Company, within fourteen (14) days from the date when the written reply to the submission was or should have been delivered) may notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the alleged violation or difference to arbitration, whereupon the Company and the Union will forthwith make a joint application to the Minister of Labour for Manitoba to have a grievance mediator appointed to assist them in resolving the alleged violation or difference.
At the end of each month all the cases which have been referred to arbitration during that month will be listed chronologically according to the time when, in the case of a grievance, the second stage meeting was held, or in the case of a Company- Union difference, the first meeting was held to discuss it, that case being listed first in which such meeting was held earliest, and then a single arbitrator shall be allocated to each case in sequence from the following panel of individuals:
A Blair Graham, QC William D Hamilton Paul S. Teskey Gavin M Wood
commencing with the name following the name of the last arbitrator allocated and commencing again at the beginning of the panel after coming to the end of the panel and for the purpose of such allocation a case which has been withdrawn from arbitration shall be deemed not to have been withdrawn from arbitration. If no second stage meeting is held on a grievance, the time to be used for the chronological listing will be the time when notice requesting further consideration was given under this clause. If no meeting is held on a Company-Union difference, the time to be used for the chronological listing will be the time when it was submitted in writing under this clause.

ARTICLE 23 - GENERAL TRAINING
Training During Working Hours
23.01 The Company desires to provide an opportunity for employees to qualify for certain higher rated occupational classifications by providing training during working hours. The jobs in which employees may be employed for these purposes are hereinafter called "trainee jobs”.
23.02	There shall be a committee known as the joint "Training Committee” consisting of three (3) employees appointed by the Union and three (3) persons appointed by the Company. The committee will meet at least once every month, and at such other times as may be agreed upon, for the purpose of exchanging and discussing information pertaining to Company training programs and considering specific problems relating to training. These meetings may be attended by the President of the Union and/or a representative of the United Steelworkers and the Manager of Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment. The Committee
Page 67
may request the attendance at the meeting of an individual who has special
knowledge of subjects under discussion.
The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to members of the joint Training Committee.
23.03	Whenever the Company decides that additional employees are required to be trained in such occupational classifications it shall post vacancies for "trainee jobs”, except where the Company is assigning an employee to a trainee job as permitted by this Clause 23.03.
The employees required to fill the vacancies for trainee jobs will be determined in accordance with their respective seniority ranking. In the event that there is no successful applicant for a trainee job, or in the event that a successful applicant for a trainee job is not from among the employees regularly working for the immediate supervisor where the additional training may be required, the Company may, in addition to any successful applicant, assign an employee to such trainee job from among the employees who are working for that supervisor. In making such assignment, the Company will, to the extent permitted by the requirements of operations, give preference according to their respective seniority ranking.
In this Clause 23.03 "deemed qualified” shall mean the employee is considered as having the ability, knowledge and skill to fill the normal requirements of the job, subject to him successfully completing the training required to obtain such ability, knowledge and skill.
Where practicable, the Company shall train the successful applicant either prior to or at least concurrently with the additional employee so assigned. Where it is preferable to the successful applicant, rather than train him concurrently with such additional employee, he shall be deemed qualified to fill a vacancy posted pursuant to Clause 15.10. Where he is the successful applicant for such vacancy, or at such earlier time as is mutually agreed to by the employee and his supervisor, the Company will provide him with the training and provided he successfully completes such training, assign him to the vacancy. Where he does not successfully complete such training, he shall be reassigned to his regular occupational classification which shall have been considered a Temporary Vacancy for the period of his training. In the event that the successful applicant for a trainee job, prior to being trained, is to be laid off pursuant to Clause 15.12, or transferred out of a Department pursuant to Clause 15.04, or demoted pursuant to Clause 15.08, then, provided being successfully trained will result in him not being so laid off or so transferred, or will result in him being demoted to an occupational classification more favourable to him, the Company shall provide him with the training as soon as practicable. Where he does not successfully complete such training, he shall be laid off pursuant to Clause 15.12, or
Page 68
transferred out of a Department pursuant to Clause 15.04, or demoted pursuant to Clause 15.08.
If the employee refuses to accept training or otherwise fails to successfully complete the training in an occupational classification for which he is deemed qualified, he shall forfeit his right to be trained in that occupational classification until he shall again have been the successful applicant for a training job in that occupational classification posted pursuant to this Clause 23.03.
No employee shall be eligible to be assigned such "trainee jobs”,
(a)	who in the judgment of the Company is qualified in such occupational classification;
(b)	who has been successfully trained as a result of a previous training posting within the previous six (6) month period unless waived by the Company in which case the senior applicant will be given preference;
(c)	who within the six (6) month period prior to his application has failed to qualify in the same trainee job for which he is currently applying unless waived by the Company; or
(d)	who does not possess sufficient knowledge ability and skill to justify his being accepted for training.
Upon completion of the training period the trainee will be returned to his former classification.
23.04	A successful applicant for a training job shall be paid during the training period at the rate of his regular classification.
Home Study
23.05	Any employee who desires to take a home study course may prior to commencing such course make application to register the course with the Company's Training Supervisor who will advise the applicant whether or not the proposed course is a work related course and is acceptable to the Company for that individual under the provisions of this Article. A training course in computer skills taken through an approved training or educational organization will be considered a work related course.
23.06	The Company will upon the successful completion of a work related study course, accepted under the provision of Clause 23.05 by an employee, reimburse such employee for the cost of such course taken by the employee provided that at the
Page 69
time of completion of the course the employee shall be in the employ of the Company, unless he shall at such time have been laid off by the Company for lack of work.

APPENDIX B
September 16, 2005
United Steelworkers Local 6166 19 Elizabeth Drive Thompson, Manitoba R8N 1S7
Dear Sirs:
A mutually satisfactory Collective Bargaining Agreement having been entered into between us, this will confirm that:
Commencing September 16, 2005 the Company will provide coverage under the Manitoba Blue Cross Ambulance /Hospital Semi-Private Program.
The Company will provide from this date without modification or amendment save such as may be required by law, and save the amendments hereinafter referred to until September 15, 2008:
(a)	the existing Group Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan.
(b)	the existing Group Life Insurance Plan, modified effective October 1, 2005 to provide sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) for death for all eligible employees under age 65
(c)	the existing Group Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan modified as follows:

If the Average Realized Price for any Quarter in which the Manitoba Operations has positive Division Operating Earnings is $2.25 U.S, each employee will receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the number of hours worked by him, including regular vacation in that Quarter multiplied by ten cents (100) Canadian. If the Average Realized Price exceeds $2.25 U.S., the multiplier used to calculate the lump sum payment will be increased by one cent (10) Canadian for each one cent (10) U.S. by which the Average Realized Price exceeds $2.25 U.S.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement between us respecting summer employment of students.
Every effort will be made to give preference to students having a parent who is an employee.
There are instances where the Company is obliged to give special opportunity to some students for other reasons.

There may be other special instances.
However, subject to the special cases that arise, Company policy will continue to be the giving of preference to students whose parent is an employee.
Notwithstanding the definition "probationary employee” in the Collective Agreement, every student shall be deemed to be a "probationary employee” subject to termination at any time prior to the month of October, without such termination being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.

Dear Sirs:
While the Company and the Union may give different emphasis to the interests of their various constituents, they share the common objective of a successful, continuing operation, functioning in an atmosphere of respect between a strong union and a strong company.
As both parties acknowledge that the ultimate determinant of employment security in the Manitoba Operations is the cost of production, and as recent fundamental changes in the Manitoba Operations have resulted in an increased cost base, the Company and the Union commit that they will actively pursue mutually agreed upon initiatives to address this imperative.
This is an enabling document, intended to formalize the mechanism by which the Union and the employees may contribute to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Operation and thus provide greater employment security, opportunity and enhanced workplace safety and health.
A joint Union/Management committee shall be established with the responsibility to achieve these objectives.
It is agreed that the broad mandate of the committee is to focus upon:
-	improved effectiveness of labour relations.
-	the on-going management of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
-	initiatives to reduce the costs of production, better utilize the plant and equipment and increase product quality without negatively impacting employment security.
The committee shall be governed by the following terms of reference:
Page 156
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.	The committee will be known as the Joint Problem Solving Committee (JPS Committee).
2.	The JPS Committee will consist of up to seven (7) members of the bargaining unit selected by the Local Union President, including the Local Union President, and up to seven (7) representatives of the Company selected by the Company, including the Manager of Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment. A representative of the United Steelworkers may also attend JPS Committee meetings and otherwise be involved in matters dealt with by the JPS Committee. It is recognized that it is most desirable that the JPS Committee initially be comprised of the Negotiating Committees for the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	The JPS Committee will meet at least once in each month or more frequently if mutually agreed. The JPS Committee meetings will be co-chaired by the Local Union President and the Manager of Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment.
4.	It is recognized that replacement of JPS Committee members will from time to time be necessary. In order to minimize the impact on the functioning of the JPS Committee, the parties will endeavour to keep to a minimum the number of individuals replaced on the JPS Committee at any given time.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement reached during negotiations to investigate programs that provide employment counseling to those employees who have been laid off, as the result of one or more major plant closures in the Manitoba Operations that would involve a reduction of one third or more of the total of all employees in the Manitoba Operations at the time of the closure.
An "Employment Transition Committee” consisting of one (1) employee appointed by the Union and one (1) individual appointed by the Company will be established to expedite the process. The committee will co-ordinate the delivery of all applicable government services and programs designed to assist affected employees, in such areas as resume writing, counseling and financial management.
The Employment Transition Committee will make recommendations to the Joint Problem Solving Committee.
Meetings of the Employment Transition Committee will be held as often as required, at mutually agreeable times. The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to the Union representative on the Committee.

Dear Sirs:
We confirm the agreement reached between the Company and the Union with respect to the Earnings Based Compensation Program. The Program will commence effective January 1, 2006 and will terminate September 15, 2008.
While the Company and the Union may give different emphasis to the interests of their various constituents, they share the common objective of a successful, continuing operation, functioning in an atmosphere of respect between a strong Union and a strong Company.
As both parties acknowledge that the ultimate determinant of employment security in the Manitoba Operation is the cost of production, the Company and the Union commit that they will actively pursue initiatives to address this imperative.
This is an enabling document, intended to formalize the mechanism by which the Union and employees may contribute to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Operations, share in its success and provide greater employment security, opportunity and enhanced workplace safety and health.
The Company will develop initiatives to improve the efficiency of the Manitoba Operations. Those initiatives which are of a large scale and suitable for involvement of the Union will be termed "Projects” and will be presented to the Joint Problem Solving (JPS) Committee.
The Company and the Union agree that some of these Projects will appropriately be pursued as Company initiatives only, while others will appropriately be pursued as joint Company and Union initiatives.
All Projects pursued as joint Company and Union initiatives will be carried out in accordance with the following principles:
1.	Disclosure - Through the JPS Committee, the Union will be kept informed of the status of the Projects whether or not the Union has chosen to be directly involved.
Page 169
2.	Choice - The Union shall have the right to decide if it wishes to participate in a Project.
3.	Commitment - Once agreement has been reached to proceed a Project will be completed without regard to other issues between the parties.
4.	Participation - Projects in which the Union has elected to participate shall be overseen by a Steering Committee composed of a maximum of two (2) representatives selected by the Union and two (2) individuals selected by the Company. There will be one (1) individual selected by the Steering Committee appointed as Team Leader for any Project. The Steering Committee, on the advice of the Team Leader, shall determine the appropriate number of participants on a Project Team. The participants on the Project Team will be selected by job class and work area. The Union shall have the right to appoint employees to a Project Team from among those employees affected by the Project. Employee participation on any Project Team will be on a voluntary basis. Time lost by members of a Project Team will be paid in accordance with the provisions of Clause 19.04 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
One objective of the Program is to share a portion of the gains from the success of the
Projects and other changes at the Manitoba Operation with hourly employees. Sharing
will take place as follows:
1.	An Earnings Based Compensation (EBC) payment will, if applicable, be paid to each employee as set out below.
2.	In this Letter of Agreement a "quarter " means a calendar quarter ending March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, or December 31st as the context requires.
3.	The Target Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) at LME nickel price of $3.00 per pound will be 30.8% based on the following 2001 Manitoba Operations Plan production and cost data;
a)	Nickel deliveries of 110 million pounds
b)	Manitoba Operation Capital Employed of $237 million U.S.
c)	Target pre-tax operating earnings of $72.9 million U.S.
4.	The Target ROCE at LME nickel price other than $3.00 per pound will be calculated as follows;
Page 170
Target pre-tax operating earnings at LME $3.00 plus (or minus) the difference between the average LME nickel price for the quarter and $3.00 multiplied by Nickel deliveries divided by Manitoba Operations Capital Employed.
Some examples are; (with result rounded to the nearest first decimal point)
Target ROCE at LME $3.13 = 36.8%
72.9	+[(3.13-3.00) x 1101 x 100
237
Target ROCE at LME $2.75 = 19.1%
72.9	+[(2.75-3.00) x 1101 x 100
237
Target ROCE at LME $2.50 = 7.6%
72.9	+[(2.50-3.00) x 1101 x 100
237
5.	The ROCE will be calculated quarterly at the applicable LME nickel price based on actual pre-tax Operating Earnings and Capital Employed for the quarter and multiplied by four (4) to annualize for comparison to the Target ROCE.
6.	Provided the ROCE for the quarter, annualized for comparison as described in paragraph 5, exceeds the Target ROCE, for each quarter for which the Manitoba Operations reports Net Operating Earnings greater than $8 million U.S. each employee will receive a lump sum payment based on the following:
i.	For every $1 million U.S. by which Manitoba Operations Net Operating Earnings exceeds $8 million U.S. each employee will be paid $0.06 Canadian for each hour worked by the employee during that quarter.
ii.	If the Manitoba Operations Net Operating Earnings in excess of $8 million U.S. for the quarter include a fraction of $1 million U.S. for which no lump sum is payable under subparagraph i of this paragraph 6, each employee will be paid that fraction of $0.06 Canadian for each hour worked by the employee during that quarter.
iii.	The EBC payment for any quarter will not be less than what the Nickel Price Bonus payment for that quarter would have otherwise been and the payment of Nickel Price Bonus will be suspended for the term of this agreement with respect to the Earnings Based Compensation Program.
Page 171
7.	EBC payments will be made in the first pay period following publication of the Quarterly Report of Inco Limited.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached during negotiations respecting Training Instructors.
During the term of the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company will develop the role of Training Instructor.
It is understood and agreed that the development of each role will include;
a)	a role description outlined as per the Company’s Role Description System, and
b)	task assignments (CPQQRT’s) that define specific tasks and expectations, and the measurement of same, and
c)	a selection process based on the Role Description and CPQQRT’s, and
d)	performance reviews as per the Company’s Performance Review System, and
e)	provision for removal from the role where circumstances show that the incumbent cannot meet the accountabilities of the role description and CPQQRT’s.
It is further understood and agreed that the authorities of the roles will not include the authority to issue discipline under the Company’s discipline programs, and reporting relationships and rates of pay will be defined based on expectations of the role. The selection process will involve posting a notice to fill the role(s), and formal assessment of the candidates’ skill, abilities and competencies. The assessment will include an interview and demonstration of skills through appropriate presentations and exercises. The senior candidate meeting the minimum standard established for each of the selection criteria will be assigned to take training to fill the role, and upon successful completion of the training will be assigned to the role.
The decision of the Company to remove an employee from the role, other than where the employee requests such removal, will be subject to review under the grievance
Page 182
procedure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 15.08A the employee will be permitted to return to his former occupational classification provided that the removal occurs within the six (6) calendar month period immediately following his assignment to the Training Instructor role.
The Company agrees that the Union will have input into the development of the role description and selection criteria and such input will be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in its decision making process. A Selection Committee comprised of two (2) representatives of the Company and two (2) employees appointed by the Union will be established for the purpose of assessing the candidates for the role of Training Instructor.
The Union agrees that the establishment of the role of Training Instructor will not preclude salaried staff or other individuals from performing similar functions where such similar functions have traditionally been performed in the past by salaried staff or other individuals.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached during negotiations respecting preferential hiring of hourly rated employees permanently laid off at the Manitoba Operations of Inco Limited. The following is subject to Inco Limited being able to make, in a manner and at a cost that is satisfactory to Inco Limited, all necessary amendments to its collective agreements and pension plans at its Ontario Operations
Where there is a requirement to hire hourly rated employees at the Sudbury Operation or the Port Colborne Operation within the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following a permanent lay off of employees of the Manitoba Operations, and all the hiring criteria at those Ontario Operations have been complied with, preference in hiring will be given to hourly rated employees laid off at the Manitoba Operations, subject to the following conditions.
To be eligible for preferential hiring a laid-off employee must make application and satisfy all education, skill and experience and medical requirements of the hiring location. Where, in the opinion of the Company, the factors described above are to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more laid off employees, preference in hiring shall be given to the laid off employee with the greatest seniority. The Company’s decision regarding employment of a laid-off employee shall not be subject to review under the grievance procedure at the hiring location.
Where a laid-off employee is hired pursuant to this letter of agreement, service at the Manitoba Operations at the date of lay off will be credited at the hiring location for the purpose of determining the amount of vacation to which the employee is entitled. Except where the laid-off employee has elected to take the commuted value of the pension, the number of Years of Employment with Pay (YEWP) at the Manitoba Operations will be credited to the pension plan in existence at the hiring location, The seniority of the employee so hired will be calculated based on that employee’s most recent date of hire at the hiring location.

The following will confirm our joint commitment respecting the reduction of contracting out, which commitment supports the common objective of a successful, continuing operation and contributes to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Operations.
To support this commitment, the parties have agreed to the following:

and relevant information to facilitate their work. This includes a general knowledge of systems and key process elements related to contracting out. As such, they will be provided access to the following:
i. )	contract, tendering, purchasing and accounting processes; and
ii. )	relevant information broken down by class of expense, general ledger, project
number, standing work order, repair and returns, standing contracts, and monthly Departmental status reports.
b.	) Facilities and Equipment: The Company shall endeavour to ensure that the
appointed Contracting Out Committee Area Representatives are provided access to a working area and computer terminal. In the event that such arrangement cannot be readily provided, it is understood that the office of the Worker Safety Representative shall be made available.
c.	) Training: Members of the Contracting Out Committee shall be provided training
as may be required on related systems (CORVU, EXCEL, Ellipse) as well as an overview on our Manitoba Division Accounting structure and contract administration process.
d.	) Resourcing for Success: Contracting Out Committee Area Representatives shall
be granted up to two (2) shifts per month to support our joint commitment to reduce contracting out. This two (2) shifts per month maximum will include time off to attend monthly Contracting Out Committee meetings. In the event of a dispute with respect to the use of these shifts, the matter shall be referred to the Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee for resolution. On a trial basis for the term of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, a full-time Union Co-Chair position will be created, with duties and accountabilities as outlined in Role

e.	) An Executive Steering Committee shall be appointed that includes the President
of the Local Union, the President of the Manitoba Operations and the Company and Union Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee. The Executive Steering Committee will meet quarterly to provide direction, review progress, assess effectiveness, set objectives and offer support to the Contracting Out Committee as may be required. The Executive Steering Committee will also meet at the request of either the Company or the Union to resolve disputes, deal with emergency situations, or provide leadership support to the Contracting Out Committee.
f.	) Scope and Accountabilities: It is agreed that in order to achieve the common
objectives of reducing contracting out and costs an examination of contracting out beyond the limitations of Clause 3.03 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement may be appropriate. The Contracting Out Committee will examine such contracting out opportunities and make recommendations as appropriate, based on these common objectives. The Company will apply careful consideration and substantial weight to any such recommendations.

Should either party wish to terminate this Agreement upon the expiry of the initial twelve (12) month period and any subsequent twelve (12) month period agreed to by the Company and the Union, that party shall provide thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other party. If no such notice is provided, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for a further period of twelve (12) months.

Dear Sir:
We confirm our agreement to facilitate the collection of information pertaining to the creation of a Senior Years Apprenticeship Program.
The Company and the Union will jointly investigate opportunities to partner with the School District of Mystery Lake and/or other such interested parties, on terms and conditions to be discussed and mutually agreed upon between the Company, the Union and the partner(s). These opportunities will provide work experience for individuals through programs such as the Senior Years Apprenticeship Programs and the Community Partners Programs (Example: Nelson House Training Authorities).
The creation of a Senior Years Apprenticeship Program will not affect the ability of Inco employees to participate in an internal apprenticeship program.
Participation in either the Senior Years Apprenticeship Program or Community Partner Programs is conditional upon the continued participation by the company in our own internal apprenticeship program.
While the Company may give preference in hiring to those individuals who successfully complete a Senior Years Apprenticeship Program as part of their course of study, it is understood that the Company is in no way obliged to employ any individual who participates in the Senior Years Apprenticeship Program.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached between us concerning advanced notification of retirement, which is designed to support our common objectives of filling vacancies in a timely manner and reducing costs.
Employees who, after September 15, 2005, provide nine (9) months’ written notice to the Company of their last day of actual work prior to retirement ("Notice of Retirement”) will receive fifty dollars ($50.00) for each completed Year of Employment With Pay as at their date of retirement, less required deductions.
The provision of Notice of Retirement is voluntary and those employees who provide Notice of Retirement may thereafter revoke it by providing written notice to the Company prior to the effective date of their retirement. Employees who revoke their Notice of Retirement will not be entitled to a payment pursuant to this Agreement unless they thereafter provide a new Notice of Retirement.
Either the Company or the Union may terminate this Agreement by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other party. Those employees who, before the termination of this Agreement, provided Notice of Retirement will receive fifty dollars ($50.00) for each completed Year of Employment With Pay as at their date of retirement, less required deductions, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance at the end of the attached copy of this letter and returning it to us.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties to establish a Joint Occupational Health Study Program for the Manitoba Operation.
The Divisional Co-Chairs of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee, the Health and Environment Worker Representative, the Superintendent of Environment, Health and Occupational Medicine and the Chief Medical Officer for Inco Limited shall meet for the purposes of identifying potential occupational health issues for study and establishing guidelines with respect to such studies.
The Company shall pay the cost of all necessary external resources associated with any such occupational health studies up to a maximum amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in each year for the next three (3) years. If less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) is spent on necessary external resources in the first or second of the next three years, the difference between the maximum amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) and the amount spent in the year shall be available to pay for such expenses in the immediately following year.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached between us during negotiations regarding mines development work related to the Capital Appropriation Request (CAR) 602 - Thompson Mine 1D Lower Project ("CAR 602”).
It is understood that CAR 602 will constitute a major capital project and the work involved in this type of project has been consistently performed by contractors in the past. Nonetheless, the Company agrees to provide to employees the opportunity to compete for work associated with CAR 602. It is further understood that some specialized work, including, but not limited to, Alimak raise drilling and ore pass widening, will not form part of this opportunity.
Phase One of CAR 602 is scheduled to begin in May 2006. Phase One has crucial project deadlines and targets that must be met in order to ensure that the required overall production levels of the Manitoba Operations can be maintained. To that end, the parties agree to work together to discuss the production, cost and safety targets which must be met by employees in order for them to receive the opportunity to be assigned by the Company to work associated with CAR 602. During this process, the results achieved by the 376 Stope ‘pilot project’, which was successful in utilizing employees while delivering results ahead of schedule, above plan and below cost, will serve as a model to guide the parties.
If the involvement of employees in Phase One of CAR 602 proves successful, this will present further potential opportunities for employees to successfully compete for and perform additional mines development work associated with CAR 602. In that regard, CAR 602 is expected to involve five phases. If further ore reserves are subsequently discovered in the 1D Lower area of Thompson Mine and suitable business case
Page 199
opportunities are identified, the future potential for employees to perform this type of work could be significant.

STATEMENT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Inco Limited, Manitoba Operation and the United Steelworkers, Local 6166, are jointly committed to maintain a work environment that is free of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated and any person who is in breach of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action or discharge.
Inco Limited, Manitoba Operation will not knowingly permit the sexual harassment of any person and will take all reasonable steps to terminate such harassment, as required under the Human Rights Code of Manitoba.
Sexual harassment is any unsolicited and unwelcome sexually oriented behaviour. It may include but is not limited to the following:
-	unwanted sexual attention of a persistent or abusive nature, made by a person who knows or ought reasonably to know that such attention is unwanted; or
-	implied or expressed promise of reward for complying with a sexually oriented request; or
-	implied or expressed threat of reprisal, in the form either of actual reprisal or the denial of opportunity, for refusal to comply with a sexually oriented request; or
-	unwelcome remarks, jokes, innuendos, propositions, or taunting about a person's body, attire, sex or sexual orientation; or
-	displaying of pornographic or sexist pictures or materials.
An individual who is being subjected to any form of sexual harassment may tell the offender that what is being said or done is offensive and ask that such behaviour stop or report the incident, at the earliest opportunity, to a union steward or committeeman, or a supervisor or other management personnel.
