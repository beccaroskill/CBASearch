5.08.4	No employees shall be transferred from one
plant to another without the employee's consent, except in the event that a specific classification is required and an employee in that classification can be spared from another operation within the Company, then the employee may be transferred without consent, provided the employee's seniority is retained in the original plant. In the case of such temporary compulsory transfers from one plant to another seniority will be immediately transferred.
14
5.08.5	The individual involved in such compulsory transfer may be returned to the employee's "Home Plant" as soon as the circumstances requiring the transfer have been overcome, and/or within a maximum period of six months from the time of transfer and/or at the end of the season. Compulsory transfers shall not sub ject the individual transferee to a lesser period of employment during the year than the employee would have received if not transferred.
5.09	Leave of Absence
5.09.1	Unless otherwise noted, provisions for leave of absence apply to regular employees only.
5.09.2	Seniority rights of employees shall not be affected if inability to report to work arises from sickness or from reasons acceptable to the Company. Absence for reasons other than sickness, if for a period in excess of one week, must be covered under the following leave of absence conditions.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE_________________________________
21.01	During the life of this Agreement, should any difference arise concerning the interpretation, application, operation, or any alleged violation of this Agreement, including any question as to whether any matter is arbitrable or should any local trouble arise in a plant, there shall be no stoppage of work or strikes on the part of the Union nor shall there be any lockouts on the part of the Company.
21.02	In the event that a grievance or dispute arises, the Shop Steward Committee shall function as the Grievance Committee and the members thereof shall be afforded such time off without pay deduction as may be required to attend the necessary meetings with the Management. At major plants, where there is a large number of Shop Stewards, the Shop Steward Committee shall elect a subcommittee who shall with the Chief Shop Steward and the Shop Steward rep resenting the section in which the grievance has occurred, 'constitute the Grievance Committee. Nothing herein shall prevent the holding of meetings between the Management and the full Shop Steward Committee if the need arises.
21.03	It is the general interest of both parties to prevent the elevation of minor questions into for-
58
mal grievances and, as a possible means to this end, employees are urged to raise grievances imagined or otherwise with their foreman as quickly as possible. Employees have the right to go directly to their departmental Shop Steward if they wish to do so.
211.04 The successive steps to be taken in the handling of any grievance until it is settled shall be set forth as follows:
Step One:
The employee shall notify the departmental Shop Steward of any incident which gave rise to the grievance as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the incident which gave rise to the grievance. The Shop Steward shall immediately approach the Departmental Supervisor, Plant Manager or Personnel Manager (which ever is appropriate) to resolve the grievance with or without the employee in attendance.
Step Two:
If the grievance remains unresolved at Step One, the departmental Shop Steward shall apprise the plant's Chief Shop Steward of the details of the grievance. The grievance shall be placed in writing and include details of the alleged violation and reference to the pertinent section(s) of the Agreement. Upon receipt of the written grievance, a meeting shall be arranged between the Grievance Committee and Plant Management in a further attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is one that is complex in nature or involves the oper-
59
ation of a seniority plan, either party may request the assistance of, and where necessary, the attendance of, a representative from their respective Headquarters.
Step Three:
If the grievance remains unresolved, the Union may provide any additional information deemed necessary in writing to the Company. The Company shall place in writing its reasons for rejecting the grievance. When the exchange of written positions is complete, a meeting shall be arranged between representatives from Headquarters of the Union and Headquarters of the Company for a final attempt to settle the grievance. Should this meeting fail to settle the matter in dispute, step four may be invoked.
Step Four:
If the grievance remains unresolved each party shall appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to nominate a third impartial arbitrator who shall act as Chairperson of the Arbitration Committee. Failing to agree upon such an impartial arbitrator within three (3) days of their appointment, either party may request the Honourable Minister of Labour to appoint such an impartial arbitrator. In the case of a grievance or dispute involving interpretation of this Agreement, the majority decision of arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, no decision of such Arbitration Board shall change this agreement
in wording or format. Where the parties mutually agree, a single arbitrator may be used.
21.05 Where, after exhausting the first three steps of the grievance procedure of this agreement, a difference remains between the parties relating to callouts, seniority issues, pay issues (individual cases), leaves of absence, vacation issues, bereavement issues, the discipline of an employ ee (other than discharge), or any other matters the parties may mutually agree to, including any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable, Mr. D. McPhillips or Mr. B. Greyell, in rotation, or a substitute agreed to by both parties, shall at the mutual request of both parties:
a)	Investigate the difference,
b)	Define the issue in the difference, and
c)	Make an order in writing, with reasons, for final and binding settlement of the dispute within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of the request, or such extension of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
d)	Notwithstanding (c), where the parties have mutually agreed before the request is sub mitted, the arbitrator shall make written recommendations to resolve the difference within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of request, and for those twenty (20) days time does not run in respect of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
61
As the process is intended to be non-legal, the parties will present their own arguments.
All presentations are to be short and concise and are to include a comprehensive opening "statement", The parties agree to make limited use of authorities and such witnesses as are necessary during the presentation of their cases.
Prior to rendering a decision, the arbitrator may assist the parties in mediating a resolution to the grievance.
All decisions of the arbitrator are to be limited in application to that particular dispute and are without prejudice. These decisions shall have no precedential value and shall not be referred to by either party in any subsequent proceeding.
The parties shall jointly apply to the Minister of Labour for payment of remuneration and expenses of the arbitrator to be made in accordance with S.112 of the Industrial Relations Act, Any remuneration and expenses not paid under that section shall be borne equally by the parties to this agreement.
If both parties agree, other matters may be referred to the troubleshooter for either recommendations on how to resolve the dispute or for resolution, depending on the particular dispute.
21.06 If, after ninety (90) calendar days of its instigation, the grievance has not been settled, either party may refer the matter to arbitra-
62
tion or the grievance shall be deemed abandoned. If either party decides to go to arbitration, they must advise the other party of their nominee within ten (10) calendar days of the decision to go to arbitration or the grievance will be deemed abandoned. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent of both parties, it being agreed both parties are interested in and will strive to achieve settlement of all grievances or disputes in the shortest possible time.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT
PREAMBLE_________________________________________
The Parties endorse the principle of equal opportunity for employment and that in so far as is practicable, the order of call out to work should be made without regard to gender. The Parties shall therefore undertake the following measures to achieve the principles.
The Parties signatory to the 1992/1994 Shoreworker Master Agreement agree:
1.	The Parties will endeavour to ensure that there shall be no discrimination between employees with respect to seniority or job opportunity, either in fact or by description.
2.	That each plant shall set up a small working committee to review plant procedures with respect to call-outs, job postings, training and related matters. Each plant committee will include representation of the Shop Steward Committee and local plant management and the committee's task shall be to:
a)	Assess the application of seniority and call-out arrangements to ensure opportunity for employment is equal without regard to gender.
b)	Review problems and complaints as they
114
may arise to discourage the elevation of such complaints to the level of grievances.
c)	Ensure as much as possible that all proce-
dures shall be designed to provide equal opportunity for all employees to all jobs based on seniority, skill, ability, and requirements of the job.
d)	Shall assist in undertaking a review of classifications and rate structure including the base rate plus premium proposal as well as possible implementation of the 1000 hour rate (by increments if necessary) and forward any recommendations to the 1994 negotiations).
e)	Where the seniority lists for a plant department or working group are impediments to the objectives of this memorandum, Headquarters of the Union and the Company shall attempt to agree to revise seniority lists and/or plant seniority plans in consultation and with the approval of the Company and of the Union's mem-, bership directly affected.
The Parties will make every effort to ensure the small working committees shall be set up at each plant by December 31, 1992. The committees shall meet as often as is * required, but at least quarterly. Minutes of all meetings shall be forwarded to the headquarters of the Company and the Union as soon as possible following such meetings.
115
3.	The Parties acknowledge this is an ongoing process and shah endeavour to have the necessary changes made by April 15, 1994 or such other date mutually agreed upon. Any procedures agreed upon prior to this date may be implemented immediately.
4.	If there is a conflict between this memorandum and the collective agreement, the collective agreement shall apply.
