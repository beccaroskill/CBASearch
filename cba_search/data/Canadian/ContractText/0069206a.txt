LETTER OF INTENT
Mr. Dave Ramsey,
President,
Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada,
Local 10,
Aylmer, Ontario
Dear Mr. Ramsey,
In order to protect future export business and thereby protecting the future job security of the employees, the Company will, from time to time, have a volume of tobacco to be processed which is in excess of the plant capacity. In these situations, it will be necessary to have that tobacco processed outside the Aylmer plant in order to prevent the loss of customers.
The Union will be advised prior to this tobacco being processed outside the Aylmer plant and will be informed of the reasons, quantities involved and the timing. ’Die Union will also be consulted in determining ways and means of minimizing the quantities involved through methods which would be appropriate under the circumstances, such as additional overtime shifts.
Yours truly,
A. Nyilas,
Plant Manager
