SECTION I - PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
The purpose of this Agreement is to secure for the Company, the Union and the employees the full benefits of orderly and legal collective bargaining, and to ensure to the utmost extent possible, the safety and physical welfare of the employees, economy of operation, quality and quantity of output, and protection of property. It is recognized by this Agreement to be the duty of the Company and the Union and the employees to cooperate fully, individually, and collectively, for the advancement of said conditions.
The Company and the Union agree to abide by the terms set out in this Agreement. The Union further agrees that it will, at all times, instruct its members to act in accordance with the terms contained in this Agreement. The Company agrees, in the exercise of the functions of Management, that the provisions of this Agreement will be carried out.
The Company and Union subscribe to and support the principles of all federal and provincial legislation.
All terms in this Agreement are intended to be gender neutral. As such, all references to man, men, he, him, or his shall also imply woman, women, she, her, or hers.
SECTION II - RECOGNITION
1.	The Company recognizes Local 18, Public and Private Workers of Canada, as the only bargaining agent representing all employees as defined in this Agreement.
2.	The term “Employee” as used and for the purpose of this Agreement shall include all persons employed by the Company on whose behalf the Public and Private Workers of Canada, Local 18, has been certified as bargaining agent except and excluding
Page I
foremen and others having authority to hire and discharge, office workers, supervisory officials and salesmen.
3.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in obtaining and retaining as members the employees as defined in this Agreement, and to this end will present to new employees, and to all Supervisors and Foremen, the Policy herein expressed.
The Company will include a copy of the PPWC Bylaws and the introduction of new employees to a Shop Steward in its “Employee Induction Program”. The employee should be introduced to a Shop Steward within his first week of work.
4.	All employees in the employment of the Company, and all new employees, shall within thirty (30) calendar days after the execution of this Agreement, or thirty (30) calendar days after entering employment, whichever date last occurs, become members of the Union and maintain membership therein throughout the term of this Agreement, as a condition of continued employment.
5.	Any employee who fails to maintain his membership in good standing in the Union by reason of failure to pay dues or assessments shall be discharged after seven (7) days written notice to the Company by the Union of the employee’s failure to maintain his membership in good standing.
6.	(a) No employee shall be subject to any penalties against his
application for membership or reinstatement, except as may be provided for in the Public and Private Workers of Canada National Constitution and in accordance with the Bylaws of Local 18.
Page 2
|0
(b)	Any employee, who applies for membership pursuant to the provisions of 6(a) above, will not have his application rejected.
7.	The Company shall require all new employees, at the time of hiring, to execute an assignment of wages for union dues in duplicate, the forms to be supplied by the Union, and will forward one copy to the Union within fifteen (15) days of execution.
8.	This assignment in the case of employees already members of the Union, shall be effective immediately and for those employees not previously members of the Union, it shall become effective thirty (30) calendar days from the date of execution.
9.	The Company shall remit the dues deducted pursuant to such assignment (until and unless said assignment is revoked in writing by the employee) to the Local Union named therein not less than once each month, with a written statement of names of employees for whom the deductions were made and the amount of each deduction.
10.	The Union and the Company recognize that supervisors are excluded from the provisions of the Labour Agreement and accordingly it is improper for supervisors normally to do the work which is done by those defined as employees in the Agreement.
It is also recognized that, for the practical and efficient operation of the mills, there are occasions when a supervisor must help. Such occasions must be temporary in nature and must not result in the displacement or exclusion of employees under the Agreement.
Page 3
SECTION III - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

2.	The Company confirms its commitment to continue its present practice of issuing pay statements to afternoon shift employees on the day prior to the regular pay day at the times posted by the Company. It is understood by the Union that in some circumstances this may not be possible and, in such cases, statements will be issued on the regular pay day.

(d)	Laid off regular employees shall have preference for available work over the said casual employees.
(e)	The Company agrees that Alternate Shift schedules will not be introduced where the intent is to increase the use of Casual Employees in place of Regular employees.

Page 9
7.

Page 10
SECTION VII - SENIORITY
1.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, it shall be mutually agreed that all employees are hired on probation, the probationary period to continue until thirty (30) days have been worked, during which time they are to be considered temporary workers only, and during this same period, no seniority rights shall be recognized. Upon completion of thirty (30) days worked, they shall be regarded as regular employees, and shall then be entitled to seniority dating from the day on which they entered the Company’s employ, provided, however, that the probationary period of thirty (30) days worked shall only be cumulative within the three (3) calendar months following the date entering employment.
2.	The Company recognizes the principles of seniority in their application to the promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and recall of employees, providing the employee has the qualifications and ability to perform the work properly.
3.	(a)	(i) In the event of a reduction of the forces, the last hired
shall be the first released, subject to the provisions of Subsection 2 of this Section. Where a reduction of forces is caused by emergency conditions the application of seniority may be postponed for such a period as may be necessary but not exceeding three (3) working days except that the Union and Company may agree to extend this period to a maximum of five (5) working days. If the Company decides to exercise its rights under this provision, it shall notify the Union immediately.
(ii)	When the mill or a portion thereof is shut down for maintenance purposes on normal production days for a period in excess of one (1) shift, production employees
Page 11
affected who wish to perform the work available will be selected in accordance with the principles outlined in 2 above and will be paid at regular rate for the work performed.
(iii)	When the mill or a portion thereof is shut down during a normal production shift, the Company may require employees to perform alternative work for the balance of that shift at their regular job rate or the rate of the alternative job, whichever is greater.
(b)	During a reduction of forces where an employee’s seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his incumbency, he may elect to apply his seniority to obtain a job paying a higher rate if he has previously held the job in the operation as an incumbent or has worked as a relief operator for sixty (60) days.
(c)	During a reduction of forces where an employee’s seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his incumbency, he may elect whether or not to apply his seniority to obtain a lower paid job or a job paying the same rate of pay or return to his last posted job or job vacancy. Where a change of departments is required, the employee will have the seniority in that department for posting purposes only.
(i)	It is recognized by the Company that a certain amount of training and/or retraining will be required. The intent is to refresh skills, not to introduce new and unfamiliar skills.
(d)	An employee may accept a lay-off until his incumbent job becomes available, provided, however;
(i) If during the lay-off period the employee wishes to return to work and so notifies the Company, he shall be
Page 12
called back to work as soon as his seniority entitles him to a job.
(ii)	The application of this provision shall not result in an employee, in the exercise of his rights, bumping an employee with less seniority.
(e)	An incumbent who is laid off from his incumbency may apply his seniority as in Clauses (3) (b), (c), and (d) above.
(i)	He will maintain seniority in the department he is laid off from so long as he is not awarded a posting in another department.
(ii)	Ineligibility will be waived on job postings.
4.	When employees are recalled after lay-off, it shall be done on the basis of the last person laid off shall be the first person recalled, subject to the provisions of Subsection 2 of this section and the following:
(a)	It shall be the employee’s responsibility to keep the Company informed of his address and phone number during a period of lay-off.
(b)	Sufficient notice of recall shall consist of notification by registered mail, by telephone, or by personal contact.
(c)	It is agreed that all employees shall return to work as quickly as possible after receiving notification of recall in accordance with this Section and shall retain all their seniority rights.
(d)	Failure to report within one (1) week shall result in loss of seniority rights, except where the employee advises the Company of his inability to return, in which case the one (1) week may be extended.
Page 13
5.	Incumbent-Relief and other seniority lists that the Company may use will be made available to the Union every month.
6.	It is agreed between the parties that seniority during lay-offs shall be retained on the following basis:
(a)	Employees with less than one (1) year of service will retain their seniority for a period of eight (8) months.
(b)	Employees with one (1) or more years of service shall retain their seniority for one (1) year plus one (1) additional month for each year of service, up to an additional eighteen (18) months.
7.	The purpose of this section is to provide training so that an employee may apply his seniority in the event of his lay-off or the permanent elimination of his job as outlined below. This section does not apply to the reduction of seasonal or temporary shifts or positions except as in (a) below.
(a)	Any employee affected by lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of forty-five (45) days will follow procedures outlined in SECTION VII - SENIORITY.
(b)	Any employee affected by a lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of forty-five (45) days and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 2 level, may elect to be trained in Group 2, 3, or Planer Group. Normal training periods shall apply.
(c)	Any employee affected by a lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) working days and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising
Page 14
his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 1 level may elect to be trained in Group 1, 2, 3, Planer Group, or a Key Job. Normal training periods shall apply.
(d)	Any employee affected by a permanent lay-off and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 1 level may elect to be trained in Group 1, 2, 3, Planer Group, or a Key Job.
(e)	For the purpose of the above clauses, all Group 1 positions will be considered the same as each other, all Group 2 positions will be considered the same as each other, all Group 3 positions will be considered the same as each other, and all Planer Group positions will be considered the same as each other.
In addition, the Company will meet with the Union to establish a training program in other jobs with the objective of eventually placing laid off personnel in line with their seniority. Phasing-in arrangements of such a program will be discussed between the parties to accomplish the objective with minimal impact on quality and quantity of production.
An employee may only use this section to exercise his seniority to be trained for a job at an equal or lower rate than that which he held at the time of the lay-off or permanent loss of job.
Page 15
SECTION VTII - LEAVE OF ABSENCE
1.	(a) Any employee desiring leave of absence for any reason other
than those set out in 2 and 3 of this Section must obtain same in writing from the Company, a copy of such leave to be forwarded to the Local Union.
(b) Where any employee is granted a leave of absence under this Section for a period of longer than thirty (30) calendar days, the Company agrees to notify the Shop Steward and the Union as to the circumstances for the granting of such a period of leave.
2.	The Company will grant leave of absence to employees suffering injury or illness, subject to a medical certificate if requested by the Employer.
3.	(a) The Company agrees that it is proper to grant leave of
absence to employees who have been elected or appointed to an office or position in their Union or who have been nominated or elected to Federal, Provincial, or Municipal office. However, it is not the intention of the Company to grant lifetime leaves of absence. In the case of an employee being appointed or elected to a full-time office or position in the Union, he shall be granted as much leave as is necessary during the term of such office.
Seniority shall accumulate during the period of an employee’s leave of absence.
Employees elected to Federal, Provincial, or Municipal office shall be granted as much leave as necessary during the term of such office.
Page 16
(b)	The Company will grant leave of absence to employees to attend Union meetings and Union conventions, or members of any Union Negotiating Committees in order that they may carry out their duties on behalf of the Union.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if leave of absence for Union business is requested for several employees of the same department or work group and in the event that their absence will impair production or prohibit the normal functioning of the operation, then the Company shall have the right to grant leave of absence only to those employees who can be given leave. Such leaves of absence shall not be unreasonably denied.
(c)	It is agreed that before the employee receives this leave of absence as set forth in Clause (a) and (b) above, the Company will be given sufficient notice in writing by the Union to replace the employee with a competent substitute.
(d)	The Company will consider request for leave of absence for educational or training purposes. In judging such requests, the Company will consider the following:
(i)	The course must be appropriate to the employee’s present job or immediate potential with the Company on successful completion.
(ii)	Leaves of absence will not be granted where the efficient operation of the mill or any department is affected.
(iii)	Employees must apply in writing at least one (1) month in advance of the requested leave of absence.
(iv)	Employees must have at least one (1) year of service.
(v)	Request for leave of more than six (6) months duration will not normally be granted.
Page 17
Benefit plans will be maintained during the leave of absence but the employee will pay the entire cost of such plans.
(e)	(i) It is agreed that employees may be required to
temporarily fill positions outside the Bargaining Unit. These employees will be allowed to fill such positions for a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) working days in each calendar year and shall continue to accumulate seniority during this time. The one hundred and twenty (120) working days may be extended subject to mutual agreement between the Union and the Company.
A maximum of five hundred fifty (550) days will be allowed. This total will exclude all employees removed from the bargaining unit to fill non-supervisory positions. This total will exclude all employees removed from the bargaining unit to fill supervisory positions where a supervisor is temporarily absent for a continuous period of more than two (2) months because of illness or injury.
Upon returning to the Bargaining Unit, those employees will return to the job held prior to the temporary assignment providing their seniority will allow them to take the position.
Where an employee is transferred to a temporary position under this Sub-Section, the Company will notify the Union and Crew Shop Steward, in advance if possible, and will post a notice in the appropriate lunch room(s).
Page 18
(ii)	In the event of a lay-off, a temporary Supervisor will be used in that position only so long as his seniority entitles him to a position in the mill.
(iii)	It is agreed that an employee who accepts a salaried position outside the Bargaining Unit may elect to return to the Bargaining Unit at any time within one (1) calendar year of transferring to the salaried position. The employee’s seniority will be maintained but will not be accumulated during the one-year period. If the employee elects to return to the Bargaining Unit, he may exercise his Wood Products Seniority to obtain a job through the normal posting procedure. Employees who elect this option will be required to pay back dues for the appropriate period when they return to the Bargaining Unit.
4.	Jury or Witness Duty
Any regular, full-time employee, who is required to perform Jury Duty, or who is subpoenaed to serve as a witness in a Court Action or Coroner’s Inquest, save and except actions involving the Company or Trade Union, unless subpoenaed by the Crown, on a day on which he would normally have worked, will be reimbursed by the Company for the difference between the pay received for such duty and his regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for his regularly scheduled hours of work. It is understood that such reimbursement shall not be for hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week, less pay received for such duty. The employee will be required to furnish proof of performing such service and such duty pay received.
Employees on jury or witness duty on an alternate shift schedule will receive the pay equivalent to that received had they worked their full scheduled shift.
Page 19
Bereavement Leave
(a)	When death occurs to a member of a regular full-time employee’s immediate family, the employee will be granted funeral leave of absence for which he shall be compensated at his regular straight time hourly rate of pay for his regular work schedule.
Five (5) days paid funeral leave will be granted to an employee attending the funeral when its location is outside a five hundred (500) kilometer radius of Mackenzie.

Capital Project Gain Share Plan — Mackenzie Division
In order to accelerate the successful start-up of the capital investment at the Mackenzie operation, the company proposes to establish a short-term incentive plan designed to allow employees to participate in gains achieved through exceeding the expected start-up curve of the project
The project start-up curve represents the minimum threshold required to justify the capital investment, and both the company and the employees can benefit if the start-up curve can be surpassed. The key elements of the gain share program are outlined below;
•	The program will be based on sawmill productivity exceeding the minimum threshold levels described in the start-up curve
•	Sawmill productivity will be measured as average net mfbm / hour for the prior 3-month period
•	Total sawmill production volume must meet or exceed the planned sawmill production volume for the 3-month period, in order for there to be any payout under this plan
•	Total planer production volume must also meet or exceed the planned planer production volume for the 3-month period, in order for there to be any payout under this plan
•	This plan will exist for the duration of the start-up curve only, and will conclude at the end of the 12th month following the start-up of the new sawmill facility
The chart below illustrates the start-up curve and minimum threshold sawmill productivity levels expected for this project, as well as the opportunity to accelerate the start-up.

Page 121
Re: Trades Guidelines and Demarcation
The Company and the Union recognize the principle of trade lines and job demarcation as practiced in the mills prior to July 1, 1986 for the purposes of interpreting the Trades Flexibility Section outlined below.
Trades Flexibility
1.	Tradesmen may be assigned work in other than their own trade under the guidance of a qualified hourly tradesman in the trade in which the work is being performed.
2.	Tradesmen may be assigned work in trades other than their own consistent with the tradesman’s ability, keeping safety factors in mind.
3.	Tradesmen may be required to take on-site training for duties that are normally performed by other trades.
(a)	The objective is to provide training to develop skills so that trades people can assist in other trades and not to eliminate other trades or tradesmen.
(b)	Apprenticeships will be distributed as stipulated otherwise in the Contract.
4.	The traditional division of work between production and maintenance is not altered by the above agreement. Employees of either department will not be assigned work that would have the effect of displacing employees of the other department.
Page 122
It is understood that there must be cooperation between maintenance and production to further the efficient operation of the mills. Production employees may be assigned to assist tradesmen as labourers and maintenance personnel may run production equipment for maintenance purposes.
Re: Trades Attrition
The parties recognize that with the implementation of Trades Flexibility in the mills the opportunity to reduce the crew complement in the Maintenance Department will exist.
The Company therefore agrees that any crew reductions in the Maintenance Department resulting from the implementation and utilization of Trades Flexibility will be accomplished by attrition and that no Maintenance Department Employee will lose his job in the Maintenance Department as a result of the above.
This shall not limit the right of the Company to reduce maintenance department crews in conjunction with any other department(s) curtailments or cutbacks or to dismiss for cause.
It is understood that if maintenance department crews are reduced as a result of any other departments curtailment or cutback, when and if that department returns to its former level of operation those maintenance department employees affected by the curtailment or cutback will be returned to the maintenance department complement.

Temporary Summer Students
Students hired for temporary vacation relief in the plant will only appear on plant seniority lists as a separate entry entitled, Vacation Relief-Students.
If during the student’s term of employment as a vacation relief he applies for permanent employment, his application must be directed personally to the Human Resources Department.
Such applicants will be considered for permanent work providing they meet normal mill standards of entry.
Upon satisfactory meeting of entrance standards, the applicant will be placed in job openings as they arise and will only begin to acquire plant seniority upon commencement of permanent work.
Re: Company Reports and Lists
The Company will provide the following reports and lists to the Union:
1.	Attendance/Absenteeism Report
2.	Job Posting Report (Scribble Sheet)
3.	Overtime Report
4.	Seniority Report
5.	Vacation Taken Report
Page 124
These reports should be provided to the Union quarterly or as frequently as they are normally produced.
Expires: June 30, 2014
Re: Vacation Pay
All employees will have their regular hourly wage rate paid through the regular payroll system for any time taken as vacation except for those employees who elect to take a lump sum payment of all vacation earning accruals. All remaining vacation earning accruals will be paid the l51 Friday after the Is1 pay following December 31st.
Explanation:
For the purpose of scheduling vacation the only change will be that employees will have to have taken their minimal allotment prior to December 31s1.
For the purpose of scheduling vacation during ‘primetime’ (mid-June to Labour Day, third week of December to New Year's Day and Spring break) employees requesting vacation for the period between January lsl and May 31SI will be required to have submitted their vacation requests prior to November IS41. Those employees requesting vacation for the period between June 1st and December 31s' will be required to have submitted their vacation requests prior to April 15th.
In order to facilitate the transition from the current practice to that proposed, we are suggesting that all vacation pay accrued since June 1, 2004 (minus any vacation pay advances taken during the same period) will be paid in January 2005. In situations where an employee’s ‘number of hours’ of vacation entitlement (as per clause 3.(ii)) is greater than
Page 125
their percentage of earnings they would receive the equivalent of 7/12’s of their allotted annual vacation.for 2004 (for the seven (7) month period from June 1 to December 31, 2004).
Effective January 1, 2005 all employees would then qualify for their annual vacation and their minimum entitlement would have to be taken before December 31, 2005. This being the case, employees w'hom had already scheduled 2004 vacations for the period between January 1, 2005 and May 31, 2005 would need to reconfirm whether or not they wished to have this time counted as part of their 2005 vacation allotment. Special consideration will be given, on a case-by-case basis, to any employee that has purposely retained the majority of their 2004 vacation allotment for planned vacations scheduled for a time prior to May 31, 2005. Those that had done so would just need to plan accordingly and retain sufficient 'vacation pay’ for their needs from the proposed January 2005 vacation pay accrual ‘pay-out’.
Re: Removal of Discipline
An employee's discipline record will be considered “clean” if he/she has no discipline for two (2) consecutive years of service. For the purposes of the above statement, the employee’s discipline record will remain intact however the historical discipline record will not be used as part of progressive discipline for future incidents of misconduct.
Exceptions to this clause will include any incidents of serious misconduct (theft, harassment, intoxication due to drugs or alcohol at work, assault or threats of assault, or gross insubordination).

Re: Equalization of the Opportunity for Overtime
The Company will endeavor to provide equal opportunity to overtime
for all employees. Employees will be called in to work overtime hours
based on the following principles:
1.	Overtime hours will be balanced semi-annually (June & December) to the effect that employees in the same job will have the opportunity to work approximately the same number of hours of overtime.
2.	Opportunities to work overtime will consider first the employees scheduled to the position, second a trained posted employee, and third an employee who has previously been trained. Employees who transfer from one job to another will be considered to have the average overtime accrual of all employees in that position.
3.	For the purpose of calculating overtime hours accrued, all overtime worked will be calculated at straight time hours and all overtime opportunities where the employee was not available or where the employee refused the shift will be included.
4.	Weekend overtime shift schedules will be made up from a voluntary sign-up sheet. Only those employees who sign that sheet will be selected for weekend overtime shifts.
5.	Employees who do not wish to be called for overtime must complete a form to that effect.
Expires: June 30, 2019

The contributions will be one cent ($.01) per hour worked per employee effective January 1, 1998; two cents ($.02) per hour worked per employee effective January 1, 1999; and three cents ($.03) per hour worked per employee effective January 1, 2000. The Company will increase contribution of $0.01 per hour in each year of the first three years of the new Collective Agreement for a total increase of $0.03 over the five year term of the Collective Agreement.
Company contribution to educational trust fund for employees working the twelve (12) hour weekend shift will be paid on the basis of forty (40) hours worked.
3.	The Funds will be directed to the Education Trust Fund by the Company.
4.	The Education Program Fund will be jointly directed and managed by a committee of two representatives from the company and two representatives from the union as appointed by the Company and PPWC Local 18.

Page 128
Education Fund Policy Statement
The strength of the PP WC Local 18 relies on the continued commitment of the membership to effect positive change. There is an increasing need for our leaders and membership to understand and respond to emerging issues affecting the Forest Industry and/or our membership. We need to renew and build upon the historic principles of the PPWC Local 18 through a comprehensive education program which will enrich union membership and enhance the objectives of the PPWC Local 18 as a proud and progressive union.
To this end, the Trustees will develop and deliver a wide range of programs which may include:
Grievance Handling Land Use Issues Leadership Training Health and Safety Public Speaking
Collective Bargaining Stewards Training Economic Issues Union History
Environmental Issues Communications Skills Benefits Training Parliamentary Procedure
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Fund will be used to develop and deliver programs, and to pay for administrative costs, time lost from work to attend education and training, travel, accommodations and such other reasonable costs as the Trustees determine appropriate regarding the operations and administration of the Fund.
