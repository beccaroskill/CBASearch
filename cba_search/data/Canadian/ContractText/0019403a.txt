LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - No. 1 BETWEEN
FORDING COAL LIMITED AND
THE UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA LOCAL 9702
SUBJECT: Counselling Interviews
The Company uses a counselling procedure regarding improvements or lapses in employee work performance and recognition of meritorious work performance. Generally, the supervisor involved prepares a Counselling Interview Report (C.I.R.) after such counselling sessions. A counselling session is a matter between the supervisor and the individual employee.
One purpose of counselling is to identify and correct lapses in work performance so that formal disciplinary action will not be necessary. Without such a procedure, it is likely that there would be far more discipline given out for what could be easily correctible work performance situations.
In all cases where a C.I.R. is prepared for filing, the employee will be advised and given the opportunity to read, discuss, and sign (as acknowledged of having read) the C.I.R. with his supervisor. Each employee will be given a copy of the Counselling Interview Report if requested.
The counselling procedure is a positive step in establishing and maintaining good relationships between employees and supervision.
The parties agree to meet to discuss any concerns re: the application of this procedure.

When an existing job is changed, the supervisor shall review the changed Job Evaluation Description with the Company Committee Chairman.
The Company Committee Chairman will assign a temporary job group, if necessary. The changed Job Evaluation Description and the temporary assigned job group will be reviewed immediately with the Union Committee Chairman.
The Joint Committee Chairmen will set an evaluation date, if necessary, which shall not exceed 120 calendar days from the day the change is effected.
Three (3) weeks prior to the evaluation date the changed Job Evaluation Description shall be reviewed by the supervisor and the employee to finalize and sign. The Joint Committee Chairmen will be available to assist if required.
Finalized copies of the changed Job Evaluation Description shall be forwarded to the Company Committee Chairman for distribution to the Union Committee Chairman for joint evaluation, if necessary.
(c)	On a continuing basis, the Company will ensure that each Job Evaluation Description is reviewed at least once every four years.
(d)	All jobs reviewed in joint session will be classed as completed, incompleted, or disputed jobs. The following definitions will be used to determine the classifications:
(i)	Completed Jobs:
Jobs which have been evaluated to the satisfaction of the two committee chairmen.
(ii)	Incompleted Jobs:
Jobs for which the Job Evaluation Descriptions are found to be incomplete or in error.
103
Incompletejobs will be reviewed again in joint sessions within thirty (30) calendar days. This time limit may be extended by mutual consent of the two chairmen.
(iii)	Disputed Jobs:
Jobs which have been reviewed in joint session but have not been ranked due to disagreement.
In the case of disputed jobs, the Company ranking will be used to establish the job groups. The Union will then have fifteen (l5)working days to refer the matterto arbitration. The partiesagree that the decision handed down under this procedure will be binding on both the Company and the Union.
(iv)	In the event of wrong job group applications due to clerical error, the error will be corrected immediately and the proper salary paid. Rate protection will not apply to job incumbents in case the proper salary is lower than the former wrong salary. The Union Committee Chairman will be notified immediatelyof the wrong job situation and the action taken.
(v)	The Company will keep the Union Chairman advised of all jobs which cease to be active.
(vi)	The Joint Job Evaluation Committee will endeavor to obtain consensus on all jobs referred to it.
Committee decisions will be binding to both the Company and the Union.
(vii)	When the Joint Committee has established the permanent job group for the job, the Company will process the necessary authorizations.
(viii)	When joint evaluation of an existing job results in a higher job group, the rate will be retroactive to the date of request as per 2(d), unless it is mutually agreed that some other date should apply. When the job group is lowered, the applicable rate protection provision of red or blue circling will apply.
104
(ix)	“Red Circling”
When a job group of a job is a lowered due to evaluation, the applicable rate protection provision of ”red circling” shall apply.
“Red Circled” employees shall receive 80°/o of the wage increase applicable to the standard for the job on which they are the incumbent until such time as the “red circle” differential disappears. “Red circled” employees who are fifty-five years of age or over or who have had twenty years of service or over on the date that any increase becomes effective shall receive the full amount of the standard increase.
(x)	“Blue Circling”
’’Blue circling” shall be applied to the current incumbents of jobs affected by job evaluation changes under the following circumstances:
1.	The job group of a job is reduced as a result of the implementation of a new job evaluation plan.
2.	The job group of a job is reduced because of changes to an existing job evaluation plan.
3.	The salary of an employee is higher than the highest salary of a job group due to transition from a system providing for separately rated jobs with performance premiums above the standard salary to a system where the maximum salary levels are attained on a time basis.
Employees who are “blue circled” shall receive the full salary increase applicable to the new job group in which the job falls.
“Blue circle” protection shall cease when an employee is promoted to a new job, the rate of which is equal to or higher than his salary at the time of promotion.
