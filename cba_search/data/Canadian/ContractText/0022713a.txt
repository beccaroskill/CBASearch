THIS AGREEMENT made the 3rd day of December, A.D., 2012 , effective the 1st day of May, 2012.
BETWEEN:
AND:
ARTICLE 1. 1.01
UNITED STEELWORKERS, CLC, for itself and on behalf of its Local 7552 (hereinafter called "the Union”)
OF THE FIRST PART
Agrium, Vanscoy Potash Operations (hereinafter called "the Company")
OF THE SECOND PART
PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
This Agreement is entered into for the purpose of promoting and
12
continuing the existing harmonious relations between the parties, to establish settled conditions of employment and to ensure the prompt and equitable disposition of any grievances which may arise.
ARTICLE 2.	EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT
2.01	The word "employees" as used in this Agreement means all employees of the Company in its Potash Operation except supervisors, foremen, superintendents, managers, office and clerical staff (including clerical staff in warehouse), laboratory staff, plant security and any persons having, and regularly exercising, authority to employ or discharge employees or regularly acting on behalf of management in a confidential capacity, at the mine site situated approximately seven km North of No. 7 Highway between Vanscoy and Delisle, Saskatchewan.
2.02	Words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine.
ARTICLE 3.	UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative for the purpose of conducting collective bargaining regarding rates of pay, hours of work, working conditions and other employment conditions of employees and will continue to do so as long as the Union retains its rights to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of such employees under the law.
3.02	(i) The Company reserves the right to employ independent contractors to
perform work at the Operation it deems necessary or desirable. However, the Company recognizes the Union's concern over the Company employing contractors to work as part of regular maintenance crews or to perform routine maintenance work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunities for the employees. The Company will therefore attempt to minimize the employment of such contractors having due regard to the needs of the efficiency of the Operation, the time available to do the work and to the availability of equipment, skills, manpower, engineering, supervision and services. While the Company may also contract out work not normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit, it shall, whenever practicable, and especially during layoffs, have such work performed by employees within the bargaining unit.
(ii)	The Company agrees that it will not contract out any work at the Operation if, as a direct result, an employee will be demoted or laid off, and such employee is qualified to perform the work.
(iii)	The Company will inform the Union prior to the beginning of each
13
month of the number of contractors scheduled or expected to be used during the coming month and the nature of their work. The Company will also, during the month, advise the Union of any additional contractors scheduled to work on the property during the month. For purposes of this Section, contractors shall mean any contractor employing trades or labourer employees on site.
(iv)	Following receipt of the notification provided in (iii) above, the Union may request a meeting with the Company to discuss the information provided. Such meeting shall be limited to the Union President and the Union Vice President, or their designates, and one contracting out committee member and will occur either immediately prior to or following the monthly Company - Union meeting. At such time, the Company will also be prepared to review, with the Union, contracts issued for off-site work.
3.03	The Company recognizes that it is not the function of forepersons,
acting forepersons, supervisors and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement to repetitively perform work which is currently being performed by an employee in the bargaining unit where qualified employees are reasonably available to do such work, except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimentation, protecting the safety of employees or equipment or in emergencies.
ARTICLE 4.	TERM OF AGREEMENT
4.01	This Agreement shall remain in effect from and including date of
ratification up to and including the 30th day of April, 2015.
ARTICLE 5.	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
5.01	The Union recognizes the undisputed right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities and to make and alter from time to time rules and regulations to be observed by employees, which rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The Union further recognizes that the Company retains all the customary rights, responsibilities, functions and prerogatives of management, except as expressly modified or restricted by a clause of this Agreement.
5.02	Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate the Company to continue to operate any of its plants or properties or any part thereof.
5.03	The Company shall always have the right to hire, to discipline, demote and discharge employees for just and sufficient cause. The selection of supervisors, acting supervisors and lead-hands shall be entirely a matter for the Company's decision.
14
ARTICLE 6.
NO DISCRIMINATION
6.01	The Company agrees that there shall be no intimidation or discrimination against any employee by reason of his/her legitimate activities as a member, activist, shop steward, or officer of the Union. The Union agrees that there shall be no intimidation or discrimination on its part towards any employee of the Company by reason of his/her not being a member of the Union.
6.02	The parties agree that there shall be no discrimination against any employee with regard to race, religion, creed, colour, sex, sexual orientation, family status, marital status, disability, physical size or weight, age, nationality, ancestry, place of origin, or receipt of public assistance.
The parties also recognize the right of employees to work in an environment free from harassment of the above grounds, and the parties shall undertake to investigate all alleged occurrences between or among employees with all possible dispatch. If it is found that any of these types of harassment has taken place, the parties shall take whatever joint action is appropriate to ensure harassment ceases.
ARTICLE 7.	NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
7.01	The Company shall not cause or direct any lockout of employees
during the life of this Agreement; and neither the Union nor any representative thereof, nor any employee, shall in any way authorize, encourage or participate in any strike, walkout, suspension of work, or slow-down on the part of any employee or group of employees during the life of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 8.	UNION ACTIVITIES ON COMPANY TIME
8.01	No person shall solicit membership in the Union or in any other labour organization, or collect dues for the Union or any other labour organization, or engage in any Union or labour organization activity on Company time or within the plants of the Company, except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement.
8.02	The time spent away from the job by employees in performance of duties as designated members of a jointly-recognized safety committee will be considered as time worked and shall be paid in accordance with Article 10.05 (i).
8.03	The time spent away from the job in investigating and settling disputes by employees delegated by the Union for that purpose shall be considered as time worked. Payment shall be on the basis of straight time. Under no conditions shall overtime rates be paid. Time to be paid for under this shall be limited to seven hundred (700) hours per calendar year.
15
8.04	The Company will provide the Union up to seven hundred and fifty
(750) hours paid leave per calendar year at straight-time rates to be authorized by the President or designate.
ARTICLE 9.	LEAVES OF ABSENCE FOR UNION PURPOSES
9.01	The Company agrees to grant leave of absence without pay to
employees for the business purposes of the Union or of the International of the United Steelworkers for the purposes and in the manner specified below.
(i)	Any employee elected or appointed to an office of the Union or of the International of the United Steelworkers, necessitating a leave of absence, shall be granted such leave of absence without pay provided it does not exceed two (2) years.
Written application for such leave must be made to the Manager, Human Resources, of the Company two (2) weeks in advance of the commencement date of the leave. The Company shall not be required to grant the privilege under (i) to more than two (2) employees at the same time. The time spent on leave shall not in any way jeopardize an employee's seniority, nor service for pension purposes, but shall not be considered as time worked for the purpose of determining vacation or other benefits.
(ii)	The Company agrees to grant leave of absence without pay to employees who are delegated by the Union for the purpose of attending conventions, labour arbitrations, labour seminars or grievance matters. The aggregate leave of absence granted under (ii) shall not exceed three hundred (300) days in any one (1) calendar year.
Permission for such leave(s) shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Union agrees to give as much advance notice as is possible of the requirement for such leave(s) of absence.
(iii)	For leaves of absence requested in writing by the Union President or designate as unpaid union business the Company agrees to pay the employee his base wages and all applicable premiums for the scheduled work time missed and bill the Union for that amount plus 15% to cover vacation and pension costs.
9.02	The Company may grant a personal leave of absence in
exceptional circumstances where the denial of such leave of absence would cause undue hardship to the employee.

Until further notice from the Company to the Union, the approval referred to need not be obtained.
ARTICLE 12.	SENIORITY
12.01	(i) Seniority shall be established on the basis of an employee's service with the Company's Potash Operation, whether broken or continuous, according to the records of the Company. Should such records not be available, then other Company validated documentation may be used. The only exception is when it applies to an employee who voluntarily quits and is subsequently rehired.
In such cases, seniority will commence from the new date of hire for the purpose of calculating plant seniority. All new and prior service will be used in calculating pension and benefits coverage.
19
However, employees hired prior to March 23, 1987, shall continue to be credited with their total Company Employment Service. It is recognized that an employee's security shall increase in proportion to the employee’s length of service and in accordance with the provisions of 12.03.
(ii) In the event that two or more employees start on the same day, then their seniority shall be determined by lottery.
12.02	Employees shall not be deemed to have any seniority until they have worked 700 hours (excluding Jury Duty) after they were last hired by the Company.

(v)
Special Assignment Employees
Employees hired by the Company for a special assignment of work may be discharged when their employment at such special assignment of work comes to an end notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary. The Union shall be notified of such employees and their status in writing. Special assignments will be limited to a maximum duration of one (1) year total service. This time limit may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and Union.
Special assignment employees do not accrue service or seniority during the term of their assignment. Special assignment employees may apply at any time for permanent positions and may be considered by the Company.
Special assignment positions are not subject to the posting provisions of Articles 15.02 and 15.09.
Work assignment will be determined solely at the discretion of the Company.
Special assignment employees who have worked at least 720 consecutive hours and are subsequently hired as permanent employees will not be required to serve a probationary period as per Article 12.02.
20
12.05
(vi)	Special assignment employees who are subsequently hired as permanent employees will be granted service and seniority retroactive to their original date of hire.
(vii)	Existing employees are not eligible to apply for special assignment roles.

(ix)	Special assignment workers will not be permitted during periods of layoff.
(i)	In the event of a reduction of crew or layoff, employees affected shall be laid off in inverse order of their seniority and in accordance with Article 12.03. If an affected employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability, to meet the normal requirements of another job, that employee can displace a junior employee. A displaced junior employee can then exercise the option to displace a more junior employee provided that employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of that job.
When it is necessary to increase the workforce, former employees who have completed their probation period shall be re-employed as closely as possible in the inverse order in which they were laid off, providing they have the qualifications, ability and physical fitness for the job for which they are being recalled.
In the event of a reduction of crew or layoff that exceeds twenty-one (21) days or recall for a temporary position that is expected to exceed twenty-one (21) days, the Company will provide up to five (5) working days for familiarization training for the employees exercising the displacement option. If the employee demonstrates the qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of the job by the end of the fifth day, the employee will be put into the job. The determination as to whether or not an employee has acquired the necessary skills and ability for the job shall be made by the Company. The Company shall make the determination in a fair and equitable manner.
The Company will provide four (4) positions in total (in the three progressions - mine operating, mill operating, warehousing) to which senior employees, displaced in the event of a crew reduction
21
or layoff, could move without having the qualifications for the job; provided that the senior employee has the ability and physical fitness to do the job and the junior employee to be displaced does not need to be retained because of skills or certification for the ongoing required work.
The employee's maximum wage loss will be one wage rate unless this is higher than the top wage rate in the new job. In this case, the employee's new rate would be the top rate in the new job.
The Company and the Union will meet prior to any crew reduction or layoff to explore all possible options for employees being displaced and who are qualified to do other jobs.
(ii)	It shall be the responsibility of a laid-off employee to notify the Company of any change in the employee’s postal address. Laid-off employees who have complied with the foregoing procedure shall be notified by the Company, either personally or by registered mail at their last known address, of the date on which they are to report for work; and should an employee fail to report within fourteen (14) days of being notified personally or within fourteen (14) days of the postal registration date of the written notice, the employee shall lose the right of re-employment. In any case, the Company shall not be obligated to re-employ any former employee who has been laid off for a period equal to the lesser of the employee's seniority or twenty-four (24) months, or thirty-six (36) months if the employee's service is greater than ten (10) years.
(iii)	Layoff Notice
In the event of a layoff the following notice periods or pay in lieu will be given:
a)	Two (2) weeks written notice, if the employee’s period of employment is less than three (3) years;
b)	Four (4) weeks written notice, if the employee’s period of employment is three (3) years or more but less than five (5) years;
c)	Six (6) weeks written notice, if the employee’s period of employment is five (5) years or more but less than ten (10) years;
d)	Eight (8) weeks written notice, if the employee’s period of employment is ten (10) years of more.
Period of employment will be defined as an employees’ length of seniority with the Company.
22
12.06
12.07
(iv)	The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six (6) days or less, or if any employee is recalled for a specific, limited period of work during a general layoff. The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
Transfers to and from the Bargaining Unit
(i)	The Company will not transfer staff employees who were previously members of the Bargaining Unit back to the Bargaining Unit. Any staff employee who was previously a Bargaining Unit member who desires to return to a Bargaining Unit job would return, assuming a job is available, with no seniority. Such employee would first have to resign as a staff employee.
(ii)	An employee who transfers from an hourly-rated job to a staff position outside the Bargaining Unit shall retain all seniority held at the time of the transfer and will reactivate such seniority if the employee returns to the Bargaining Unit within a three (3) month period following such transfer. In the event the transfer is for more than three (3) months, the employee shall lose all retained seniority. This paragraph does not apply to temporary acting supervisory positions.
Acting Supervisors and Lead Hands
(i)	The acting supervisor is generally expected to assume all the normal responsibilities and duties of their immediate supervisor with the exception of administering discipline.
(ii)	The Company will limit an individual’s acting foreman assignment to one thousand and forty (1040) hours worked in any calendar year subject to the needs of the operation. The employee will not accumulate seniority for any hours worked in excess of the one thousand and forty (1040) hours for that calendar year as long as he/she continues in the assignment.
(iii)	A lead hand acts as a leader of a group of employees working on similar or related work, or leads activities with minimal direction in a significant or complex area. The lead hand assigns work to the employees, as directed by the supervisor or acting supervisor, and works along with them. The lead hand is expected to be a work leader and not a supervisor. As such, the lead hand is responsible for the safe and correct completion of work but not for disciplinary action or other personnel matters.
23
(iv)	The Company’s policy defines the complete and specific responsibilities and duties of a lead hand and acting supervisor.
(v)	The Company agrees to provide copies of all lead hand and acting supervisor hours to the Union on a quarterly basis.
12.08	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, an employee shall be on probation until such person has worked seven hundred (700) hours, computed from date of last hire. Upon completion of such probation period the employee shall be credited with seniority from the date of hire. During the probationary period the Company may terminate the employee’s employment for cause, without reference to any other provisions of this Agreement. Union activity shall not be considered as a reason for discharge under this Section. This clause shall not apply to employees re-employed in accordance with Section 12.05.
12.09	The Company shall maintain and post a seniority list including occupational classifications, which list shall be revised quarterly. Two (2) copies of the list shall be provided to the Union.
ARTICLE 13.	PROCEDURE FOR SETTLING DISPUTES
13.01	Should a dispute arise between the Company and any employee or employees regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement, the employee or employees concerned shall first seek to settle the dispute with the immediate supervisor. Both parties agree that this should be the first step in a dispute resolution process and nothing in this Article shall prevent an employee from discussing the dispute with the Company.
Grievance Procedure
13.02	Stage 1. Failing an employee’s satisfactory settlement of a dispute with the Company, the employee or employees concerned, in person, with their shop steward in attendance, shall first seek to settle the dispute with the immediate supervisor.
13.03	Stage 2. Failing a satisfactory settlement within five (5) working days after the dispute was submitted under Stage 1, the employee or employees concerned, in person, with their shop steward and/or a member of the Grievance Committee of the Union in attendance, or through the Grievance Committee of the Union, may submit the dispute, which at this stage must be stated in writing, to the Superintendent who may appoint members of his/her staff to assist in investigating the dispute.
13.04	Stage 3. Failing a satisfactory settlement within five (5) working days after the dispute was submitted under Stage 2, the Grievance Committee of the
24
Union may submit the dispute, which shall be stated in writing, to the management of the Company, or the accredited representative or representatives of the management, who may at their discretion require the employee or the employees concerned, and the members of the supervisory staff concerned in, or having knowledge of, the dispute, to appear before them and give evidence regarding the dispute.
The Grievance Committee of the Union may request the presence of the employee or employees concerned at Stage 3 proceedings, but where this necessitates the absence of the employee from the place of work, the employee shall first obtain the consent of the Company and it shall be at a time and a duration that does not interfere with the Company's operations.
The person whom the Union has designated as its Area International Union Representative may appear with the Grievance Committee of the Union at the Stage 3 presentation of a grievance. The Company shall be advised by letter from the United Steelworkers, CLC, of the identity of the Area International Representative.
13.05	Arbitration.
(i) Expedited Arbitration. Failing a satisfactory settlement at Stage 3 both parties may then mutually agree to take the matter to Expedited Arbitration. Expedited Arbitration will be binding, set in an informal atmosphere, and used when a difference arises between both parties relating to the dismissal, discipline, or suspension of an employee, or to the interpretation, application, operation, or alleged violation of the Agreement including any question as to whether a matter is arbitral.
The parties agree that the purpose of Expedited Arbitration is for the fair and quick settlement of disputes. Once the parties agree to Expedited Arbitration, the selection of an arbitrator shall be from the panel listed in 13.05 (ii). If there is no arbitrator available from 13.05 (ii), a substitute may be agreed to by the parties within ten (10) days. The rotational system for arbitrators as outlined in 13.05 (ii) will be used to determine who will hear the dispute. The arbitrator shall:
(a)	investigate the difference
(b)	define the issue in the difference
(c)	not alter, modify or amend this agreement in any respect
(d)	render a decision within five working days of the hearing.
The arbitrator may, with discretion, render a verbal award to the parties at the conclusion of the hearing, but in all cases a brief written decision shall be rendered within the above time frame. This five-day time limit does not run in respect of the grievance procedure.
The procedures for Expedited Arbitration shall be as follows: A maximum of four (4) people from each party shall attend. The grievor shall be
25
considered as one of the four (4) members of the Union's committee. No case law, jurisprudence, or witnesses shall be used.
The hearing shall be in an informal setting with no need for swearing-in testimony. Both parties shall have fifteen (15) days to notify the other in writing of their wish to proceed to Expedited Arbitration.
(ii) Formal Arbitration. If either party does not wish to utilize the Expedited Arbitration procedure as outlined in this article, the Union or Company may, on giving fifteen (15) days notice in writing to either party of its intention, refer the dispute to arbitration. The selection of an arbitrator shall be by rotation from the panel listed below.
1.	Robert Pelton	(deceased)
2.	William Hood
3.	Ken Norman
4.	Gary Semenchuck
If an arbitrator so selected is unable to serve, then the next arbitrator on the panel shall be selected. If an arbitrator on the panel is permanently unable to serve, then the parties shall jointly select a replacement. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days, the appointment shall be made by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Saskatchewan upon request of either party. The decision of the arbitrator in respect of an interpretation or alleged violation of this Agreement, shall be final and binding upon the parties, but in no event shall the arbitrator have the power to alter, modify or amend this Agreement in any respect. Each party shall pay the expenses incurred in connection with the presentation and preparation of its own case. The parties shall bear in equal shares the expenses of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall render a decision.
13.06	If a dispute (i) is not submitted under Stage 1 within fourteen (14) calendar days after the occurrence or discovery of the act or decision giving rise to the dispute, or (ii) is not advanced to the next stage under Stages 2, 3, or arbitration, within fourteen (14) calendar days after a decision was made or should have been made, then the dispute shall be deemed to be abandoned, and all rights of recourse to the dispute procedure shall be at an end. Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action must be taken under (ii) above.
13.07	The Company shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Grievance Committee of the Union. Failing a satisfactory settlement within seven (7) days of the submission in writing of the dispute by the Company, the Company shall have the right to refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with this Article.
13.08	In the meantime, and in all cases while disputes are being investigated and settled, the employee or employees and all other parties
26
involved, except an employee serving a disciplinary suspension, must continue to work, but where an employee or employees has or have been discharged by the Company, employee or employees shall not remain in the employ of the Company while the case is being investigated and settled. If the claim be made within five (5) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) that an employee or employees has or have been unjustly discharged, the case shall be dealt with according to this Article, and if it is proven that the employee or employees has or have been unjustly dealt with, the employee or employees shall be reinstated. If a claim is made for compensation for time lost in cases where reinstatement has followed, it shall be left with the Grievance Committee of the Union and the Management to decide what amount, if any, is to be paid, and failing agreement, with the same arbitrator that dealt with the claim and who shall fix such compensation.
13.09	The procedure for settling disputes set out in this Article shall be strictly adhered to, but the Union shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Company at Stage 3 where:
1.	There is no aggrieved employee or employees possible of identification at the time the dispute arose; or
2.	The grievance involves Company policy in which case the grievor or grievors possible of identification shall be noted on the face of the grievance form.
All Union grievances filed at Stage 3 shall be signed by the Grievance Chair or a designated member of the grievance committee, or the union executive members. The union will provide the company with a list of these designates.
13.10	Notwithstanding marginal paragraphs 13.02, 13.03, 13.04, 13.05 and 13.06 above, in a grievance involving a discharge the grievance must be presented directly at Stage 3 of the grievance procedure by the Grievance Committee of the Union. The Stage 3 reply shall be given within five (5) working days of the presentation of the grievance at Stage 3.
13.11	As much as is practical and except in a case of gross misconduct and/or a case requiring immediate action, it is the Company's intention that an employee, accompanied by the employee’s Shop Steward and the Grievance Committee Chairperson or delegate, will be given the opportunity for a hearing with the supervisor(s) in question prior to receiving a disciplinary suspension or a discharge. Such hearing will be without prejudice to any subsequent grievance or arbitration procedures.
13.12	If it is necessary for a steward or other employee to take time off during working hours in connection with a grievance, the steward or employee
27
must first receive permission from his/her immediate supervisor. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13.13	Any time limits provided for in this Article may be varied by the mutual consent of the Company and the Union and confirmed in writing.
13.14	The company agrees to provide copies of employee discipline, terminations and suspensions to the Union within five (5) calendar days.
13.15	(i) In all cases involving discipline or suspension, the disciplinary notice
will remain on the employee’s file. However, after a period of three (3) years without further incidents of discipline, it will not be used to elevate subsequent disciplinary action.
(ii) The presence of a shop steward is mandatory at any meeting during which an employee receives discipline. The absence of a shop steward due to reasons beyond Company’s control will not preclude such meeting from proceeding. An employee may choose to ask his/her steward to leave once the meeting has begun.

ADDENDUM A
Addendum A to the Agreement between Agrium, Vanscoy Potash Operations and the United Steelworkers, CLC, Local 7552, shall be frozen and not payable for the term of the Agreement.
COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE
1.	Each employee covered by this Agreement shall receive a cost of living allowance (COLA) during the term of this Agreement as hereinafter provided.
2.	The cost of living allowance shall be based on the Consumer Price Index (all items - base 1961 = 100) published by Statistics Canada (hereinafter referred to as CPI).
3.	The cost of living allowance shall be equal to one cent (10) for each 0.3 point rise in the CPI as hereinafter determined counting as a full cent any fraction of one-half cent (1/20) or more.
4.	Adjustments to the cost of living allowance shall be made as follows:
(a)	Should the CPI for March, 1983 (as published in April, 1983) exceed the CPI for March, 1982 by more than twelve percent (12%), a COLA will be generated to pay one cent (10) for each 0.3 point rise in the CPI in excess of twelve percent (12%).
(b)	The COLA generated by this formula will become payable the first full pay period following publication by Statistics Canada of the official index for March, 1983 and will be incorporated into the hourly base rates in effect at that time as indicated in Schedule A.
5.	The parties to this Agreement agree that the continuance of the cost of living allowance will depend upon availability of the monthly Statistics Canada CPI in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the index for November, 1978. If Statistics Canada changes the form or basis of calculating the CPI the parties shall attempt to determine an appropriate index figure by agreement. If agreement is not reached the parties agree to request Statistics Canada to make available for the life of this Agreement a monthly CPI in its present form calculated on the same basis as the index for November, 1978.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
10 HOUR SURFACE COMPRESSED WORK WEEK
SCHEDULE
between
AGRIUM
VANSCOY POTASH OPERATIONS
(Hereinafter called the "Company")
and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED
STEELWORKERS) on behalf of its Local 7552 (Hereinafter called the "Union")
Revised Date: November 15, 2012 PREAMBLE
The Company and the Union agree to implement a 10 Hour Compressed Work Schedule effective the date of ratification, that averages 40 hours of work over a defined work week. All the provisions of the current Collective Agreement in effect at that time shall prevail save and except as follows.
SCOPE
For the purpose of this Agreement this 10 hour compressed work week schedule would be applicable to surface employees not normally assigned to an existing 12 hour rotating compressed work week schedule. The company reserves the right to determine the application and suitability or the implementation or discontinuation of a 10 hour shift schedule for any crew or work area.
55
DETAILS
Entire crew placed on a 10 hour schedule
Description: The Company is considering putting some or all crews that are currently on 8 hour dayshifts onto 10 hour dayshifts in the future (either Monday to Thursday, Tuesday to Friday). This implementation of a 10 hour shift schedule is not intended to occur immediately upon ratification of the agreement, but will be considered during the life of the agreement.
Implementation: It is recognized that this shift may be desirable to many employees, and have benefits of employee retention and efficiency. The Company intends to weigh the merits of the 10 hour shift schedule for various dayshift crews, and implement a new 10 hour shift schedule for crews where it makes sense to do so.
The implementation of a 10 hour shift schedule for any given crew must be agreed to by the majority of that crew. The new 10 hour shift schedule will be given a 6 month trial period. At the end of the 6 month trial period, in order to continue the 10 hour shift schedule, the majority of employees on the crew must agree.
Should the 10 hour shift schedule for any crew be terminated, all employees will revert back to their previous (8) hour shift schedule and the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at that time will apply. Overtime will not be paid if incurred as a result of implementing or discontinuing the 10 hour shift schedule.
The company will reserve the right to cancel any and all 10 hour shift schedules for any crews that are in place if the desired results are not being achieved.
HOURS OF WORK
Maintenance 10 hour day shift (days) will be defined 7:30 am to 5:30 pm daily. Tailings 10 hour day shift will be 7:00 am to 5:00 pm daily (April to October only) The Dry 10 hour day shift will be 6:00 am to 4:00 pm daily.
WORK SCHEDULE
The defined work week for the 10 hours shift shall be one of the following:
1.	Monday through Thursday
2.	Tuesday through Friday
3.	Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Saturday (Dry Only)
56
Work schedules as outlined in this LOU shall not be altered, and their start and stop times will not vary, without mutual consent of the Company and the Union.
PREMIUMS
All premiums in the current collective agreement apply.
SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
Shift differential will begin to be paid for all hours worked on afternoons after the completion of an eight (8) hour dayshift as per article 16.01.
LUNCH PERIODS
The daily coffee/lunch periods shall be two (2) ten (10) minute breaks and one (1) twenty (20) minute break, on Company time, during which time employees shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
VACATIONS
Employees working a ten (10) hour shift schedule must take their vacation hours in full ten (10) hour shifts.
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
Public holidays for the Dry persons are to be observed as per Article 17.01 (i). All others on ten (10) hour shift are to be observed as per Article 17.01(ii)
RESCHEDULING IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
The company reserves the right to schedule any and all of its employees back to an 8 hour shift schedule as defined in the current collective agreement during a period of any emergency that would cause normal operations to cease. This rescheduling will be done without any payment of overtime. As much advance notice as possible will be given to the employees.
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
This LOU will terminate with the expiration date of the current collective bargaining agreement unless both parties agreed to otherwise. The Company or the Union may also terminate this agreement by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.

AGRIUM
VANSCOY POTASH OPERATIONS
(Hereinafter called the "Company")
and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED

Revised Date: November 15, 2012
PREAMBLE
The Company and the Union agree to implement a 10 Hour Compressed Work Schedule effective the date of ratification, that averages 40 hours of work over a defined work week. All the provisions of the current Collective Agreement in effect at that time shall prevail save and except as follows.
SCOPE
For the purpose of this Agreement this 10 hour compressed work week schedule would be applicable to underground employees not normally assigned to an existing 12 hour rotating compressed work week schedule. The company reserves the right to determine the application and suitability or the implementation or discontinuation of a 10 hour shift schedule for any crew or work area.
59
ROTATION (APPLIES TO AFTERNOON SHIFTS ONLY)
This agreement contains both 10 hour dayshifts and 10 hour afternoon shifts. Employees working on a 10 hr afternoon shift will not work more than 2 consecutive weeks on the afternoon rotations, unless agreed to otherwise.
An employee will be entitled to work an equivalent amount of time on days to the actual time worked on afternoons.
DETAILS
The Company envisions three distinctly different situations where a 10 hour shift would be applied in the Mine.
1.	Entire crew placed on a 10 hour schedule
Description: The Company is considering putting some or all crews that are currently on 8 hour dayshifts onto 10 hour dayshifts in the future (either Monday to Thursday, Tuesday to Friday, or an alternating combination of the two). This implementation of a 10 hour shift schedule will be considered during the life of the agreement.
Implementation:	It is recognized that this shift may be desirable to many
employees, and have benefits of employee retention and efficiency. The Company intends to weigh the merits of the 10 hour shift schedule for various dayshift crews, and implement a new 10 hour shift schedule for crews where it makes sense to do so.
The implementation of a 10 hour shift schedule for any given crew must be agreed to by the majority of that crew. The new 10 hour shift schedule will be given a 6 month trial period. At the end of the 6 month trial period, in order to continue the 10 hour shift schedule, the majority of employees on the crew must agree.
Should the 10 hour shift schedule for any crew be terminated, all employees will revert back to their previous (8) hour shift schedule and the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at that time will apply. Overtime will not be paid if incurred as a result of implementing or discontinuing the 10 hour shift schedule.
The company will reserve the right to cancel any and all 10 hour shift schedules that are in place if the desired results are not being achieved.
2.	Only a portion of a crew placed on a 10 hour schedule: Work of an Ongoing Nature
Description: There are several situations in the Mine where an "ongoing” 10
60
hour shift is required by the Company. Current examples include the lube truck, water truck and our construction "safety services” roles, but other situations may exist in the future. In these cases, the entire crew is not needed on a 10 hour shift - only a portion of the crew or perhaps just an individual employee.
Implementation: Where such unique roles exist, the company will select the most suitable employee(s) for the task based on the skill match to the job and the employee’s interest in the 10 hour shift. Given the ongoing nature of the task and the employee’s desire to remain on the shift, the rotational language above does not apply. That employee will stay on the shift as long as the Company and Union agree to the shift, and the employee is willing to work it. Given the agreement of the Company and the Union, and the employee’s desire to go on the shift, no "vote” or "majority approval” is required to place an employee on such a shift.
3.	Only a portion of a crew placed on a 10 hour schedule: “Campaign” Type Work
Description: There are many situations in the Mine where a 10 hour work schedule is required by the Company for specific jobs, tasks, projects, or duties. These are typically cases where the entire crew is not needed on a 10 hour shift - only a portion of the crew or perhaps just an individual employee. These are also typically afternoon shift situations. Examples of where the company intends to use 10 hour shifts in this way include "campaigning” maintenance or projects jobs through use of afternoon coverage, and the use of afternoon shifts on the shaft or construction crews for tasks such as material movement, mucking under conveyors, etc.
Implementation: Where such unique roles exist, the company will select the most suitable employee(s) for the task based on the skill match to the job and the
employee’s interest in the 10 hour shift. If the job requires the employee to work afternoon shifts, the above rotational language governs the time spent on and off afternoons. Given the ability of an employee to limit his afternoon shift time by using the rotational language, no "vote” or "majority approval” is required to place an employee on such a shift.
HOURS OF WORK
Day shift (days) will be defined as 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 pm daily. Afternoon shift (afternoons) will be defined as 2:30 p.m. to 12:30 am daily.
Work schedules as outlined in this LOU shall not be altered, and their start and stop times will not vary, without mutual consent of the Company and the Union.
61
WORK SCHEDULE
The defined work week for the 10 hours shift shall be one of the following:
1.	Monday through Thursday either days or afternoons
2.	Tuesday through Friday days
3.	Lube truck, Water truck schedules and "safety services” shall be Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Saturday either days or afternoons.
PREMIUMS
All premiums in the current collective agreement apply. SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
Shift differential will begin to be paid for all hours worked on afternoons after the completion of an eight (8) hour dayshift as per article 16.01.
LUNCH PERIODS
The daily coffee/lunch periods shall be two (2) ten (10) minute breaks and one (1) twenty (20) minute break, on Company time, during which time employees shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
VACATIONS
Employees working a ten (10) hour shift schedule must take their vacation hours in full ten (10) hour shifts.
PUBLIC HOIDAYS
Public holidays for water truck operators and "safety services” are to be observed as per Article 17.01 (i).
All others on ten hour shifts are to be observed as per Article 17.01(ii) RESCHEDULING IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
The company reserves the right to schedule any and all of its employees back to an 8 hour shift schedule as defined in the current collective agreement during a period of any emergency that would cause normal operations to cease. This rescheduling will be done without any payment of overtime. As much advance notice as possible will be given to the employees.
62
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
This LOU will terminate with the expiration date of the current collective bargaining agreement unless both parties agreed to otherwise. The Company or the Union may also terminate this agreement by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.

If after rounding, an employee is required to take more hours of time off than that specified in 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, and 18.04; then such extra time will be regarded as leave of absence without pay.
5.	LUNCH PERIODS
The daily lunch periods of an employee working on the Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule shall be two (2) twenty (20) minute breaks, on Company time, during which time the employee shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
6.	STANDBY
The Parties recognize that the most significant benefit to this schedule to employees is the additional days free from work. The Parties also recognize that absenteeism problems increase costs and reduce productivity and replacement employees must be available when employees are absent. These replacements will, of necessity, have to come from employees on their days off. The necessity to work employees on their days off negates the primary benefits of the schedule to employees and increases significantly the cost of overtime coverage to the Company. In recognition of the above, the Parties agree:
a)	To encourage 100% attendance by all employees.
b)	To establish procedures for covering absent employees and standby provisions for those on days off.
66
The Union agrees to establish a voluntary call board system to assist in replacing absent employees. Employees on time off, who are available to work, will enter their names on the board prior to leaving work and will be available for work if called. Employees who are not relieved may be required to remain at work on overtime rates by the Company until call board relief arrives on the job. In the event that not enough qualified employees are available to meet the requirements of the operation, it is understood and agreed for the continuance of the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule that the Company will have the right to establish a compulsory rotation selection of such operation personnel or terminate the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule.

(Hereinafter called the "Company")
and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED
STEELWORKERS) on behalf of its Local 7552 (Hereinafter called the "Union")
Renewed Date: November 15, 2012 PREAMBLE
The Company and the Union agree to implement an Apprenticeship Program.
For the purpose of administration of the Program, the following trades are presently considered:
Electrical
Industrial Instrument Mechanic Heavy Duty Mechanic Industrial Mechanic Carpentry
Steamfitter - Pipefitter
Welder
Painter
TERM OF AGREEMENT
The duration of the Agreement will be until the expiration of the current Agreement. If neither party sees a need to change the "Letter of Understanding” at that time, then the Agreement shall continue to apply for the term(s) of any subsequent collective agreement(s).
82
SELECTION PROCESS
To ensure an equitable selection process for all prospective applicants, Marginal Paragraph 12.03 of the Collective Agreement will be used in selecting employees for the Apprenticeship Program. To determine qualifications under Marginal Paragraph 12.03 the following categories will be used:
1)	Education
The standard for entry into each trade program shall be Saskatchewan Grade 12 as well as the minimum requirements of the Provincial Apprenticeship Certification Process. Each employee who meets the education requirements will be further assessed on the following categories.
2)	Mechanical Aptitude Test
Each prospective applicant will be required to write a Mechanical Aptitude Test to determine whether the candidate possesses the aptitude and ability to work in the trade.
3)	Work Record
Each prospective applicant's work record will be reviewed to determine attendance and job record. The following item will be used in the evaluation:
i)	Discipline Step System - to include absence without permission, safety violations and any related work infractions.
4)	Performance Evaluation
Each prospective applicant(s) previous job evaluations and a recent evaluation done by a minimum of two (2) supervisors will be used in the assessment.
All provisions of Article 20 of the Collective Agreement in effect between the parties shall apply in the administration of the Apprenticeship Program. Any dispute arising out of the terms of the Agreement between the parties is subject to the grievance procedure.
RATES OF PAY
An employee accepted into an Apprenticeship Program, will be paid a wage rate commensurate with his skills and knowledge. In any event, this rate will not be less than two wage grades below that received by the employee prior to his transfer. However, if that rate is higher than the level at which the apprenticeship is identified, then he/she shall be "red-circled" until the apprentice reaches the
83
appropriate level in his apprenticeship or equivalent to his rate of pay at the time of transfer. Then the rate of pay will increase commensurate with successful completion of each level of the apprenticeship until Journeyman level is attained.
The Company will pay a Five Thousand Dollar ($5000) Completion Bonus to the Employee upon receiving a journeyperson certificate.
Rate of pay for each level of apprenticeship is determined as per the rate of pay in Article 20.02 of the Collective Agreement.
At which level the apprentice is indentured will be determined by the Apprenticeship Branch.
Journeyman rates of pay will not be given until an employee receives his Journeyman's Certificate. The pay will be retroactive to the date the employee meets all requirements for certification up to a maximum of 60 calendar days.
TRAINING ALLOWANCES
Indentured apprentices are granted Leave of Absence to attend scheduled technical training. The scheduled dates are to be the responsibility of the Apprenticeship Branch, in consultation with the Company. While an apprentice is at school he will receive remuneration from the Company equal to 40 hours regular pay for each week at school. Payment of wages will coincide with regular pay periods.
If an employee is absent from school for any unauthorized reason, then his/her wages will be reduced in accordance with the number of days he/she is absent, unless he/she is entitled to payment under the Collective Agreement.
APPRENTICESHIP FEES
Under the current fee schedule charged by the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission, the following fees will be paid by the Company:
❖	Employer Fee:	The Company will pay for the cost to register the
employee for apprenticeship training,
❖	Employee’s Tuition fees: The Company will pay for the cost of the weekly tuition fee for technical training,
❖	Books:	The Company will reimburse the employee for any costs
associated with books and or manuals which are required for the training,
❖	Tradesperson Registration: The Company will provide reimbursement to an employee who challenges and successfully passes the journeyperson examination.
84
It will be the employee’s responsibility to cover the cost of any other fee not described above.
GENERAL CONDITIONS
1)	Existing Tradesmen (ticketed or non-ticketed) will be given consideration for entry into the Program in another trade only when there is no qualified applicant for the posted apprentice position. Active indentured apprentices cannot apply.
2)	There will be a six (6) month probationary period in the trade. An apprentice may be removed from the Program and his apprenticeship agreement cancelled during such probationary period, for just cause or upon the request of the employee. If the apprentice ceases to be in the Program, he/she shall be returned to the job classification he left to join the Program and other employees affected shall also return to their former jobs.
Upon successful completion of the probationary period, the Company will proceed to indenture the apprentice on an Apprentice Agreement. A contract will be signed between the employee, the Company and the Saskatchewan Department of Labour, binding all parties to the conditions set forth by the Apprenticeship and Standards Branch. Time in the trade during such probationary period will be credited to the employee.
3)	Any apprentice who fails a required training course twice on any level, will be removed from the Program.
4)	Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship program employees are required to submit proof of certification to the company within 60 calendar days.
5)	A Standard Evaluation Program will be used throughout the apprenticeship to evaluate the progress of apprentices. The evaluation is to be periodically completed by the immediate supervisor in consultation with the Journeyman Tradesman to which the apprentice is assigned to on the job and by instructors at the appropriate training institute. For trades in which no standard evaluation program is available, a program will be developed jointly between designated Company and Union Apprenticeship Committees.
6)	The number of apprentices required for each or any trade and the number of apprentices at any level within any trade shall be determined by the Company.
7)	Unsuccessful applicants will be required to re-apply for future postings. Paperwork from a previous application can be used if the new posting is within 365 days of the last posting.
85
8)	Apprentices may transfer from one department to another (Mine or Mill) in
the same trade subject to the following conditions:
i)	A transfer can only be done within the first six (6) months of an apprenticeship.
ii)	Transfer can only take place if another opening occurs in the same trade, within the time period outlined in (1).
iii)	All eligible apprentices will be notified of the opening prior to the posting.
iv)	The most senior apprentice will be given first consideration.
v)	Transfer from one trade to another will not be considered at any time during an active apprenticeship term.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING SAFETY LIAISON POSITIONS
Between
AGRIUM
VANSCOY POTASH OPERATIONS
(Hereinafter called the "Company")
And
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED STEELWORKERS)
on behalf of its Local 7552
(Hereinafter called the "Union")
Revised: November 15, 2012
A.	PURPOSE
In the spirit of fostering an incident free safety environment with strong employee and labour relations, the Company and the Union agree to implement two (2) bargaining unit Safety Liaison positions, one for Underground and one for Surface. These positions will be filled by bargaining unit employees selected by the Union. The Union will put forward a candidate for each position and the Company will either approve or reject the candidates.
B.	SCOPE
All the provisions of the current Collective Agreement in effect between the parties shall remain in effect and apply to these positions unless otherwise noted herein.
The terms and conditions of this letter and these positions shall only apply to the incumbents that are selected for the Safety Liaison positions. Should the current incumbents vacate the Safety Liaison positions for any reason during the term of the Collective Agreement, this Letter of Understanding immediately becomes null and void and terminates immediately unless both the Company and the Union agree to renew.
89
C.	KEY JOB ELEMENTS
These positions will be under the direct supervision of an Agrium Mine or Mill Superintendent as applicable. The incumbents will be required, but not limited to, to perform the following duties:
•	As required, attend OHC meetings and other meetings as determined by the Company with input from the Union.
•	Promote Safety and the well being of our employees through participation in safety audits, the review of safety policies and procedures and occupational health and safety regulations and review new safety related programs, etc.
•	Foster a higher level of company union communications and cooperation while at the same time actively work towards a proactive resolution of issues related to OH&S, Employee and Labour Relations
•	Participate in investigations and follow up sessions as required, to situations involving OH & S issues or the current CBA or related issues for the site.
D.	SHIFT SCHEDULE
The position is defined specifically as a day shift position.
The Safety Liaisons will be scheduled to work an 8 hour shift, five days a week from Monday through Friday, on a continuous basis starting at 7:00 AM and ending at 3:00 PM each day. Saturdays and Sundays are considered as days off and vacations and statutory holidays will be observed as per the collective agreement.
The company may allow the Safety Liaison’s mobility throughout the Surface and Mine operations. At the request of a Safety Liaison, the Company may allow the Safety Liaison to tour the operations at different times and /or during different shifts. Such requests may not be unreasonably withheld.
E.	RATES OF PAY AND OVERTIME
The Safety Liaison’s will be paid at their current base hourly rate of pay as per schedule A of the CBA. Overtime and any other applicable premiums will be paid as per the terms of the collective agreement for day shift work.
Time spent in these positions will be considered as time worked for the purposes of progression training or job certification. However, the incumbent and their supervisor will work together to ensure that the employee maintains any plant site or trade certification(s) the employee held prior to accepting the position. The supervisor will ensure that any additional "tool time” / experience required to
90
maintain such certification or level of skill proficiency will be provided to the employee throughout the term of their position. Time spent in this role does not constitute time towards an apprenticeship unless specifically working on the "tools” in the particular trade that the employee is apprenticing in.
As the Safety Liaison’s availability on day shift is critical to the effective and efficient functioning of these positions, overtime hours that would cause them to miss one of their regularly scheduled day shifts should not be offered by the Company. Exceptions would be overtime related to an incident investigation or something deemed by the Company as an Emergency. They are eligible for any and all other available overtime as available.
As the intent of the Safety Liaison position is to foster and improve Company/Union communication and cooperation on the work site, it is imperative that these employees are on site as often as possible. Unless otherwise agreed to any time spent away from site for Union business will be covered by Articles
8.04	& 9.01 of the collective agreement.
If any off site Safety Liaison union business is proven to the satisfaction of the Company, to be of value to the ongoing function of these positions, the Company may agree to approve some or all of this off site time as paid leave, un-paid leave or as reimbursable Union leave as per Article 9.01(iii).
F.	TERM
This agreement will remain in effect for the duration of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement at which time it will terminate or until such time that either party chooses to terminate the agreement. Either the Company or the Union may choose to terminate this Letter of Understanding by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
10 HOUR AFTERNOON COMPRESSED WORK WEEK SCHEDULE FOR UNDERGROUND
PRODUCTION
between
AGRIUM
VANSCOY POTASH OPERATIONS
(Hereinafter called the "Company")
and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED STEELWORKERS)
on behalf of its Local 7552 (Hereinafter called the "Union")
Original Date: November 15, 2012
PREAMBLE
The Company and the Union agree to implement a 10 Hour Afternoon Compressed Work Week Schedule for Underground Production effective the date of ratification, that averages 40 hours of work over a defined work week. All the provisions of the current Collective Agreement in effect at that time shall prevail save and except as follows.
SCOPE
For the purpose of this Agreement this 10 hour compressed work week schedule would be applicable to underground operators normally assigned to an existing 12 hour rotating compressed work week schedule. The company reserves the right to determine the application and suitability or the implementation or discontinuation of a 10 hour shift schedule for any crew or work area.
101
DETAILS
As VPO works to expand to VAULT production rates and then sustain those increased rates, it is important to ensure that our mining machines are running as much of the 24 hour day as can reasonably be achieved. One key step in increasing mining machine run time is the ability to add certainty to run our miners during times when today the machine is down. One key window of focus is the gap between dayshift and nightshift.
VPO intends to introduce a 10 hour afternoon shift for production operators. This shift would consist of enough operators to run at least two boring machines and possibly one drumcutter, through lunches, shift changes or other periods in which key machines are otherwise not manned. They would be assigned other work throughout their shift as required around the mine, to suit the day’s priorities. Approximately 8 to 16 operators would be placed in this schedule. Mine Management will have the sole right to select candidates for this shift based on experience, personal desire to be on the shift, job fit, proper mix of skills (example: need a mix of lead hands, borer operators, drumcutter operators, and several less experienced operators to work behind the miners).
NON CONTINUOUS SHIFT POSITIONS
For every two (2) positions filled on the 10 Hour Afternoon Compressed Work Week Schedule for Underground Production, the Company agrees to post one (1) Non Continuous Shift Positions, up to a maximum of six (6). These positions will be posted as per Article 15.09 and will be filled within 24 months of the implementation of the 10 Hour Afternoon Compressed Work Week Schedule for Underground Production. Only current underground operators may apply for these positions.
The Company shall decide which crews the successful employees are placed on. The following are examples of the types of crews currently being considered.
1.	Construction
2.	Projects
3.	Shaft
It is understood that this LOU shall only apply during normal operation of the Company.
In the event that an employee filling one of the non-continuous shift positions fails to meet expectations (less than an "S” rating), he or she may be removed from their position. The position will be reposted as per article 15.09.
It is understood that normal operations cannot be disrupted during the implementation of this LOU. This may require delays in filling these positions to ensure that replacements are adequately trained (e.g. hoistmen).
102
HOURS OF WORK
Afternoon shift (afternoons) will be defined as 2:00 p.m. to 12:00 am daily.
Work schedules as outlined in this LOU shall not be altered, and their start and stop times will not vary, without mutual consent of the Company and the Union.
WORK SCHEDULE
The defined work week for the 10 hours shift shall be one of the following:
1.	Monday through Thursday afternoons OR
2.	Tuesday through Friday afternoons
PREMIUMS
All premiums in the current collective agreement apply. SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
Shift differential will begin to be paid for all hours worked on afternoons after the completion of an eight (8) hour dayshift as per article 16.01.
LUNCH PERIODS
The daily coffee/lunch periods shall be two (2) ten (10) minute breaks and one (1) twenty (20) minute break, on Company time, during which time employees shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
VACATIONS
Employees working a ten (10) hour shift schedule must take their vacation hours in full ten (10) hour shifts.
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
Public holidays for employees working on this schedule will be observed as per 17.01(ii).
RESCHEDULING IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
The company reserves the right to schedule any and all of its employees back to an 8 hour shift schedule as defined in the current collective agreement during a period of any emergency that would cause normal operations to cease. This rescheduling will be done without any payment of overtime. As much advance notice as possible will be given to the employees.
103
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
Should this LOU be terminated, all employees be placed on a shift of the Company’s choice and the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at that time will apply.
This LOU will terminate with the expiration date of the current collective bargaining agreement unless renewed by both parties. The Company or the Union may also terminate this agreement by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.

RATES OF PAY AND OVERTIME - FACILITATOR
The Facilitator will be paid at their current base hourly rate of pay as per schedule A of the CBA. Overtime and any other applicable premiums will be paid as per the terms of the collective agreement.
Time spent in the full time Facilitator position will be considered as time worked for the purposes of progression training or job certification. However, the incumbent and their supervisor will work together to ensure that the employee maintains any plant site or trade certification(s) the employee held prior to accepting the position. The supervisor will ensure that any additional "tool time" / experience required to maintain such certification or level of skill proficiency will be provided to the employee throughout the term of their position. Time spent in this role does not constitute time towards an apprenticeship unless specifically working on the "tools" in the particular trade that the employee is apprenticing in.
When a facilitator vacates the role, he/she shall be returned to the location and position they left prior to taking on the role of full time facilitator.
As the Facilitator's availability on day shift is critical to the effective and efficient functioning of these positions, overtime hours that would cause them to miss one of their regularly scheduled day shifts should not be offered by the Company. Exceptions would be overtime related to an incident investigation or something deemed by the Company as an Emergency. They are eligible for any and all other available overtime as available.
SHIFT SCHEDULE - FACILITATOR
The position is defined specifically as a day shift position.
The Facilitator's hours of work will be Monday to Friday 8:00am to 4:00pm. The hours of work may vary as per 14.01.
CBA
All the provisions of the current Collective Agreement in effect between the parties shall remain in effect and apply unless otherwise noted herein.
COSTS
All costs associated with the WORKER LED SAFETY INITIATIVE shall be paid by the Company.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS
between
AGRIUM
VANSCOY POTASH OPERATIONS
(Hereinafter called the "Company")
and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED STEELWORKERS)
on behalf of its Local 7552 (Hereinafter called the "Union")
Original Date: November 15, 2012 PREAMBLE
The Company retains the right to have a performance management program for their hourly employees at Vanscoy Potash Operation. As a settlement of grievance 16-11, the Company and the Union agree to enter into an agreement in which the following terms and conditions will apply:
1.	The Company will provide a copy of the most current performance management program to the Union, and will notify the Union if and when the program changes. The performance management program will not change for the life of this Letter.
2.	Within the first quarter of each year, employees will meet with their supervisor to discuss the results of their previous year’s performance review and discuss expectations for the upcoming year with a hard copy of expectations given to every employee. During that meeting, the employee will be given a copy of their performance review, including rating, signed by their supervisor, and will be given an opportunity to discuss their performance and rating with their supervisor. Everyone receiving a Below Expectations or Unsatisfactory rating will be placed on a performance improvement plan so that each employee knows what is required of them to improve their performance.
116
3.	A supervisor will meet with their employee for a mid-year review and a year-end review to review and discuss their progress. At each review, the supervisor will identify what the employee is doing well and if any adjustments are needed, focusing on discussion and support needed to increase the likelihood of success.
4.	The Company’s performance management documents include differentiation guidelines supporting how employee ratings are determined. The differentiation criteria are based upon the expectations achieved by the employee, how the employee achieves these expectations (based upon the employer’s core values of Results Orientation, Ownership Mindset, Integrity, Capacity for Change and Inspired Leadership), and calibrated against employees in similar roles and levels. Ratings are:
a.	Top Performance: an employee consistently exceeds expectations; noticeably outstanding performance;
b.	Excels: exceeds some and meets all expectations;
c.	Successful: consistently meets expectations;
d.	Below Performance: expectations meets some but not all expectations;
e.	Unsatisfactory Performance: must improve quickly and dramatically for continued employment.
5.	The Company will provide the Union with the employee’s performance review and rating for anyone with a rating below Successful unless the employee requests in writing for the Union not to receive the documentation.
6.	The Company retains the exclusive right to administer a Profit Sharing Plan, including the right to discontinue or alter the terms of the Profit Sharing Plan at any time. The Company will provide a minimum of 30 days notice to the Union of any such changes.
7.	The Parties agree that payouts made under the Profit Sharing Plan are dependent on factors determined solely by the Company. The sole exception to this, by way of this Agreement is how Performance Ratings affect or impact an Employee’s Profit Sharing payout.
8.	Subject to the availability of a payout, Employees rated as Successful or better will be eligible for 100% of the Profit Sharing payout amount as described in the Company’s Profit Sharing Plan.
9. Subject to the availability of a payout, Employees rated as Below Expectations will be eligible for 75% of the Profit Sharing payout amount as described in the Company’s Profit Sharing Plan.
10. Subject to the availability of a payout, Employees rated as Below Expectations for 2 consecutive years (e.g. "B” followed by "B”) or as Unsatisfactory and Below Expectations for 2 consecutive years (e.g. "U”
117
followed by “B”) will be eligible for a 50% payout of the full Profit Sharing payout amount as described in the Company’s Profit Sharing Plan.
11.	Employees must be on, or have received, a Performance Improvement Plan in the performance year prior to receiving an Unsatisfactory rating. If they have not been on or received a Performance Improvement Plan, the lowest rating they can receive in the performance year is Below Expectations.
12.	Employees with an Unsatisfactory rating will not be eligible for any payout.
13.	The Company recognizes that the Union has the right to grieve individual ratings below Successful through to arbitration.
14.	The Company agrees to provide education sessions on its Performance Management process for all employees. Employees will also be provided copies of all available Performance Management process documentation via hard-copy or electronically.
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
The Company or the Union may terminate this agreement by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention. This agreement may also be terminated immediately with the mutual agreement of both parties.
