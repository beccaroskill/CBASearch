Conversely, if three (3) hours overtime are offered and it turns out that four (4)hours were worked, then four (4) hours worked at the straight time equivalent will be charged against the overtime record of the employee that worked and/or any employee who was offered the opportunity and declined.
6.	The original overtime lists posted at the beginning cf the New Year will be posted in seniority order.

B.	An employee under (A) above who wishes to work during an overtime opportunity on the first Saturday on his/her vacation, may do so by making a request to their supervisor of their desire to work. The employee would then be selected as any other employee. An employee who does not make such a request to work, will not be charged for a failure to accept the overtime opportunity.
C.	An employee returning from vacation will only be entitled to be selected for an overtime opportunity which falls on his/her first scheduled work day following their vacation. For example, an employee who is on vacation and scheduled to return to work on Tuesday because Monday is a recognized Statutory holiday, would not be entitled to any overtime opportunities on that statutory holiday Monday.
77
14.	A. A relief operator who is relieving in his/her relief
group on a daily basis, will be offered overtime in their base group if there is no work available in his/her relief group after all scheduled employees in that group have been canvassed.

5 WEEKLY INDEMNITY BENEFIT
If you become totally disabled and are prevented from working due to a non-occupational accident or a sickness not covered by Workers’ Compensation, you will receive Weekly Indemnity benefits provided you are under the care cf a licensed physician.
If disability commences during a period of layoff you will be eligiblefor Weekly Indemnity beneits from the date you are recalled to work only if you have 10 or more years of seniority and you are recalled within a period of two weeks from the date cf layoff and you are totally disabled on that date.
The amount cf your Weekly Indemnity benefit is 70% cf your basic weekly earnings rate as of the date disability commences. When a general change in wage rates takes effect under the terms of the labour agreement, the amount of your Weekly Indemnity benefit from the effective date cf such change will be 70% cf the basic weekly earnings rate to which you would be entitled if you were at work. The benefit payment is based on a 7 day week. For each day of absence for which a benefit is payable, you will receive one-seventh <f the weekly benefit. Benefits are payable from the first day of absence of disability due to accident, or from the fourth day of disability due to illness.
Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of 26 weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks.)
A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation cf the disability unless you have completely recovered and have been back at work for at least 14 days.
Your Weekly Indemnity insurance will be cancelled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your Weekly Indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
113
6. LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received Weekly Indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received Workers' Compensation payments for a continuous period cf 26 weeks. Your LTD benefit will be payable at the end of each month at 66 2/3% of your basic monthly earnings rate as cf the date your LTD benefit commences. For example, if your hourly earnings rate in the 26th week after you become disabled is $19.60 per hour:
(a)	Your weekly earnings rate is 40 x $19.60= $784.00
(b)	Equivalent monthly earnings rate is
($784.00 x 52 weeks) divided by 12 = $3,397.33
(c)	Monthly LTD benefit is 66 2/3% of
$3,397.33	= $2,265.00
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Workers' Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
In order to qualify for LTD benefits, you must be under the continuing care cf a licensed physician, and during the first 2 years cf LTD benefits, be unable to perform the duties cf your normal occupation or any other job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or a related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation cf disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least 14 days.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early,
114
LTD benefits will cease ascf your date cf early retirement.
No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities
caused by self inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefits will continue for up to 24 months but will be reduced by 75% cf what you earn from rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit cf $2,265.00 and you earn $800 in rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD benefit	$2,265.00
Subtract 75% cf $800	600.00
LTD benefit during rehabilitation	$1,665.00
Earnings from rehabilitative employment $800.00 Monthly income during
rehabilitation	JS2,465,00
Provided your employment with the Company has not been terminated, while you are in receipt cf LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits.
Your LTD insurance will be cancelled as cf the date you retire or terminate service with the Company.
NOTE: You may not receive wages or other allowances such as holiday pay, vacation pay, weekly indemnity, long term disability, Workers’ Compensation or similar benefits from more than one source for the same day or part day.
