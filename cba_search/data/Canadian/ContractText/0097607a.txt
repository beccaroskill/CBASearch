The Company will not hire loaders with operators if there are regular or spare classified loader operators and/or Company owned machines available to do the work.
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3:01 It is agreed that it is the exclusive function and right of the Company to operate and manage all aspects of its business, including the limitation, curtailment and cessation of any or all operations, except where any right to do so has been specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement.
1
3UH2 The Company reserves the right to adjust all or any of its crews arising out of any change in manufacturing process or in a change of equipment.
The Company agrees to review with the Union pertinent details and reasons for any major cutbacks or lumbermill shutdowns. The Company will have such review with the Union not less than two (2) weeks in advance of such contemplated change unless an emergency situation arises on short notice. Emergency situations should generally be considered as events beyond the control of local mill management.
3:04 Technological Change
a)	Technological change for the purposes of this agreement is defined as changes in the operation resulting from the introduction of new and different equipment which will reduce labour requirements.
b)	The Company agrees to give the Union as much advance notice as possible from the decision to make a technological change and the start-up of the new equipment. If there will be a reduction of two or more regular jobs, the advance notice will be at least six weeks in advance of start-up.
c)	The notice to the Union will advise of the new equipment and the earliest anticipated start-up date together with information as to the number of jobs to be eliminated and an offer to sit down with the Union executives to discuss the coming changes and other jobs which may be affected or training to be undertaken.
ARTICLE 4 - HIRING. SERVICE. PROMOTION. DEMOTION. TRANSFER. ETC.
4-m When hiring new employees, the Company shall, in the first place, take into consideration the ability, both present and potential, of the prospective employees.
4iH2 Recognising its obligation to help solve community problems when hiring new employees, the Management of the Company will give preference to residents of Plaster Rock, N.B,, and surrounding area, provided qualifications and abilities are relatively equal to other applicants.
4:03
a)	In cases of promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and recall, length of service will prevail when skill and experience are relatively equal.
b)	When a permanent vacancy on a classification occurs, the job will be posted for bid unless there is a regular spare assigned to the classification, who has been appointed to a regular spare status on that classification as the result of job bid award. If there is a permanent vacancy and there is a regular spare appointed by job bid, then the senior regular spare by job classification for that job will be the individual transferred to that classification.
2
An employee holding spare seniority to a classification as the result of a regular spare job bid award as indicated above will still retain seniority on his regular classification. The Company has the right to establish one or more spares for all regular classifications that require advance training and will post job bids for all classifications for which it determines a need for regular spares.
Temporary spare assignments on a classification may be made as necessary but will not exceed one (1) week in duration unless there is currently no available classified spare for the position. Individuals so appointed without a job bid award will gain no seniority or rights in that classification and their experience as the result of a temporary spare assignment will not be used to give them precedence in a later job bid award. Temporary assignments will not exceed two (2) calendar months.
In the event of a prolonged absence (other than vacation) exceeding two (2) weeks in duration, the resultant vacancy will be filled by the senior classified spare for the position starting no later than the first complete calendar week following notice of absence.
c)	All applicants will be advised as to the disposition of their application and in the event senior employees are to be bypassed on a job bid selection, a Company representative will meet with the Union to review the skill, qualifications and other factors, where applicable, upon which the award is to be based.
d)	In the event of job reduction or elimination caused by lay-offs, changes in mill equipment or operating methods and/or procedures, the following will apply:
The selection of the employees to be laid off from active mill employment will be made on inverse order of mill seniority except that the company will have the right to retain more junior employees in place of more senior employees, where the junior employees retained have special skills or licenses that the Company determines are necessary to its operations. Special skills are those skills required to meet qualifications required to fill the most recent job posting. Such requirements will also be used for bumping to another position when a reduction occurs.
In determining who will fill remaining jobs after a lay-off as covered above, the Company will:
1)	In continuing classifications give preference for retention to the senior (on the basis of mill seniority) of the employees who have indicated to the Personnel Department, at least 24 working hours in advance, of their desire to continue working and who have been regularly assigned to that classification. The retained senior employee may be subject to bumping as indicated in 2) below.
2)	Reassign, on the basis of mill seniority, employees laid-off from their regular classification and who have indicated to the Personnel Department, at least twenty-four (24) working hours in advance, of their desire to continue working to a parallel or the nearest lower rated classification for which they have the experience and/or the skill and
3
ability to fill to the Company's satisfaction without extensive training or break in. If there is no lower rated classification for which they have the experience and/or skill and ability to fill, they will be reassigned to the nearest higher rated classification for which they do have the experience and/or the ability to fill to the Company's satisfaction without extensive training or break-in. Extensive Training shall mean that employees bumping to Groups (0) through (3) will be allowed one (1) week training and Groups (4) through (8) will be allowed two (2) weeks training.
For employees displaced as a result of technological change as described in Article 3:04 above, the training and/or break-in period may be extended to thirty (30) days as required.
3)	In repositioning employees as the result of a job reduction or lay-off as described above, the Company agrees to accept mill seniority and the Union agrees to accept the Company's evaluation of the special skills required in the mill and those possessed by individual employees.
4)	If work is not available in a given area due to unforeseen interruptions or schedule changes that involve short-term situations, employees working in the affected area in the lumbermill, at the start of their next scheduled shift, will be allowed to bump junior employees working elsewhere in the lumbermill complex provided they:
. Report to work
-	Make their intentions clear to mill management
-	Have the necessary skills and abilities to exercise bumping rights
Mill management will be responsible to ensure that the appropriate procedures are followed in a timely and effective manner.
All employees reporting for work at the start of their shift will, if they can exercise bumping rights or if alternative work is available, be assigned to the proper work area. If no work is available, employees will be sent home without pay. If employees are bumped after the shift has started, they will be paid only for time worked.
Employees not wishing to exercise bumping rights in the event of such interruptions or schedule changes will be required to notify management, on an annual basis, of their preference. Such employees, as well as junior employees with no bumping rights, will be contacted as per Article 13:03,
Give preference to senior employees without a valid M.L.B, License, who otherwise have the necessary skills and qualifications, for the positions of trimmerman, stacker operator, tallyman, strapping machine operator or stockman. Such employees will not be bumped by junior employees holding a valid M,L,B,License.
e)	Employees selected on a job bid will be subject to a maximum thirty (30) working days probationary period during which time they will be assessed for continued assignment in the
4
department and during such period they may elect to return to their former job. Seniority on a classification will be established on the date of the job bid award. Employees being removed or withdrawing from the classification within the thirty (30) working day period will return to their previous classification without loss of seniority and will lose all seniority in the classification from which they were removed or withdrew.
An employee who meets the necessary requirements for a job bid (spare or regular) will participate in a review with Management and Union representatives. Purpose of this review will be to fully explain all aspects of the position to ensure the employee is completely informed prior to making a final decision.
Within the training period for groups zero (0) through three (3) an employee will have the opportunity to withdraw from the position within forty-five (45) hours actual training time, without penalty, and bid on future job postings. For groups four (4) through eight (8) the allowable retractable time will be extended to ninety (90) hours of actual training time.
An employee removed by the Company from a job for which he/she had been selected, will be allowed to immediately bid on another spare or regular job posting. Upon accepting a job bid award, an employee will not be eligible to bid on any (spare or regular) jobs for a period of one (1) year complete year.
(f)	If the Union should question the application by the Company of this provision, representatives of the Company will meet with Union representatives to discuss and review all the factors involved in the Company's selection of individuals affected.
(g)	A Labour/Management Committee will be established which will meet every month to discuss matters of mutual interest. The committee will consist of three (3) representatives each from the Company and the Union. A Business Representative from the Union and the Manager of Human Resources (or designated representative) from the Company may also attend these meetings.
liM When it becomes necessary to fill any open classified positions, preference will be given to present employees in the bargaining unit, provided they have the ability to fulfill the requirements of the job, before recruiting from outside the unit.
Service or mill seniority shall mean time from last date of hire as a regular employee. Temporary or part time student employees for vacation relief will start service or mill seniority if they become available for work on a normal basis and will immediately become eligible for Union membership if they have already worked in excess of forty-five (45) days. The effective hiring date for a student will be the date on which he/she becomes a regular employee.
The normal work season for students will end on the Saturday of the weekend following the Labour Day holiday. Subsequent to this, any (former) students who may be retained for regular employment with the Company will start their probationary period on the first scheduled operating day following the Labour Day holiday.

after last day worked. Subsequent re-employment will be as a new employee without consecutive
service.
4:08
a)	An employee is considered a new employee until he/she has completed forty-five (45) days of work. During this period he/she will be considered probationary and will have full recourse to normal Union representation and the grievance procedure. During an employee’s probationary period, the Company has, however, full and uncontestable right to terminate such employee if the Company decides, for any reason, that the probationary employee is or will prove to be unsatisfactory.
b)	Should a probationary employee be laid off before completing forty-five (45) days of employment and subsequently be rehired by the Company within ninety (90) days, his/her unbroken service with the Company prior to layoff will be counted in computing the probationary period.

4:09

less
1/35th of the C/QPP benefits in effect in 1996, multiplied by the Member’s Continuous Contributory Service from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996, not exceeding 21 years.
Earnings for this purpose shall be the employee’s classified rate multiplied by his/her normal scheduled hours. However, in the event that an employee’s scheduled earnings in any of the five 12-month periods immediately preceding retirement do not reflect a normal annual schedule of hours for that period for reasons other than a leave of absence, the employee’s earnings for that period will be adjusted to reflect his/her normal annual schedule of hours, provided the employee has been actively at work for at least 3 months during that 12-month period. For a disabled employee, the classified rate to be used for this adjustment shall be the classified rate in effect immediately preceding the onset of the disability.

PLASTER ROCK LUMBERMILL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN
Changes to the Bonus Incentive Plan, as a result of the 2005 negotiations, will become effective upon ratification of the new Labour Agreement.
Bonus is payable to all employees of the Plaster Rock Lumbermill on regular scheduled hours.
Bonus is to be calculated on a per shift basis and paid weekly to all employees. Shift production will be calculated as the average of the two shifts when the mill is operating on a two-shift per day basis.
In the event of mill modernization projects that result in increased productivity, the Bonus Incentive Plan will be restructured to coincide with the increased productivity capacity of the mill. The revised system will not have a lower payout plan than the average of the previous twelve (12) months prior to modernization.
All bonuses will be calculated on a 9 hour shift. Any shift less than or in excess of 9 hours will be calculated to represent productivity for a 9 hour shift.
The production bonus (as per the Labour Agreement) will apply when “a full operation” occurs beyond regular scheduled hours. Full operation means a minimum of one planer line or the entire sawmill operation for a full shift or part of a shift.
The bonus plan will be applicable to Sawmill and Planermill basis as follows:
Sawmill
Bonus is to be calculated on gross production per shift basis (average to two shifts when mill is operating on two shift basis). Bonus will be paid in 1,000 fbm increments. Gross production will be calculated with 6% trim loss that will be reflected in the rate per 1,000 fbm.
Kiln operators, boiler room employees, sawmill maintenance, stockman, yard grader and yard labourer will be attached to the Sawmill production bonus along with regular production employees assigned to the Sawmill.
Planermill
Bonus is applicable to all employees assigned to the Planermill or associated with the Planermill operation (i.e. machines handling dressed lumber and/or for shipment).
46
Bonus is based on production per shift at the Planermill on the basis on saleable output from the Planermill.
Bonus will be calculated daily. The hourly bonus to be paid for each day will be paid by applying the appropriate hourly bonus from the following tables for each planer in operation on that day and averaging the two (e.g. Specialty operates on 1” x 6” lumber and produces 100,000 fbm. resulting in an hourly bonus of $2.86; the dimension operates on 2” x 6” lumber and produces 250,000 fbm, resulting in an hourly bonus of $2,40, The hourly bonus to be paid to all employees working in the Planermill for this day is $2.63/hr. ($2.86 + $2.40)/2 = $2.63). If the Planermill is on two shifts per day basis, then the hourly bonus will be the average of the two.
In the event that either line operates for less than nine (9) hours in a shift for reasons other than equipment breakdown, the production for the line(s) in question will be adjusted to reflect a full nine (9) hours of production.
Seven Day Scheduled / Scheduled Weekends
Employees scheduled to work weekends or days that the Lumbermill does not operate will receive the average hourly bonus paid during the week in which the non-operating day occurs for scheduled hours on that shift. i.e. Saturday bonus is to be based on the past week and Sunday bonus on the following week.
