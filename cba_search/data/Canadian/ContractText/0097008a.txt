SECTION I - PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
The purpose of this Agreement is to secure for the Company, the Union and the employees the full benefits of orderly and legal collective bargaining, and to ensure to the utmost extent possible, the safety and physical welfare of the employees, economy of operation, quality and quantity of output, and protection of property. It is recognized by this Agreement to be the duty of the Company and the Union and the employees to cooperate fully, individually, and collectively, for the advancement of said conditions.
The Company and the Union agree to abide by the terms set out in this Agreement. The Union further agrees that it will, at all times, instruct its members to act in accordance with the terms contained in this Agreement. The Company agrees, in the exercise of the functions of Management, that the provisions of this Agreement will be carried out.
The Company and Union subscribe to and support the principles of all federal and provincial legislation.
All terms in this Agreement are intended to be gender neutral. As such, all references to man, men, he, him, or his shall also imply woman, women, she, her, or hers.
SECTION II - RECOGNITION
1.	The Company recognizes Local 18, Pulp, Paper and Woodworkers of Canada, as the only bargaining agent representing all employees as defined in this Agreement.
2.	The term “Employee” as used and for the purpose of this Agreement shall include all persons employed by the Company on whose behalf the Pulp, Paper and Woodworkers of Canada, Local 18, has been certified as bargaining agent except and excluding
Page 1
foremen and others having authority to hire and discharge, office workers, supervisory officials and salesmen.
3.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in obtaining and retaining as members the employees as defined in this Agreement, and to this end will present to new employees, and to all Supervisors and Foremen, the Policy herein expressed.
The Company will include a copy of the PPWC Bylaws and the introduction of new employees to a Shop Steward in its “Employee Induction Program”. The employee should be introduced to a Shop Steward within his first week of work.
4.	All employees in the employment of the Company, and all new employees, shall within thirty (30) calendar days after the execution of this Agreement, or thirty (30) calendar days after entering employment, whichever date last occurs, become members of the Union and maintain membership therein throughout the term of this Agreement, as a condition of continued employment.
5.	Any employee who fails to maintain his membership in good standing in the Union by reason of failure to pay dues or assessments shall be discharged after seven (7) days written notice to the Company by the Union of the employee’s failure to maintain his membership in good standing.
6.	(a) No employee shall be subject to any penalties against his
application for membership or reinstatement, except as may be provided for in the Pulp, Paper and Woodworkers of Canada National Constitution and in accordance with the Bylaws of Local 18.
Page 2
(b)	Any employee who applies for membership pursuant to the provisions of 6(a) above, will not have his application rejected.
7.	The Company shall require all new employees, at the time of hiring, to execute an assignment of wages for union dues in duplicate, the forms to be supplied by the Union, and will forward one copy to the Union within fifteen (15) days of execution.
8.	This assignment in the case of employees already members of the Union, shall be effective immediately and for those employees not previously members of the Union, it shall become effective thirty (30) calendar days from the date of execution.
9.	The Company shall remit the dues deducted pursuant to such assignment (until and unless said assignment is revoked in writing by the employee) to the Local Union named therein not less than once each month, with a written statement of names of employees for whom the deductions were made and the amount of each deduction.
10.	The Union and the Company recognize that supervisors are excluded from the provisions of the Labour Agreement and accordingly it is improper for supervisors normally to do the work which is done by those defined as employees in the Agreement.
It is also recognized that, for the practical and efficient operation of the mills, there are occasions when a supervisor must help. Such occasions must be temporary in nature and must not result in the displacement or exclusion of employees under the Agreement.
Page 3
SECTION III - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
1.	The management of the operation and the direction and promotion of the Employees are vested exclusively in the management provided, however, that this will not be used for the purpose of discrimination against employees, and is in accordance with the principles outlined in Sections I and VII of this Agreement.
2.	The Company shall have the right to select its employees and to discipline them or discharge them for proper cause.

The Company confirms its commitment to continue its present practice of issuing pay statements to afternoon shift employees on the day prior to the regular pay day at the times posted by the Company.

11.	Alternate Shift Crewing
(a)	Employees wishing to move onto the weekend shift must do so by using the shift sign-up process currently in place. Employees will be chosen based on seniority and the posting that they hold. Employees with incumbencies will have preference over a qualified relief, regardless of seniority. In addition, consideration will be given to ensure that there are an adequate number of experienced tradespersons on shift at all times. Where there are no volunteers, employees will be selected and assigned on a reverse seniority basis and overtime rates (if applicable) will apply. Employees who are assigned to the weekend shift cannot be bumped from this shift, unless they request to be reassigned.
(b)	Employees, after accepting a position on the weekend shift and finding that the shift does not suit their lifestyle, may return to their previously held position providing that they do not complete more than four (4) tours. The Company will provide a replacement for the employee within thirty (30) days. This option is limited to one time over a two (2) year period.
(c)	Employees whom have requested the weekend shift and now want to be reassigned can do so by:
(i)	Making a request to their Supervisor, and if there is a qualified operator on the sign-up sheet the employees shifts will be interchanged. The employee leaving the weekend shift will have no choice of his\her shift and be placed into the vacancy created by the employee who is moving onto the weekend shift.
(ii)	Posting onto a vacancy on the weekday shift. The departing employee will be restricted from returning to the weekend shift for a period of two (2) years unless accepting an incumbent position.
Page 16
(d)	Employees requesting a position on the weekend shift will work both schedules without overtime rates.
(e)	On both the weekend and weekday shifts, temporary vacancies of less than three (3) weeks will be filled from within the shift crew. Only as a last resort will vacancies be filled from the other shift.

(iii)	When the mill or a portion thereof is shut down during a normal production shift, the Company may require employees to perform alternative work for the balance of that shift at their regular job rate or the rate of the alternative job, whichever is greater.
(b)	During a reduction of forces where an employee’s seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his incumbency, he may elect to apply his seniority to obtain a job paying a higher rate if he has previously held the job in the operation as an incumbent or has worked as a relief operator for sixty (60) days.
(c)	During a reduction of forces where an employee’s seniority is such that he will not be able to keep his incumbency, he may elect whether or not to apply his seniority to obtain a lower paid job or a job paying the same rate of pay or return to his last posted job or job vacancy. Where a change of departments is required, the employee will have the seniority in that department for posting purposes only.
(i)	It is recognized by the Company that a certain amount of training and/or retraining will be required. The intent is to refresh skills, not to introduce new and unfamiliar skills.
Page 23
(d)	An employee may accept a lay-off until his incumbent job becomes available, provided, however;

(c)	It is agreed that all employees shall return to work as quickly as possible after receiving notification of recall in accordance with this Section and shall retain all their seniority rights.
Page 24
(d)	Failure to report within one (1) week shall result in loss of seniority rights, except where the employee advises the Company of his inability to return, in which case the one (1) week may be extended.
5.	Incumbent-Relief and other seniority lists that the Company may use will be made available to the Union every month.
6.	It is agreed between the parties that seniority during lay-offs shall be retained on the following basis:
(a)	Employees with less than one (1) year of service will retain their seniority for a period of eight (8) months.
(b)	Employees with one (1) or more years of service shall retain their seniority for one (1) year plus one (1) additional month for each year of service, up to an additional eighteen (18) months.
7.	The purpose of this section is to provide training so that an employee may apply his seniority in the event of his lay-off or the permanent elimination of his job as outlined below. This section does not apply to the reduction of seasonal or temporary shifts or positions except as in (a) below.
(a)	Any employee affected by lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of forty-five (45) days will follow procedures outlined in SECTION VII - SENIORITY.
(b)	Any employee affected by a lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of forty-five (45) days and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 2 level, may elect to be trained in Group 2, 3, or Planer Group. Normal training periods shall apply.
Page 25
(c)	Any employee affected by a lay-off that is estimated to be in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) working days and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 1 level may elect to be trained in Group 1, 2, 3, Planer Group, or a Key Job. Normal training periods shall apply.
(d)	Any employee affected by a permanent lay-off and whose lack of past experience precludes him from exercising his seniority to obtain a job at or above the Group 1 level may elect to be trained in Group 1, 2, 3, Planer Group, or a Key Job.
(e)	For the purpose of the above clauses, all Group 1 positions will be considered the same as each other, all Group 2 positions will be considered the same as each other, all Group 3 positions will be considered the same as each other, and all Planer Group positions will be considered the same as each other. For example, “A” Mill Department Group 1 is equivalent to “C” Mill Department Group 1.
In addition, the Company will meet with the Union to establish a training program in other jobs with the objective of eventually placing laid off personnel in line with their seniority. Phasing-in arrangements of such a program will be discussed between the parties to accomplish the objective with minimal impact on quality and quantity of production.
An employee may only use this section to exercise his seniority to be trained for a job at an equal or lower rate than that which he held at the time of the lay-off or permanent loss of job.

Page 65
3.	Selection for entry into the Apprenticeship Program will be made
in the following manner:
(a)	Education - A candidate will not be considered for an apprenticeship without documentary proof of education that meets the minimum Apprenticeship Branch requirements for the specified trade.
(b)	Seniority - An employee must have a minimum of one (1) year Wood Products seniority before being eligible for an apprenticeship. Two (2) points will be awarded for each year of Wood Products seniority. There is no limit on the points attributed to seniority but the successful candidate must be able to commit to work in the trade for five (5) years after completion of the apprenticeship.
(c)	Pre-apprenticeship Training - Any candidate who has successfully completed a recognized pre-apprenticeship course in the specific trade shall be awarded a maximum of five (5) points.

SECTION XVIII - JOB ELIMINATION & TECHNOLOGY CHANGE
1.	Definition
Job elimination means permanent loss of employment as the result of Company decisions to eliminate positions, excluding those in No. 2 below.
Technology change, which term shall include automation, mechanization, and process change, means the introduction of equipment or material of a different nature or kind than that previously utilized, or a change in the operation that is directly related to the introduction of that equipment or material.
2.	Exclusions
No payment will be made under No. 7 in cases:
(a)	of curtailments of a temporary, seasonal, or indefinite duration which includes those caused by market or economic conditions
(b)	of employees hired for work of known or temporary duration.
3.	Required Notice of Technological Change
The Company will advise the Union, as soon as possible, and in any case, not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days before the introduction of mechanization, technological changes and/or Page 68
automation which the Company has decided to introduce and which will result in terminations or other significant changes in employment status of individual employees.
The Company will advise the Union, as soon as possible, and in any case not less than thirty (30) days before the expected date of change, of the anticipated time sequence of final installation and production start-up and the anticipated effect on the job status of individual employees.
4.	Notice of Job Elimination
The Company will advise the Standing Committee at least thirty (30) days prior to job elimination. Crew reduction will be in accordance with SECTION VII - SENIORITY.
5.	Job Elimination Options
An employee who qualifies under job elimination, may elect one of the following options:
(a)	Recall and seniority retention as per SECTION VII -SENIORITY, or
(b)	Severance allowance as per No. 7 below. Such employee must elect his option within thirty (30) days of notification that his loss of employment is permanent. If Option (b) is selected, the employee will be deemed to have terminated effective the last day worked. Where a temporary curtailment becomes permanent, severance eligibility will be determined by the status of the employee at the time of the temporary curtailment.
Page 69
6.	Seniority Status
In cases of technological changes:
(a)	In the event that it is necessary, crews will be reduced in accordance with SECTION VII - SENIORITY, of the Agreement.
(b)	An employee who is set back to a lower paid job because of mechanization, technological change or automation, will receive the rate of his regular job at the time of the set-back for a period of six (6) months, and for a further period of six (6) months he will be paid an adjusted rate which will be midway between the rate of his regular job at the time of the set-back and the rate of his new regular job. At the end of this twelve (12) month period, the rate of his regular job will apply.
(c)	If, through the application of SECTION VII - SENIORITY, the employee moves to a lower, equal, or higher rated job because of mechanization, technological change or automation, he will have the option of terminating his employment and accepting severance pay as outlined in Section 7 (a) below, provided he exercises his option within six (6) months of starting on the job.
7.	Severance Allowance
Employees may be eligible for a Severance Allowance under job elimination or technological change but not both. Any employee affected by job elimination or any employee with one or more years of continuous service for whom no job is available because of mechanization, technological change or automation will, upon
Page 70
termination, receive a severance allowance calculated by one of the two following methods, it being the choice of the affected employee as to which of such methods of calculation is used:
(a)	One week’s pay for each year of employment during his last period of continuous service, computed on the basis of fifty-six (56) straight time hours at the employee’s regular rate, the maximum severance allowance payable being thirty (30) week’s pay.
(b)	Two percent (2%) of his total earnings for the last period of continuous service, the maximum severance allowance payable being an amount equal to one thousand six hundred eighty (1,680) hours at the employee’s regular rate.
At the time of separation, the employee shall have the option of receiving his severance allowance on termination, or he may elect to have his severance allowance held in abeyance for up to one (1) year from the date of termination. He may apply in writing at any time during the year, at which time his full severance allowance will be paid forthwith.
Employees affected by technological change for whom no employment is available will be given at least thirty (30) day’s notice of separation.
When weeks of severance pay combined with the termination dates carries into the following year, the employee has the option to have the severance pay payable in the following year. The severance allowance will not be more than the employee would normally receive if he remained at work at forty (40) hours per week to his normal retirement date.
Page 71
8.	Training
The Company agrees to participate in a program of training or retraining for another job within the operation for those employees who are displaced under technological change.
9.	Retiring Allowance
(a)	The Company and Union recognize that in face of significant reduction of the workforce due to job elimination, attrition through early retirement is a preferential way to decrease the size of the workforce.
For the term of this Agreement, and consistent with 3. Required Notice for Technological Change and 4. Notice for Job Elimination above, and; the continued availability of a skilled workforce, a one-month window of opportunity will be opened for eligible employees to exercise a retirement leaving option.
(b)	Employees exercising the option shall terminate their employment within four (4) weeks after the implementation of the job elimination.
(c)	Eligible employees are those employees who are fifty-five (55) years or older and who qualify for pension benefits under the PPWC Mackenzie Wood Products Plan.
(d)	Employees wishing to exercise the Retirement Leaving Option shall be entitled to receive a Retirement Allowance equivalent to the value specified in No. 7 above as well as pension benefits in accordance with the applicant’s pension entitlement.
Page 72
(e)	The Retirement Leaving Allowance may be directly rolled into an RRSP or other tax shelter as may be permissible under the Income Tax Act, otherwise it will be subject to the appropriate tax deductions.
10.	Severance Pay for Permanent Plant Closures
Effective July 1, 2003, employees terminated by the Company because of a permanent full site closure shall be entitled to severance pay equal to ten (10) days’ pay for each year of continuous service with the company and thereafter for partial years in increments of completed months of service.
SECTION XIX - RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED PAYMENTS (ROCE)
1. Payments will be made to each employee in the following years based upon ROCE payment triggers. ROCE will be based on the previous calendar year from combined Canadian Forest Products Ltd., Solid Wood Sector, Northern Operations performance information, compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Year	ROCE 5%	ROCE 10%	ROCE 15%	ROCE 20%
2003	0	0	0	0
2004	$100	$250	$375	$500
2005	$100	$500	$750	$1000
2006	$100	$250	$375	$500
2007	$100	$250	$375	$500
2008	$100	$250	$375	$500
Page 73
(a)	ROCE based payments will apply to all regular Employees on the basis of increments of months worked in the calendar year. Regular employees who are laid off during the year will be paid on the basis of months in which they actually worked at least one (1) day. For the purposes of this section, vacation will be considered as time worked. These payments will only apply to employees with seniority rights.
(b)	Payments will be made by June 30 each year, or in the event that PricewaterhouseCoopers published results are not available by that date, payments will be made as soon as possible thereafter.
Page 74

basis as under the terms and conditions of the PPWC Mackenzie Wood Products Pension Plan.
Payments under this provision will cease at the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the employee who selects to retire early under this provision attains age 65 (sixty-five) or dies, whichever occurs first.
In addition, employees may elect to retire at the age of sixty (60) without losing the option to bridge at age sixty-one (61).
9.	Employees who for reason of layoff did not accumulate the required one thousand six hundred (1600) hours to qualify for a full years pension credit will be granted the hours required to qualify for a full years pension credit. This will apply for the years 1981, 1982 and 1983.

11.	The Company agrees that the trustees should investigate the rules applying to credited hours and hours on which contributions are made of both the Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan and the Forest Industry Pension Plan and apply those rules if agreed to the administration of the Pension Plan.
Page 109
12.	The Company agrees that the Break in Service provision of the Pension Plan will be the same as that which applies in the Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan.
13.	The Company agrees that the Trustees should review the performance of the current actuary and seek competitive bids from up to four Actuarial Firms which may include the present actuary prior to confirmation of an actuary for the next plan year. If either the Union or Company Trustees are in favour, a second actuarial opinion may be sought.
14.	The Company agrees that the Trustees should consider and investigate entering into a reciprocal agreement regarding portability with the Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan and with the Forest Industry Pension Plan. If the Trustees are in favour of such an arrangement an approach may be made to the two other Industry Plans to seek their approval.
15.	Re: Portability between the Canadian Forest Products Ltd./Local 18 Pension Plan and the Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan.
The Company and Union agree to authorize the Trustees of the Pension Plan to have the Pension Plan actuary develop an arrangement for vesting purposes between the Pension Plan and the Pulp and Paper Industry Pension Plan which will permit service in both plans to count for vesting.

In addition the PPWC Mackenzie Wood Products Pension Plan will provide an automatic Joint and Last Survivor benefit to vested members aged fifty-five (55) and older. This amounts to a pension of two-thirds (2/3) of the reduced pension that would be paid to the member had he retired. Such pension is paid to the elected survivor. This provision will remain unchanged. It is not paid in addition to the pre-retirement death benefit outlined in the paragraph above.

Page 127
2.	The Company agrees not to introduce contractors which would result in the loss of positions held by employees.
3.	The Parties agree that there may be reasonable exceptions to clause two (2) above. Such cases will be reviewed with the Union where practical at least one (1) month prior to implementation.

4.	The Company agrees not to make repetitive use of the exception language in order, over the course of time, to convert an employee work force into a contractor work force.
5.	The umpire will be selected by mutual agreement within sixty (60) days of the ratification of the Agreement. If the Parties fail to agree within the above time they will request the Minister of Labour to appoint the umpire.
Re: Trades Guidelines and Demarcation
The Company and the Union recognize the principle of tradelines and job demarcation as practiced in the mills prior to July 1, 1986 for the purposes of interpreting the Trades Flexibility Section outlined below.
Trades Flexibility
1.	Tradesmen may be assigned work in other than their own trade under the guidance of a qualified hourly tradesman in the trade in which the work is being performed.
Page 128
2.	Tradesmen may be assigned work in trades other than their own consistent with the tradesman’s ability, keeping safety factors in mind.
3.	Tradesmen may be required to take on-site training for duties that are normally performed by other trades.
(a)	The objective is to provide training to develop skills so that trades people can assist in other trades and not to eliminate other trades or tradesmen.
(b)	Apprenticeships will be distributed as stipulated otherwise in the Contract.
4.	The traditional division of work between production and maintenance is not altered by the above agreement. Employees of either department will not be assigned work that would have the effect of displacing employees of the other department.
It is understood that there must be cooperation between maintenance and production to further the efficient operation of the mills. Production employees may be assigned to assist tradesmen as labourers and maintenance personnel may run production equipment for maintenance purposes.
Re: Trades Attrition
The parties recognize that with the implementation of Trades Flexibility in the mills the opportunity to reduce the crew complement in the Maintenance Department will exist.
The Company therefore agrees that any crew reductions in the Maintenance Department resulting from the implementation and utilization of Trades Flexibility will be accomplished by attrition and
Page 129
that no Maintenance Department Employee will lose his job in the Maintenance Department as a result of the above.
For the term of the agreement, the Company shall employ all reasonable means to maintain a minimum Maintenance work force of ninety-five (95) tradesmen and apprentices. This shall include no less than thirteen (13) electrical personnel, forty-two (42) in millwrighting and/or welding, six (6) mechanics, four (4) carpenters and/or painters, three (3) in sprinkler fitting and twenty (20) in saw filing.
This shall not limit the right of the Company to reduce maintenance department crews in conjunction with any other department(s) curtailments or cutbacks or to dismiss for cause.
It is understood that if maintenance department crews are reduced as a result of any other departments curtailment or cutback, when and if that department returns to its former level of operation those maintenance department employees affected by the curtailment or cutback will be returned to the maintenance department complement.
The parties agree that the closure of ‘B’ Mill will result in a reduction of the maintenance work force by one-third (1/3). Specifically: total trades complement will be reduced from ninety-five (95) to sixty-three (63). This reduction is reflected throughout all listed trades.
Amended March 17th, 1993

Re: Vacation Pay
All employees will have their regular hourly wage rate paid through the regular payroll system for any time taken as vacation except for those employees who elect to take a lump sum payment of all vacation earning accruals. All remaining vacation earning accruals will be paid the 1st Friday after the 1st pay following December 31st.
Explanation:
For the purpose of scheduling vacation the only change will be that employees will have to have taken their minimal allotment prior to December 31st.
For the purpose of scheduling vacation during ‘primetime’ (mid-June to Labour Day, third week of December to New Year’s Day and Spring break) employees requesting vacation for the period between January 1st and May 31st will be required to have submitted their vacation requests prior to November 15th. Those employees requesting vacation for the period between June 1st and December 31st will be required to have submitted their vacation requests prior to April 15th.
In order to facilitate the transition from the current practice to that proposed, we are suggesting that all vacation pay accrued since June 1, 2004 (minus any vacation pay advances taken during the same period) will be paid in January 2005. In situations where an employee’s ‘number of hours’ of vacation entitlement (as per clause 4.(ii)) is greater than their percentage of earnings they would receive the equivalent of 7/12’s of their allotted annual vacation for 2004 (for the seven (7) month period from June 1 to December 31, 2004).
Effective January 1, 2005 all employees would then qualify for their annual vacation and their minimum entitlement would have to be taken before December 31, 2005. This being the case, employees whom had already scheduled 2004 vacations for the period between January 1, Page 132
2005 and May 31, 2005 would need to reconfirm whether or not they wished to have this time counted as part of their 2005 vacation allotment. Special consideration will be given, on a case-by-case basis, to any employee that has purposely retained the majority of their 2004 vacation allotment for planned vacations scheduled for a time prior to May 31, 2005. Those that had done so would just need to plan accordingly and retain sufficient ‘vacation pay’ for their needs from the proposed January 2005 vacation pay accrual ‘pay-out’.
Re: Removal of Discipline
An employee’s discipline record will be considered “clean” if he/she has no discipline for two (2) consecutive years of service. For the purposes of the above statement, the employee’s discipline record will remain intact however the historical discipline record will not be used as part of progressive discipline for future incidents of misconduct.
Exceptions to this clause will include any incidents of serious misconduct (theft, harassment, intoxication due to drugs or alcohol at work, assault or threats of assault, or gross insubordination).

Re: Equalization of the Opportunity for Overtime
The Company will endeavor to provide equal opportunity to overtime for all employees. Employees will be called in to work overtime hours based on the following principles:
1.	Overtime hours will be balanced semi-annually (June & December) to the effect that employees in the same job will have the opportunity to work approximately the same number of hours of overtime.
Page 133
2.	Opportunities to work overtime will consider first the employees scheduled to the position, second a trained posted employee, and third an employee who has previously been trained. Employees who transfer from one job to another will be considered to have the average overtime accrual of all employees in that position.
3.	For the purpose of calculating overtime hours accrued, all overtime worked will be calculated at straight time hours and all overtime opportunities where the employee was not available or where the employee refused the shift will be included.
4.	Weekend overtime shift schedules will be made up from a voluntary sign-up sheet. Only those employees who sign that sheet will be selected for weekend overtime shifts.
5.	Employees who do not wish to be called for overtime must complete a form to that effect.
