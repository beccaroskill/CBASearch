It is understood that an employee who is moved under the above provisions will return to his original job as soon as production requirements warrant.
For lay-offs of less than a full shift, seniority will not be considered.

The Company recognizes the principles of seniority and recognizes that it is difficult to develop rules which would, in every Instance, be fair both to the eaployee and the Coapany .	Therefore, it is agreed that whenever
situations arise on a job which may not be readily answered by the above, the Company and the Union will meet to resolve
8
he problea. Kvery e£ fort will be Bade to arrive at an igreeaant, but if a autual agreement is not concluded, then leniorlty shall prevail.
