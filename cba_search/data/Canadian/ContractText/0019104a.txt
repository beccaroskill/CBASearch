ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION
1.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all employees employed in connection with the mining operations of the Company at Grande Cache, Alberta, except office staff, engineering and survey employees, security guards, uniformed police and supervisory staff including supervisors with authority to hire and/or fire, in respect to terms and conditions of employment of employees including provisions with reference to rates of pay and hours of work.
With the exception of emergencies, the Company agrees that prior to any contracting out of work the Company and Union executive will meet to discuss:
a)	Scope of the work being contracted out and
b)	Duration of the contract and
c)	Anticipated number of contractor employees
All options of directing the work towards employees of Smoky River Coal will be investigated.
In any event the contractor shall not be given preference in overtime work which is being performed by Smoky River Coal employees. In all other respects the parties will follow past practice regarding the treatment of short term and long term contractors.
The Company further agrees that any contractor or other agent employed by the Company to carry out work falling within the scope of this clause who is not a party to a Collective Agreement or affiliated to The Alberta Federation of Labour or the Canadian Labour Congress, shall be required as a condition of such employment to carry out such work in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement and such contractor or agent shall endorse a memorandum of intent to this effect with the Union. The Company will advise the Union each month, in writing, of the names of any sub-contractor and the number of employees employed by those sub-contractors.
1.02	The Company agrees that it will not contract out work that is normally done by its employees, if such contracting out would result in demotion or a loss of employment through layoff.
1.02.1	Notwithstanding the foregoing it is understood that any
contractor or agent will not be obliged to create or set up a pension as contemplated by 18.07 of this agreement provided however, the Union shall be entitled to obtain an alternate benefit if the cost of such alternate benefit is not in excess of the Company pension plan on a per employee basis, but if the contractor is already party to a pension plan then that contractor’s employees will remain covered by that pension plan.
1.03	The word “employee” or “employees” wherever used in this agreement shall mean any and all employees covered in the bargaining unit as defined above. The male gender when used in this agreement, shall include the female gender.
1.04	Supervisors shall not be covered by this Agreement. Any person who is promoted out of the bargaining unit shall, if he remains promoted after three months (90 calendar days), lose all seniority and if he later rejoins the bargaining unit he will be treated as a new employee.
In any event he will not be allowed bumping rights.
1.05	Supervisors in an acting supervisory capacity shall be covered by this agreement, while holding such a position. While an employee is in an acting supervisory capacity, his probation period as per Article 1.04 shall accumulate and be used to decrease his probationary period.
Should an employee then be promoted to a supervisory position out of the bargaining unit, the time spent as an acting supervisor will count as probation.
The Company will supply to the Union upon request a list of the time spent by hourly employees in acting or probationary supervisory capacity on a monthly basis.
The time limits for Article 1.04 and 1.05 shall not exceed three (3) months (90 calendar days) in any year of this collective agreement.

The Company will supply all new employees with a copy of the Collective Agreement.
3.02	All employees covered by the Agreement and employed by the Company who are now members in good standing of the Union shall, as a condition of employment, remain members in good standing.

The Company shall deduct commencing with the first full pay cheque of an employee, the initiation fee and the first month’s dues and thereafter the then prevailing monthly Union dues. Such dues deduction shall be made, after the initiation fee and first month’s dues deduction, in respect of the second pay period in each month and shall be a condition of employment for each employee.

35
17.03	A joint committee of three Union representatives and three (3) Company representatives will be established in each of the following areas:
(a)	Underground
(b)	Surface Mines
(c)	Processing
The Union and the Company will appoint one person on each committee IO act as co-chairman for that committee. The Company and the Union will ensure that the representatives appointed to the committees have such qualifications as to enable them to complete inspection tours and report as required by any relevant legislation or Governmental directives. The inspection shall be conducted in each area by any two of the three representatives of each party. The meetings of the Committee, again consisting of any two representatives from each side, shall be held at least once per month and more often if necessary. Prior to the meeting, the inspection tour of operations will be conducted. The inspection tour report will be discussed at the monthly meeting. The Committee shall also discuss:

The two recognized Union committee members who will join the Company representative for the purpose of inspecting a particular portion of the operation will be chosen by the Union from these members.

No disciplinary action shall be taken until the jointly developed “Dispute-Resolution Procedure” has been followed.
