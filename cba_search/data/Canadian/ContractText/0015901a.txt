ii)	the relative skill, ability and physical fitness of the employees to fulfill such requirements, and
iii)	the graduate seniority including time served as an apprentice with the Company since his most recent date of hire, of any electrician who has answered the notice.
If, in the opinion of the Company, there is not a suitable candidate for the vacancy from those who have applied to the notice, or if no one has applied to the notice, then the Company will select the employee to be assigned.
