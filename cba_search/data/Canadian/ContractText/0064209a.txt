Upon request, the Company will also provide an employee with a copy of any material or documents in an employee's personnel files, which if inaccurate, shall be corrected.
(e)	The Company agrees that the discharge of any employee shall only be made by the Vice President-Human Resources, after the grounds upon which the discharge for just cause are based have been thoroughly investigated by the Company, and the employee has been given an opportunity, with his Shop Steward present, to respond to the reasons stated for the discharge.

Regular medical attendance is required throughout the benefit period. Employees who are receiving weekly indemnity benefits due to a nonoccupational accident will have the three-day waiting period paid following 20 working days of continuous disability.
Successive disabilities are considered to be different periods if they are separated by fourteen consecutive days of active, fulltime work or the disability is due to wholly different causes.
Disabilities arising from pregnancy are covered, however, no benefts are payable during any period:
(a)	for which benefits are paid under the Employment Insurance Act.
(b)	of maternity leave taken pursuant to provincial or federal law or pursuant to mutual agreement between the employee and the employer, or

80
Your weekly income benefits will be reduced by an amount payable under a government automobile insurance plan which is approved as a reduction by the Employment Insurance Act.
Collective Bargaining Agreement
If you are receiving benefits under the weekly indemnity plan as provided for under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, you shall be entitled to receive increases in the weekly indemnity benefit relative to increases in the hourly rate of pay provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
LONG TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE
Elimination Period
The monthly income benefits specified in the Schedule of Benefits is payable after 26 weeks of total disabil ity th rough to recovery, age 65 or retirement, whicheveroccursfirst.
For a period of total disability which is a result of pregnancy, the elimination period commences on the date the pregnancy terminates, or, if earlier, the date the employee is totally disabled. Ceasing to be actively at work with the employer does not, by itself, mean than an employee is totally disabled.
Definition of Disability
An insured employee is not considered totally disabled during the first 24 months following the elimination period if he/she is deemed able by the Company, to do the substantial (60%) portion of the regular duties of his own occupation for any employer. Thereafter, an insured employee is not considered totally disabled for the period following the first 24 months of benefits if he/she is deemed able, by the company, to perform at least 60% of the regular duties of any occupation for any employer for which
81
he/she is reasonably fitted, or could become, by education, training or experience.
Regular duties are defined as those work related activities which are considered essential to the employee's performance of the occupation and which proportionately take the majority of time to complete.
Successive Periods of Disability
If you return to work after a period of total disability, any subsequent period of total disability will be considered a continuation of the previous one, unless the two periods of total disability are separated by an interval of full-time employment of less than:
-one day, if the two periods of total disability are due to unrelated causes; or
-six continuous months, if the two periods of total disability are due to the same or related causes.
If the period of total disability is considered to be a continuation of a previous period of total disability, benefits will be resumed in the same amount but without the application of another elimination period. Unless you have been at work for at least two weeks, your monthly indemnity will be based on the amount of your basic earnings prior to your original disability.
Benefit Reduction
The purpose of this insurance is to extend to you a reasonable level of income when you are disabled, but it is not designed to give you income which would exceed or even equal your normal take-home pay when you are working. For this reason, the benefits that you receive from the plan will be reduced by any income from the following sources.
82
Direct Offsets
1.	any amount of income provided for you and your dependents by reason of your same or subsequent disability under the legislation of any government or emanation thereof, other than Employment Insurance. However, any increase in the disability under the Quebec/Canada Pension Plan because of an automatic adjustment in the cost-of-living index occurring while you are receiving monthly indemnity of monthly rehabilitative income is not considered income for the purpose of determining the amount payable.
2.	any amount of income provided to you under any Workers' Compensation Law orsimilar legislation.
In addition, if your monthly indemnity exceeds 85% of monthly basic earnings, your monthly indemnity will be further reduced by the amounts received from the following sources.
Indirect Offsets
1.	any amount of income provided for you from any employer by reason of the same orsubsequentdisability;
2.	any amount of income provided for you under any other group insurance or group pre-payment plan, including any policy issued to you as a result of your membership in an association of any kind;
3.	any amount of income provided for you under any retirement or pension plan of your employer;

5.	when permitted by law, any amount of income provided for you under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act or similar legislation.
83
Rehabilitation
If, after having received payments, you are unable to return to your former full-time position but can engage in some work (approved by the insurer) for remuneration, the benefits will continue but will be reduced by 50% of your rehabilitative earnings provided your total income during a rehabilitative program does not exceed 100% of your pre-disability income. The benefits will cease once you are no longer classified as being totally disabled or on attainment of age 65.
Limitations
Your long term disability income continuance benefit does not include coverage during which:
-you are not under the regular care of a doctor; or
-you engage in any occupation or employment for wage or profit, otherthan rehabilitative employment; or
-beyond your65th birthday.

85
-you will be required to submit a "treatment plan" to the insurance company before treatment commences for any Routine Treatment expected to cost more than $200. This enables the insurance company to determine in advance the share of the cost of the proposed treatment and thus allows you to know the extent of any part of the costs you will have to pay.
