18
employee, in accordance with the conditions, provided hereunder in paragraph 6.02.

An employee will be considered on probation and will not be subject to the seniority provisions of this agreement until after he has completed sixty (60) days of work (forty (40) days of work for employees on weekend shifts) in the bargaining unit within a period of six (6) consecutive calendar months (nine (9) months for employees on weekend shifts) from the date of hire. Upon completion of such probationary period the employee’s name will be placed on the seniority list of his department, with seniority dating from his date of hire.

'1. Any employee, who has worked on an occupation covered by the bargaining unit and who has been transferred before November 4th, 1987, to an occupation not
19
covered by the agreement will be credited for seniority purposes with his total length of continuous service accumulated within the bargaining unit if he is transferred again to an occupation covered by the present agreement.
It is understood that said employee will have the right to use one of the following options when so transferred:
-	Replace the least senior employee on the former occupation and shift that he held prior to his transfer outside the bargaining unit.
-	Replace the least senior employee on the said former occupation and on the schedule of his choice.

2.	Any employee, who works on an occupation covered by the bargaining unit and is given an opportunity after November4th, 1987, to attend educational or training courses or any employee trained for a non-bargaining
20
unit occupation, will be credited for seniority purposes with his total length of continuous service, if he should be subsequently transferred into the bargaining unit within twelve (12) months of completion of said courses or training.
Prior to the commencement of said course or training, the company will inform the union in writing with the name of the employee concerned as well as an estimated period of time of the duration (maximum of twenty-four (24) consecutive months) for said course or training.
3.	After November 4th, 1987, any employee who works on an occupation covered by the bargaining unit and who is subsequently transferred to an occupation not covered by this agreement will be credited for seniority purposes, with his total length of continuous service if he is transferred again into the bargaining unit within twelve (12) months.
4.	In the case where an employee is reinstated into the bargaining unit as per the provisions of 8.02 b) 1, 2 and 3, said employee will remit to the union a sum equal to the amount of union dues for the period so spent up to a maximum of 24 months outside the bargaining unit.

22
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to probationary employees where time lost for any reason will not be counted in determining the completion of the probationary period.
8.04	Loss of Seniority:

a)	voluntarily quits the employ of the company;
b)	is discharged for just cause and the discharge is not reversed through the grievance procedure;

e)	is absent due to sickness or an accident for more than twelve (12) months in the case of an employee with less than five (5) years’ seniority and twenty-four (24) months in the
23
case of an employee having five (5) years’ or more seniority. If an employee advises the company at the end of the said twelve (12) or twenty-four (24) month period, as the case may be, and once every six (6) months thereafter of his intention to return to work, his seniority will not be broken. These provisions do not apply in Workmen’s Compensation cases and seniority will not be broken during the period of compensation.
8.05	Application for seniority:
Seniority rules are applied firstly to the employees of the department concerned before looking elsewhere in the plant.
8.06	Definition of vacancy:
For purposes of this article 8 a vacancy results either from the normal turnover of personnel, such as retirement, resignation, death, promotion, dismissal, demotion for cause or transfer of employees to jobs not covered by this bargaining unit or from an increase in the number of employees re quired on an occupation. The above does not imply that particular job vacancies must necessarily be filled. However, should the job remain in operation it shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of article 8.07.
24
8.07	In the case of job vacancies, the
following procedure will apply:
a)	The company will post the job vacancy notice for a period of seven (7) days on the departmental and central bulletin board and will remit a copy to the departmental steward. However, the company is not required to post any job vacancy where duration of the vacancy does not exceed sixty (60) working days. A temporary job vacancy is that which is defined under article 8.11 - Temporary transfers, subheadings “a” to “f”.
b)	Employees who are interested in the job vacancy will offer their candidacy by requesting a job bid form from their supervisor.
c)	If no employee in the department concerned has offered his candidacy or if no candidates are qualified in the department, the company will consider from other employees who have applied.
d)	In the choice of the employee to occupy the job vacancy, seniority shall prevail among employees who have offered their candidacy providing they are qualified to perform the occupation for which they are a candidate as outlined in paragraph 8.09.
e)	1. The company will post acknowledgement notices for all candidates to any job vacancies. The name of the successful applicant
25
will be posted on a job award notice for any job vacancy for a period of four (4) working days.
The company will advise the successful applicant of any job vacancy within one week from the expiry date of the job posting period.
The company will send a copy of the job posting and the award of the successful candidate to the local union.
2. The company will place the successful applicant on the occupation within fifteen (15) working days of the end of the posting period except where such appointment would disrupt normal production flow and/or needs and the requirements of quality.
f)	It is agreed that the company may temporarily fill the job vacancy during the posting period without restriction.
g)	The employees who have bid for the job vacancy as described in sub-paragraph (b) above are the only ones who may later file a grievance.
h)	An employee who has thus been granted an occupation at an equivalent or lower contractual wage rated job will not be permitted to bid to his former occupation or an equivalent or lower contractual rated job for any future job vacancy during the ensuing year.
26
In any cases when an employee has been granted an occupation at an equivalent or lower contractual wage rate job, he will then receive the contractual wage rate of the job he has been granted if it is unmeasured or measured hourly, and if it is a piece work job he will than receive the guarantee rate of said job or according to his performance.
i)	In exceptional cases where employees who have been promoted and who cannot perform during the training period, a demotion or transfer can be considered only by mutual agreement of both parties.
When the company nevertheless wishes to demote or transfer an employee for reasons of ill-health, the employee will be given preference according to his seniority if it is an occupation which he has previously fulfilled satisfactorily in the same department or if he has not previously fulfilled this occupation, if he is qualified to do the work. This, however, does not preclude the right of the employee who is demoted or transferred from lodging a grievance on the basis that his demotion or transfer was unjustified.
8.08	Preference of assignment:
In the case of preference of assigment requested by employees the following will apply:
27
a)	When a vacancy occurs on an occupation on a particular shift, a maximum of one (1) change in assignment will be permitted upon request of an employee working on the occupation and shift concerned on the basis of seniority.
b)	The preference of assignment as described above will be granted to the employee currently working on the occupation and shift concerned prior to filling the job vacancy.
c)	The parties agree that in no other circumstances will there be a preference of assignment among the employees currently working on the same occupation.
8.09
1. The following factors will be considered in evaluating an employee’s skill, competence and ability related to the performance of the work for which he is a candidate.
a)	Physical requirements of the occupation and physical qualification of the candidate.
b)	Results of aptitude tests.
c)	Successful participation in training courses for the occupation for which he is a candidate. These training courses may take the form of theoretical courses, on-the-job training in the department or in the training center.
28
d)	Licences where required.
e)	For the jobs involving the handling of a crew, the ability to direct people shall also be considered.
f)	To utilise an aptitude test as a factor of consideration to evaluate an employee, the company must:
1.	Consider new experience since last test and allow an employee applying for a job to undertake same test as other candidates.
2.	Act same as above in cases of courses followed by an employee in relation with requirements of posted occupation.
It is understood that some of these above-mentioned factors will have more relative importance than others depending on the occupation which is vacant.
2. Should the company decide to give training courses to its employees on various occupations, the employees who are chosen will be selected according to the provisions of paragraph 8.09.
8.10	Permanent transfers:
A permanent transfer is a permanent assignment of an employee by the company to a job vacancy in another occupation at the same wage rate.
29
In the case of permanent transfers, the same principles will apply as outlined above in paragraph 8.09. An employee will carry his seniority with him immediately upon being transferred permanently to a different department.
It is understood and agreed that an employee on the seniority list is not obliged to accept a permanent transfer.
8.11	Temporary transfers:
A temporary transfer is a temporary assignment of an employee at the request of the company to a temporary job vacancy in another occupation at a higher wage rate, at a lower wage rate or an equivalent wage rate.
It is understood that temporary transfers from the weekday schedule to the weekend schedule and vice versa shall be voluntary with the exception that the least senior employee on the occupation and schedule in question being required to accept said transfer when the only alternative of the company is to lay-off other employees.
Temporary transfers shall be effected for a maximum period of thirty (30) calendar days except for one of the following reasons in which case the given movements will not exceed twelve (12) months.
30
a)	To replace one or more employees who are taking their annual vacations;
b)	to replace an employee absent as a result of an industrial accident or illness, or non-industrial accident or an employee absent on maternity leave;
c)	to replace a transferred employee, who at the request of the company is working for another branch of C.S. Brooks Corporation or of Dominion Textile Inc., or for another company affiliated to or supplying materials or services to the company;
d)	to fill a job because the company has temporarily increased certain labour requirements to meet a special situation.
It is understood that this paragraph does not imply that in cases of normal vacancies and normal conditions that articles 8.06 and
8.07	are not to be applied;
e)	to replace an employee who is receiving special training or preparation for a supervisory or technical position, or to replace an employee transferred as a result of the transfer of another employee who is receiving the said special training or preparation;
f)	to replace an employee absent on a special approved leave.
31
The company shall have the right to transfer employees on a temporary basis to fill temporary job vacancies as described in the preceding paragraph. Employees who are thus transferred will be remunerated according to the provisions of paragraph 13.02.
The company will not use a series of temporary appointments outside the job posting procedure to enable an employee to accumulate experience in order to place him in a preferential position in the event of a permanent vacancy.
8.12	Shift work:
a)	If there is more than one shift in operation on any occupation, the employees will rotate every week.
b)	The departmental seniority of an employee who is currently on the occupation in that department will govern preference of shifts when a vacancy occurs on that occupation.
8.13	Layoffs - One complete shift or less:
Subject to paragraph 8.14 hereunder in the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees on an occupation in a department for one (1) complete shift or less, the employees on the occupation and shift concerned will be laid off in the reverse
32
order of seniority according to the seniority list established in paragraph 8.19. It is understood that employees so laid off will not have the right to displace other employees on other shifts or other occupation.
8.14 Layoffs - More than one (1) complete shift:
In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees on an occupation in a department for more than one (1) complete shift to five (5) complete shifts for weekday employees or more than one (1) to three (3) complete shifts for weekend employees, the employees on the occupation with the least seniority according to the seniority list will be subject to a layoff. The employee subject to a layoff will have the right to replace an employee on a probationary period in production, or an employee with the least seniority on an occupation in his department which he had previously fulfilled satisfactorily or on an equivalent or lower rated occupation in his department provided that he is qualified to perform the work.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no employee qualified under 8.09 shall be affected by a layoff out of the order of his seniority for an aggregate of more than five (5) working days for weekday employees or more than
33
three (3) working days for weekend employees within a calendar quarter (13) weeks).
8.15	Layoffs - More than five (5) complete shifts:
In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees on an occupation in a department for more than five (5) complete shifts, for weekday employees or more than three (3) complete shifts for weekend employees, the employee on the occupation with the least seniority according to the seniority list established in paragraph 8.19 will be subject to layoff. The employee subject to said layoff firstly has the right to replace a probationary employee on production or an employee with the least seniority on an occupation which he has previously fulfilled satisfactorily or on an equivalent or lower ranked occupation in his department provided that he is qualified to perform the work within a maximum delay of five (5) days for weekday employees or four (4) days for employees on weekend shifts. Secondly, if the employee is unable to use the above provisions he has the right to replace a probationary employee on production or an employee with the least seniority on an occupation which he has previously fulfilled satisfactorily or an equivalent or lower ranked occupation in another department provided that he is qualified to perform
34
the work within a maximum delay of five (5) days for weekday employees or four (4) days for employees on weekend shifts.
This last disposition can only be invoked once by an employee concerned on the occasion of each layoff and will only be applied to employees with six (6) months seniority or more.
In cases where occupations and/or complete assignments are permanently eliminated due to a reduction of machinery or technological change, this last disposition which will be extended to thirty-five (35) working days, can only be invoked once by an employee concerned on the occasion of each layoff and will be applied to employees who have at least completed their probationary period.
An employee who transfers to another department as a result of Article 8.15 will have his/her seniority transferred effective immediately when the transfer occurs. This does not eliminate the provisions of Article
8.16	(d).
N.B. It is understood that provisions of Article 8.13, 8.14 and 8.15 are to be applied within the employees regular schedule before being applied into the other schedule.
35
8.16	Recalls to work:
The following procedures will apply in recalling employees to work following a layoff:
Temporary Recalls:
a)	Laid cff employees will be recalled to work in their order of seniority in their respective departments and on the occupation which they held prior to the layoff.
However, should such employee not be available then laid off employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority in their respective departments provided they previously fulfilled the occupation satisfactorily and provided that they meet the provisions of Article 8.09.
Further, should such employees not be available then laid cff employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority from other departments provided they previously fulfilled the occupation satisfactorily and provided that they meet the provisions of Article
8.09.
Permanent Recalls:
b)	Laid off employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority in their respective departments on an occupation which they have previously fulfilled satisfactorily and provided that they meet the provisions d Article
8.09.
36
However, should such employees not be available than laid off employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority in their respective departments provided that they meet the provisions of Article 8.09.
Further, should such employees not be available then laid off employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority from layoffs from other departments provided that they previously fulfilled the occupation satisfactorily and provided that they meet provisions of Article 8.09.
Further, should such employees not be available then laid off employees will be recalled to work in the order of seniority from layoffs from other departments provided they meet the provisions of Article 8.09.
c)	However, if an employee is recalled to a new department his seniority will be transferred effective immediately when the transfer occurs. This does not eliminate the provisions of Article 8.16 - D.
New employees will not be hired until all laid off employees have been so recalled.
However, it is understood that employees will not be obliged to accept the recall to a work schedule or department different than the one they worked prior to their layoff except in the case that the only alternative for
37
the company is to hire new employees then it is understood that the junior employee involved in, the above provisions, will be obliged to come back to work.
d)	It is understood that, when an occupation or shift is again formed, the original employees on this shift or occupation who may have been transferred or demoted to another occupation and while displaced to another job have not been awarded a new occupation as a result of Article 8.07 will return to the reorganized shift or occupation provided that this happens within a period of one (1) year following their transfer or demotion except where such transfer would disrupt normal production flow and/or needs of the requirementsof quality.
It is understood that the company will not use these delays to allow employees on temporary transfers to accumulate preferential position on the reformed shift.
The employee originally on the shift and the occupation must be transferred back on his shift in the shortest possible delay. After the application of this paragraph any unfilled occupations on the reformed shift are considered “Vacancies” as defined in paragraph 8.06.
38
8.17	Notice of change of address:
It is the duty of employees to notify the company promptly of any change of address. If an employee fails to do this, the company will not be responsible for failure of a notice to reach such employees.
8.18	Compensation:
If it is established that the seniority rights of an employee have not been respected, the sole arbitrator will have the right to determine compensation to be paid by the company, if any, up to the amount of earnings lost and change the seniority date of the employee if necessary.
8.19	Seniority list:
a)	A list of seniority standings will be posted in each department showing the names of each employee in that department together with his length of continuous service with the plant in accordance with paragraph 8.01. This list will be revised every six (6) months. Copies of these posted lists shall be forwarded without delay to the union, and a copy remitted to departmental stewards and other plant union officers. After such posting, each such list shall become final with respect to the employees designated therein, except as to any employee who disputes, under the grievance procedure, the accuracy of his
39
seniority date or the seniority date of any other employee of his department designated therein, within thirty (30) working days after the list is posted. In any event, such grievance cannot dispute the accuracy of any previous final list.
b)	The accuracy of the seniority lists may be subject to revision at any time when such inaccuracy occurs as a result of typographical error.
c)	The date of posting will be indicated on the seniority list.
8.20	Occupations not covered by agreement:
Appointments to occupations not covered by this agreement shall not be subject to the terms of this Article 8.
8.21	Posting for future openings:
Should the company decide to give training courses to its employees, training for future openings will be posted as an occupation without assignment and shift. The posting and selection will be done according to the provisions of Articles 8.07 and 8.09.
When the training is completed the employee will return to his or her former occupation. It is also understood that when such training is fully completed, said accumulated experience
40
is to be taken in consideration in the event of
any future lay offs.
When the occupation for which the employee was trained becomes open, it will be posted to allow preference of assignment and shift only among employees currently on the occupation. Then the employee that was trained will be required to take the opening provided the opening occurs within one year of the completion of the training period and provided the employee has not subsequent to the training period been awarded a job posting to an occupation that is a promotion over the future needs posting to which he was trained.
If more than one employee were trained in advance, seniority shall prevail with the least senior employee being required to accept the opening.
ARTICLE 9 PRODUCTIVITY
9.01
a) During the course of the present agreement all changes concerning tasks, work assignments, piece-work rates or changes in the regular duties of an hourly-paid occupation or changes from an hourly-rated occupation to piece-work rated occupation or vice versa and the establishment of new rates
41
therefore shall be submitted by the company to the union.
b) The plant manager, upon request, at any time after the commencement of change referred to in paragraphs 9.02, 9.03 and 9.04 or at any time after a written request for a revision of element time values has been submitted under paragraph 9.05, and until such time as the change is accepted or the written request for revision is settled or a decision of the sole arbitrator is rendered, shall grant the union permission to delegate a representative to observe the effects of the said change and/or to carry out chronometrical tests himself for the purpose of verification provided the said representative does not hinder the proper functioning of the department,
9.02
If a change contemplated by the company concerning a piece-work occupation has to do with the revision of a measured work element or the addition of a measured work element not already established or the complete elimination of a measured work element, the company must, at least one (1) working week prior to the application of that change, advise the union in writing of the nature of the change.
If the change applies to a measured piecework occupation and affects the existing
42
standard time value by twenty percent (20%) or more, a period of adaptation will be applied.
The period of adaptation will have a maximum duration of four (4) weeks. During this period, the employees concerned will work under the new conditions. For wage payment purposes, the difference between the preceding and new standard time values will be applied progressively in four (4) equal increments over the four (4) week period of adaptation. At the conclusion of the period of adaptation, the full revised standard time values will be in effect for wage payment purposes.
When the change has been put into effect by the company, and the union does not agree with such change, a review will be made by a representative of the plant's industrial engineering department and the representative of the union. Such review will include an inspection of the job specification and summary data which formed the basis for the change. If such review does not settle the grievance, the union may refer the said change to the sole arbitrator mentioned below for his decision.
Only the work elements changed and calculations affected by the change will be subject to review by the sole arbitrator. If no request is made in writing by the union to
43
submit such change to the sole arbitrator within fortyfive (45) days after the date it was put into effect, the change shall be deemed to be accepted.
9.03
If a change contemplated by the company concerning a piece-work occupation has to do with a revision of a measuredwork element or the addition of a measured work element or the complete elimination of a measured work element because of the installation of different machinery or if an hourly or piecework element because of the installation of different machinery or if a non-measured hourly occupation is to be placed by the company on measured piece-work or if a new occupation is introduced, the company must, at least two (2) working weeks prior to the application of such change, advise the union in writing of the nature of the change. On the date that such change takes place it will be considered as under a trial period, the conditions of which are defined in paragraph 9.06 and the following paragraphs.
9.04
All changes made by the company concerning piece-work occupations other than those referred to in paragraphs 9.02 and 9.03
44
are to be settled, if grievances arise, by the following procedure:
Step one:
A review of the grievance is to be made by an industrial engineering representative of the company and a representative of the union.
Such review will include an inspection of the job specification and test data which form the basis for the change. The representative of the union may also by arrangement with the industrial engineering representative of the company visit the premises where the grievance arose. Notice of the nature of such change will be given to the union in writing.
If no grievance is made as a result of any changes referred to in this paragraph within twenty (20) working days after the change is to be put into effect, the change shall be deemed to be accepted.
Step two:
If the review provided in step one above does not provide an immediate solution to the grievance, joint tests will be made by an industrial engineering representative of the company and a representative of the union to settle the grievance on the change concerned.
45
Any joint tests shall be of the same nature and to the same extent as the tests upon which the change was originally based. The extent of the joint test called for may be varied by the parties by mutual agreement.
If the results of the joint tests made by the company and the union are such as not to affect the standard time value by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the said joint tests affect the standard time value by greater than plus or minus 4%, the standard time value will be so revised and put into effect.
If the results of the said joint tests call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change.
If the parties, after having completed the joint tests in this Step two, and after having studied their findings cannot agree on the results of the said joint tests, the union may refer the said change to the sole arbitrator mentioned below.
Step three:
The sole arbitrator shall review the change made by the company and shall make tests of the same nature and to the same extent as
46
the tests upon which the change was originally based.
If the results of the tests made by the sole arbitrator are such as not to affect the standard time value by plus or minus 4% or less, no change is to be made in the standard time value.
If the results of the test made by the sole arbitrator affect the standard time value by greater than plus or minus 4%, the standard time value will be so revised and put into effect.
If the results of the tests made by the sole arbitrator call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the change.
It is recognized that due to their nature, changes referred to in this paragraph 9.04, may be frequent and continuing revisions of such changes to reflect modifications in conditions may be called for at any time.
9.05
a) If no change is introduced by the company but if in the opinion of the union a change has occurred of the type covered in paragraph 9.04, in case of an unsettled complaint, a grievance may be submitted for settlement, including arbitration if necessary, in accordance with the terms of paragraph 9.04.
47
b) If no change is introduced by the company of the type covered in paragraphs 9.02 and 9.03 but if in the opinion of the union a time of one or several elements of a standard time value requires modification, the following procedure will apply.
1.	When one or more element times of a standard time value which have not been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator have been in effect and a period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of the last acceptance by the union, it may request a revision in the said standard time value. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been arbitrated this will not preclude the balance of the element times of the said standard time value not arbitrated, from the application of this paragraph. If one or more element times of a standard time value have been previously submitted to the sole arbitrator, but if in the opinion of the union a change has occurred which had not been covered by the decision of the sole arbitrator (or submitted as a change by the company) and which in their opinion affects the standard time value such contention may be submitted by the union to the sole arbitrator for his decision. In such a case the burden of proof falls on the union.
48
2.	Within forty-five (45) days from the written request of the union for a revision of element time values, both parties will meet to at tempt to finally settle the request. Failing a mutually satisfactory settlement, the request for revision by the union may be referred to arbitration according to the dispositions of paragraph 9.11. When such a request is made for arbitration, then all the element times for a standard time value except such element times as have been previously arbitrated shall be referred to the sole arbitrator for decision.
If within the said delay of forty-five (45) days, the union does not submit its request for revision to arbitration, the said request for revision will be deemed to have been abandoned.
3.	Following a request for arbitration made by the union, according to paragraph 1 if the arbitrator finds a difference from the standard time value in effect of 4% or more, then and only then shall the arbitrator decide that a change in the standard time value be put into effect in accordance with his observations. f the results of the review made by the arbitrator call for an increase in the standard time value by greater than 4%, retroactivity is to be paid back to the date of the union’s request for revision.
49
4.	For all requests for revisions which are raised during the first three (3) months following the signature of the collective labour agreement, the retroactivity, if any, will be limited to a four (4) week period following the date the request for revisions was submitted.
9.06
Following the date that the changes referred to in paragraph 9.03 above take place, a trial period of twenty (20) working days will follow.
9.07
During the trial period of twenty (20) working days, the employees concerned will work under the new conditions and be paid according to the new rate and during the said twenty (20) working days, their average hourly earnings will not be lower than their straight time average hourly earnings during the last four (4) weeks while the employees were working on piece-work during the previous six (6) months. In no case shall this guarantee of average hourly earnings extend beyond the said twenty (20) working days.
9.08
At any time during the trial period the company and the union will meet to review the results obtained during the trial period and will try to agree on the change.
50
9.09
Prior to the end of the sixth (6th) week following the completion of the trial period, if there is no agreement on the change, the union must notify the company and the sole arbitrator (referred to in paragraph 9.11 here after) thereof in writing by registered mail and the change will be referred to the sole arbitrator for his decision. The parties may refer the change to the sole arbitrator prior to the completion of the trial period by mutual consent.
If such a notice is not sent during the said trial period or prior to the end of the sixth (6th) week following the completion of the trial period by the union and if no notice is sent by the company within the same period of its intention to abandon the proposed change, the said change will be considered as final and accepted by both parties.
9.10
In cases where the change is submitted to the sole arbitrator, the sole arbitrator must render his decision within eight (8) additional working weeks from the date a change was submitted to him. In any event the change will remain in force until the final decision of the sole arbitrator has been rendered.
9.11
The sole arbitrator for the purpose of this article and the duration of this agreement will
51
be an industrial engineer to be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties.
9.12
The sole arbitrator must before starting each arbitration make a sworn declaration stating that he has no pecuniary interest in the question, that he is not personally associated with or interested in a firm or company that manufactures textiles and that he is not by reason of his business affairs or any other circumstances influenced or prejudiced in favour of either employees or employers.
9.13
Each of the parties to this agreement will bear its own expenses of arbitration. The fees and expenses of the sole arbitrator will be paid for on the basis of one-half by the company and one-half by the union.
9.14
a)	All grievances arising out of articles 9 and 10 shall be submitted to the sole arbitrator for decision. In any case, the decision of the sole arbitrator must be within the frame-work of the company’s work measurement plan and wage payment methods and further the sole arbitrator shall not have the power to amend, alter or modify the terms of this agreement.
52
b)	For the purposes of articles 9 and 10 of the collective labour agreement, one of the following firms will act as arbitrator as called upon:
Woods Gordon & Co.
Charron, Bourgetel et Ass. Enrg.
Leatham Simpson.
9.15
The decision of the sole arbitrator will be final and binding on the union and the company and all employees or groups concerned. In so far as wages are concerned the decision will be retroactive to the commencement of the trial period should the sole arbitrator so decide and the amount of retroactive adjustments, if any, shall be determined by the said sole arbitrator.
9.16
If at any time during the trial period the company decides to abandon the proposed change, an adjustment of wages must be made in such a manner as to ensure, that for the time during which the trial period has been in force, average hourly earnings for each employee immediately concerned are equivalent to 100% of the average hourly earnings of that employee during the last four (4) weeks while the employee was working on piece-work during the previous six (6) months.
53
9.17
When the company advises the union of a change in task under paragraph 9.03, it will give to the union all pertinent information and all necessary explanations concerning such change or new occupation.
9.18
Upon request, the company will, at the commencement of a trial period, make available to a designated representative of the union for examination the job specification data referring to the establishment of the task which has been placed on such trial period. It is understood and agreed that such job specification data is a confidential company document and is to be returned to the company within a reasonable delay and is not to be retained beyond the conclusion of such trial period.
9.19
Upon request, the company will, at the commencement of a trial period, supply in writing to the union the average hourly earnings of each employee placed under such trial period during the last four (4) weeks while the employee was working on piece-work during the previous six (6) months. The union will also be provided in writing, if they so request, with the average hourly weekly earnings of said employees during such trial period.
54
9.20
Grievances arising from changes in measured or unmeasured hourly-paid occu pations or a regular assigned increase in the scheduled volume of work of such an hourly-paid occupation may also be submitted to the sole arbitrator for decision within forty-five (45) days following the occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the grievance or knowledge of same, as the case may be. In this case, however, the sole arbitrator shall determine whether or not the changed occupation or a regularly assigned increase in the scheduled volume of work of such an hourly-paid occupation requires more than a normal daily work performance. The sole arbitrator shall decide the content of a normal daily work performance and the company will modify the content of the occupation accordingly. A normal daily work performance may be defined as the average amount of work a qualified employee working at normal pace (as defined in article 10) under standard conditions, can produce over a day.
9.21
It is understood that all changes which affect the standard time value will be taken into account in the standard time value for the occupation.
55
9.22
Changes in piece-work rates shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of this article where applicable.
ARTICLE 10
WAGE PAYMENT METHODS
10.01	Measured direct occupations:
a)	Measured direct occupations are to be paid on the basis of piece-work rates, expressed in dollars (or cents) per production or machine unit, derived from work measurement and based on “objective hourly rates” appearing on the rate lists for piece-work occupations annexed to this agreement, except the employees under probationary period, (paragraph 8.02 of the collective agreement).
b)	Measurement is based on the execution of each element of work at a reference pace under usual and normal operation conditions. The reference pace is defined as “walking three miles per hour over smooth level ground without load”.
An employee on measured work with a one-hundred percent (100%) work assignment, including allowances for rest and personal needs (varying from 10% to 25% of
56
work time), normally exceeds the reference
pace described above by 25%.
c)	The piece-work rates are calculated so that a one-hundred percent (100%) work assignment will give an employee the opportunity to earn the objective rate.
d)	For any delay or time loss beyond his control and for which he is not responsible, the frequency and length of which are not foreseeable (and which have not been taken into account in the machine efficiency calculations), the measured direct employee is paid the objective rate.
He reports these delays and time losses without delay and has them signed and approved by his department foreman or his assistant. Such are, for example, delays resulting from waiting for work, breakdown and maintenance of machinery, power failure, etc...
e)	The total piece-work earnings will be calculated weekly for each employee on a measured direct occupation, and he is guaranteed that his average hourly earnings for the week will not be lower than ninety percent (90%) of the objective rate for his occupation.
Each employee will be informed of his guaranteed rate.
57
Each week, a sheet showing the following information for the preceding week will be posted in the department:
-	Occupation and employee's names
-	Objective rate
-	Hours worked
-	Average hourly piece-work earnings
-	Total earnings (excluding shift and overtime premiums)
-	Percent pay performance (in relation to objective rate)
-	Payments for delays (included in the total earnings amounts)
f)	Some occupations previously paid as measured direct occupations may be reclassified by the company as measured indirect occupations, and paid according to provisions in paragraph 10.02.
Also, some occupations previously paid as measured indirect or as unmeasured occupations may be reclassified by the company as measured direct occupations, and paid according to 10.01 (a) above.
In either case, the company will submit to the union the data pertinent to such changes at least two weeks prior to the change, and will meet with the union representatives on request to explain the change.
58
10.02	Measured indirect occupations:
a)	Measured indirect occupations are to be paid hourly rates appearing on the rate lists for measured hourly-paid occupations annexed to this agreement, except the employees under probationary period (paragraph
8.02	of the collective agreement), and except otherwise provided in paragraph 10.03 below.
The occupations mentioned in paragraph
10.01	(f) above, reclassified from measured direct to measured indirect, are also to be paid on this same basis.
Some previously unmeasured occupations, which may be judged measurable by the company, are also to be paid on this same basis when, they have been measured and accordingly re-assigned.
b)	The employees on measured indirect occupations are to be given around one-hundred percent (100%) work assignments as described in preceding paragraph 10.01 (b).
10.03	Work assignment:
a)	Experienced employees on measured occupations, direct or indirect, shall be given around one-hundred percent (100%) work assignments, as defined in the preceding paragraph 10.01 (b).
It is understood that, in the case of employees on measured direct occupations and
59
piece-work payment, there is no obligation on the company to offer such a work assignment, when the assignment is not available or when the employee is not capable or willing of handling such an assignment.
b)	An individual employee with a physical handicap may request a work assignment lower than one-hundred percent (100%) on a measured occupation. The company will consider each such request individually.
If the request is reasonable and the employee is on a measured direct occupation, he will be given a work assignment between 90% and 100%, as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation if practical, and he will be paid his piece-work earnings. If the employee is on a measured indirect occupation and his request is reasonable, he will be given a work assignment between 80% and 100% as near as possible to his request and on his regular occupation and if practical, and he will be paid according to his assignment.
At certain processes, due to the number or productive units, isolation of equipment, etc..., it may be impossible or impractical to implement a reduced work assignment for an employee on such a process without reducing the volume of production to the next process. Also an employee may not be capable of
60
handling a work assignment between 90% and 100% on a measured direct occupation. In such cases, an occupational transfer for the employee will be considered in line with article 8.10 (Permanenttransfers).
Such requests for a reduction in work assignments are limited to one per year for each employee and to one per occupation per month.
c)	In the case of an employee on a measured occupation, direct or indirect, who in the opinion of the company, is not capable or willing of handling a 100% work assignment, the same conditions as in paragraph 10.03 (b) above for a reduced assignment or transfer will apply. However, before proceeding in this manner, the company will advise the union giving the reasons for the contemplated change.
d)	When an employee on a measured direct occupation, who in the opinion of the company is continually incapable of producing at the present guarantee rate of 90%, his guarantee rate will then become 80% of the objective rate of his occupation.
However, before proceeding in this manner, the company will advise the union giving the reasons for such change.
61
Such case will be individually reviewed every six (6) months following the date of change.
10.04	Measured time values:
The measured time value is expressed in minutes and is the time required to perform an operation at a pace and with allowances for rest and personal needs as defined in paragraph 10.01 (b) under standard conditions.
The measured time values will not be changed except if a change in the conditions result in an increase or a decrease in the work content, or if in the opinion of both parties an error has been made that would require an adjustment.
Checks are made to make sure that conditions are maintained in conformity with those used to calculate a measured time value.
10.05	Information:
A copy of the job specification in force will be made available in the department. If the company makes a change concerning an occupation, the job specification will be also made available in the department.
The method of calculation of wage payment may be checked by the employee personally or by his representative.
62
