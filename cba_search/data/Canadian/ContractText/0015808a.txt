RIGHT TO REFUSE PROCEDURE
DEFINITION
A worker may refuse to perform work at a workplace where he has reasonable grounds to believe and does believe that the particular work is dangerous to his safety or health, or the safety and health of another worker or any other person.
STEP 1
An employee should contact his immediate supervisor immediately and explain the reasons why he/she believes that the task is dangerous. A visual investigation should take place, at that point, between the immediate supervisor and the employee. If the situation has been resolved between the immediate supervisor and the employee by implementing a temporary solution, the matter will be recorded and the details of the temporary resolution documented.
STEP 2
If satisfactory conclusion does not occur at Step 1, the incident will be recorded as a formal "right to refuse" and the appropriate documentation will be signed by the employee and the immediate supervisor, and the employee should be reassigned to another job, preferably in the immediate area, but must be available pending any further investigation.
STEP 3
A supervisor shall not assign or require any other worker to perform the particular work unless that worker has been informed by the first worker, or a Safety and Health Officer, of the worker's refusal to perform the work and the reasons thereof.
2
STEP 4
If the situation cannot be resolved between the immediate supervisor and the employee, it is now referred to senior supervision, the appropriate Union Health and Safety representative and the Safety Department. It is understood that if the employee so desires, a Union steward will be made available.
STEP 5
If the situation cannot be resolved, the situation may be referred to a Safety and Health Officer by any of the participating parties.

(a)	Length of continuous service.
(5^	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
16
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern. Length of continuous service will be based on Company service rather than department service.
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be employed as probationary employees for a period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). Probationary employees shall have recourse to the grievance procedure in all matters and during the probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed to be for just cause.

Within twenty-one (21)	calendar days of the
expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the appropriate local Union. With respect to vacancies so filled, the seniority date of the successful applicant shall be noted.

19
An employee wishing such transfer shall file a written "Request for Transfer" application form with the Employment Office at Flin Flon or the General Office at Snow Lake. An employee's application shall lapse one (1) year after the date of filing but may be renewed from year to year at his request. However, in no event may an employee have more than three (3) such applications on file at any one time. The Company shall maintain a file of such "Request for Transfer" application forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, the Personnel Superintendent or designated representative shall meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
If there are no "Requests for Transfer" on file from employees deemed acceptable for transfer to the Flin Flon Mill, Warehouse, Surface and Transportation Department or the Flin Flon Mine Department, and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before filling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.
20
7.08	If an employee is transferred from one section to another within the same department there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former section and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.

Article 19
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
19,01	(i) The Company agrees that the Unions have an
understandable concern over "contracting out" by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the employees.
The Company will continue to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Unions agree that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1. The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of operations and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
/u
2. The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the Presidents or their designate of the affected Unions prior to awarding a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside Company property. The Company will also consult with the appropriate Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the affected Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the
	71
	parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representativesand will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
5.	It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, the Unions and Senior Management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
6.	The Company agrees that no employee shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
19.02 The Company will continue its present practice of supplying free transportation to and from a Company designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.09.	
When an employee is required by the Company to travel in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way to or from a Company designated point and the outlying job site,	
/i
outside the time of his regularly scheduled shift, a travelling allowance will be paid. Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the 30 minute portion will be paid. Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
19.03	Without restricting Management Rights as set out in Article 3 of this Agreement, all working conditions now established by practice and negotiation and now in effect shall remain in force insofar as they are consistent with this Agreement.

(b)	Employees will be advised of any discipline as soon as possible following the incident giving rise to the discipline.
(c)	When an employee is formally disciplined while at work, a steward will attend. Every reasonable effort will be made to have the attending steward be from his own jurisdiction.

The employee and his Union will be made aware of any information which is being considered for use in the discipline and informed of any information which is being placed in the employee file that could be used for discipline; and
(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, there will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts. It i s understood that any discipline stemming from the investigation will be solely determined by management. Every reasonable effort will be made to have this investigation completed within seven (7) calendar
/b
days. Suspensions will be administered at the end of an employee's shift whenever appropriate and possible, it being understood there are circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the workplace immediately following the incident. Except in those circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the property immediately, when a suspension is imposed the suspension will not be served, if the employee decides to file a grievance on the matter, until Step 2 of the grievance procedure has been completed.
(e)	The employee and the steward in attendance will receive a written copy of the suspension slip or discharge letter. Also, the appropriate Union shall be advised promptly in writing by the Company of the reason or reasons for such suspension or discharge.
23.02	There may be situations outside of the formal discipline procedures in which an employee may feel that he would be more comfortable with a Union Steward present when he is called into a meeting with management. Such request for a Union Steward will not be unreasonably denied. If either party feels the intent of this clause is not being followed, the parties will meet to resolve the matter.
23.03	If any employee feels that he has been unjustly disciplined, he shall have the right of appeal through the grievance procedure at Step 2. Such appeal must be filed in writing by the Union with the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of notification of discipline and, unless so filed, the right of appeal shall be lost.
77
23.04	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay period next preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
23.05	All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and-may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.

78
write a note to the file explaining his disagreement. Such note will become part of the file.

27.05	I f it does not appear to either the affected Union(s) or the Company that a revised collective agreement will be concluded by the expiry date, then either may apply, pursuant to the relevant labour legislation, for the appointment of a Conciliation Officer to assist the parties in concluding a collective agreement. Meetings with the Conciliation Officer will begin no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the stated expiry date of the Collective Agreement, and will continue as necessary until the earlier of the conclusion of a new collective agreement, or the stated expiry date of this Agreement, whichever occurs first.
27.06	The parties agree that neither party will apply for the appointment of a Conciliation Commissioner or a Conciliation Board pursuant to any legislative provision that may be in effect.
27.07	Should the parties fail to conclude a revised collective agreement prior to the stated expiry date of this Agreement, and provided that notice to negotiate has been given pursuant to Article 28.01 of the Collective Agreement, then, for the sole purpose of governing the relationship between the parties, the terms of this Agreement shall continue in effect until a new collective
a7
agreement has been concluded, and the following shall apply:
(a)	The resolution cf the provisions of this Agreement shall be immediately referred to arbitration, with the arbitration being scheduled, where possible, in accordance with the time lines referred to in clause .04;
(b)	All negotiation shall be suspended as at midnight of the stated expiry date of this Agreement, and the parties shall not be obligated to meet to negotiate beyond that date. This provision is intended to facilitate the conclusion of a jointly negotiated collective agreement prior to the expiry date, and the failure of either party to negotiate following the stated expiry date will not be taken to constitute a violation of any provision of the applicable labour legislation;
(c)	One arbitration board shall be appointed to hear all collective bargaining referrals that arise pursuant to any of the Collective Agreements that expire within twelve (12) months of each other. The arbitration board shall be established in the following manner:
(i) At any time after the commencement cf negotiations, the Company or the Unions which are party to a 2012 Amending Agreement shall name a single person who will act as their nominee to the arbitration board. The party receiving such notice shall likewise name its nominee within seven (7) days cf receipt of notice of the appointment of the other party's nominee.
88
(ii) The Chairperson of the arbitration board shall be chosen in rotation from the panel of individuals set forth below:
Hugh Jamieson Martin Freedman Martin Teplitsky
I n the event that any of the aforenoted individuals become permanently incapacitated or otherwise unable to act, then the parties wiN meet to select a replacement for such individual.
Where the parties are unable to agree on such a replacement, then they may request that the arbitration board that has been convened pursuant to this Article name a replacement, and the arbitration board may do so notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 22 of this Article.
27.08	The Company and the aforenoted Unions shall each designate a contact person and those two individuals shall serve to facilitate the fixing of hearing dates and the resolution of all procedural matters relating to the arbitration hearing(s).
27.09	Unlessthe parties otherwise agree, the referral from each of the collective bargaining tables shall be treated as a separate referral. The parties may, however, either by agreement or direction of the arbitration board, stipulate that certain evidence (as for example, the Company's main economic submission) be heard only once and considered
89
as though it had been heard in each of the collective bargaining table referrals that are being considered by the arbitration board. For the purpose of greater certainty, the term "collective bargaining table" shall be defined as those collective bargaining tables that are established pursuant to clause .01 of this Article.
27.10	The arbitration board shall convene a hearing (the 'initial hearing"), either in person or by conference call, to determine the following:
(a)	the order in which the arbitrations will proceed;
(b)	the terms and conditions of the proposed Collective Agreements which are in dispute between the parties;
(c)	the date for submission of written briefs; and
(d)	the date(s) for the arbitration hearings.
In determining the order in which the hearings are to proceed, the arbitration board will have regard to factors such as the date on which negotiations commenced, the date on which an application for conciliation was made, the number of employees representedat each particular bargaining table, and any other relevant matters.
27.11	In preparation for the initial hearing, each party shall provide, in writing, to the other and to each member of the arbitration board, no less than three (3) working days prior to the initial hearing, a document setting forth the following:
	90 (a) the terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreements that have been agreed;
	(b) the terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreements that remain outstanding;
27.12	The Chairperson is to direct the nominee(s) at the initial hearing that, with the exception of other members of the arbitration board, they are to have no communication with anyone with regard to any aspect of the process or the hearing from that point onward until the arbitration board has issued all award(s) for any referral that has or may be made to the arbitration board with respect to Collective Agreements covering employees in the Flin Flon mineral area.
27.13	On the date fixed by the arbitration board at the initial hearing, each patty shall submit to each member of the arbitration board, in writing a copy of:
	(a) its position on all terms and conditions of the proposed collective agreement which are in dispute between the parties;
	(b) its brief in support of its submission; and
	(c) a list of all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties as at that date.
27.14	The arbitration board shall on the date fixed by the arbitration board at the initial hearing, hold a hearing in order to provide each party or its representatives with the opportunity to submit evidence and arguments in support of their position.
91
The arbitration board may establish its own procedures for the conduct of the hearing, and may reschedule matters to dates other than those established at the initial hearing.
27.15	Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration board shall render its decision no later than fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the hearing.
The failure of the arbitration board to render its decision within the time specified under the previous paragraph does not affect the jurisdiction of the arbitration board to continue and complete the issuance of its award.
27.16	I n arriving at its decision, the arbitration board may take into account:
1(a)	the terms and conditions of the existing or any
previous Collective Agreement between the parties;
(b) wage settlements in general in the geographic area, in the industry and with the Company or a related company;
(c)	the economic circumstances of the Company;
(d)	changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index for the City of Winnipeg as published from time to time by Statistics Canada;
(e)	the desirability of maintaining comparable settlements between the Company and its various bargaining units;
92
(9 such other matters as in the discretion of the arbitration board will assist it in arriving at a fair and reasonable decision.
In arriving at its decision, the arbitration board shall have regard to all of the foregoing factors, giving due weight to those that it considers to be relevant for the resolution of the specific dispute. Except in cases of "survival", where there is threat of closure of the operation or a significant portion of the operation, the total wage and benefit package as detailed in the Collective Bargaining Agreement(s) effective December 31, 1999 shall not be reduced without the consent of the Union(s).
27.17	Neither party will rely on the funding status of the pension plan in opposition to or in support of any proposal for increased pension benefits. The foregoing sentence does not otherwise preclude or restrict the arbitrator from considering the Company's pension plan funding obligations in addressing the stipulated criteria.
27.18	Except where otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitration board shall impose a collective agreement that expires three (3) years after the stated expiry date set forth in the Collective Agreement that was being arbitrated. The newly imposed collective agreement is to be retroactive to the stated expiry date of the Collective Agreement that was being arbitrated except that the effective date of any particular change need not coincide with the effective date of the imposed collective agreement.
27.19	The decision of the arbitration board is final and binding and the decision is not open to appeal or review in any
93
court of law except on a question involving the jurisdiction of the arbitration board.
27.20	The parties shall bear the fees and expenses of their own nominee and shall equally bear the fees and expenses of the Chairperson.
27.21	A mutually agreed alternative process for dispute resolution may be substituted for the three-person panel process set out above. Possible alternatives include but are not restricted to mediation - arbitration, single person arbitration and final offer selection.
27.22	All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be interpreted as being subject to the provisions of this Article. This Article, the revised Article "No Strikes No Lockouts", and any other provisions that the patties in a separate Letter of Understanding have identified as being non-arbitrable, shall remain unchanged for the duration of Project 2012 and the arbitration board shall not have any jurisdiction to amend or delete those provisions.
27.23	Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, this Article shall expire and be of no force and effect as of July 1, 2012. This Article shall also cease to be of any force and effect if Project 2012 does not proceed or is cancelled as those terms are defined in the 2012 AmendingAgreement that was executed between the Company and those Unions who are signatory to that Agreement.
See Letter of Understanding #41 - Project 2012

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #8
To the Union:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number- of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
I n the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
If an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee's request).
b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked "regular" vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
c)	Employee would take a "special" vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6)	In t he determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
Itwas the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue
that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable
manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #18 To the Union:
RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
14 s
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company's Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate.
b)	Trades - I n order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
c)	Operators- In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation cf the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBMS Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one (1) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (1) representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
144
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills required to perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It i s further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct
result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1, 1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid
off unless such layoffs are the result of the following:
a)	Layoffs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Layoffs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	Layoffs of any employee hired after the effective date of the collective agreement then in force.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	Layoffs due to closure, sale or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It is understood that any layoff resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterized as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

RE: 17-HOUR REPORTING RULE
This will confirm our discussions during 1990 bargaining that the intent of the "17-hour reporting rule" is to protect the Company from having to pay two employees to do one job.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #24 To the Union:
RE: 12-HOUR SHIFTS
The parties agree that no additional wage and benefit costs will be incurred with the adoption of a twelve (12) hour shift schedule and, to this end, the following clauses in the Collective Bargaining Agreement have been revised. This summary is for information purposes only and doe3 not prohibit the establishment of other provisions as may be deemed necessary by individual departments when implementing extended hours.
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be considered to have accumulated 1.5 straight time working shifts for any twelve (12) hour shifts worked for purposes of completing the normal probationary period of four hundred eighty (480) working hours (including overtime hours worked).
9.02	Standard rates of pay for hourly employees working extended hours shall be calculated on the basis of working 320 hours in an eight (8) week period (average forty (40) hours per week).
Standby allowance will be paid to hourly employees working extended hours if the department requires such an arrangement. The allowance payable will be one-half (1/2) hour's pay at straight time at the employee's applicable hourly rate.
For areas which work four on/four off with 12-hour shifts and do not use a swingman, the basis for their scheduled overtime pay will be as follows:
(j)	2.3 hours at 1/2 regular rate will be paid for each
48-hour working set of shifts which are worked as scheduled.
(ii)	Employees who miss a shift(s) due to sickness or AWOL during a 48-hour set of scheduled shifts will not receive the payment outlined in (i) for that 48-hour set.
(iii)	For the purpose of determining the payment in (i), shifts of paid leave such as vacation and bereavement leave will be considered as shifts worked.
(iv)	Payment under (i) will be prorated for shifts missed in the 48-hour set for shifts of unpaid leave (i.e. if there is one shift of unpaid leave in the 48-hour working set, the payment would be 36 - 48 x 2.3 hours x 1/2 regular rate).
9.04 For employees working 12-hour shifts, two (2) working days shall be considered as sufficient notice for change of rest days. Also, shifts paid at overtime rates because of insufficient notice of either change of shift or rest days shall be considered as straight time hours worked for the purposes of calculating subsequent overtime entitlement based on the 8-week averaging period.
11.03 A second-shift differential shall be paid to hourly employees working such extended hours on the basis of 2/3 the combined afternoon and night/graveyard shift differential payable to employees on standard eight (8) hour shifts.
13.06
14.01
14.02
15.02
15.08
Sick Benefit waiting periods, daily payments, and the duration of daily payments for employees working twelve (12) hour shift rotations will be converted to an hourly equivalent and subsequently multiplied by an employee's normal hours.
Statutory holiday pay for employees on a compressed work week who are not required to work on a statutory holiday shall consist of eight (8) hours pay at straight time, provided they comply with the regulations of Article 14.
Statutory holiday pay for employees on a compressed work week, other than those referred to in Article 14.04, who are required to work on the eleven (11) General Holidays listed in 14.01 shall consist of holiday pay in an amount equal to his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours and one and one-half (1 1/2) times his regular rate of pay for all hours worked by him on that General Holiday.
(d) Regular vacation bonus for employees on a compressed work week shall be adjusted to 1.5 times the current regular vacation bonus for each compressed day of regular vacation granted and taken under Article 15.08.
Regular vacation entitlement for employees on a compressed work week shall be converted as outlined below. It is understood that anything less than one full compressed vacation day will be taken as a part shift, or paid out at the end of the year.

In t his situation, travelling time will be adjusted to one (1) day and four (4) hours if the employee attends the funeral outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence, the employee shall be paid his regular rate of pay for twelve (12) hours.
It is agreed that the Company or the Unions may terminate a twelve (12) hour shift schedule in any particular department and/or work area and revert to eight (8) hour shifts by giving the other party fourteen (14) days' notice.

RE: SPECIAL ALLOWANCE - JOB AMALGAMATION
During 1987 bargaining the Company and the Union agreed that a special allowanceof onejob class would be paid if, asa result ofjob amalgamation, the CWS evaluation of the amalgamated job does not result in a minimum one job class increase above the highest classified job being amalgamated and the following criteria are met:
(i)	two or more job descriptions are combined into one or more job descriptions and one or more job descriptions are terminated, and
(ii)	the primary function(s) of the terminated job(s) become part of the primary function(s) of the remaining job(s), and
(iii)	as the result of the amalgamation less employees are required to do the work.
It is understood that if technological change were to eliminate most of a job's duties and the remaining duties were added to another occupation, or a job were terminated and its duties spread amongst a large number of jobs or incumbents, the special allowance would not apply.
The special allowance will not form part of the CWS evaluation or classification but will remain a separate allowance.

To the Union:
RE: MINE DEPARTMENT TRAINING
Further to the 1993 negotiations, the following practices were
agreed to regarding Mine Department training:
1)	Vacancies for development miners will be bulletined within the department prior to hiring. If no qualified development miners apply, the Company will commit to training up to four (4) development miners at any one time (two (2) for Callinan and two (2) for Trout Lake). I n t he event a situation arises which will cause the Company to increase its need for new development miners beyond the four (4) outlined, the Union will be consulted as far in advance as possible to discuss alternatives to hiring. One potential alternative to hiring would be to recall qualified development miners from other departments or from the recall list out of seniority.
2)	If there is a requirement to bring additional employees into the mines to fill temporary vacancies created as a result of the training program, such employees will be required to return to their original department or return to layoff once the training has been completed.
3)	After completion of the training, if no permanent vacancy exists, the person trained will return to his former job.
4)	During the training period and until the person trained is placed in a permanent development miner position, he shall be paid at the rate of his former job.
158
5)	Anyone who receives training as a development miner as outlined above will be unable to bulletin to any other position in the mine for a two (2) year period after completion of the training.
6) Mine Department employees who have completed development miner training will be required to fill future vacancies for development miner positions, either temporary or permanent, regardless of whether such vacancies are at Trout or Callinan.
7)	Employees who receive training under this program must be prepared to qualify for all development miner jobs including drift mining and conventional raise mining.
8)	The patties agree to develop selection criteria for development miner trainees to assist the selection process.

RE: STAFF TO HOURLY - MINE DEPARTMENT
The parties agree that staff employees returning to the bargaining unit in the Mine Department will return to an entry level position. Such employees will remain at entry level for at least thirty (30) days and be considered the junior employee for temporary assignment while at entry level. The terms of Article 8.08 (b) would apply to such temporary assignment. The returning staff employee will remain at entry level until he is the successful applicant for a bulletin.
It is not the Company's intent to show favouritism to a returning staff employee. That being the case, any disputes arising regarding job assignment or work location involving a returned staff employee will be considered a proper subject for the Grievance Procedure. The employee and his immediate supervisor are encouraged to settle any disputes prior to proceeding to Step I of the Grievance Procedure.

The letter will be passed-out at the time of new employee documentation. It is understood that the Union will provide the Company with a suitable quantity of letters for distribution.

Industrial Relations Manager
Greetings:
As President of the United Steelworkers, Local Union 7106, I wish to welcome you to Flin Flon.
The Steelworkers are involved in many and varied activities. Information can be obtained by visiting us at our office, 68 Church Street, Flin Flon.
Membership in our Union is voluntary and although you will be paying Union dues (under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement), you may become a member only upon signing an application for membership. Attached to this letter you will find an application form for membership. I urge you to fill it out and return it to the Personnel office or bring it to the Steelworkers' office at the
161
Labour Temple. The application forms can also be obtained at the office.
I would like to extend a hearty welcome to you to visit us so that we can get to know each other.
Good luck in our community.
Please find below the United Steelworkers Anti-Harassment Policy.
UNITED STEELWORKERS ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Steelworker members are entitled to a harassment free environment at all union activities, events and meetings.
There are two principles fundamental to the labour movement:	human rights and solidarity. Harassment
strikes at the heart of both.
Steelworkers will not tolerate nor condone behaviour that is likely to undermine the dignity or self-esteem of an individual, or which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. As Steelworkers we must speak out against harassment and stand together to protect human rights.
Harassment is not a joke. 11 is an expression of perceived power by the harasser over another person, usually for reasons over which the victim has little or no control. Prohibited grounds under Human Rights Codes across Canada can include sex, race, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, political or religious beliefs, and place of national origin.
1
Harassment can be defined as any action (verbal, psychological or physical) on a single or repeated basis which humiliates, insults or degrades and is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome by the victim of the harassment.
Harassment can include but is not limited to:	unwanted
comments, slurs, racist or sexist jokes, pictures or posters, bullying or intimidation, graffiti, physical contact of any kind, remarks about a person's appearance or personal life, unwelcome sexual advances or demands, suggestive looks or gestures.
Steelworkers take harassment complaints seriously. Complaints of harassment at Steelworkers activities will be investigated by one of our anti-harassment complaints counsellors and reported to the Canadian National Director for any necessary follow-up. A substantial complaint will result in action by the Union, which could include the removal of the harasser from the event. A letter outlining the reasons for the removal will be sent to the local union.
”We can't make people like each other. But we can, through concrete action, promote tolerance and mutual respect in our Union."
Fraternally,
Tom Davie
President January 1, 2006

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #37
RE: COMMITMENT TO COST AND MANPOWER REDUCTIONS
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties at
1996	bargaining and their commitments with regard to cost and manpower reductions. The parties recognize the need for cost and manpower reductions in 1997 and beyond to enhance our chances of survival.
It is understood that there is a need to reduce operating costs in
1997	by $30 million and, as part of this effort, the Company has decided that the hourly Steelworker and Trades Association memberships will be reduced by 48. These reductions will be measured againstthe January 1, 1997 budgeted manpower number of 982 which does not include hourly employees who may need to be laid off in 1997 as a result of the Westarm Mine closure (37 employees as of February 7, 1997).
It is understood that 48 Steelworker and Trades Association positions will be reduced by voluntary means. To this end, incentive programs have been put in place. It is understood that it may have the effect of reducing the Steelworker and Trades Association memberships by more than the target of 48.
In association with the Company's commitment to reduce manpower by 48 by voluntary means in 1997, the Unions underscore their commitment to the terms of Letter #18 by the following:
1.	Each Union President will communicate in writing to their members the need and their support for the flexible use of employees' skills.
172
2.	The parties will work together to educate the employees of the necessity for flexibility to reduce costs and improve productivity while adhering to safe working practices and standards.
3.	To not allow their demonstrated commitment to waiver in the face of disputes over other issues.

RE: PROJECT 2012
1.	Project 2012 provides an opportunity for enhanced employment security beyond 2004. To ensure that HBM81S employees gain the optimum benefit from this opportunity, the parties agree that involuntary layoffs are the least desirable method of reducing manpower and will therefore continue to work together in attempting to make any future manpower reductions take place voluntarily when practical.
2.	For greater clarity, the second paragraph of Article 19.02 of the Collective Agreement shall be interpreted to apply to both existing and new mines and surface plants covered under the terms of the Collective Agreement.
3.	If the Company establishes a new mine that is not covered under the terms of the Collective Agreement, it is committed to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has been historically performed at its mines that
176
are covered under the terms of the Collective Agreement. For the purpose of this commitment, the term ”new mine” shall be defined to mean a mine that feeds and is located within 150 kilometres of the metallurgical plants in Flin Flon.
4,	Unlessthe parties otherwise agree, the following provisionsof the Collective Agreement (except as otherwise noted) will remain unchanged for the duration of Project 2012, and the arbitration board shall not have any jurisdiction to amend or delete those provisions:

(ii)	Letter of Understanding #16

Note 1: The figure of $50,000.00 referred to in this Article will be considered to have been expressed in 1998 dollars, and it will be deemed to be adjusted upward at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index for the City of Winnipeg.
Note 2: Paragraph (c) on page 139 [Now page 78 of the new Collective Agreement] of the Collective Agreement will be amended to read as follows:
