AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
PERSTORP COMPONENTS (CANADA) INC. AND/OR ITS SUCCESSORS IN THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO
AND
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA ON BEHALF OF ITS LOCAL UNION NO.296
This Agreement is made and entered into this 6th day of March, 1996, by and between Perstorp Components (Canada) Inc., Kitchener, Ontario, ("The Company") and Local 296 of the United Steelworkers of America ("The Union") .
PURPOSE
It is the mutual desire of the parties to this Agreement to promote co-operation and harmony and to formulate rules and re-establish orderly procedures to govern the relationship between the Union and the Company.
The Union realizes the necessity of encouraging full productivity consistent with fair labour practices and in conformity with this Agreement, and agrees that it will co-operate with Management in discouraging any practice which imposes any unreasonable restriction on production. The Union recognizes the necessity of the efforts of Management to improve production, establish efficient methods, eliminate waste in production, conserve materials and supplies and improve the quality of workmanship and that it is desirable to strengthen goodwill between the Company, the employees, the customer, the Union and the public.
It is understood that the use of the masculine gender herein shall be construed as meaning male or female.
Therefore, both parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1
RECOGNITION AND SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
2
1:01 The Company recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agency for all hourly paid employees except shift managers, supervisors, full time department clerks, office staff and laboratory technicians.
(a) No employee shall be permitted or required to make a verbal or written agreement with the Company or its representatives which might conflict with the terms of this Agreement.
1:02 The Company agrees to meet and negotiate with the accredited representatives of the Union on matters pertaining to hours of work, rates of pay and working conditions of employees covered by this Agreement.
1:03 The Company and the Union mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination, interference, restriction, coercion, harassment, intimidation or stronger disciplinary action exercised or practised with respect to an employee by reason of age, race, creed, colour, national origin, political or religious affiliation, sex, physical or mental handicap, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been received, or any other prohibited ground of discrimination as defined in the Ontario Human Rights Code, nor as a result of an employee's membership or activity in the Union as defined in the Collective Agreement.
1:04 Both parties recognize the value of goodwill between the employees and the Company and to this end agree that neither party will make any destructive criticism of the Union or Company officials. Criticism that may be offered will be made in confidence and for the purpose of making constructive changes in existing conditions.
1:05 Employees who are excluded from the bargaining unit shall not perform work which replaces production or maintenance employees on their regular jobs, or overtime, except in the
3
event of an emergency, or for the purpose of training, taking inventory or experimental work.
The Company can assure the Union that, before non-production work is contracted out, Management will examine the possibility of having the work done by Bargaining Unit employees. Consideration will be given to Safety related concerns, the need for special equipment, the ability of internal workers to do the work required, and the effect on manpower requirements and production schedules.
Is06 The Company agrees to send copies of Employee Status forms to the Union on a timely basis, with regard to hirings, firings, leaves of absence, job postings, etc.

5
be automatically renewed for the duration of such new Agreement. Any authorization shall cease to be effective upon termination of employment or upon transfer to an occupation outside the bargaining unit.

jurisdiction to determine the terms of reinstatement with respect to penalties and/or rights and pay for lost time.
3:09 Upon mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union, a Board of Arbitration may be substituted for a single Arbitrator and all provisions of this Article will continue to apply so far as they are relevant.

12
3:12 (a)An employee who claims that he has been laid off inconsistent with his seniority rights or not recalled in accordance with his seniority rights, may protest in writing to the Director of Human Resources within five (5) normal working days of such alleged violation of seniority rights. If the employee's claim is upheld, he will be placed on the job to which his seniority entitles him and receive a pay adjustment as set out in 3:12 (c) .
(b)If such written protest is made more than five (5) normal working days after such alleged violation of seniority rights and his claim is upheld, he will be placed on the job to which his seniority entitles him, but any pay adjustment will only be made from the date on which such protest was made, as set out in 3:12 (c) .
(c)Any pay adjustment will be the difference between any earnings or remuneration the employee has received during the period for which adjustment is made and the earnings he would have received had he been properly placed.
3:13 It is agreed that individual members of the Plant Negotiating Committee will not be asked to participate alone in any meeting arranged for the purpose of arriving at a decision on any subject. This does not apply to the first step of the grievance procedure, nor to any discussion of a general or informative nature.
3:14 There shall be no lockout, strike, sit-down, slowdown, nor stoppage of work either partial or complete over any matters covered by the Agreement during its term.
In the event of any strike, slowdown, sit-down, or concerted stoppage of work, either partial or complete, the Union shall, at the request of the Company, forthwith inform the Company as to whether or not the same was authorized by the Union.
3:15 Any employee desiring to leave his work because of matters concerning this Agreement shall apply to his foreman for permission to do so, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13
3:16 Nothing contained in this Article shall prohibit an employee from presenting a personal complaint or request directly to Management.
3:17 If the Union considers that an employee other than a probationary employee has been unjustly discharged, or suspended, any grievance filed on behalf of the employee shall be submitted	directly to the Director of Human
Resources at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. This procedure also applies to Policy Grievances.
3:18 Copies of all correspondence to employees regarding
disciplinary action will be given to the Chief Steward. No correspondence to employees regarding disciplinary action shall be given to employees without a Union Steward or the Chief Steward present, provided the employee requests a Steward and one is available on that shift. An explanation to warrant discipline will also be provided.
3:19(a) Where an employee is disciplined causing a reprimand to be documented and placed on an employee's file, such document shall be retained on the employee's active disciplinary record for a period of one (1) year following the date of the reprimand.
(b)	Should no further disciplinary action become necessary during the one (1) year period, the document shall no longer be considered a part of the employee's active disciplinary record.
(c)	Any further disciplinary action taken during the one (l) year period shall cause all active reprimands to be retained as part of the employee's active disciplinary record until the expiration of the one (1) year period applicable to the most recent reprimand.
(d)	In the event that the employee is on leave of absence or layoff for a period of thirty-one (31) or more consecutive calendar days, such one (1) year period shall be extended by the number of calendar days the employee is on leave or layoff.
(e)	The Company agrees that no employee who has successfully
14
completed the probationary period will be disciplined or discharged without just cause.
(£) When an employee is suspended or dismissed without notice, he shall have the right to discuss the matter with his Steward for a reasonable period of time before being required to leave the plant premises.
(g)	In any case where an employee is to be suspended for reasons of Attendance issues only, then the suspension is not to be served until the Grievance Procedure up to and
including Step Three (3) has been exhausted.

the shift
ii)	may displace the most junior in the department on the
shift

when the number of employees working in a shift must be adjusted for that shift, it shall be done as follows:
i)	if the temporary assignment is known at the start
of the shif t or before, then the affected employees shall be assigned by job classification in reverse order of seniority; if this is not the case then:
ii)	if the temporary assignment appears after the
start of the shift, then only the affected crew of the affected line will be given the assignment; assignment by job classification in reverse order of seniority will not apply - in this case (ii) only.

8:17	(a) Whenever it is necessary to recall employees who have
been laid off, the order of recall will be generally in the reverse order of lay-offs.

8:19 An employee notified of recall must inform the Company of his intention to return, within three (3) normal working days, after notification by registered letter to the latest address.

Failure to do so will result in complete loss of seniority.
8:20 In the event that an employee is unable to return to work due to illness, injury or pregnancy and so notifies the Company within seven (7) calendar days of notification of recall, his seniority status shall be preserved during the period of illness, injury or pregnancy as governed by Section 8:04 (e) .

Dear Mr. Zarsen:
RE: INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
Current and future trends in manufacturing have required individual workers to take greater responsibility and be more directly accountable for the production process. The introduction of complex technological advances, more highly automated processes, intricate problem solving methods and sophisticated mathematical validation concepts, necessitates the development of complex new skills by the workforce through retraining.
As process improvements are undertaken, both parties recognize the importance of minimizing disruption to the workforce while acquiring the necessary skills to implement the changes. With this objective in mind, it is agreed that:
(A)	The Union will be notified (at the time of project approval) when the introduction of technology will have a significant impact on the workforce either because of reduction in jobs or where new skills will need to be acquired.
(B)	Where the success of a change to equipment, operation, or procedure is dependent upon the acquisition of additional knowledge or skill on the part of the
employee, retraining will be provided to the employees
involved.
60
(C)If it is reasonable and practical to do so, the Company will reduce the workforce through attrition when a technological change necessitates a reduction in the workforce .
Yours Sincerely,
Tony Pihowich

(i)	a Lump Sum Payment; or
(ii)	an Annuity payable for the spouse’s lifetime, as may be provided by the amount in (i), commencing either immediately or on the first day of the month on or next following the date at which the spouse attains age 65.

31
(b)	If an employee dies prior to the commencement of his Pension and he has no spouse, the employee’s beneficiary or, if none, his Estate will receive a lump sum equal to the commuted value of the Deferred Pension to which the employee was entitled or would have been entitled under Article VII, if he had terminated his employment immediately before his death.
The right to designate or to revoke a designation of a Beneficiary pursuant to this Section is to be exercised by the execution by the employee or retirant, and by delivery to the Company, of an instrument in writing, which expressly provides that the designation or revocation, whichever is the case, is made with reference to this Plan.
Upon delivery to the Company, prior to or on or after the death of the employee or retirant, of a designation or a revocation of a designation of a beneficiary made pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs of this Section, the designation or revocation, even if it is contained in a Will, or an instrument purporting to be a will, relates back to and has effect as and from the date of its execution but without prejudice to the Company, the Trustees, or any Insurance Company on account of any payment or payments made under this Plan.
(c)	If an employee dies following the commencement of his Retirement Pension and before he has received a total of sixty (60) monthly pension payments, the balance of the sixty (60) monthly payments, exclusive of any monthly Supplemental Pension, will continue to be paid to his beneficiary or, if none, to his Estate, unless the retirant was receiving a Joint & Survivor Pension or has elected a ten (10) or fifteen (15) year guarantee period, in which case the provisions of the elected option will apply.

Section 1. Maximum Funding
There shall be a Maximum Funding of the Fund for each calendar month (and for each pay period when required by the provision of Section 2 of this article).

Section 2. Trust Fund Position
There shall be a Trust Fund Position (stated as a percentage) for the Fund for each calendar month. The Trust Fund Position for the Fund for any particular month shall be determined by dividing the current market value of the total assets in such Funds as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the first Monday of such month, as certified by the Trustee, by the Maximum Funding of such Fund for such month. The Trust Fund Position for the Fund for any particular month shall be applied in connection with such Fund for all purposes under the Plan to each of the pay periods beginning within such month; provided, however, that whenever the Trust Fund Position for the Fund for any particular month is less than ten percent (10%), such Trust Fund Position shall be applied in connection with such Fund for all purposes under the Plan only to the first pay period beginning within such month, and thereafter there shall be determined a Trust Fund Position (stated as a percentage) for such Fund for each pay period until the Trust Fund Position for a particular pay period equals or exceeds ten percent (10%).

Upon the determination of such dispute, such Credit Units as are still held in suspension
47

(c)	For purposes of the Plan, an "Unscheduled Short Work Week” with respect to an employee is any Short Work Week:
(1)	which is not a Scheduled Short Work Week as defined in Article XII, subsection 3 (b); or
(2)	in which an employee returns to work from lay-off to replace a separated or absent employee (including an employee failing to respond or tardy in responding to recall), or returns to work after a full week of lay-off in connection with an increase in production, but only to the extent that the Short Work Week is attributable to such cause.
(d)	For any Short Work Week with respect to an employee which results both from the circumstances set forth in subsection 3(b) as well as those in subsection 3(c) of this Article XII, (i) the Benefit for the hours of the Short Work Week attributable to the circumstances set forth in subsection 3(b) shall be calculated on the basis that the hours attributable to the circumstances set forth in subsection 3(c) were Compensated or Available Hours and (ii) the Benefit for the hours of the Short Work Week attributable to the circumstances set forth in subsection 3(c) shall be calculated on the basis that the hours attributable to the circumstances set forth in subsection 3(b) were Compensated or Available Hours.

If an employee believes himself entitled to a Short Week Benefit for a week
69
under this Article XII (which he does not receive on the date when Short Week Benefits for such week are paid) he may make written application therefore in accordance with procedures established by the Company. The Company shall promptly determine the employee’s eligibility for a Short Week Benefit, and such Benefit shall be paid or denied in accordance with such determination.
