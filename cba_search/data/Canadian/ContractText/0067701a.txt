(b) During the life of this Agreement any reduction in the work force of the Company will be thesubject of negotiation with the Union. If the Company plans plant closure, reduction of staff or anticipates that the introduction of a new technology in the form of new equipment or product distribution system, will result in regular employees whose immediate jobs are directly altered thereby being placed in a different occupational classification or being removed from their occupational classification due to lack of work, then when the Company knows the changes that are expected to apply to these employees it will arrange for an early discussion of these changes with the Union.

In accordance with Manitoba legislation, if you have completed less than 10 years but at least 5 years of service, you will receive a monthly pension at age 65 equal to the amount of basic pension credited to you under the Plan with respect to your service in Manitoba after January 1,1985.
If you were a member of the Plan before January 1, 1975, when yourservice is terminated you mayeither:
(a)	Leave all of your contributions in the Plan and receive at age 65 a monthly pension equal to the basic pension to your credit to December 31, 1974, or
(b)	Withdraw your contributions plus interest to your date of termination of service in which case you forfeit your credited service to December 31, 1974, and any pension in respect of such service. Any such withdrawals, however, are restricted by government legislation as explained below.
By law, an employee who has attained age 45 and completed 10 years of service when he terminates is not permitted to withdraw the required contributions which he made after July 1,1976 in Manitoba. If any contributions are “locked-in” by law you will receive at age 65 the basic pension to your credit for the period during which you made such contributions. You may elect to withdraw those contributions prior to the lock-in date and forfeit credited service and any pension for service to the lock-in date.
In accordance with Manitoba legislation, you may-elect to transfer the commuted value of your vested pension to atrumui registered pension ■p/ian'(ft sut-h other plan so permits) or to a registered retirement savings plan of your choice. The Manitoba Pension Benefits Act requires that the amount transferred be locked-in and is not capable of being withdrawn from the R.R.S.P. in a lump sum.
14.	ESCALATION OF PENSION AFTER RETIREMENT If you retire from the service of the Company, your pension entitlement will be reviewed annually, and where applicable, extra pension will be payable from January 1st of each year following your retirement.
65
The extra pension, if any, payable to you under this provision will be determined each year by multiplying your total basic pension by a percentage factor equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index in the preceding year, but the percentage factor for any year will not be more than 2%. For purposes of this calculation, your total basic pension is the amount of basic pension you are entitled to receive at retirement from all Company plans, before the election of any options, and does not include any minimum pension supplement or disability supplement you may be entitled to receive.
Any extra pension resulting from such adjustments
included in determining any spouse’s pension which may be payable after your death.
15.	PREVIOUS PLANS (before January 1,1958)
If you were a member of a previous Company pension clan (Government Annuity and Monarch Life) in effect before January 1,1958, your benefits from that plan are payable in accordance with the provisions of that previous plan and are in addition to the benefit you receive from the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Since your period of membership in the previous plan is included in determining your total credited service, any basic pension to your credit under the previous plan is taken into account in determining the amount of any minimum pension supplement you are entitled to receive. Since your pension from the previous plan will be actuarially reduced if you retire before age 65, your basic LPR pension will include an amount equal to the difference between your actuarially reduced previous plan pension at age 65 reduced by the same factors as are applicable to your LRP pension as explained in Section 8, 9 or 10 as the case may be.
For these purposes your basic previous pension has been determined and fixed as that amount of pension payable from age 65 and guaranteed fora minimum of 5 years which would be available in accordance with the terms of the previous plan in effect at December 31,1957 but excluding anv.Densionourchased by voluntary contributions you may have made to that plan. Anv increase in the amount of vour Government An-n&y which has resulted from an increase in interest
66
rate from 1975 is not considered asa part of your basic previous plan pension and would be payable as an extra benefit over and above your basic pension.
After retirement your total basic pension which is subject to escalation as explained in Section 14 includes the amount of basic previous plan pension determined as explained above.
