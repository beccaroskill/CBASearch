Pension Plan Document, individuals in receipt of Long Term Disability or Workers' Compensation benefits in excess of 104 weeks will receive continuous service (as defined in section 12.02(b) of tho collective agreement except as part (iv) thereof is modified by the provisions herein contained) for pension purposes up until either their return to work or their date of retirement.

6.	Employees placed on the inactive list after 1C weeks of Wage Continuance Program benefi will no longer have vacation pay off-set fro Long Term Disability earnings.
V	Contracting Out
This will confirm our understanding with respect issues involved with contracting out.
This letter supplements Article 2.03 cf tl Collective Agreement.
During the course of negotiations, the Unic expressed its many concerns to the Compai about the contracting out of work which could t preformed by bargaining unit employees. Tl Company stated that it could not abide by a toi prohibition on contracting out of work.
126
The Company agreed to recall former employees with recall rights and to promote employees who had been demoted before it contracted out work of a duration of 14 days or longer. The Union requested assurances that in times of expansion or employee attrition, the Company would post vacancies, attempt to fill them and train or hire new employees before it contracted out work. The Company perceived that such provision in the Collective Agreement could result in a total prohibition on contracting out work, which is the circumstance the Company has maintained it cannot live with.
The purpose of this Letter of Agreement, therefore, is to commit to the Union that apart from the design and construction phase of major capital projects when the Company is expanding its operations, it will ensure to have work normally performed by bargaining unit employees performed by them and will post vacancies as required and if there are no successful candidates, it will hire new employees into the bargaining unit to do the work.
It is understood that if there is no satisfactory qualified person available for hire, the Company may contract out work until it can hire a new employee.

<V Pay For Knowledge
Letter XXV to the 1992 Collective Agreement committed the parties to a review of the Joint Job Evaluation Program dated March I J974. The reason for the review was in part that there were claims the system could no l onger measure changed jobs and in part, there was a Pay Equity System put in place January I, 1991, that caused the need for two separate systems to be followed for job postings and workforce reductions, if any.
As a result of initial deliberations the parties agreed to develop a new job evaluation program that combined pay equity principles.
The Vice President and General Manager of Sudbury Operations, EricBelford, suggested that those charged with the review consider a "Pay for Knowledge System" as an accompaniment to the combined Joint Job Evaluation/Pay Equity Program due to the following reasons:
the system that has been in place limits the efficiency of employees and can result in low morale and lack of self-fulfilment for employees; the old system in many cases required employees to operate in narrow areas of specialization with limited
139
opportunity to learn new work and be ab to advance; in certain areas of ti operations it is recognized that employee with broader skills can provide sever services in an area as opposed to thei being a requirement to have sever employees provide those services; tl Company also recognizes that narro specializations limits opportunities r>< only to advance but in times of work fore reductions, limits employees opportunity for job security; as well, long tenure on job can result in boredom as work loses i challenge.
Joint Committee
Effective May 1,	1995, a Joii
Union/Management Committee consisting > two Union representatives arid tw Management representatives will h established to implement and maintain tl Pay For Knowledge System. The Unic members will be paid their regular rate > pay, Nickel Bonus and Cost-of-Livir Allowance, if any, while serving on tl Committee and will accrue seniority ar credited service.
140
Goals
The goals of a Pay For Knowledge System are improvement of efficiency, provision of broader job opportunities, greater work challenge and the opportunity to earn higher wages.
Purpose
The purpose of this letter is to outline a Pay for Knowledge System. The System is a formal program that includes training through pursuit of requisite courses at the High School or, Community College or University level as well as successful completion of Company sponsored training modules; demonstrated proficiency on the job; and performance reviews; or a combination of several of these methods.
Procedures
Progression from an entry level job in an occupational stream to the standard rate for the job is time related and as in the forerunner of the Pay for Knowledge System will usually require two 6 month periods of
141
on-the-job experience. However, once a employee has reachedthe standard rate.th employee may earn higher wages than th standard rate of his job by successfi completion of requisite courses combine> with on-the-job experience. There ar specific time provisions of on-the-jo experience required for mast advancement and this is necessary to ensure th£ sufficient experience is gained in th application of the knowledge required t perform the successive functions in eac occupational stream. Advancement is tic automatic. Performance reviews which shot acceptable performance along with sufficler experience on the job are required before a increase in increment is received. Skills mus be readily available to the Company and use sufficiently to retain proficiency an increased wages above the standard rate.
The parties recognize there are certai specialist jobs which may not len themselves to broader opportunities an therefore employees in those jobs may ne be able to be paid above the standard ratefc their job unless duties change and their jo is re-evaluated.
142
Management retains the right to reduce an employee's wage rate from above standard to the standard rate for his job where the employee demonstrates lack of ability to perform the job.
Present employees who have relieved employees in higher job classes who were absent for whatever reason, will receive credit for such time spent in relief. As a guide to the amount of credit to be received due regard will be given to the increment paid while relieving in the higher job class.
There are other benefits that will result from a Pay For Knowledge System apart from those mentioned above. Each employee will know what is required on their part in respect of training courses they must successfully complete in order to advance and develop to their full potential. Broadened abilities equate to greater job security. More training coupled with on-the-job experience not only means greater earnings potential but also means that when a vacancy is posted and candidates apply who have the same training and experience the senior employee ought ta get the job.
143
Before the Pay For Knowledge System c i be implemented considerable work must l done by supervision in determining wh training courses or modules are required^ each of the jobs inthe bargaining unit as w< as schedules of requisite experience inordi for an employee to be able to advance. On courses relevant to the job duties will for part of the training requirement. Th process cf determining the requisite course will be targeted for completion by March 1996, and this will allow employees to beg pursuing courses of study that will enab them to progress. The next step will be develop necessary modules where nor exist and this will be targeted forcompletic by March 1, 1997, so the Pay ForKnowledi System can be implemented on that date.
A training module differs from a trainir course in that the module may take a day > two of training on Company premise whereas training courses are acquired institutions such as a Community Collet and are usually of a duration of asemeste
As this former step is going on, front lit supervisors will review with each employe
144
what the training courses are that the employee must complete in order to advance to the next pay level above their current rate of pay.
Given the time requirements for course determination and development, the parties agree to implement Pay For Knowledge effective March I 3997.
The Collective Agreement will continue to govern the actions cf the parties.
An employee, who through completion of requisite courses and on-the-job experience attains the standard rate for the job next in his line of progression, will not automatically be reclassifiedto the job class of the higher job; to attain the job class of the higher job, the employee must be the successful candidate for a job posting.
The Company agrees that in the case cf a workforce reduction after the implementation of Pay for Knowledge, an employee who has attained a higher rate of pay as a result of the provisions of the Pay For Knowledge System will not have that rate of pay reduced provided he is able to maintain a job in his
145
line of progression through the proceeding of Article 12.18.
XXVI	Tests
Where the Company requires applicants for job vacancy to undergo a test, such test will t administered in such a manner ar circumstance to provide an objective evaluatic of all applicants.
Tests are to be objective, uniform for e employees and relevant to the job postir which has been placed on the bulletin board Applicants shall be informed of their test resul and where results indicate counselling required for self improvement purposes. su< counselling will be provided by the Company.
Wheretest results or methodsare challenge the employee shall be entitled to the actu test results and methodology used by tf Company.
XXVII	No Successful Applicant
The Union discussed with the Company i* concern aboutthe practice of indicating a employee was "placed" in a job when thei was "No Successful Candidate" during tf posting process. The Company has agree to stop its practice and showthe employe concerned as the Successful Candidafc however, it is understood between tf
146
parties that such action shall in noway be interpreted as a reduction in the standard needed to be deemed qualified for the purposes cf the Collective Agreement.
XVIII	Overtime Lists (12.06 (b))
The Company will undertake to make the necessary changes to the computerized time collection system to be able to provide overtime listings which show declined overtime opportunities as well as overtime worked.
It is the intent of the Company to have these changes i n place by January 1,1996.
XIX	Job Evaluation Committee
This is to confirm our commitment to ensure that a Joint Job Evaluation Committee is established, maintained and operative throughout the term of the Agreement.
XX	On the Job Training Opportunity
It is understood between the parties that upon the adoption of a Pay for Knowledge System this clause shall only provide for 1 training opportunity in any one year and that opportunity shall be focused on allowing employees to change lines of progression.
