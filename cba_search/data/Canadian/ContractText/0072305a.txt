Dear Mr. Campbell,
RE: INTRODUCTION DE^BN TECHNOLOGY
Current and future trends in manufacturing have required individual workers to take greater responsibility and be more directly accountable for the production process. The introduction of complex technological advances, more highly automated processes, intricate problem solving methods and sophisticated mathematical validation concepts, necessitates the development of complex new skills by the workforce through retraining.
As process improvements are undertaken, both parties recognize the importance of minimizing disruption to the workforce while acquiring the necessary skills to implement the changes. With this objective in mind, it is agreed that:
(a)	The Union will be notified (at the time of project approval) when the introduction of technology will have a significant impact on the workforce either because of reduction in jobs or where new skills will need to be acquired.
(b)	Where the success of a change to equipment, operation, or procedure is dependent upon the acquisition of additional knowledge or skill on the part of the employee, retraining will be provided to the employees involved.
(c)	Whenever it is reasonable and practical to do so, the Company will reduce the workforce through attrition when a technological change necessitates a reduction in the workforce.
Yours sincerely,

It is understood that amendment to the Pension Plan in accordance with this Plan, is subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to obtaining and retaining such acceptance of the Pension Plan by such Pension Authorities and Commissions and subject to obtaining and retaining such acceptance of this Plan by the relevant Tax Authorities to establish that the Company is entitled to deduct the amount of its contributions to the Pension Fund as an expense before taxes under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, or any other applicable tax laws, as now in effect or as hereafter amended or adopted, the Company agrees with the Union that the Company will provide the pensions and pay the Severance Awards provided for herein which are awarded to those who become eligible therefore during the term of this Plan or any renewal thereof. No action in performance of the terms of this Plan and consistent herewith shall be construed or interpreted to be a violation of any of the terms of any Collective Labour Agreement between the Company and the Union.
86
Should such approval or acceptance of the above named authorities be refused or withdrawn, negotiations will be started by the parties in an effort to make such changes as are required to obtain approval. In the event of failure in such negotiations, but in any case not later than the effective date of such refusal or withdrawal, this Plan will be terminated.
In such event, either the Union or the Company may apply to the Ontario Labour Relations Board for permission to terminate the Collective Labour Agreement then in effect (solely for the purpose of obtaining Conciliation Service on the matter in dispute) and the other party shall join in such application. If, subsequent to notice of termination of the Collective Labour Agreement or subsequent to termination of this Plan under these circumstances the parties settle any differences between them then the Collective Labour Agreement if terminated, shall be reinstated to continue in full force until termination according to its provisions.

ARTICLE Ill MAXIMUM FUNDING AND TRUST POSITION
Section 1. Maximum Funding
There shall be a Maximum Funding of the Fund for each calendar month (and for each pay period when required by the provision of Section 2 of this Article).

ARTICLE Xl
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
Section 1. General
The determination of the eligibility under the Plan of any person who applies for a Weekly Supplemental Benefit and the payment under the Plan of such Benefit shall be made and administered under and in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
Section 2. Application For a Benefit
The Company shall have the right to establish reasonable rules, regulations and procedures concerning the times and places at which persons desiring to establish eligibility for and/or to apply for a Weekly Benefit shall report in order to comply with the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 1 and 2 of Article V, and concerning the form, content and substantiation of applications for Benefits.
So far as practicable, such procedures shall require the applicant to apply for a Benefit under the Plan for any week of lay-off during the same week as, or in any event, no later than four (4) weeks after he has received his Unemployment Insurance Benefit for such week of lay-off.
The Company shall designate an office or department at the Plant where persons laid off from such Plan may appear for the purpose of complying with such requirements.
An applicant shall be required to exhibit his Unemployment Insurance Benefit cheque for the week with respect to which application for a Benefit under the Plan is made, or the payment receipt or similar document showing receipt of the Unemployment Insurance Benefit for such week; provided, however, that if the applicant was ineligible, as provided in subsection (b), 3 of Section 2 of Article V, to receive an Unemployment Insurance Benefit for such week, such applicant, shall, in lieu of exhibiting such cheque, payment receipt or similar document, furnish proof satisfactory to the Company that he was ineligible solely for the reason set forth.
Unemployment Insurance Benefits shall be presumed to have been received by the applicant on the date set forth on the cheques therefore, or, on the date on the copy of the payment receipt or similar document.
In addition, an applicant for a Benefit under the Plan may be required to state, in writing under oath, (i) whether he received or was entitled to receive any Benefit from any source other than the Plan and the Unemployment Insurance system, for the week with respect to which application is made, and if so, the source and amount thereof; (ii) the
107
amount earned from all sources during such week and the source thereof; and (iii) the identity and number of his dependents; and (iv) such further additional evidence and information as the Company may deem to be material and relevant in order to enable the Company to determine whether such person is eligible to be paid a Benefit under the Plan, and if so, the amount of such Benefit.
Section 3. Determination of Eligibility
(a)	When a person files an application for a Benefit under the Plan in accordance with Section 2 of this Article, and furnishes to the Company the evidence and information required to be furnished under such Section, the Company promptly thereafter shall:
(1)	determine whether such person is an eligible person and, if he is determined to be an eligible person,
(2)	determine the number of uncancelled Credit Units to the credit of such eligible person, and
(3)	determine whether any Weekly Supplemental Benefit is payable to such eligible person, and, if so, the amount thereof.
(b)	If the Company determines that a Weekly Supplemental Benefit is payable to an eligible person with respect to the week for which application for such Benefit is made, it shall deliver prompt written notice thereof to the Trustee setting forth the name of such eligible person and the amount of such Benefit. Upon receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall be required to make payment of such Benefit from the Fund to such eligible person within a reasonable time. If the Company determines, after a person has been paid one or more Weekly Supplemental Benefits under the Plan, that such Benefit or Benefits should not have been paid or should have been paid in a lesser amount or amounts (as the result of a subsequent disqualification for Unemployment Insurance Benefits or otherwise), a written notice thereof shall be mailed to such person and such person shall return the amount of overpayment to the Trustee. If such person shall fail to return such amount promptly, the Trustee shall arrange for an amount equal to the amount of overpayment to be reimbursed to the Fund by making a deduction from future Weekly Supplemental Benefits otherwise payable to such person or by requesting the Company to make a deduction from compensation payable by the Company to such person, or both. The Company is authorized to make such deduction from the employee’s compensation and in such event pay the amount deducted to the Trustee. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, at such time as such amount of overpayment is recovered by the Fund, the number of Credit Units of such person, if any, therefore cancelled with respect to such
108
overpayment of benefits shall be restored to him, except to the extent that such restoration would raise the number of his Credit Units above one hundred and thirty (130) at the time thereof, and except as otherwise provided in Article VI, Section 2. The payment of Benefits under the Plan may be made by, and the return of amounts of overpayment may be made to the representative of the Trustee appointed by it for such purpose in the Plan. Such representative may be persons employed by the Company.
(c)	If the Company determines that a person is not entitled to a Weekly Supplemental Benefit with respect to the week for which application for such Benefit is made, it shall send prompt written notice thereof to him.
(d)	In making weekly wage calculations for purposes of Benefit determination, the Company shall be entitled to rely upon the official form filed by the applicant with the Company for income tax withholding purposes, and the applicant shall have the burden of establishing that he is entitled to a greater number of withholding exemptions than he shall have claimed on such form.
Section 4. Power and Authority of the Company
The Company shall have such powers and authority as are necessary
and appropriate in order to carry out its duties under this Article, including, without
limitation, the following:

The Union employee designated as the representative of the Union shall be paid for time lost from work in attending meetings with the Company representative for the consideration of such appeals, by the Company through its payroll Accounts and all such payments shall be recovered by the Company from the Fund.
Any person who shall have been determined by the Company not to be entitled to any Benefits, who shall have been determined to be entitled to be paid a Weekly Supplemental Benefit that is lesser in amount than the amount to which such person believes he is entitled, who questions the number of Credit Units credited to him at the time of lay-off, who has more of his Credit Units cancelled than he believes correct or who is determined to be ineligible for a Benefit which termination is disputed by him, may appeal such determination by presenting an Appeal, on a form to be provided for that purpose to the Union representative. Such written Appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days following the date of notice of such determination or denial or reduction of such Benefit to such person, or within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing of a cheque of such smaller amount by the Trustee to such person. In the situation where a number of employees have filed applications for Benefits under substantially identical conditions, an appeal may be filed with respect to one of such employees and the decision thereon shall apply to all such employees. The representative receiving said written Appeal will promptly furnish one copy to the Company representative.
If the Union representative shall find that such Appeal is justified, he shall so notify the Company representative, and the Company representative and Union representative shall meet within ten (10) days from the date of the Appeal (for such extended time as may be agreed upon) to determine the disposition of such Appeal.
In the event the two (2) parties cannot agree upon the disposition of the Appeal, the Union representative, at the request of the applicant, may refer the matter to the “Board of Appeals” for disposition, on a form to be provided for that purpose, within the time limit and in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 5 (b) of this Article XI.
(b)	(1) Within twenty (20) days after disposition of an Appeal by the Company and
the Union representatives, the Union representative may request a ruling by
110
the Board of Appeals, Such a request shall be in writing, shall specify the respects in which the Plan is claimed to have been violated and shall set forth the facts relied upon as justifying a reversal or modification of the determination appealed from. A copy of said request will be furnished to the Company representative. The board of Appeals shall have no jurisdiction to act upon an Appeal made after the time specified above or upon an Appeal which does not otherwise comply with this subparagraph. Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (2) set forth below, the handling and disposition of such a request to the Board of Appeals shall be in accordance with the regulations and procedures established by the Board. The applicant, the Union representative, or the union members of the Board of Appeals may withdraw any appeal to the Board at any time before it is decided by the Board.
(2)	In ruling upon Appeals, the Board shall have no authority to waive, vary, qualify, or alter in any manner, the eligibility requirements set forth in the Plan, the procedure for applying for Weekly Supplemental Benefits set forth therein, or any other provisions of the Plan, and shall have no jurisdiction other than to determine on the basis of the facts presented and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan;
(i)	whether the first stage of Appeal and Appeal to the Board were made within the time and in the manner specified in this Section;
(ii)	whether the person is an eligible person with respect to the Benefit involved and, if so,
(iii)	the amount of any Benefit payable;
(iv)	whether the accrual or cancellations of Credit Units was properly determined.
(3)	There shall be no appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals. It shall be final and binding upon the Union, its members, the person involved, the Trustee, and the Company. The Union will discourage any attempt of its members to appeal and will not encourage or co-operate with any of its members in any appeal to any court or labour board from any decision of the Board, nor will the Union or its members by any other means attempt to bring about a settlement of any claim or issue on which the Board is empowered to rule hereunder.

A Short Week Benefit shall be paid from the Fund. No application for such Benefit shall be required of the employee except as otherwise provided in Section 5 of this Article. Any Short Week Benefit payable for a week under the provisions of this Article XII shall be in lieu of any other Benefit payable under this Plan with respect to such week except as otherwise provided under subsection 1 (g) of this Article XII.
Section 5. Application for Determination
If an employee believes himself entitled to a Short Week Benefit for a week under this Article XII (which he does not receive on the date when Short Week Benefits for such week are paid) he may make written application, therefore, in accordance with procedures established by the Company. The Company shall promptly determine the employee’s eligibility for a Short Week Benefit, and such Benefit shall be paid or denied in accordance with such determination.
