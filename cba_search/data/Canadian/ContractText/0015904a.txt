(b)	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern.

Probationary employees shall have recourse to the grievance procedure in all matters and during the probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed to be for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.

The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.

If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract work, the Union President will be so advised and with full information on the reasons for the decision, time* the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the wo rk has been completed bythe contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate aii pertinent information which would ailov| the parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more; effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
3. A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
in order to deal with these guidelines, For the purposes,pf jjjjpf

representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meefjif conjunction with the Labour Management Committees

To the Unions:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting shortterm personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use Of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
4)	it is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
(a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee’s request).
107
2-
(b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked “regular”
vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
(c)	Employee would take a “special” vacation day at his request only
(vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6)	in the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
It was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

RE: HEAVY DUTY/MAINTENANCE MECHANICS
This will confirm the agreement reached at 1993 bargaining with regard to separating the Heavy Duty trade from the Maintenance Mechanic classification. As discussed, Heavy Duty Mechanics and Maintenance Mechanics will be considered separate and distinct classifications with the signing of the 1993 Collective Agreement.
Employees in either classification on October 1,1993 will be “grandfathered” and have the right to use their seniority to bump junior employees in the other classification to retain a job in the event of a lay-off. An employee will lose “grandfathering” rights on being laid off.
Notwithstanding the foregoing’ Maintenance Mechanics or Heavy Duty Mechanics laid off prior to the reconstitution of the October 25,1993 list (anticipated to be revised in and around June 1994, per Letter #26), will have recall rights to either classification. That is, such employees will be recalled in the inverse order they were laid off. Heavy Duty Mechanics recalled to the surface plants or Industrial Mechanics recalled to positions underground will be considered temporary assignments and such employees will be reassigned to where their skills can be best utilized when the opportunity presents itself.
It is understood that if a lay-off results in a deficiency of heavy duty skills, mechanics with heavy duty skills who are working in the surface plants can be reassigned underground on a temporary basis for up to twelve (12) months under the terms of Letter #28. It is further understood that if the Company is unable to fill its skill requirements underground by reassigning employees on a temporary basis, the Company and the Unions will meet to craft a solution to the problem.
As agreed at 1993 bargaining’ shortly after the Collective Agreement is ratified, Industrial Mechanics working in surface operations will be canvassed to determine which mechanics wish to become Heavy Duty Certified and work underground. Those who so indicate will be afforded the opportunity to work underground and enter a Heavy Duty apprenticeship on the following basis - once all the Heavy Duty
2
117
Mechanics have been recalled from lay-off, the Company will fill vacancies for Heavy Duty Mechanics using Industrial Mechanics on the list of those desiring training to the point that there are four (4) Heavy Duty apprentices at Trout Lake Mine and four (4) Heavy Duty apprentices at Caliinan Mine. Any subsequent vacancies will be filled by hiring until an apprentice graduates. Vacancies for Heavy Duty Mechanics will be filled in the manner outlined above until all the Industrial Mechanics who indicated they wished to become Heavy Duty Mechanics have had the opportunity to enter the Heavy Duty apprenticeship.

It is, therefore’ the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
Flin Ron employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2 *s) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (2 h) hours of straight-time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools from Snow Lake when they return from the completion of a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day they were returning to Rin Ron. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare, Rin Ron to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period.

RE: LONG TERM ABSENTEEISM
This will confirm the agreement reached at 1993 bargaining with regard to employees who have been off work twelve (12) months or more.
Effective the date of signing Of the Collective Agreement, an employee who has been off work for more than twelve (12) months on Sick Benefit will not accrue vacation pay. Accrual of vacation pay will restart after the employee has been back at work on a full time basis for a minimum of three (3) months (accrual from the date of return).
Effective the date Of signing Of the Collective Agreement, an employee who Is Off
work on Workers’ Compensation will stop accruing regular vacation. When such employee returns to work and remains at work for a minimum three (3) month period, he shall be deemed for the purpose of regular vacation to have been at work for the full calendar year prior to his return to work.
For example, an employee goes off work on WCB July 1996 and returns to work April 2000 (seniority entities him to 25 regular vacation days/year).
-	January 1997 employee would be paid lump sum for any regular vacation earned in 1995, but not taken prior to July 1996 when he went off work on WCB.
-	January 1998 employee would be paid lump sum for any regular vacation earned from January 1996 tiff July 1996.
-	When employee returns to work in April 2000, he will be entitled to 25 regular vacation days with pay to be taken during the calendar year 2000. (Would be entitled to the 25 days during 2000 regardless of when he returned to work during 2000.)
Effective the date of signing of the Collective Agreement, employees off work on Workers’ Compensation or Sick Benefit will cease accruing special vacation on being off work for twelve (12) months. Accrual of special vacation will restart once
130

an employee has returned to work for three (3) months (accrual from date of return to work).
Using the same circumstances in the example outlined above, if the employee's
next set of specials are due August 1998, then:
His specials would continue to accrue until July 1997.
As of August 1998 he would have accrued 23/36 x 15 * 10 working days of specials to be taken no later than August 2001.
When he returns to work April 2000, he would have the 10 days referred to above (to take by August 2001) and he would begin accruing specials again.
At his next entitlement date (August 2001) he would have accrued 16/36 x 15 = 7 working days of specials to be taken no later than August 2004.
Effective the date of signing of the Collective Agreement, an employee who has been off work for twelve (12) months or more will be required to retire provided he qualifies for an unreduced pension unless his personal physician, in consultation with a Company designated physician, determines that the employee should be able to return to work within a twelve (12) month period.

To the Unions:
RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT
AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skiffs. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, employees may perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skiffs acquired may justify in some instances increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
(a)	Safety - Ail work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company’s Safety Rules, the
regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate.
(b)	Trades - In order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph (a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
2
136
(c) Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph (a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBM&S Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one representative of the United Steelworkers, one representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skiffs required to perform the additional duties safely. This Committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skiffs acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise, it is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
it is agreed that during the term of this Agreement, no employees on the payroll as at October 25,1993 other than those on the layoff fist as of that date will be laid off unless such lay-offs are the result of the following:
a)	Temporary lay-offs because of temporary shutdown, including but not limited to vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Lay-offs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof not including work reorganization or process modifications with the exception of the Noranda Reactor Project.
3
137
c)	Lay-offs of any employee hired after October 25,1993.
d)	Discharge for cause.	--
e)	Lay-offs due to closure, safe or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, safe or merger.
it is further agreed that subsequent to the final lay-offs taking place as a result of Snow Lake closure and ZPL commissioning, the layoff list outlined above will be reconstituted, it is anticipated that the list will be revised in and around June of 1994. The revised fist will include ail employees actually laid off plus twenty (20) employees retained for capital projects, consisting of the fourteen (14) junior Steelworkers, the four (4) junior mechanics and the two (2) junior electricians. It is understood that employees on the revised list outlined above, as well as employees hired after October 25,1993 may be laid off with the implementation or completion of a capital project. It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.
it is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is understood that either party may cancel this Letter of Understanding by giving the other party one (1) month’s written notice.

RE: GRADUATE ELECTRICIANS
Further to discussions with the Joint Bargaining Committee 1987 regarding moves to different work locations for graduate electricians in Flin Ron, it is agreed that notices wfll be posted to advise of vacancies in a particular work location. The purpose of such notices will be for the graduate electrician to indicate his preference to move to tie vacancy and since such moves are not considered to be an upgrading or downgrading and the rate of pay does not change, Article 7.01 does not apply.
The Company will determine who will be moved or assigned to the vacancy and, in making such determination, will consider factors such as:
i)	the work requirements in each work location, and
ii)	the relative skill, ability and physical fitness of the employees to fulfil such requirements, and
iii)	the graduate seniority including time served as an apprentice with the Company since his most recent date of hire, of any electrician who has answered the notice.
If, in the opinion of the Company, there is not a suitable candidate for the vacancy from those who have applied to the notice, or if no one has applied to the notice, then the Company will select the employee to be assigned.
It is understood between the parties that in the event the" Company decides^ transfer tradesmen presently in Department 69 into bper^ng depaiiments^tf^y gl| be considered as remaining in Department 69 for the pufposes pf th]s letter<

Successful candidates will be required to obtain and maintain pressure tickets suitable to the requirements of operations.

Prior to any change, the Union will be consulted.
Successful applicants will be given six (6) months to obtain the required tickets and be paid a two (2) job class additive above their current rate once those tickets are obtained. The two (2) job class additive will be paid retroactive to attainment of the final ticket. The attainment of the final ticket will be deemed to be the time at which the coupon is welded which results in the final ticket being obtained.
If an employee in the classification of Boilermaker/Welder Specialist loses a ticket, he/she will have six (6) months to obtain the necessary ticket. During the six (6) month period, the two (2) job class additive will be maintained. If the ticket is not renewed at the end of six months, the (2) job class additive will be withdrawn.

RE: MODIFIED WORK
The Company and the Unions have agreed to establish a Modified Work Program
which is designed to help employees return to meaningful work with minimal risk
to their rehabilitation. To this end, the parties agree to the following:
1.	A committee of three (3) representatives to oversee the program will be formed consisting of: one (1) from the Company, one (1) from the Trades Association and one (1) from the United Steelworkers.
2.	The committee will operate by consensus.
3.	The committee will use a medical professional for consultation purposes as required.
4.	The employee must qualify for Sick Benefit or Workers’ Compensation before being eligible for the formal Modified Work Program. However, employees who fall outside the formal Modified Work Program may make arrangements with department supervision for modified work.
5.	The employee will be involved in placement decisions. All reasonable efforts will be made to meet the employee’s needs both medically and personally. Any disputes will be dealt with by the Joint Committee. Every effort will be made to place the employee on modified work in his original department and classification.
6.	Wage structure:
a) Workers’ Compensation
The employee will receive the rate of pay for the modified work performed until a decision on make-up of wages is made by WCB. If there is no make-up of wages, then the Company will retroactively pay the red circled rate of the employee’s former job.
2
157
b) Sick Benefit
The employee will receive a red circled rate for 520 hours of modified work for each unrelated occurrence of modified work, if a dispute arises over whether an occurrence is a reoccurrence, it will be referred to the Committee. Anything in excess of 520 hours will be paid at the rate of the modified work performed.
7.	The employee’s originating department will assume the costs for the first 520 hours if the employee is assigned to another department.
8.	The Modified Work Program will be co-ordinated by the Superintendent of Loss Control who will also serve as the Company representative on the committee.
9.	Union jurisdiction:
If an employee is assigned to a job outside of his current union jurisdiction, he will continue to pay dues to his union for a one (1) year period. At that time it will be reviewed by the committee and the affected unions.
10.	Transfers:
An employee on temporary modified work can only apply for job bulletins in his original department.
11.	A meeting will take place between the department, the co-ordinator, the employee and his union steward to outline the restrictions and responsibilities of all involved in the modified work assignment.

That being the case, for each staff employee returning to the bargaining unit, one hourly employee will be removed from the layoff list.

That is, the Company, effective January I, 1994, will be responsible for paying for only the non-recoverable portion of eligible drug costs for regular participating status members and special participating group members.
It is understood between the parties that the Company will, retroactive to April I, 1994, provide members with a vision care benefit so long as the cost of that benefit to the Company is offset by an equal amount of savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments. The vision care benefit shall be for the cost of prescription lenses, frames and contact lenses to a maximum of $100 every twenty-four (24) months for eligible members.
It is further understood that the Company will provide a pension window affording employees who have attained 55 years of age and 30 years of service to retire without penalty during the calendar years 1994,1995 and 1996. The pension window provided for the calendar years 1995 and 1996 will be provided only if the savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments exceeds the combined cost of the vision care benefit and the yearly cost of the pension window.
For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the expression “savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments” shall be defined to mean the reduced Company costs that can be established as being solely attributable to the Company being the secondary rather than the primary payer for drugs covered under Article 13.04 (c) of the Collective Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “savings”). Savings shall include savings related to all bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired), and the cost of the vision care benefits shall be based on the cost required to extend the benefit to all such bargaining and non-bargaining
2
165
unit personnel (both active and retired). The cost of the pension window shall be determined on the basis of the cost of extending the pension window only to personnel employed in the bargaining units covered by the terms of this Letter of Understanding.
The Company will review the savings that are available following each calendar quarter during the years of 1994,1995 and 1996 to determine if there are sufficient
savings available to provide the vision care benefit and the pension windows. Savings may be carried forward from quarter to quarter within a calendar year, but shall not be carried forward from one calendar year to the next.
The cost of the pension window will be amortized over a 15-year period starting with the calendar year in which each electing employee retires. If there, are insufficient savings available to fund the pension window for all employees who elect to retire in either 1995 or 1996, then the pension window will be offered .to employees in the order in which they have filed their written request to retire in accordance with the terms of the pension window.
The cost of the pension window will be as determined from time to time by the actuary appointed by the Company under the terms of the Revised Retirement Pension Plan for Employees of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited and Its Designated Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies. The actuary’s decision shall be final, provided that it is made in good faith and in accordance with the principles and assumptions utilized to value the pension plan as a whole.
In light of the costs that the Company will incur in funding the pension window during the 15-year period over which the additional costs are amortized, there will be no obligation on the Company to purchase any additional benefits or to make any concessions related to any subsequent savings other than those set forth herein.

To the Unions:
RE: HEALTH PLAN COMMITTEE
It is understood between the parties that the Health Plan Committee, during the term of the Collective Agreement, will determine the drugs that should be covered by the Health Plan and make a recommendation outlining any changes to those presently covered to the Company and the Unions for final approval. As a starting point, the Committee will review the drugs covered by Manitoba Pharmacare and add or delete from that list of drugs, using the criteria of cost containment and real medical need.

RE: LUMP SUMP PAYMENT IF PROFITABLE
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties that in lieu of an increase in wages during the term of this Agreement, employees will receive a lump sum payment in the event the Company is profitable in the 1994 or 1995 calendar years. Profitability shall be as determined by the Profit Sharing Plan, it being understood that any monies paid as a result of this letter will be deducted from earnings prior to the profit sharing calculation being made.
The lump sum payment to an employee shall be to a maximum of two percent (2%) of the employee’s straight time earnings for the calendar year the Company was profitable. It is understood that the cumulative payment of these lump sums cannot exceed the profit earned in the calendar year in question. In the event the cumulative payments would exceed the profit earned, the percentage would be scaled back from two percent (2%) to the point the cumulative payment causes the Company to break even.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #54
To the Unions:
RE: TRAINING AND JOB SECURITY FOR SENIOR EMPLOYEES
This will confirm discussions held at 1993 bargaining with regards to training and job security for senior employees within a trade. As agreed, in the event lay-offs become necessary during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, junior employees in a trade will be laid off unless such employees have received specialized training as a result of being the successful applicant for a plant wide training posting. Such training postings will be awarded to senior qualified applicants within a trade. It was agreed that the only posting that is deemed to be a training posting under the terms of this letter, that was filled prior to the signing of the October 1,1993 Collective Agreement, is a posting for Specialist Welder. This agreement was made with the understanding that senior Boilermaker/Welders who wish to obtain a pressure ticket will be given the opportunity to do so.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicants for training postings, with fifteen (15) or more years of service, may be bypassed for training with the understanding employees with fifteen (15) or more years of service will be retained over junior employees within a trade with such training, in the event of a lay-off. Prior to bypassing a senior employee for such training, the President of the Union in question will be consulted.
As discussed at 1993 bargaining, the need for training that would call for plant wide training postings has not yet been determined, but the need Is anticipated to be infrequent. That being the case, prior to such training being posted, the Company will consult with the President of the Union in question.
It is further understood that if a tradesman is awarded a training posting he may be restricted from work location moves or other training postings for a period of time equivalent to two (2) times the training period.
