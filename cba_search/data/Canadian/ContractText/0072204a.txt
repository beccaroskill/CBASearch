ARTICLE 18 JOB POSTING
18.01	When a job in the bargaining unit becomes vacant, the Employer will post a notice of the vacancy for a period of two (2) working days. The Notice will contain the nature of the job, the shift, the qualifications required and the rate of pay. An employee who wishes to be considered for the position so posted shall signify his desire by signing his name to the posting indicating his department and his qualifications for the job.
18.02	In filling any posted vacancy under this Article, the Employer will consider the training, skill and ability of the applicants to perform the work in question and where these are relatively equal seniority shall govern. If the job is not filled as a result of the posting, the Employer reserves the right to hire.
18.03	There will be a maximum of three (3) postings for a vacancy-the original posting to fill the vacancy and two (2) subsequent postings for the vacancies created by successful applicants. Any further vacancy that occurs after the second subsequent posting may be filled by the Employer without posting. Should the successful applicant to a posting be un— 32 —
satisfactory, he shall be returned to his former job and the vacancy may be filled without further posting.
18.04	(a) A newly hired employee or any employee who has successfully bid under this Article shall not be entitled to bid for a subsequent posted job for four (4) months from the date of his employment or date of his successful bid, except with the Employer's permission.
(b) Employees on the payroll before the date of ratification, July 23,1991, who bid into the Continuous Operations, and subsequently decide that they do not wish to work such a schedule, must announce their intent to return to their former position prior to the completion of twenty-eight days of Continuous Operations work. They will thereafter be returned to their former position, as soon as is practicable.
Should such an employee work on Continuous Operations for more than twenty-eight days and wish to opt out of this schedule, they may do so under the provisions of Article 18.04 (a).
18.05	Any job which is vacant because of illness, accident, vacation, leave of absence, temporary transfers or promotions and temporary vacancies shall not be deemed to be vacant for the purposes of this Article. However, where it is expected that the temporary vacan-
— 33 —
cy caused by any of the above reasons will exceed 3 months, the Company will post the job on a temporary basis. It is understood that when the original incumbent returns from such leave, the employee who filled the temporary vacancy shall return to his or her job. The Employer reserves the right to reassign an employee who has returned to work after an absence of more than six (6) months due to illness or accident if, in the opinion of the Employer, the employee cannot perform his regular job.
18.06	Wherever possible, a successful applicant to a job posting will get transferred to the job applied for within ten (10) working days from the date of his successful application. If not transferred at the end of ten (IO) working days, the successful applicant will be paid the training rate of the job to which he was the successful applicant.
ARTICLE 19
BASE CLASSIFICATION RECALL PRIVILEGE
19.01	For the purpose of administering these provisions base classification is defined as:
(a) the classification to which an employee was originally a successful applicant throug
— 34 —
the job posting procedure subject to the limitation in item 2 of this provision, or (b) the classification into which an employee is permanently assigned if the employee
did not obtain the classification through the job posting procedure.
An employee will have one (1) base classification at any time.
19.02	A seniority employee who is removed from his base classification for an indefinite period of time due to a shortage of work and is employed in another classification will retain recall privileges to the base classification in the same department and shift for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months or a time equivalent to the employee's seniority from the date the employee was originally removed from the classification, whichever is greater. When base recall privileges are exercised the Employer is not required to implement the job posting procedure.
19.03	An employee will forfeit base classification recall privileges when:
(a) the employee becomes a successful applicant to another classification through the job posting procedure in which case the new classification becomes the base classification.
35
(b)	the employee does not exercise base classification recall privileges when so offered in which case the classification to which the employee is presently assigned becomes the base classification.
(c)	twelve (12) months or a time equivalent to the employee’s seniority have elapsed from the date of being removed from the base classification, whichever is greater, without being given an opportunity to exercise base classification recall privileges in which case the classification to which the employee ispresently assigned becomes the base classification.
19.04	These provisions, in no way, are meant to alter the provisions for temporary transfers contained in the Collective Agreement.
ARTICLE 20
TEMPORARY TRANSFERS
20.01	The expression “temporary transfer” used in this clause shall mean the transfer for four hours or more of an employee from one classification to another by the Employer with the intention of returning the employee to his regular job classification as soon as practicable, but not in excess of ten (10) working days
— 36 —
unless mutually agreed upon between the Union and the Employer. When an employee
is temporarily transferred at the Employer's option and the rate of pay for the job classification to which the employee is transferred is higher than the rate for his regular classification, he shall be paid at least the next higher increment of the job to which he is temporarily transferred over his regular rate.
20.02	If an employee is transferred at the
Employer's option from one job classification to another on a temporary transfer and if the rate of pay for the job classification to which the employee is temporarily transferred is lesser than his regular job classification, he shall be paid at his regular rate of pay consistent with other provisions contained in this Agreement.
20.03	If an employee is temporarily transferred in lieu of layoff at the employee's option to a job classification where the rate of pay is lesser than his regular job classification, he shall be paid the rate of the classification to which he is transferred unless specifically excepted by the Employer.

If the Employer so reschedules the working hours in accordance with this Article, overtime for the purpose of paragraph 21.03 shall be paid in accordance with the rescheduled normal daily and weekly working hours so that such employees shall be paid time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of eight hours per day.
21.06	Time and one-half shall be paid for all hours worked on a Saturday. Double time shall be paid for all hours worked on a Sunday. Payments under this paragraph are premiums for working on Saturday or Sunday and if an employee works on either day and such work is

21.09	Shift premium shall be paid only for
actual hours worked and no overtime or premi-
— 40 —
um shall be calculated thereon. Article 21.08
shall not be interpreted so as to pyramid the
shift premium in addition to overtime rates paid to employees working overtime in conjunction with their regularly scheduled shift.
