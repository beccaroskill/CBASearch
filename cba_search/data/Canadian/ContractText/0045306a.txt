The Company and the Union agree that when certain provisions of the Collective Agreement are perceived to be barriers to the general mobility of members of the Target Groups within the work force, then such provisions may be suspended or amended subject to mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
LABOUR RELATIONS COMMITTEE
The Company and the Union agree to set up a joint Labour Relations Committee to deal with, from time to time, matters of employee and employer concerns related to working conditions, and to provide for a forum to identify and discuss training and retraining potential needs. This process should enhance communications and co-operation in the work place between the employer, employee, and the Union.
Meetings are to be held on a monthly basis, if needed, and an agenda of items to be discussed should be prepared prior to a meeting to facilitate useful discussion and resolution of issues.
Terms of Reference for the Committee will be established by the Committee during the Committee’s initial meetings.
TRAINING & EDUCATION JOINT COMMITTEE
The Company agrees to establish a Joint Training & Education Committee with the Union to discuss education and training matters of mutual concern affecting employees of CSP Foods.
