For the purpose of this agreement, the copper bonus payable during the calendar quarter (the payment quarter) shall be determined by the average price of copper in Canadian dollars in the preceding calendar quarter (the measurement quarter).
141
/
The average price of copper in a measurement quarter shall be determined by averaging the average monthly copper price for each month in the measurement quarter as determined using the London Metal Exchange settlement quotation for copper as published in Platt's Metals Week under the heading "L.M.E. Settlement," converted to Canadian dollars using the average monthly U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate. The conversion to Canadian dollars will be made using the monthly average of the Bank of Canada's daily Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar closing rate. The average price of copper in Canadian dollars shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent.
Based upon the average price of copper in Canadian dollars in the measurement quarter, bonus payments, as a percentage increase to the base rate shall be payable for the payment quarter to the following schedule.
Average Copper Price:
$1.27 Cdn. or greater $1.26 $1.25 $1.24 $1.23 $1.22
Bonus Payment:
+6%
+5%
+4%
+3%
+2%
+ 1%
The above bonus payment calculation shall be applied to all wage dependent earnings of all
142
bargaining unit employees during the measurement quarter. Any funds payable under this plan will be allocated to the purchase of improved pension benefits under the Highland Valley Copper Pension Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees. (the "Plan").
Specifically, when the total cumulative copper bonus is at least equal to $2,300,000 the normal form of pension in the Plan will change from joint and survivor pension with a survivor benefit of 50% to joint and survivor pension with a survivor benefit of 60%. The Plan will be amended to adopt this improvement. After such amendment, the cumulative copper bonus shall be reduced by $2,300,000. This benefit improvementwill be effective as of the start date of the payment quarter in which the cumulative copper bonus from the measurement quarter reaches $2,300,000. Any employees who retire during the payment quarter shall be eligible to receive a joint and survivor pension at 60 per cent.
Thereafter, each $2,400,000 increase in the total cumulative copper bonus shall increase the monthly rate of lifetime pension, for past and future service by $1. The Plan shall be amended to increase the life time benefit for past and future service. The monthly rate of lifetime pension shall be increased by the greatest multiple of $1 allowable such that the value of the increase does not exceed the cumulative copper bonus. After such amendment, the
143
cumulative copper bonus shall be reduced by $2,400,000. These benefit improvements will be effective as of the start date of the payment quarter in which the cumulative copper bonus from the measurement quarter reaches $2,400,000. Any employees who retire during the payment quarter shall receive the amended pension amount.
Such amendments shall occur no more frequently than quarterly.
At September 30, 2006, any then remaining cumulative copper bonus shall be used to increase the amount of lifetime pension. For each $2,400,000 in the cumulative copper bonus, the lifetime pension will increase by $1 for past and future service. The amount of increase shall be such that the value of the increase equals the remaining cumulative copper bonus, even if such calculation results in an increase that is not in a whole dollar increment. The plan will be amended to incorporate this increase in the benefit level.
A quarterly statement will be provided to the union on the status of the copper bonus account and this will also be subject to an annual review by the Partnerships external auditors.

HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
The company and the union agree that this Human Rights Policy deals with and applies only to allegations that an employee has been subject to discrimination (which includes personal and sexual harassment) because of a protected category(s) of the Human Rights Code. The parties undertake to educate their principals as to the correct interpretation and application of this policy.

HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
PREAMBLE:
The objective of the Human Rights Policy is to ensure that all employees of Highland Valley Copper are assured of a work environment that is free of all forms of discrimination, including personal and sexual harassment. By introduction of this policy, it is the intention of Highland Valley Copper to ensure proper work place behavior and that the treatment of individuals is fair and equitable and in full compliance with all applicable Human Rights Legislation as well as Section 14 of the Mines Act and Article 1.01 (c) of the Collective Agreement.
The Human Rights Code of the Province of British Columbia protects individuals from acts of discrimination with respect to employment, or any term or condition of employment because of a person's race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age of that person or because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offense that is unrelated to the employment or the intended employment of that person.
173
DEFINITIONS:
Discrimination:
Discrimination is to treat a person differently because of that person's race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age, or because of a criminal or summary conviction that is unrelated to the employment or intended employment.
Harassment:
Harassment is a form of discrimination and therefore a violation of the Human Rights Code. Harassment may be direct or indirect. When Harassment is indirect, it results in a work environment that is considered to be "Poisoned". The work environment may be poisoned by crude language, sexist or racist remarks, unwelcome jokes and cartoons, nude or semi-nude pictures, displaying of racist or bigoted pictures or materials or other unwelcome conduct that creates an uncomfortable or hostile work environment for one or more employees.
Personal Harassment:
Personal Harassment, means any conduct that is unwelcome or that ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome and includes, but is not limited to, vexatious comments or conduct, jokes, insults, threats, cartoons,
174
innuendo, or refusal to talk or work with a person for reason(s) that relate to any protected category of the Human Rights Code.
Sexual Harassment:
Sexual Harassment has been defined by the Supreme Court of Canada as any conduct of a sexual nature that is known or ought to be known to be unwelcome. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favours, unwelcome remarks of a sexual nature, jokes about a person's body or sexual orientation, taunting, repeated unwelcome requests for dates, touching or brushing against, hugging, kissing, patting, grabbing, pinching, and displaying sexually oriented printed material or pictures.

175
Managers and Supervisors:

2.	Prepare and maintain a written record of the dates, approximate times, nature of the unwelcome behavior and witnesses, if any.
3.	Record the incident(s) in writing and file the allegation with their immediate Supervisor, Department Manager, Industrial Relations, or Union Civil Rights Committee Representative.

177
3.	Tell the harasser that their conduct is inappropriate and a violation of the Human Rights Policy.

Remember that harassment is a violation of the law and is a serious matter. Implementation of this policy does not prohibit employees from reporting incident(s) to the Provincial Human Rights Tribunal.

1.	Assure the complainant that an objective examination of the allegation will be undertaken immediately.

If, in the opinion of the Manager, the allegation should be further pursued, he will appoint an internal or an external investigator. The above procedure does not preclude an employee from filing a formal complaint with the Human Rights Tribunal.

SUBJECT	CONTRACTING OUT
PROCEDURES
In an effort to improve communications and increase the effectiveness of the contracting out committee the parties agree to implement the following procedures.
Long Term Projects
Develop and maintain a project list which will allow for:
• A preview involving the project originator, Company and Union contracting out representatives and at times a consultant. The preview will involve discussions as to the nature of the work to be performed, involvement of Highland Valley Copper employees in the project prior to the contractor (vendor) being chosen, the approximate number of contractor employees, the number of days they will be employed and their union affiliation.
188
•	The issue of a preview number if the work or a portion of the work is to be contracted out
•	The issue of a contracting out notice
•	Project updates
•	The tender of the project if contracting out is required
At times the vendor will not have been chosen prior to the issue of contracting out notice. However, the Union agrees this will not be a problem as the union has participated in the preview process.
Unplanned Work Where Contractincl Out May be Required
When a situation arises where unplanned work is necessary and will require contracting out the following procedures will be followed:
•	The staff employee responsible for the work will contact his Company contracting out representative and provide him with all details
Then the Company contracting out representative, will inform the Union representative about the unplanned work. If he is unable to make contact with a member of the Contracting Out Committee, he will inform the Contracting Out Chairman. If he is unable to make contact, he will call the Union President and failing to contact him, will
189
notify the Contracting Out Chairman via e-mail.
•	The representative will inform the person he has contacted of details of the unplanned work, when it will occur, who will be doing the work, what manpower, skills, equipment and facilities will be involved.
The representative will then ensure that a Contracting Out Incident is issued.
Contracting Out Committee Meetings
Contracting out meetings will follow a regular agenda profile. Both Company and Union contracting out representatives will review issues prior to meeting and come prepared to discuss contracting out issues. The parties will:
•	Update the projects list
•	Review contracting out projects
•	Prepare a plan on how and what to communicate to Highland Valley Copper employees regarding contracting out matters, (i.e., advertise successes etc)
•	Where there is a dispute the parties will make every effort to resolve the issue through open discussion and all members will participate.

SUBJECT	VALLEY PIT STABILIZATION
PROJECT
During bargaining the company identified a project called the "Valley Pit Stabilization Project". The company advised the Union that without this project mine life will be shorter than planned. The Company indicated that this project will require more employees than what the current mine plan calls for. The Company acknowledged they currently have no firm numbers as to how many additional employees would be required to complete the project.
Therefore, the Union agrees to meet with the company when the company decides to proceed with the "Valley Pit Stabilization Project". Among other issues that may be considered by the parties, the Union may grant the company relief from the limitations contained in the letter of understanding on, "Recall of laid off employees to do Contract Work", and the restraints contained in the agreement on pre-approved notices on contracting out.

SUBJECT	PAINTING IN MILL
DEPARTMENT

2.	Employees working in a modified duty capacity in other operating departments and
259
whose rehabilitation and work hardening program does not preclude the physical demands of the assignment.
3.	Suitable candidate(s) currently employed in the Modified Work Centre.
4.	Mill Operations employees in accordance with department seniority.
Modified duty employees assigned to painting in the Mill will remain at the hourly rate last held immediately prior to the accommodation. Employees painting as provided in item #4 above will be paid at wage grade 7.

SUBJECT	BACKUP LISTS - MINE
OPERATIONS
1.	In addition to the backup lists as set out in Article 22.24, there is established a Shovel, Rotary Drill and Cableman Operators' backup list. The Shovel Operators, Rotary Drill Operators and Cableman have designated their preferred position should their equipment not be operable due to mechanical difficulty or the Company choosing not to operate that piece of equipment. Each operator must choose either Dozer, Grader, F.E.L. or Cableman so long as they are qualified. Otherwise, their alternate operating assignment will be Haul Truck Driver. Any new Shovel Operator, Rotary Drill Operator or Cableman shall make their choice upon being awarded the new position.
2.	In the event a backup operator is required, a selection will be made from the crew's backup lists. If the senior operator is
274
selected from the Shovel Operator, Drill Operator or Cableman list he will operate that piece of equipment until his regular equipment is available. Should the backup operator be selected from the trained backup operators list as referred to in Article 22.24, the employee next in line on that list in accordance with Article 22.25 will be required to take that position for the remainder of the shift. Such employee shall remain in that position as long as the equipment is operable and shall otherwise be assigned as a Haul Truck Driver.
3.	A Blaster Operator or Equipment Operator, who successfully bids from a dayshift position onto a trained operators list, pursuant to Article 22.24, which requires an assignment to a continuous shift schedule, shall receive the requisite training and subsequently be assigned to that shift as a truck driver until he moves up in his line of progression or successfully bids on another position.
4.	If a full time operator's position becomes available, the position will be offered to the most senior employee on the backup list for that classification. If the vacancy is on another shift, the employee may refuse the promotion. If the vacancy is on the same shift, the most senior employee on the trained backup operators list on that shift must accept the job.

SUBJECT	EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION
OF OVERTIME MINE OPERATIONS
The parties agree that there have been times when the amount of overtime available in Mine Operations has gone well beyond that which is normally available on an "Incidental Overtime" basis. At times Mine Operations has had to introduce "Campaign Overtime" measures.
Incidental Overtime;
Is available when there is a need to work overtime to cover for budgeted manpower levels. Examples of this are when there are manpower shortages because employees are away from work due to sickness, leave of absence, weekly indemnity, long term disability, vacation etc.
Campaign Overtime;
Is available when the budgeted manpower level does not enable the mine to meet production requirements. An example of this is when the
277
planned strip ratio can not be maintained and waste removal falls behind. This will require the mine to operate more than the budgeted amount of trucks resulting in an abnormal amount of overtime.
The following procedures will be implemented in order to ensure the equitable distribution of overtime during times when it is necessary to apply "Campaign Overtime" measures.
PROftFDURF - "CAMPAIGN OVERTIME
MEASURES"
•	The Superintendent of Mine Operations or his designate will inform the Union President or his designate prior to applying "Campaign Overtime" measures.
•	All Mine Operation employees who are qualified to drive truck will be eligible for this overtime.
•	The "Incidental Overtime" hours worked will be included with the "Campaign Overtime" hours worked to ensure that all overtime hours worked are balanced as equitably as possible.
•	The parties will meet with representatives from Mine Operations and arrange a method of recording the overtime hours worked and the distribution of the overtime that is in the
278
spirit of Article 13.12 (a) and (b) of the C.E3.A.
• Campaign overtime will not be put into effect
in the event of that truck drivers have been
put in motion and have not been recalled.
