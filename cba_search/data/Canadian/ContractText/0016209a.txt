The purpose of this information is to define the employee's functional abilities or restrictions, and is not intended to provide a diagnosis such that the privacy of the employee is compromised. The Reportwill providethe physicianwith the opportunity to indicate any concerns or conditions relative to the employees abilities to return to the work site. In the event the physician recommends modified work, the following steps will apply:
>	The Report is to be provided to the Company, either by fax or mail, prior to the employee returning to the work site with the employee maintaining a copy of the form.
>	The company in consultationwith the Union Disability Management Representative (or his/her alternate) will review the form noting any concerns by the physician. If modified work is recommended, the employee will be contactedand appropriate arrangements made.
