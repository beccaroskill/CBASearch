10.02	SENIORITY ZONE
(a)	Seniority shall be plant wide. An employee transferred to another
18
department shall retain his original seniority date. Seniority lists will be revised after signing of this Agreement and every three (3) months thereafter. Copies of the lists will be posted on the corresponding departmental bulletin boards and copies will also be given to the Chairperson of the Grievance Committee. If an employee does not challenge his seniority as stated on the seniority list within ten (10) employee working days after the list is posted, then that statement shall be deemed correct. Protests with respect to alleged inaccuracies in the seniority lists shall be initiated at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
(b)	A plant-wide and a departmental seniority list shall be posted and a copy given to the Chairperson of the grievance Committee within five working days of each layoff and recall.

Any disciplinary action against a probationary employee including, without limitation, warnings, suspensions, demotions and discharge, shall be deemed absolutely to be for just cause. The Company, in its absolute discretion may terminate the employment of any probationary employee at any time with or without notice or pay in lieu of notice. The probationary period may be extended by the duration of any leave of absence granted during that period and may be extended by mutual agreement in writing between the Company and the Union.
A new employee, during his probationary period but no later than upon completion of his probationary period, will be assigned by the Company to a job classification which has not been filled through the job posting procedure. The Company will inform the Local Chairperson of any such assignments, in writing, within five (5) working days.
19
10.04 LOSS OF SENIORITY
An employee shall lose all seniority when he:
(a)	voluntarily quits his employment with the Company or retires.
(b)	is discharged and is not reinstated through the grievance procedure or arbitration.
(c)	is off work for a continuous period of twenty-four (24) months or the length of the employee's seniority, whichever is shorter, except when a leave of absence has been granted.
(d)	fails to accept recall when given notice of recall, or fails to report to work within five (5) days of accepting recall, unless a reason acceptable to the Company (such as a 2 week notice to a current employer) is given and a leave of absence procedure invoked.
(e)	fails to return to work upon termination of authorized leave of absence, unless a reason acceptable to the Company is given.
(f)	accepts gainful employment while on leave of absence without first obtaining the consent of the Company in writing.
(g)	fails to notify the Company of his absence for a period of three (3) consecutive working days unless his reason for such lack of notification is beyond his control.
10.05	EMPLOYEE ADDRESS
It shall be the duty of each employee to notify the Company promptly of any change in address. Notice required to be given by the company shall be deemed to be given if forwarded to the employee at the last address of which the Company had notice. The Local Chairperson will be notified when the Company has failed to contact an employee for recall or other seniority related items.
20
10.06	SHORT LAYOFFS
Short layoffs may be invoked as the result of a breakdown of equipment, accident, or other events outside the control of the Company.
Should a short layoff exceed more than twenty-four (24) hours, an employee affected by such a layoff may exercise his seniority as set out in the following order.
(a)	By taking the layoff or by displacing the most junior employee within his departmental shift, provided he is capable of performing the required work efficiently, or,
(b)	If the employee is not able to exercise his seniority as stated above he shall;
(i)	Displace the most junior employee in another department on the same shift in a group level (4) job for which he has previously qualified, or a group level (3) job for which he has previously qualified, or a group level
(2)	job for which he has previously qualified, or;
(ii)	Displace the most junior employee in a group level I job, provided he is capable of performing the required work efficiently.
Once the layoff expires, the employee affected by the layoff must return to his prior job classification.
10.07	EXTENDED LAYOFFS AND BUMPING
(a)	The Company will give the Union one (1) week notice in writing of its intent to lay off if the layoff is to exceed five (5) consecutive working days. The Company will provide the initial employee being laid off the same one (1) week notice of the layoff in his classification. This does not apply to an employee who is subsequently laid off as a result of having been bumped by a more senior employee.
(b)	Foremost, those employees with seniority who remain must be capable of performing the required work efficiently.
21
(c)	Employees with seniority shall not be required to leave the plant through the layoff procedure while employees without seniority remain in the plant except where such employee holds a skilled trades job classification.
(d) (i)	When a layoff occurs, an employee shall exercise his bumping rights as
he previously set out. The employee shall have the right to choose the order he will bump into jobs which he previously qualified in through job postings, previous bumps, temporary transfers (umbrella jobs) and recalls. If an employee gains any job to which he is entitled to bump the employee has the right to rearrange his list, otherwise any new job will become the first possible bump.
(ii) If such employee, because of his seniority, cannot exercise his bumping rights as set out in (i) above, and where such employee is not the most junior employee in the plant, he shall bump the most junior employee working in a group level four (4) classification first. If there are no junior employees to be displaced in a group level four (4) job classification then the employee will bump the most junior employee in a group level three
(3)	classification. This bumping process will continue in sequential order until the employee has displaced a junior employee. An employee exercising this bumping right will not be permitted to select a bumping preference based on group level or job classification. The sequential bumping order will be strictly adhered to. An employee exercising this right must be able to show that he will be able to do the job within the qualifying time or be disqualified. An employee if he desires may voluntarily take the layoff by advising the Company in writing within one day of notice of layoff and will be placed on general recall status.

To become qualified for a position an employee must satisfactorily complete the qualifying time as set out in job postings or a qualifying time mutually agreed between the Union and the Company. Should an employee be displaced from a job by reason of layoff, bumping or recall, before completion of the qualifying time, the employee will be entitled to have recall to the position. Any remaining qualifying period, training, and wage progression movement shall resume upon recall to the position.
22
(e)	The right to bump shall be confined to those employees who have completed their probationary period.
(f)	The onus is on an employee to be aware of his bumping rights and it is agreed that the Company will not be liable to an employee or his Union for an employee failing to exercise his proper bumping rights. However, when requested, the Company will assist an employee in determining his bumping right.
(g)	In the case of a reduction, an employee affected by a layoff may elect to take the layoff if he is in a skilled trades classification or in the case where an employee has a bona fide medical reason and is unable to perform work which is available and such reason is acceptable to the Company.
10.08	RECALL PROCEDURE
Recall from a layoff or displacement shall be based on the following:
(a)	For a group 5 or higher job, it is understood that, a vacancy shall be filled first by the most senior displaced or laid off employee who is qualified to do the job. Once the total of laid off positions have been recalled in a job classification, any further vacancies shall be posted.
(b)	For a group 4 or lower job, it is understood that, a vacancy shall be filled first by either the senior displaced employee from that job classification or the most senior employee on layoff from the plant, whoever is most senior. Once the total of laid off positions have been recalled in a job classification, any further vacancies shall be posted.
(c)	A Skilled Trades employee shall remain on layoff and will be recalled only to his skilled trades job classification when it becomes available or will be placed on general recall status if advised in writing at the time of lay off.
(d)	An employee exercising this right must be able to show that he will be able to do the job within the qualifying time or be disqualified.
23
10.09	ADVANCE APPLICATIONS FOR POSTINGS
(a)	If an employee wishes to be considered for the next vacancy which may occur in any job classification, he may make written application to the Human Resource Department using the prescribed form. The Company will forward a copy to the Union President and will maintain the application on file until the end of each calendar year or until the employee is awarded the job or he asks, in writing, for this application to be removed, whichever occurs first. When a vacancy occurs in the job classification sought, he is assured of consideration along with any others who may have applied by that method or through the normal job posting procedure and will be required to take the job classification if awarded as in 10.10(a).
(b)	Employees who have such a request filed with the Human Resource Department and are awarded the position must return to work within four
(4)	months from the date of the posting. If the employee cannot return to work or does not return to work within the four month period the position will be awarded to the employee next in line who qualifies.
10.10	PROMOTION AND JOB POSTING
(a)	Posting of Permanent Job Vacancies
All present and newly created hourly-rated permanent vacancies within the bargaining unit shall be posted on the Company bulletin board, with an up-to-date job description, for six (6) calendar days, which shall exclude holidays and plant shutdowns, to give employees with qualifications and seniority ample time to apply in writing. Employees are required to submit separate applications when applying for more than one job posting and must indicate their preference (e.g. first, second, third, etc.). The successful applicant for a posted vacancy will be obliged to take the job when awarded a job posting.
Qualifying experience or skill as stated in the job posting will be reasonable and consistent with requirements of the job classification.
24
(b) Awarding of Job Postings
The Company shall fill all job vacancies based upon plant seniority only, when awarding job postings to current group level 6 jobs and lower with the exception of Lab Tech. II - Dyehouse and Q.P.C. Tech. I. However, tests may be required for reasons of safety and colour blindness. All tests written and passed within a twenty-four (24) month period shall not have to be rewritten.
(c)	Special Skill Job Vacancies

(ii)	Positions recognized as Specialized Classifications will be filled as per Appendix “B”.”
(d)	Transfer to New Job
The Company will be able to temporarily transfer employees or hire new employees to fill a job vacancy that cannot be filled immediately by the successful applicant because of training requirements, leave of absence, medical leaves or vacations in the job classification of the successful applicant. This period shall not exceed twenty-one (21) calendar days, unless mutually agreed upon in writing by the Company and the Union. Wage progression (Article 19.02) shall start when the job is awarded.
(e)	Failing to Qualify
An employee failing to become qualified for the new job will be returned to the job from which he was promoted.
(f)	Accommodation of a disability
Before awarding a job posting, the Company and Union will consider the accommodation of any employees who are off work as a result of an occupational
25
disability.
(g)	Job Posting for Permanent (Non-Rotating) Shifts
Job postings will be identified by shift vacancy, and posting will be open to all employees, including employees currently in the classification on other shifts.
The job will be awarded in accordance with 10.10 (b). If the successful applicant is currently in the classification on another shift then the employee will be moved to fill the vacancy as per 10.10 (d) and the vacancy created by that move will be then posted and identified by shift vacancy.
10.11	PROMOTION RESTRICTIONS
The only restriction on employees being awarded a job posting within the plant shall be that an employee who has been awarded a job posting is prohibited from posting to another job for one (1) month plus the waiting time period stated in Article 10.10 (d), to a maximum of fifty-two (52) days. This restriction period shall not apply if the job posting has been identified by the employee as his first choice on a previously submitted Advance Application For Postings Form as prescribed under 10.09 (a).

The Company will endeavour to fill staff vacancies by promotion or transfer of existing Company employees drawn either from outside or within the bargaining unit, subject to management judgement of suitability.
26
10.14	TRANSFER OUT OF UNIT
(a)	In the event that an employee within the bargaining unit has been promoted or transferred to a position beyond the scope of this Agreement and within one year is returned by Management to a position within the scope of this Agreement, he shall retain all seniority he had previously acquired and shall have added thereto the seniority accumulated while serving outside the bargaining unit. This one year period shall be accumulative. Such an employee shall retain his job rights for this one year period.
(b)	In the event that an employee within the bargaining unit has been promoted or transferred to a position beyond the scope of this Agreement for more than one year but less than two years is returned by Management to a position within the scope of this Agreement, he will be laid off and will be subject to recall based on the seniority accumulated prior to the promotion or transfer.
(c)	The Company shall advise the Union in writing of the name of any employee within the bargaining unit who is promoted or transferred by the Company to a position beyond the scope of this Agreement and the date in which the promotion or transfer occurred.
10.15	TEMPORARY TRANSFERS
(a)	Where a temporary transfer of an employee to a job classification is necessary to effect proper and efficient operation of the plant, the Company will give preference by seniority to employees within the shift and department affected to fill the immediate job vacancy and subsequent job vacancies.
Temporary transfers will be made by giving the senior employee occupying a job classification within the departmental shift concerned preference provided he makes his desire known to his Supervisor and that he has the knowledge and ability to do the job without any further training. If a senior employee does not indicate preference to be temporarily transferred, the Company will temporarily transfer the least senior employee from within the departmental shift who has the
27
knowledge and ability to do the job without any further training. The Company must use all available qualified employees within the department before making temporary transfers from outside of the department.
(b)	The employee transferred shall receive the higher of his current rate or the rate of the job to which he is transferred, as outlined in the wage schedule. He shall be considered to be in his regular job classification for the purpose of overtime distribution during such time as he fills the temporary job. The temporary transferred employee shall be asked for overtime in the temporary transferred job after everyone in the classification is considered. Upon completion of such temporary transfer period, the transferred employee shall be returned to his previous job.
(c)	Temporary transfers shall be limited to a maximum of seven (7) calendar days except where such transfer is caused by a leave of absence, a medical leave, vacation or training, in which case the temporary transfer may continue for the duration of the absence.
(d)	The Company shall provide the Union with a list of all temporarily transferred employees if the temporary transfer is to exceed seven (7) calendar days.
(e)	Time spent in training as per Article 10.16 (a) or when assigned out of classification shall not be considered “qualifying time” for any position.
10.16	TRAINING PROGRAMS
(a)	Training for Temporary Transfers
When training programs for job classifications within the bargaining unit are implemented it is understood that employees may be trained under the following guidelines:
1)	Opportunities for training shall be posted within the department and shall be awarded to the most senior applicant(s) in the department. If there is an insufficient number of employees to fill the opportunities, the Company may require the most junior employee(s) in the
28
department to be trained.
2)	When a permanent classification vacancy exists it shall be posted and filled in accordance with Article 10.10- Promotion and Job Posting.
3)	Employees trained for temporary transfers may be assigned to positions as per Article 10.15 (a) and the duration of such assignments shall be in accordance with Article 10.15 (c).
4)	Employees who are trained for temporary transfers shall retain ownership of their original classification.
5)	Rates of pay and overtime for employees trained for temporary transfers assigned out of their classification shall be governed by Article 10.15 (b).
(b)	The Company and the Union agree to establish and maintain a Joint Training Committee. The purpose and mandate of the Joint Training Committee will be to identify the specific training required to develop the necessary skills, qualifications and competencies for employees in each classification. The Joint Training Committee will also be mandated to oversee the development of training programs and to review and assess the success of these programs.
The Joint Training Committee shall consist of an equal number of members from the Union and the Company. The Joint Training Committee shall meet once every month or more often as may be required.
(c)	Training required to perform job duties or for health and safety purposes shall normally occur during an employee’s regular work schedule. If such training occurs outside an employee’s regular work schedule time spent will be paid at the applicable overtime rate.

(c)	If there is more than one shift rotation working (i.e. 12 and 8 hour rotating shifts) in any job classification, the senior employees in the job classification affected shall have the right to choose which shift rotation they will work on.
10.18	STUDENT EMPLOYEES
It is understood that the Company will first temporarily recall an employee who is laid off from the plant to fill in for temporary increases in production requirements, vacations and other absences before hiring a student employee. When the Company deems it necessary, it may hire and train student employees for Group Level five (5) or lower to fill in for temporary increases in production requirements, vacations or other absences. These employees will pay Union Dues and be under the rules and regulations that apply to all employees but will not have seniority rights or rights to grievance procedures that normally are given to employees who have completed their probationary periods.

11.05	SICK LEAVE
Each employee will be granted two days of paid sick leave during the calendar year. Unused sick leave entitlement will be paid out at the end of the calendar year. Sick leave will be paid at the regular rate of pay without premiums, times the hours of the shift scheduled at the time of illness. Employees must have completed their probationary period before qualifying for this leave. Employees who terminate employment will be credited for one paid sick day for each period of six months of employment completed within the calendar year and the final
32

33
(ii)	two weeks' notice in writing to the employee if his seniority is two years or more, but less than five years;
(iii)	four weeks' notice in writing to the employee if his seniority is five years or more, but less than ten years; and,
(iv)	eight weeks' notice in writing if the employee's seniority is ten years or more.
Alternatively, the Company may give notice in writing and pay the employee an amount equal to the pay to which he would have been entitled for work that would have been performed by him, at his regular rate, in a normal non-overtime work week for the appropriate period of notice as defined above.
12.02	COMPETITIVE POSITION AND WORKLOADS
The parties hereto recognize that, for the purpose of providing more efficient operations of the plant and thereby keeping the Company in a competitive position in the industry, it is necessary from time to time to:

12.03	JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
The Company will continue the established practice of determining relative wage rates. Before finalizing new or revised job descriptions covered by this Agreement, the Company agrees to discuss with the Union President or his nominee, the Local Chairperson and a Steward of the Department affected, the circumstances giving rise to the change.
The Union may request the Company to re-evaluate a job classification rate. Within ninety (90) days of a written request outlining reasons for the request, the Company will advise the Union of the result of the re-evaluation. This reevaluation will be signed by the individual who performed the re-evaluation. A job classification rate will not be reduced during the term of the Agreement as a result of a re-evaluation of a job classification requested by the Union.
ARTICLE 13 - HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME AND PREMIUMS
13.01 HOURS OF WORK
(a)	Eight (8) hours of work will constitute a work day and forty hours a work week for 5 day, 8 hour day work and 5 day, 8 hour shift work operations.
(b)	Twelve (12) hours of work will constitute a work day and 40 hours per week averaged over a one year period will constitute a work week for the 12 hour, 7 day work schedule.
(c)	Eight (8) hours of work will constitute a work day and 40 hours per week averaged over a one year period will constitute a work week for an 8 hour, 7 day work schedule.

35
(d)	12 hour weekend shifts will be paid an extra 4 hours pay at their regular
rate if scheduled to work a Saturday or Sunday. The weekend shift workers will work one other day during the week, which will be picked by mutual agreement between the individual employees and their supervisor.

An employee can only be made to work a maximum of sixty (60) hours in a week, a combination of regular hours plus voluntary and mandatory overtime. This would not prevent an employee from volunteering for more overtime hours should they choose to.
The Company may require that the maximum consecutive hours worked be exceeded in case of an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance. If the Company has to exceed the twelve (12) hour daily cap for extraordinary production requirements the Union shall receive notice a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours in advance. In such cases the employee will still receive a minimum of eight (8) hours of rest and will not lose pay on his following shift.

(b)	12 HOUR SHIFTS

On the week of 36 hours all hours will be paid at regular rate; on the week of 48 hours, 44 hours will be paid at regular rate and 4 hours at the rate of time and one half. It is agreed that absence during the 48 hour week will not eliminate the overtime hours so long as a minimum of 12 hours are worked in that week.
(d)	If an employee who has worked less than forty (40) regular hours in a week due to an unpaid absence works a sixth shift, he shall be paid on a straight time hourly basis for the equivalent number of hours of the unpaid absence except in the case of overtime worked in primetime as per Article 13.06.
37
13.06	OVERTIME RATES FOR PRIME TIME
(a)	For the 5-day, 8-hour day work and 5-day, 8-hour shift schedule, the employee will be paid at the rate of two (2) times his regular hourly rate for all authorized work between the hours of 4:00 p.m. Saturday and 4:00 p.m. Sunday.

A first day off will be considered a Saturday.
Second and subsequent days off the schedule will be considered to be Sunday.
13.07	OVERTIME AND RESCHEDULED SHIFTS
Overtime rate will not be paid for make-up or re-scheduling of shifts to suit the convenience of an employee or group of employees.
13.08	OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION
Overtime work in excess of the shift schedule in effect at any one time is intended to be on a voluntary basis provided adequate response is received. Overtime will be allocated on an equal opportunity basis and will be distributed as evenly as possible to those employees in the job classification for which overtime work is required, who are willing to work overtime, and who are qualified for the work required. Overtime will be offered to employees outside of the job classification within the department only after all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response within the job classification have been exhausted. After all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response has been exhausted, the Company reserves the right to schedule the employee with the lowest number of mandatory overtime credits, assuming the employee has not reached the maximum hours of work defined in Article 13.02.
It is understood that the distribution of overtime does not assume that each employee sharing overtime will at any given time have received the same number of overtime credits, but merely expresses a fundamental practice to keep such overtime as nearly in balance from time to time as is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
When the Company deems it necessary to have work performed on overtime the
38
following procedure will be used:
(a)	Overtime opportunities will be first offered to employees in the job classification who normally perform the work, commencing with the employee who has on record the least amount of overtime credits. An employee shall be recorded on the overtime list within his job classification as having worked the overtime when he has worked the overtime; when he is absent from work on his shift when overtime would have been offered to him; when he has been offered voluntary overtime and declines; when he is absent and, as a result of his absence, overtime is required, except when he is on vacation including the weekend (or designated weekend) continuous to the vacation, unless availability is made known beforehand; and when the Company is unable to contact the employee after reasonable attempts to do so.
(b)	After all reasonable attempts to obtain sufficient response by employees from within the job classification are exhausted, overtime opportunities will be offered to employees outside the job classification, within the department. Overtime worked by an employee outside his job classification shall be recorded with the overtime credits on the overtime list as having worked within his job classification. If such an employee declines an overtime opportunity outside his job classification, no overtime credits will be recorded.
(c)	If the balance of overtime hours among employees who normally share overtime work is not properly maintained because of an improper allocation and a grievance is filed, and as a result, an employee is found not to have had his fair share of overtime, the off-balance condition shall be identified and the affected employee shall be given the opportunity to work the improperly allocated overtime, when it is made available, at a time of his choosing.
If the improper allocation of overtime is found to be a result of deliberate or willful contravention of the provision, the employee(s) affected shall be compensated for the overtime lost at the applicable overtime rate.
(d)	The Company agrees to post separate overtime overtime lists showing overtime and mandatory credits of employees. Both of these lists will be revised each week and total credits on each list shall be carried forward from week to week. The hours will be reset to zero (0) on the main
39
overtime list at the start of each calendar year, the mandatory overtime list will be reset to zero (0) every three (3) months starting at the beginning of each calendar year. Each department within the plant will be consistent in the manner for which overtime credits are recorded.
(e)	Overtime credits will be recorded on the overtime list as follows: For example, eight (8) hours worked at time and one half will be recorded as twelve (12) credits and eight (8) hours worked at double time will be recorded as sixteen (16) credits. Mandatory overtime credits will be recorded on a separate list following the same calculation of credits.
(f)	An employee who is transferred from one job classification to another job classification through a job posting, bumping or recall , will, upon transfer, be credited with the average of the overtime credits in the job classification within the departmental shift to which he is transferred, except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(g)	An employee who is absent from work for one week or more, except when he is on vacation, will upon return to work, be credited with the average of the overtime credits in the job classification within the departmental shift to which he returns except when there is only one employee per shift in that classification in which case he will be averaged with those in the classification.
(h)	An employee on temporary transfer under Article 10.16 (b) shall be considered in his regular job classification for the purpose of overtime distribution.
(i)	When overtime credits are equal for all employees in a job classification the most senior employee will be asked first. When mandatory overtime credits are equal for all employees in a job classification, the most junior employee will be scheduled first. These procedures will continue until all employees in the job classification have established credits, at which point overtime will be awarded/scheduled as per previous sections of this Article.
(j)	Probationary or Student employees will be asked for overtime only after all employees in the job classification with seniority have been asked.
40
(k)	The difference in overtime credits should not exceed forty (40) hours.
(l)	If an employee is asked to change shifts, he shall be paid overtime if not off work for 24 hours before reporting for work on his new shift. This is not in effect if caused by a layoff as stated in Article 10.07.
13.09	OVERTIME BREAKS
An employee who has worked an eight (8) hour shift and is required to work overtime shall be allowed a ten (10) minute break before the start of his overtime work. If he is scheduled to work two hours or more of overtime, he shall be allowed a twenty (20) minute break prior to beginning his overtime work.
Subsequent breaks will follow the pattern of the department in which he is working.
13.10	OVERTIME LUNCH ALLOWANCE
An employee who is required to work more than two (2) hours of overtime as an extension of his shift will be entitled to a seven dollar ($7.00) lunch voucher. Such lunch vouchers shall be redeemable at the plant cafeteria for food and/or beverage and shall have no cash value. When a lunch voucher is given at a time when the plant cafeteria is not open, that voucher shall be redeemable for cash.
13.11	CALL IN
(a)	If an emergency arises whereby an employee is recalled without prior notice to come to work after his scheduled shift, he will be paid a minimum of four (4) hours pay at his regular rate or for the actual time worked prior to the commencement of his next shift, at the applicable overtime rate, whichever is greater.

Specialized Classification Training Program Appendix “B”
A.	Purpose
The purpose of the Specialized Classification Training Program (“Training Program”) is to provide employees with the training and competencies required for specialized classifications at Crossley Carpet Mills in a consistent and effective manner.
B.	General Principles
-	The Joint Training Committee will define the period of training and the training content for each specialized classification.
-	It is understood that this Training Program is dynamic and can be modified to reflect new training requirements.
-	It is understood that while the Joint Training Committee can recommend Training Program content and changes to the Training Program, the final decision on these matters is the sole responsibility of the Company.
C.	Specialized Classifications Defined
Specialized classifications are jobs that require a specific skill set and/or training not readily available in the internal or external workforce. The following are considered specialized classifications:
-	Tufting Specialist
-	Technician - Yarn Mill
-	Technical Specialist - CMF
-	Lab Tech I
-	Latex Operator I
-	Repair Inspector/Mending Leadhand
It is recognized that this list can be modified to reflect changing Company needs. It is agreed that this list may only be modified by recommendation from the Joint Training Committee (refer to Section D). The Company must approve any changes to the above list recommended by the Joint Training Committee before these changes will take effect.
63
D. Joint Training Committee
The Joint Training Committee (“Committee”) will be comprised of an equal number of Company and Union representatives not to exceed four (4) from each group. The Committee will meet once every six (6) weeks unless otherwise agreed. The Committee’s responsibilities will be:
-	Recommend the training course period, content, curriculum, and syllabus for each classification listed in Section C.
-	Ensure each prospective candidate for the Training Program is given a full understanding of the candidate’s responsibilities, obligations, and benefits when entering the Training Program.
-	Accept or reject applicants for the Training Program subject to final approval by the Human Resources Department of the Company.
-	Hear and decide on questions involving employees that relate to their participation in the Training Program.
-	Offer constructive suggestions for the improvement of training on the job.
-	Review the supervisor’s monthly report on each employee in the Training Program.
E.	Application and Entry
Employees interested in enrolling in the Training Program will submit an application to the Human Resources Department.
i)	Testing
The Committee may determine that applicants must write and pass test(s) as part of the application process. These tests must be relevant to the classification and must be reviewed and recommended by the Committee before being used in the application process. The Committee will review all test results before making a recommendation concerning an applicant’s potential entry into the Training Program.
ii)	Training Agreement
Once an employee has been selected to enter the Training Program, he or she will sign a Training Agreement developed by the Committee and approved by the Company. The Agreement will include:
64
-	A statement of the employee’s duties and responsibilities in regards to participating in the Training Program.
-	A syllabus of the training, including courses, length of the Training Program, etc.
-	A list of related training costs (e.g. academic course fees) that will be paid for by the Company, provided that certain conditions are met.
-	A statement where the employee agrees to a commitment to remain in the classification he or she was trained in for a minimum period of time after the Training Program has concluded.
-	A statement outlining the implications if the conditions of the Training Agreement are not fulfilled (e.g. reimbursing the Company for course fees).
F.	Supervision of Trainees
Employees in the Training Program will be under the direction of the supervisor of the department to which they are assigned.
The Chairperson, or an individual charged with this responsibility in consultation with the Committee, will prepare adequate record forms to be filled in by the supervisor under whom the trainee receives direction, instruction and experience. Supervisors will make a report at least every thirty (30) days to the Chairperson on the work and progress of the trainee under their supervision. These reports will be submitted to the Committee for review.
G.	Academic Training
Trainees may be required as a condition of their training to receive and attend classroom instructions at a technical or similar school. The Company shall assume all costs for tuition, books, and other classroom-related costs.
H.	Hours of Work
Trainees will work the same hours and be subject to the same conditions regarding overtime rates as other hourly employees working for the Company. In the case a trainee is required to work overtime, he or she will receive credit on the term of training for only the actual hours of work.
I.	Wages
For all Specialized Classification the trainee will be paid as per the wage progression
65
outlined in the Collective Agreement. Hours spent in classroom instruction shall not be considered hours of work in computing overtime.
J.	Completion of Training
At the conclusion of the trainee’s training, the Committee must be satisfied that the trainee has successfully completed all aspects of his or her curriculum and has obtained the skills and competencies required to perform in the classification trained for. If the Committee is satisfied, the trainee will then be awarded the position he or she trained for once a position becomes available in the classification.
