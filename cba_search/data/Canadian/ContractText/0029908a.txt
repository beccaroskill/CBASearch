Night shift	11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.
A job will belong to the shift within which the majority of its regular hours fall.
When a job's starting time is changed, the employees in the department who work on the shift in which the job originally belonged will be canvassed in order of seniority to determine who will work at the new starting time.
Should a senior employee accept the new starting time, the process will be repeated until all starting times on that shift have been assigned.

New employees shall be on probation and shall not acquire any seniority rights until they have accumulated sixty (60) days worked, provided these days have been accumulated within six (6) calendar months. In the event that an employee is absent due to a work related injury, this six (6) months period will be extended by the number of days missed due to the work related injury.

In the latter case, seniority shall be the determining factor provided the senior operator, after a reasonable time to qualify, is capable of doing work performed by an employee with less seniority except where immediate, essential qualifications are necessary for the efficient operation of the plant. In such cases, the Company will discuss the matter with the Union.
In cases of increases in the working forces, rehiring shall be in the reverse order to that of layoffs. The Company shall advise the Union when a layoff is about to take place, and shall give the Union a list of employees to be laid off or rehired. In the cases where it is necessary to secure workers in less time than required notice, the Company, if unable to make contact with the senior eligible employee may recall the next senior employee and so on down the list until the vacancies are filled. However, should the senior employee subsequently report within the required time, he shall be given the work for which the next senior employee was recalled.
In case of layoff, other than in the event of emergencies herein referred to, employees shall be given one (1) working day’s notice for every, complete six (6) months seniority, with a minimum notice of two (2) working days.
