The Notice will contain the nature of the job, the shift, the qualifications required and the rate of pay. An employee who wishes to be considered for the position so posted shall signify his desire by signing his name to the posting indicating his department and his qualifications for the job.
18.02	In filling any posted vacancy under this Article, the Employer will consider the training, skill and ability of the applicants to perform the work in question and where these are relatively equal seniority shall govern. If the job is not filled as a result of the posting, the Employer reserves the right to hire.
18.03	There will be a maximum of three (3) postings for a vacancy — the original posting to fill the vacancy and two (2) subsequent postings for the vacancies created by successful applicants. Any
37
further vacancy that occurs after the second subsequent posting may be filled by the Employer without posting. Should the successful applicant to a posting be unsatisfactory, he shall be returned to his former job and the vacancy may be filled without further posting.

ARTICLE 19
BASE CLASSIFICATION RECALL PRIVILEGE
19.01	For the purpose of administering these provisions base classification is defined as:
(a)	the classification to which an employee was originally a successful applicant through the job posting procedure subject to the limitation in item 2 of this provision, or
(b)	the classification into which an employee is permanently assigned if the employee did not obtain the classification through the job posting procedure.
39
An employee will have one (1) base classification at any time.
19.02	A seniority employee who is removed from his base classification for an indefinite period of time due to a shortage of work and is employed in another classification will retain recall privileges to the base classification in the same department and shift for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months or a time equivalent to the employee’s seniority from the date the employee was originally removed from the classification, whichever is greater. When base recall privileges are exercised the Employer is not required to implement the job posting procedure.
19.03	An employee will forfeit base classification recall privileges when:
(a)	The employee becomes a successful applicant to another classification through the job posting procedure in which case the new classification becomes the base classification.
(b)	the employee does not exercise base classification recall privileges when so offered in which case the classification to which the employee is presently assigned becomes the base classification.
40
(c)	twelve (12) months or a time equivalent to the employee’s seniority have elapsed from the date of being removed from the base classification, whichever is greater, without being given an opportunity to exercise base classification recall privileges in which case the classification to which the employee is presently assigned becomes the base classification.
19.04	These provisions, in no way, are meant to alter the provisions for temporary transfers contained in the Collective Agreement.
ARTICLE 20
TEMPORARY TRANSFERS
20.01	The expression “temporary transfer” used in this clause shall mean the transfer for four hours or more of an employee from one classification to another by the Employer with the intention of returning the employee to his regular job classification as soon as practicable, but not in excess of ten (10) working days unless mutually agreed upon between the Union and the Employer. When an employee is temporarily transferred at the
41
employer's option and the rate of pay for the job classification to which the employee is transferred is higher than the rate for his regular classification, he shall be paid at least the next higher increment of the job to which he is temporarily transferred over his regular rate.
20.02	If an employee is transferred at the Employer's option from one job classification to another on a temporary transfer and if the rate of pay for the job classification to which the employee is temporarily transferred is lesser than his regular job classification, he shall be paid at his regular rate of pay consistent with other provisions contained in this Agreement.
20.03	If an employee is temporarily transferred in lieu of layoff at the employee's option to a job classification where the rate of pay is lesser than his regular job classification, he shall be paid the rate of the classification to which he is transferred unless specifically excepted by the Employer.

Mr. Roy Scott
International Representative Canadian Headquarters of the U.A.W.
205 Placer Court Willowdale. Ontario
Dear Mr. Scott:
During our recently concluded negotiations, we held several discussions on Article 11.07 of the Collective Agreement which reads as follows:
“Those promoted to positions not covered by this Agreement will retain their seniority after promotion and if transferred back into the bargaining unit, the time served in the non-bargaining position shall not be included in the seniority standing.”
The intent of this clause can be illustrated by the following example, Employee A is hired into a bargaining unit position on January 1, 1969. He is transferred into a non-bargaining unit position on January 1, 1971, where he remains until January 1, 1977, when he is returned to the bargaining
59
unit, On return to the bargaining unit, his seniority date would be January 1, 1975 rather than January 4, 1969, since his service outside the bargaining unit would not count for the purpose of the Collective Agreement. The employee in question could be returned to any bargaining unit vacancy that may exist, but normally would be returned to the classification from which he originally came, provided he is able to do the work available. In the event other seniority bargaining unit employees are on layoff at the time of the transfer of Employee A, the returning employee's revised seniority date would have to be considered in determining his eligibility to return to the bargaining unit since he would not be eligible to bump other more senior employees.
Sincerely,
D.R. Hancocks Personnel Manager

Mr. G. R. Scott International Representative C.A.W.
205 Placer Court Willowdale, Ontario M2H 3H9
Dear Roy:
As you may know, the Company has opened a Commercial Products operation at Oakville, which will take the place of the Brampton facility. Although the Oakville Commercial Products location is outside the jurisdiction and scope of our present Collective Agreement the Company intends to apply the Agreement to the location as it did in Brampton. This will avoid any conflict in the transferring of personnel between the two locations.
Our decision to apply the Collective Agreement is without prejudice and does
68
not in any way constitute voluntary recognition of the Union at any future facilities which Rubbermaid may open or acquire.
Yours truly,
Pat Twigg
Vice President, Human Resources c.c. A. Harvey
