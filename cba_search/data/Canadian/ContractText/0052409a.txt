Mr. Danny Gallant Business Manager B.C.T.G.M., Local 426 #218 - 1945 Dundas Street, E.
Mississauga, Ontario L4X 2T8
Dear Mr. Gallant:
During negotiations recently completed, the Company agreed to renew the following “Letters of Understanding”, which will expire upon expiration of the collective agreement on April 30, 2005.
Working Relationship
The Company, in recognizing the need to improve the relationship with the B.C.T.G.M. Union and its members, is prepared to agree to the following, during the life of the agreement.
•	The parties will work together on obtaining the help of an outside consultant who will lead us into a high performance workplace. This will enable the Lakeshore Bakery to pursue the Vision - “Lakeshore is to be a key strategic producer of baked goods ranking in the top percentile of the North American Bakeries, noted for quality, cost effectiveness, and flexibility, while embracing the latest managerial/leadership qualities”.
•	The Company and the Union agree on the need to solicit the help of a third party to lead the parties into the development of a labour-management partnership.
Joint Technology
The Company and the Union agree on the need to create a means through which they can mutually discuss the content and the implications of technological change at the Lakeshore Biscuit Plant. Both parties agree to the creation of a “Joint Technology Committee”(JTC) to accomplish these ends. The JTC shall be created no later than three (3) months following the signing of the new collective agreement. The JTC will be comprised of three (3) members of the union executive plus three (3) members of management.
•	New job classifications created as a result of technological change will be reviewed with the JTC committee.
§
•	It is recognized that highly skilled technical jobs may fall under the I.A.M. agreement, and that management may access information and will have the need to input data.
•	The Company agrees there will be no concerted effort to transfer bargaining unit work to management at the Lakeshore Biscuit Plant due to technology.
Part-time Employees
Employment of part-time employees will not result in a reduction in the regular complement of full-time employees. The Company agrees that if part-time employees are hired they will be employed to work in the E.H.&S. Departmentto provide services that can only be performed when production has ceased.
In the E.H.&S. Department the Company will use part-time employees to provide coverage on the Friday midnight shift if scheduled employees do not report for work. During the weekend in the E.H.&S. Department if there are insufficient volunteers for overtime, then the Company will use part-time employees. In the event that additional work is scheduled after overtime has been solicited, the work will be offered to the E.H.&S. employees before using part-time workers.
Shop Chairman
The Company will provide 4 hours per day for the Shop Chairman to conduct Union business covering issues pertaining to the Lakeshore bargaining unit.
The Company will provide an office for the exclusive use of the Shop Chairman to conduct Union business. The room will contain a desk, file cabinet and chairs.
Total Plant Shut-down
In the event of a total shut-down of one week or more, employees shall be retained to perform the available work throughout the plant on the basis of plant wide seniority and
