Dear Mr. Budgell,
Re:	Maximum Strip Widths in P.C.T.
The field layout procedures for this Company's P.C.T. operations involves the use of both strips (i.e. parallel ribboned lines) and in the case of small isolated or irregular shaped blocks, the use of traverses. However, the use of strips is by far the dominant procedure used. While the bulk of all strips are currently established to a width of 60 metres, there are situations in lower densities where strips tend to be widened to 80 metres and sometimes 100 metres.
The Company agrees, in principle, that the maximum strip width will now be 60 metres. An exception to this would be a circumstance whereby a reasonable widening of the last strip on the edge of a given area would complete the treatment block. The Company also holds the position that the above changes will not affect any layout that is already in place that may possibly have some wider strips. All further layout activity will incorporate the above changes.
