Section4.Q1	Plant and Department Seniority
A - For the purposes of establishing seniority rules, seniority shall be considered on a plant and departmental basis. Wherever used in this Agreement, the term "plant seniority" shall mean the employee's total accumulated seniority from the employee's latest date of hire. Department seniority shall mean the employee's continuous service in the department from the employee's latest date of entry into the department.
B - Employees' seniority as covered in this Agreement shall apply only to employment at ADM Medicine Hat, Alberta, flour mill and shall not apply elsewhere.
Section4.02	Seniority List
The Company will maintain and post a seniority list which shall be updated every 6 months. Department seniority lists shall also be maintained for all departments. Copies of all seniority lists shall be posted and furnished to the Union.
Section 4.03	Probationary Period
An employee shall be regarded as a probationary employee until he has completed 90 calendar days within the bargaining unit. Absences of 7 consecutive calendar days or more will not count toward fulfillment of the probationary period. He shall not have seniority standing until the completion of this period. The discharge of a probationary employee shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement. Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee's name shall appear on the Company's seniority list as of his latest date of hire with the Company.
Section 4,04	Consideration of Qualifications
The application of the seniority provisions of this Agreement must be governed by whether the employee is qualified to perform the job required. Terms referring to "qualified" or "qualifications" when used in this Agreement mean qualified to competently perform the job, without further training, in a safe, efficient and productive manner. If the employee is not so qualified, the applicable seniority provisions shall not apply. The Company may employ testing procedures to determine potential qualifications for entry into the Maintenance Department.
Section4.05	Filling Permanent Vacancies (Except Maintenance and Job
Classifications in the Line of Progression)
A - When new jobs are created or the Company determines it is necessary to fill a permanent vacancy, such job will be filled by department seniority from the employees within the department where the vacancy occurs, provided that, in the opinion of management, such employee is capable of learning and performing the job in a safe, efficient and productive manner. If a permanent vacancy is not filled from employees in the
.4.
department where the vacancy occurs, such vacancy will be posted for bid and filled from those employees signing the posting on the basis of plant seniority, provided, however, that such employee is, in the opinion of management, capable of learning and performing the job in a safe, efficient and productive manner.
Note 1A:	Permanent vacancies may also be filled by hiring employees from outside
the workforce if, in Management's opinion, no suitable employee is available in the bargaining unit.
Note2A: .An employee who returns from an absence of up to 30 days because of vacation, leave of absence, funeral leave, jury duty, or occupational or non-occupational illness or injury may make application retroactively for any permanent vacancies posted during his absence, provided that he does so within 2 working days following his return to work.
Note3A:	For entry into Maintenance, see Section 4.06 - Maintenance Classifications
- Entry & Training.
B - An employee bidding or permanently assigned or transferred to a new job will have a fair trial period (15-day maximum) on such job. An employee shall be returned to his old job if he is unable to perform the new job satisfactorily.
Section 4,06	Maintenance Classifications- Entry & Training
A - Entry into the Maintenance job classifications will be either by assignment, provided the employee is agreeable to such assignment, or by hiring from outside. The following criteria, among others, may be used in the selection of Maintenance personnel:
1.	Results from a Company-designated test battery to measure maintenance aptitude, interest and other skills and characteristics.
2.	Physically able to perform all types of plant maintenance work.
3.	Willing and able to perform high work.

•5
Training Grade 3 -- 24 Months Training Grade2 - 18 Months Training Grade 1 -- 6 Months
An employee with obvious maintenance skills may be advanced at a faster rate. Advancement through the training grades will be based on management's judgment of the employee's maintenance skills and job performance. An employee who is not progressing satisfactorily to the Maintenance classification may be kept in any grade for longer than the above-listed time, or he may be disqualified. An employee who is disqualified within 12 months of entering his training will, if possible, return to his previousjob classification. An employee disqualified after 12 months in training will be transferred to the Utilityjob classification.

Section Note: The Company will post a notice when a maintenance vacancy is to be filled through the testing program.

and continues working into the next day, or his scheduled day off, or into a new workweek shall receive 1 1/2 times his straight time hourly rate (or double time if applicable) for such hours he works beyond the start of a new day. Such hours shall not be used to create overtime or premium payments during the employee's regular scheduled shift.
Note 2:	For purposes of satisfying the 40 straight time hour requirement, the
following unworked hours shall count as straight time hours of work up to 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week for days the employee was either scheduled to work or was laid off: (1) a worked or unworked holiday for which the employee is paid, provided it falls on an employee's scheduled straight time day of work, or (2) a paid absence resulting from either bereavement leave, jury duty or vacation time off, or (3) 8 hours per day for Union members who miss work as a result of attending approved union business, or (4) 8 hours per day for days absent while entitled to benefits under Weekly Indemnity.

Note: For purposes of satisfying the 40 straight time hour requirement, the following unworked hours shall count as straight time hours of work up to 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week for days the employee was either scheduled to work or was laid off: (1) a worked or unworked holiday for which the employee is paid, provided it falls on an employee's scheduled straight time day of work, or vacation time off, or (2) a paid absence resulting from either bereavement leave, jury duty, or vacation time off, or (3) 8 hours per day for Union members who miss work as a result of attending approved union business, or (4) 8 hours per day for days absent while entitled to benefits under Weekly Indemnity.
Section5.06	Call-In Pay
An employee, who is called in for emergency or overtime work on his scheduled day off or called back after he has finished his shift and left the plant and premises, will be paid at his applicable hourly rate for such unscheduled hours worked or 4 hours' pay at his straight time hourly rate, whichever is greater. An employee called back or called in to start in advance of his regular starting time and who continues to work on into his scheduled shift, shall not qualify for the 4-hour guarantee provided for in this Section.

When necessary, the employee with the least seniority who is available and qualified must work the overtime.
Notel:	The term man-on-the-job means the employee who is actually performing a
specific task or job. If more than one man-on-the-job is involved, then the employee who is performing the specific task will be offered the overtime. If the employee

own jobs in order to work overtime in anotherjob.
Note 3:	If overtime (including call-ins) is misassigned, an employee so affected
shall have the opportunity to make up such missed overtime as soon as is practical within a 30 calendar day period at any time mutually agreeable between the Company and the employee.

NOTES APPLICABLE TO JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
1.	Employees in any job classification will perform any jobs or duties to which they may be assigned. Each "job classification" may include a wide variety of different jobs, tasks and duties, some of which may cross job classification lines. Maintenance, housekeeping and lubrication duties may be required of any employee. Employees who either perform maintenance duties or assist in performing maintenance duties will be paid at the rate of their own regular job classification. The Company shall have no obligation under this collective Agreement to establish a light duty job or classification.
2.	There are no minimum crew or job manning requirements. The Company has the sole right to determine the number of employees in any job classification as well as the right to determine crew size in the plant or any portion thereof, provided there is no violation of the Canada Labour Code. Classifiedjobs may be filled, vacated or permanently discontinued at the Company's discretion.
3.	If employees within the bargaining unit do not possess the necessary skills to fill a vacancy, the Company may fill such vacancy by hiring from outside.
4.	Temporary Employees shall not be entitled to Company Benefit Plans, Seniority, Recall Rights, or any other provisions of this Agreement.
5.	The rate of pay for Probationary Employees shall be $14.00 per hour
6.	Safety is a shared responsibility. Employees' job responsibilities include their personal safety and collectively, that of their fellow employees.
7.	If, due to a layoff, a current employee as of February 27, 2004, is bumped into the Plant Wide Utility position, the employee will be paid the red-circled rate.
Section 6.02	Shift Differentials
A - 2nd or 3rd Shifts - A shift differential is paid in addition to an employee's regular straight time hourly rate if he is scheduled and working on either the 2nd or 3rd shift. The 2nd shift differential is 650 per hour. The 3rd shift differential is 950 per hour.
Note 1A: If an employee is scheduled on a 2nd or 3rd shift and is involved in a continuous work period requiring him to work on more than one shift, then the shift on which he has been scheduled establishes the shift differential, if any, for all hours worked during the continuous work period.
