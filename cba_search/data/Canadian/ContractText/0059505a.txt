The shift engineer must enter in the “call-back” book, the name of the man called back, the time and the reason for the call-back.
4.	The Maintenance employee on standby will be one who is capable of completing any emergency work on all of the Company’s production equipment.
5.	The maintenance man called back must make a brief note in the space provided in the call-back book, describing what was wrong and what he did to correct the situation. Any additional personnel called in (after consulting with the Shift Engineer) must also be recorded in the call-back book.

Re: Overtime Banking
Further to Article 8 (1) of the collective agreement the following conditions and procedures shall govern the “banking” of overtime.
1.	That the employee advises their supervisor that they wish to “bank” their overtime at the time of overtime assignment and that such election is irrevocable. The time eligible for banking shall be the work hours in excess of forty (40) hours in a week. The employee must bank all (both straight and premium payment portions) overtime earned on a particular shift with the additional condition that overtime on a given shift must exceed one (1) hour to be eligible for banking.
2.	That time-off in lieu of overtime may only be taken in full-work periods unless replacement is not required in the opinion of the Company.’
3.	That one (1) week notice be given in advance of taking time-off in lieu of overtime payment and that the scheduling of time-off be approved by the Company. The Company may at its discretion waive the one (1) week notice requirement if no replacement is required for the employee.
4.	That banked overtime may not be
substituted for vacations except that a seniority employee may request to take banked overtime prior to using vacation time if the prior approval of the Supervisor has been obtained (i.e., if an employee wishes to take a day off and the Supervisor can operate the department without him for that day, not requiring an additional man to be called in, banked overtime may be used). If an empibyee scheduled for lay-off he has the option of using his vacation or banked overtime owing during this lay-off period. However, if an employee calls in sick on a Friday or Monday, and wants to be paid for these days, vacation time must be used instead of banked overtime.
This provision shall be implemented on a trial basis ending July 31, 1990 at which time the parties will review and have the opportunity to reinstate it.
5.	That time-off in lieu of overtime is not considered work time for purposes of statutory holiday entitlement, seniority retention, benefit extension, and other such provisions of the Collective agreement.
6.	Unused “banked” overtime will be paid to the employee at the end of the calendar year.
7.	Pay for “banked” overtime will be at the
56
rate in effect at the time the overtime was banked.

1.	The period of disability must be a minimum of two weeks.

Re: Vacation Banking
TrfeWtow'fr^yocedure will appty to the vacation banking option referred to in Article 13 of the parties’ Collective Agreement:
1.	Elections to bank vacation should be subrTHtt«dx>rior to the deadline for vacation scheduling requests. No additional banking of vacation will then be allowed without mutual consent.
• 2 Where the Collective Agreement provides that vacation pay will be based on a percentage of the prior years earnings this amount will be converted to eight (8) hour days of pay at the employee’s regular rate. The result of the conversion will be the number of days to be banked.
Example:
An emflidyee 'eirQi'oi^Tor"Td% vacation pay has earnings of $15,000 in the previous year. He elects to bank his “5th week” entitlement. His current rate is $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount would be 2% of $15,000 divided by $12.00/hour (twelve). The banked amount equal to 25 (twenty five) hours or 3.125 days.
3. Employees will be advised at year’s end of the amount of vacation which has
60
been banked on their behalf. Once vacation is banked it is “locked in’1 until retirement, resignation or other form of termination.
4.	Payment for the banked days will be based upon the rate in effect at time of termination. The Company will cooperate to the extent practical and proper to make the payment in the manner the employee feels to be most tax effective.
5.	Where banked vacation becomes payable as a result of death the payment will be made to the deceased employee’s beneficiary as indicated by their life insurance beneficiary designation and in the absence of such beneficiary to their estate.

The Company’s assistance will be at the rate of 50% of eligible expenses to a maximum outlay of $800.00 (eight hundred) after the employee satisfies an initial deductible of $200.00 (two hundred).
