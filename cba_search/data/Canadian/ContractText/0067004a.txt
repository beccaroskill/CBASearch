(hereafter called the “Company”),
Party of the Second Part.
WITNESSETH:
In consideration of the mutual terms and covenants hereinafter contained, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:
SECTION 1
1.01	WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to co-operate in establishing and maintaining proper and suitable conditions in the Company which will tend to secure uniform and equitable terms of employment and conditions of labour satisfactory to the Company and the Union, and to provide methods of fair and peaceful adjustment of all disputes that may arise between the parties hereto or between those represented by them and who are affected by this Agreement, and in order to ensure, so far as possible, uninterrupted operation and general stabilization of the Company’s business, and to ensure a proper and ethical conduct of the business and relations between the Company and the employees.
1.02	Wherever the masculine is used in this Agreement, it shall be considered as if the feminine has been used where the context of the employees) hereto so requires.
SECTION 2
2.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agent for those of its employees listed and classified under the clause entitled “Wage Rates and Classifications” in this Agreement. New Classifications may be added from time to time when mutually agreed between the parties hereto.
2.02	The Company agrees that the Union may have the assistance of representatives from outside its own local in any negotiations or discussions between representatives of the parties hereto, provided that all such representatives are approved by Local No. 1.
2.03	Those employees not members of the bargaining unit shall not do the work of any employee covered by this Agreement unless with the consent of the Union.
SECTION 3 — DISCRIMINATION
3.01	The Company and the Union agree there shall be no discrimination against any employee because of their race, color, sex or religious creed.

1
SECTION 4 - MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
4.01	The right to hire, promote, demote, discharge or discipline for just cause and to ensure the efficiency of the employees and of the Company's operation is the sole responsibility of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
SECTION 5 - UNION SECURITY
5.01	All employees in the bargaining unit are required to remain members of the Union in good standing for the duration of this Agreement as a condition of employment.
5.02	All new employees shall be called Regular On Grid Employees (hereinafter known as R.O.G.) or Seasonal Employees.
The complete terms and conditions for the employment of R.O.G. employees are contained in Appendix "A " of this Collective Agreement.
(1)	The present system for the assessment of new employees will continue to operate as it has but that in recognition of certain concerns with this present system there will be more involvement and dialogue between the Line Manager and the employee. Where the Regular On Grid Employee has, during their period of evaluations, a reporting relationship to more than one Line Manager, then all Line Managers for whom the employee has worked shall collectively make his/her probationary assessment.
(2)	All employees hired during the period defined as March 1 to September 15 inclusive, and the period December 1 to December 31st shall be classified as "SEASONAL EMPLOYEES", (exceptfor persons hired in the maintenance mechanic classification who shall be classified as probationary employees) and all persons hired within this classification shall cease to be employees of the Company on or before the 30th of September in the year of hire or, if rehired for December of that year, by December 31st of that year. Persons classified as "SEASONAL EMPLOYEES", shall be paid the rate of pay as specified by the collective agreement and shall, in addition, be entitled to receive certain benefits pursuant to the statutory holiday and vacation provisions of the Collective Agreement but shall have no other entitlements under the
2
Collective Agreement nor shall they be permitted to change their employment status. A Seasonal Employee who may be re-employed by the Company outside the designated seasonal period as a Regular On Grid Employee shall not have any of their days worked as a Seasonal Employee applied against days to be accumulated for purposes of R.O.G. status, and for purposes of determining R.O.G, status their first day of work as a R.O.G, employee shall be deemed to be the employees first day of work with the Company. The parties agree that circumstances may result in the need to utilize Seasonal Employees outside the designated seasonal period and the Union agrees that reasonable requests will be honored. It is understood that any time worked under such circumstances will not be counted for the purposes of establishing R.O.G, status.
A “SeasonalEmployee” may be released for unsuitability in the sole discretion of the Company. In the event that a “Seasonal Employee” is terminated for disciplinary reasons, the standard of cause for review of the Company’s decision shall be whether the decision was arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith. The parties agree that this standard of just cause complies with Sections 43,1(1) and of the Labour Relations Act.
(3)	It is understood that for periods of unusual production demands outside the Seasonal period, the Company and the Union agree to consider hiring Seasonal Employees on a short term basis.

5.04	Upon the employment of Regular On Grid Employees or Seasonal Employees the Union shall issue to each such employee upon payment of the required fee, a Union Permit Card.
3
CHECK OFF
5.05	The Company will continue, as agent for the Union, the present voluntary revocable dues deduction agreement and all Union Dues and assessments shall be deducted from each weekly pay cheque. Such monies collected shall be paid to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union, not later than the 10th day of the month following the month in which the deductions were made, accompanied with the list of the names of all employees for, and in behalf of whom such deductions have been made. Monthly statements showing the names of all additions and deletions of staff shall also be forwarded to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union.
In the event that any such deductions are not made for reasons of sickness, vacations, leave of absence, etc., they shall be collected from the weekly pay cheque of the employee on their return to work. (No more than two (2) weeks arrears in any one (l) week.) The Union will inform the Payroll Department of any Union arrangements in force, regarding exemption from payment of Union Dues.
The Union can request the Company to change the amount of dues deducted no more than twice annually. Any request to change the amount of dues being deducted must be authorized by the Local Union.
SECTION 6 - UNION ACTIVITIES
6.01	If the Union will give the Human Resources Manager twenty-four (24) hours notice of Union Executive meetings, he/she will arrange to have at least one Executive member from each of the five (5) departments released from work to attend the meeting.
SPECIAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE
6.02	The Company agrees to grant unpaid leave of absence, upon written application, for a period of not more than twelve (12) months or for the balance of the duration of this Agreement (whichever is longer) to any employee who has been elected or appointed as an official of the Parent Union or of the Local Union or who has been elected to public office, if such duties require he/she to have leave of absence from Company duties on a full time basis.
4
Employees on such leave of absence may be continued as active members of the pension and welfare plans (subject to applicable legislation and/or government regulations or directions) upon payment of the total contributions to such plans whether from the Union or employee concerned. During such period of leave of absence the employee’s seniority shall continue to accumulate as if he/shS were employed at their regular post by the Company.
6.03	On each January 1 an Educational Leave of Absence Bank will be established which consists of one hundred (100) days total in each year for The Bargaining Unit. Upon written application by the Union President, the Union may request an Educational Leave of Absence for employees without loss of regular pay.

5
SECTION 7 — SENIORITY
7.01	The Company agrees to recognize the seniority rights of all employees who are members of the Union. Seniority is designed to give Union members an equitable measure of security based on length of service with the Company. Seniority will be the determining factor in layoff and choice of annual summer vacation period; and will be a factor in promotions and job assignments when a vacancy occurs.
7.02	Each employee will have seniority standing in the department in which they are employed. Except in the case of employees whose seniority rights have already been established an employee’s seniority will be established in accordance with Appendix “A” of this agreement.
7.03	An employee does not have seniority rights until he/she completes the Regular On Grid employee requirements as established by Appendix “A -- of this agreement and becomes a permanent employee. Once established, an employee’s seniority date will remain unchanged except as provided for herein, and the employee’s name will be placed on the department seniority list of the department within which he/she is working.
7.04	The Company agrees to compile and post departmental seniority lists of all Union employees within three (3) months after signing of the Agreement. Such lists shall be amended and reposted quarterly. If, within one (1) month after the first posting, an employee submits proof that their seniority date should be altered and such proof is accepted by the Company and the Union, an amendment will be made accordingly. The Company will also supply the Union with a copy of the seniority lists and the correction thereto.
7.05	The departments referred to above shall mean:
Brewing
Packaging Staging Distribution Plant Services Retail Store
7.06	The following Union Executive Officers: President, Vice-president, Secretary-Treasurer, and Recording Secretary shall hold top plant and
6
departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of lay-off only.
7.07	Departmental Executive Members and the Union Steward shall hold top departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of lay-off and transfers out of their department only. In the event that more than one employee holds top departmental seniority, then the order of their seniority for purposes of lay-off or transfer out of their department only will be interpreted as being the order in which they are mentioned above.
7.08	An employee’s seniority date will be established as set out in Section
7.02	and no changes shall be made in an employee’s seniority date, except as provided for therein or as in Section 8 or Section 12.11.
SECTION 8 — TERMINATION OF SENIORITY
8.01	Seniority will cease for any of the following reasons:
1(a) Where a permanent employee voluntarily resigns. All such resignations shall be in writing and signed by the employee concerned.
(b)	Where an employee is discharged for cause and such discharge is not reversed through the grievance procedure.
(c)	Where an employee obtains leave of absence for reasons other than those given when the request was made, for accepting unauthorized employment, or for failing to pay union dues, while on leave of absence. Unauthorized employment is employment not approved by the Company and the Union.
(d)	Failure to notify the Company (accepting a call back to work after a lay-off) within seventy-two (72) hours (excluding Saturday and Sunday) of recall notification by registered mail of the last address on file with the Company, and failure to report to work within seven (7) days of acceptance of recall.
(e)	When an employee has their name withdrawn from Union
7
membership. In the event this should occur, the Union will give the Company in writing the reasons for such action.
(f)	For employees with less than two (2) years seniority, a continuous lay-off of twelve (12) months or more will result in the termination of seniority. For those employees with seniority of two (2) years or more, a continuous lay-off of twenty-four (24) months or more will result in the termination of seniority.
(g)	Where an employee is absent from work for three (3) consecutive working days without having notified the Company and received permission to be absent in advance, unless the employee can demonstrate that he/she could not obtain advance permission.
SECTION 9 - SPECIAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE DURING LAY-OFF
9.01	During periods of lay-off, permanent employees may apply for special leave of absence if they have obtained steady work elsewhere. Such employees shall not be called for short periods of employment during the period of layoffs, but they shall be required to comply with Section 8.01, paragraph (d), when they receive a formal recall.
9.02	The Company will not issue such formal recall unless the amount of work available is expected to last at least four (4) weeks, or unless there are no other laid-off permanent employees available.
9.03	Employees who are granted special leave of absence will be required to pay Union Dues during the period of leave.
SECTION 10 — LAY-OFF AND RECALL
10.01	In the case of a lay-off, Seasonal Employees, if any, and then Regular On Grid Employees shall be laid off first plant wide, with the exception of skilled tradespersons whose services are mutually deemed to be essential for the efficient operation of the Company. Laid off employees will be allowed to replace more junior employees in other departments provided the employees exercising such rights are able and willing to do the job. Employees who exercise these rights would do so for the period of lay-off only and their security in the original department would not be affected.
8
10.02	Except in the case of extreme emergency, the Company will give permanent employees who are to be laid off notice on the bulletin boards three (3) working days prior to lay-off. If the employee is on leave of absence, or absent through sickness or on Workmen’s Compensation at the time of lay-off, the employee shall be subject to the lay-off provisions the same as if he/she were on active status.
10.03	Any employee who is laid off or continues to be laid off in violation of seniority must present a claim, in writing, to the Human Resources Department within three (3) working days from the date of notice of such employee’s layoff, otherwise it shall be deemed that compensation for time lost arising out of any wrongful lay-off is waived. The Company will promptly determine the merits of written claim and if it is found that the lay-off was unjust the affected employee will receive their straight time lost during such lay-off.
10.04	When rehiring takes place in any department, the reverse of Section
10.01	will be followed (i.e. laid off permanent employees will be recalled in order of their seniority within that department). In the event that additional employees are required by that department, then permanent laid off employees holding seniority in another department will be recalled in the order of their seniority, Permanent employees recalled to work in another department will not transfer their seniority rights to the department in which they are recalled except as provided for in Section 11.
Employees who hold top departmental seniority pursuant to Article 7.07, and who are laid off will be recalled in order of seniority.
10.05	Notification of recall shall be made by registered mail to the last address which the employee shall have recorded with the Company, and the Recording Secretary of the Union shall be notified thereof. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Company notified of their mailing address in order that he/she may be contacted within seventy-two (72) hours as provided in Section 8.01 (d).
SECTION 11— TRANSFER AND WORK ASSIGNMENTS
11.01	In the event of a permanent transfer of an employee from one
9
department to another, the said employee shall retain their accumulated seniority in the new department.
11.02	Employees may at any time apply for transfer from one permanent job to another, or from one shift to another (other than nights to days) within their department, or from one department to another, or for training programs relating to jobs within the bargaining unit.
An employee may also apply for transfer from one department to another for health reasons, providing Management and Union mutually agree this is a valid reason for application.
11.03	When permanent job vacancies arise or training programs conducted, those employees who have applied will be given first consideration, but other applications may be invited. Selection for such vacancies or training programs will be made on the basis of present qualifications or demonstrated ability to benefit from training, but where other things are equal, seniority will apply. Selections made in accordance with this Article will be discussed with the Union.
11.04	Employees who apply but are not selected may discuss their application with the Department Manager concerned and if still dissatisfied may file a grievance commencing at Step 3.
11.05	Employees who voluntarily relinquish a higher hourly rated job for a lower rated job cannot return to the former job, except as provided for herein.
11.06	An employee transferred at their request to another department or to another job or shift in their department shall not be permitted to request another transfer unless he/she has spent twelve (12) months in that department, job or shift. This restriction shall not prevent an employee from applying for a posted day job at any time.
11.07	In assigning employees to daytime jobs, the senior employees shall be given preference if able and willing to do the job. A daytime job refers to a job where there is no shift work.
11.08	If any employee requests a transfer to a lower rated job because of personal preference, he/she will, if the transfer is made, be paid at the lower rate.
10
11.09	If any employee is transferred on the initiative of the Department Manager (and not because of a request of the employee) for the efficiency of the department, for his/her own good, or because of undisputed disability, he/ she will be paid at the lower rate unless the employee has had at least seven (7) years service, or one (1) year continuous employment at the higher rate and in such case the employee will retain their rate until such time as the job rate exceeds the rate being paid. Thereafter, the employee will be paid the contract rate for the job.
11.10	In the event that such a transferred employee is retransferred to their original department before August 1st of the following year for production work, the employee will be paid the higher rate for the balance of the calendar year in which he/she was transferred plus a maximum of ten (10) months.
11.11	It is agreed that in arranging personnel for the different shift crews in the Packaging Department, the Company will post an Executive Member and a Steward in each crew. The posting will be based on the list of Executive Members and Stewards submitted to the Company by the Union.
11.12	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of the Company to assign employees where necessary in order that the efficiency of the department is not impaired. Should an employee who has been transferred at their own request as outlined in Section 11,02 be required to work in other areas because of production requirements, the employee will be returned to their regular shift or department when normal conditions exist. This will not affect the employees right of transfer as noted in Section 11,02 above.
11.13	With the exception of Maintenance Mechanics who are covered independently herein, employees transferred or assigned temporarily to a job paying a higher rate of pay will be paid at the higher rate for all hours worked in the higher rated job. This section does not include employees while on work stabilization or a defined training program.
11.14	If at any time it becomes necessary to make transfers because of lack of work or departmental reorganization the following procedure will be followed:
(a)	The employee affected will first replace an employee with less seniority in his/her department, providing he/she has the ability
11
and qualifications to perform the work.
(b)	If there is no one with less seniority in the department, or, if they should lack the ability and qualifications, they may then exercise their right to replace employees with less seniority in other departments. At the time of the transfer the Company will advise the employee and the Union as to whether the transfer is temporary or permanent. After the employee is advised that he/she has been permanently transferred, he/she may submit a request for transfer to job vacancies as specified in Section 11.02.
11.15	(a) The Company must supply adequate manpower in all operations in all departments at all times so that an employee will not be required to perform more than a fair days work.
(b) Clause (a) shall not be construed to mean that the manning of all operations is at present exactly adequate or that all employees are presently assigned exactly a fair days work and accordingly changes in an employee’s work load may be made so long as the resulting situation is not a violation of Clause(a),
(c)	Whenever changes are to be introduced, which may affect bargaining unit personnel, the Company agrees to notify the Union as soon as it is practicable prior to finalization of plans. A meeting will be arranged with the Union to discuss an appropriate disposition of the employees affected.
11.16 CLASSIFICATIONS DURING OVERHAUL
When a scheduled overhaul is planned and lay-offs are avoided through work stabilization, a list of selected employees to support the mechanical trades will be made by Management. Selection will be based on aptitude and ability for work. Compensation will be based on the following criteria:
(a)	Employees assigned to work with Maintenance Mechanics to perform jobs requiring mechanical skills will be paid the Maintenance Mechanic “C” rate for such work.
(b)	Employees assigned to work with Maintenance Mechanics or
12
Painters to do routine general maintenance or painting work will be paid the Maintenance General Rate,
It is understood that the number of employees qualifying for the “C” Mechanic Rate is dependent upon the circumstances prevailing at the time the Company requests additional supporting staff for the mechanical trades.
It is also understood that, from time to time, there may be employees selected whose aptitude and ability to do the work assigned to them is to be assessed. Whenever this circumstance occurs, the employees will be paid the Maintenance General Rate for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks.
It is also understood that employees who are assigned to other work stabilization jobs outside the Maintenance Department in order to avoid lay-off will be paid their regular rate.
The Company agrees to supply the Union with names of those employees who when performing work that required the use of their additional abilities would receive the “C” mechanic rate. This list will be updated from time to time as employees show their ability.
SECTION 12 — PROMOTION AND VACANCIES
12.01	Promotions or allocations to better paid jobs or to more desirable jobs within the bargaining unit shall be based on seniority provided that the applicants have the ability and are qualified and considering the efficient operation of the Company. In the event that a senior employee lacks necessary training, the Company will arrange to give the necessary training wherever in the opinion of the Management, this is practicable.
12.02	Except in the Packaging Department, the Company agrees to post for fifteen (15) working days all vacancies for permanent jobs in the bargaining unit. The Company is not obligated to consider applications which are received after the expiration of the fifteen (15) working days.
12.03	The Company agrees to post summer vacancies in the Retail Store no less than fifteen (15) working days before the vacancies arise. The most senior employees will be selected from applicants provided they are approved by the Marketing department.
13
12.04	All permanent vacancies will be posted on all plant bulletin boards and will set out the nature of the job, the qualifications required, and such other information as may be necessary. All permanent employees may apply for such jobs.
12.05	The Company agrees to fill such vacancies from the list of applicants subject to the provisions set out in 12,01 above. If a vacancy cannot be filled from the list of applicants, the Company may select another candidate.
12.06	The Company shall have the right to fill vacancies temporarily pending a permanent appointment to the position.
12.07	Upon appointment to a new position, the selected employee will undergo the normal three (3) month probationary period, but such period may be extended in specific instances after discussion and agreement with the Union. If an employee demonstrates that he/she will not qualify within the probationary period, he/she may be required to return to their former position before such time without prejudice and without loss of seniority.
The selected employee may, within the above probationary period, request a return to his/her former position if he/she provides reasons satisfactory to the Company for such request. In the event that the employee is permitted to so return, he/she shall not be eligible to apply for any further posted jobs for a period of one year from the date of his/her return to their former job. This restriction shall not prevent an employee from applying for a posted day job at any time.
LINE MANAGER AND OTHER NON-BARGAINING UNIT POSITIONS
12.08	The same posting procedure for Line Manager positions will be followed except that the Company maintains the right to invite other applicants. All Line Manager appointments shall be posted on bulletin boards as soon as the appointments are decided on and before the appointee assumes their new duties. It is agreed that before Line Manager appointments are announced, the Company will advise the Union of its selection but nothing in this section shall affect the right of any applicant having greater seniority to submit a grievance if he/she feels that they have been discriminated against as a result of such decision, but such grievance shall not be arbitrable.
14
12.09	With qualifications for the job being given full and prime consideration, employees having the greatest seniority shall be given preference for promotions to Line Manager positions.
12.10	The Company may post other job opportunities outside the bargaining unit to give Union members an opportunity to apply but the postings of such jobs shall not be considered a contractual matter or governed in any way by the terms of this Agreement.
12.11	If a permanent employee transfers to a non-bargaining unit Company position he/she will continue to pay Union dues for a period of six (6) months from the date of their transfer, the employees seniority in the bargaining unit shall be frozen as at the date of their transfer, and the employee will forfeit his/ her seniority in the bargaining unit unless he/she transfers back to the bargaining unit within six (6) months from the date of the transfer. The Company will deduct the required dues and remit them to the Union.
12.12	Withdrawal cards will be issued free by the Union to those who qualify under the constitution and By-Laws of the Union.
12.13	If an employee from the bargaining unit is selected for a position outside the bargaining unit the normal probationary period will be three (3) months, but such period may be extended in specific instances after discussion and agreement with the Union.

5,	WEEKLY INDEMNITY BENEFIT
If you become totally disabled and are prevented from working due to a nonoccupational accident or a sickness not covered by Worker’s compensation, you will receive weekly indemnity benefits provided you are under the care of a licensed physician. If disability commences during a period of lay-off you will be eligible for Weekly Indemnity benefits from the date you are recalled to work only if you have 10 or more years seniority and you are recalled within a period of two weeks from the date of lay-off and you are totally disabled on that date.
The amount of your weekly indemnity benefit is 70% of your basic weekly earnings rate as of the date disability commences. When a general change in wage rates takes effect under the terms of the labour agreement, the amount of your weekly indemnity benefit from the effective date of such change will be 70% of the basic weekly rate to which you would be entitled if you were at work. Your weekly indemnity benefit payments will be reduced by the amount of any disability payments which you are eligible to receive from the Canada Pension Plan or any other government source.
The benefit payment is based on a seven (7) day week. For each day of absence for which a benefit is payable you will receive one-seventh of the weekly benefit. Benefits are payable from the first day of absence if disability is due to accident, or from the fourth day of disability due to illness. Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks).
66
Where it is necessary for an employee to have dental surgery, benefits will be payable commencing on the fourth day following such surgery and will continue up to a maximum of two weeks for any such claim, but only on receipt of proper certification by a dental oral surgeon.
A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation of the disability unless you have completely recovered and have been back at work for at least fourteen (14) days.
Your weekly indemnity insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your weekly indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received weekly indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received Worker's Compensation payments for a continuous period of twenty-six (26) weeks.
During the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, your benefit will be payable weekly at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect during that period. At the end of the first seventy-eight (78) weeks, your LTD benefit will be fixed at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect in the 78th week of the LTD benefit period and thereafter your LTD benefit will be payable in an equivalent monthly amount at the end of each month. For example, if your earnings rate in the 78th week is $22.25 per hour:
(a)	your weekly earnings rate is 40 x $22,25 =	$890,00
(b)	your weekly LTD benefit in the 78th week
is 66-2/3% of $890,00	=	593,33
(e\ thereafter your monthly LTD benefit is
4-1/3 x $593,33	=	$2,571,09
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker's Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
67
In order to qualify for LTD benefits you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, be unable to perform a regular job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work £jt at least six (6) months.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefit will continue for up to twenty-four (24) months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $2,571,09 and you earn $1,000 in rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD benefit Subtract 75% of $1,000 LTD benefit during rehabilitation Earnings from rehabilitative employment Monthly income during rehabilitation
While you are in receipt of LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits. Please refer to the Labatt Retirement Plan section of this booklet for a description of the pension credits which will accrue to you while you are disabled.
Your LTD insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company.

NOTE:	You may not receive wages or other allowances such as holiday
pay, vacation pay, Weekly Indemnity, LTD or Worker’s Compensation or similar benefits from more than one source for the same day or part day.
7.	SEMI-PRIVATE HOSPITAL BENEFIT
Your provincial health plan (OHIP) provides basic hospital benefits for you and your family but generally limits benefits for room charges to the amount payable for ward accommodation. Insured benefits are provided under the Company’s plan for you and your covered dependents to supplement the provincial plan benefit and provide payment for room charges up to semiprivate accommodation in a licensed hospital. If hospitalized in a private room the benefit will be limited to that which would have been paid for semi-private accommodation. These benefits apply in all confinements approved by a licensed physician except those covered by Worker’s Compensation.
Your semi-private hospital insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company except that:
(a)	If you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for up to one year for expenses incurred during the continuance of that disability.
(b)	If one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in hospital.
(c)	If a dependent wife is pregnant on the date her insurance is canceled, she will be entitled to semi-private hospital benefits up to the date of childbirth or termination of pregnancy as if the insurance were still in force.
8.	MAJOR MEDICAL EXPENSE BENEFIT
Basic medical benefits are provided for you and your family under your provincial health plan (OHIP), The major medical expense benefit under the Company’s group insurance plan provides benefits for you and your covered dependents for certain expenses not covered by the provincial hospital and medical plans. Expenses allowed under the major medical expense benefit are listed below.
69
Benefits are payable only if the services are recommended by a physician and if provincial legislation does not prohibit insurance of any such expense.
■	drugs and medicines dispensed on the written prescription of a physician. Reimbursement will be based on the cost of the generic equivalent of a prescription drug, if such an equivalent exists. You will receive full reimbursement of a brand name drug only if a generic equivalent does not exist, or if your physician provides specific instructions prohibiting substitution.

70
You are required to pay the first $ 10 of expenses incurred in each calendar year, This is known as the “deductible” and is applied to each insured person, employee or dependent, except that the total deductible for all members of your family will not be more than $20 in each calendar year. If expenses which are included in the deductible occur within the last three months of the calendar year the same expenses may be applied against the deductible for the next calendar year. If two or more insured members of your family ace. injured in a common accident only one deductible will be applied against their resulting combined expenses incurred in any one calendar year.
The amount of benefit payable is determined as follows:
(a)	the charges are totaled for all allowable expenses incurred by the employee or dependent during the calendar year
(b)	from this total the deductible is subtracted
the major medical expense benefit then pays 100% of the remainder
The maximum total amount payable for any individual is $11,000 per lifetime. However, after a person has been insured for a full calendar year, up to $3,000 of the original benefit will be reinstated on January 2nd of each year but at no time will the maximum exceed the original amount.
The major medical expense benefit does not cover periodic health check-ups and examinations, eye refractions or fitting of glasses, dental services, travel for health, expenses resulting from an act of war, charges for hospital room and board, hospital and medical expenses for services covered by the provincial plan, expenses for injury or illness covered by Worker’s Compensation Act, or any service for which an employee or dependent does not have to pay.
If when you retire you are entitled to group life insurance as explained in Section 3, you and your eligible dependents will continue to be insured for major medical expense benefits. You will continue to be required to pay the first $10 of expenses incurred in each calendar year as a “deductible” applied to each insured person with the total deductible for all members of your family not to exceed $20 in each calendar year.
71
You will then be reimbursed for 80% of any eligible expenses incurred after the date of your retirement in excess of the deductible. The maximum total amount payable for expenses incurred after your date of retirement is $10,000 for each individual member of your family.
If you terminate service and do not qualify for retired benefits your major medical insurance will be canceled as of the date on which your service is terminated, except that the following extended benefits are provided:
(a)	if you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, major medical benefits will be extended for up to one year, provided such expenses are incurred during the continuance of that disability
(b)	if one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in the hospital
if a dependent wife is pregnant on the date her insurance is canceled, benefits will be payable for treatment as a result of that pregnancy.

An annual reinstatement of up to $600 will be provided at the beginning of each calendar year, if required, to restore the lifetime maximum to the level of $4,500. At no time will the maximum exceed the original amount. Benefits will be paid on the basis of the lesser of the actual fee charged or the amount stated in the current Dental Association Schedule of Fees in the province in which you reside. If optional procedures are possible, benefits will be payable in accordance with the procedure involving the smallest fee.

In case of accident, you must see the doctor no later than the day following the accident in order to qualify for benefits from the first day; otherwise benefits will be payable as if the disability is due to illness. Diagnosis and prescription by telephone only does not constitute a "visit" for this purpose.

APPENDIX “E” - LABATT RETIREMENT PLAN FOR BREWERY WORKERS IN LONDON
This section of the booklet is a summary of the main features of the John Labatt Limited Retirement Plan for Wage Employees as amended
January 1, 1994 with respect to Brewery Workers employed by Labatt Brewing Company Limited in London, Ontario. A complete description of the Plan which is the governing document is available for reference at your Human Resources Office. If you have any questions do not hesitate to seek the answers from your Manager or Human Resources Staff.
Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits provided by the Labatt Retirement Plan (LRP).
1.	ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP
A new employee becomes a member of the Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following completion of 90 days of work in a 12 month period and his seniority date will then be established as his date of employment for purposes of this Plan.
You will be advised when you are eligible and are enrolled as a member and you will be asked to submit proof of your age.
2.	CONTRIBUTIONS
You are not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of your service after January 1, 1974, Any required contributions which you have made in respect of service before January 1, 1974 remain to your credit in the Plan and will be applied to provide benefits in respect of your service before January 1, 1974.
The Company contributes whatever amount is necessary, along with the required contributions made by employees in respect of service before January 1, 1974, to provide the benefits called for under the Plan. The Company also pays the full cost of administering the Plan, and in addition, matches your contributions to the Canada Pension Plan.
78
All contributions to the Plan are paid over to the Royal Trust Company to be invested and held in trust for the purpose of paying benefits as provided in the Plan.
3.	NORMAL RETIREMENT DATE
Normal retirement is at age 65, Your pension commences as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following your 65th birthday,
4.	SERVICE AND CREDITED SERVICE
Your service to qualify for certain of the benefits under the Plan is the total number of years from your date of employment as established under the Plan to the date on which you retire, die or terminate service.
The number of years of your “credited” service determines the amount of pension you are entitled to receive. Credited service is calculated as explained below:
(a)	From January 1, 1974 you receive a credit of one year for 1800 or more hours of work in a calendar year while a member of the Plan or a prorated partial year of credit for less than 1800 hours. For example, if while a member of the Plan you work only 900 hours in a year, your credit for that year will be one-half year (900 divided by 1800). If you are absent due to disability, you will receive service credits for any periods during which you are totally disabled and receive weekly indemnity or long term disability insurance benefits or Worker’s Compensation payments, but in no event will you receive more than one year of credited service for any one calendar year.
(b)	Your credited service for the period from January 1, 1958 to December 31, 1973 is the number of years for which you have made the required contributions to the Plan.
If you were a member of a previous company pension plan before January 1, 1958 when the Labatt Retirement Plan became effective, your credited service to December 31, 1957 is the period from your date of employment to December 3 1, 1957 but
79
excluding any periods when you were eligible to but did not contribute to the previous plan.
5.	CALCULATION OF BASIC PENSION CREDIT
You receive credit for a monthly basic pension payable from your normal retirement date (age 65) calculated as follows:
a)	for service after January 1, 1995 - $33,50 multiplied by the number of years of your credited service after January 1, 1995.
b)	for service after January 1, 1994 - $33,00 multiplied by the
number of years of your credited service after January I, 1994
c)	for service in 1993 - $32.00 for one year of credited service in
1993 or prorated amount for less than one year
d)	fur service in 1992 - $31,00 for one year of credited service in
1992 or prorated amount for less than one year;
e)	far service in 1991 - $30.00 for one year of credited service in 1991 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
f)	for service in 1990 - $28,00 for one year of credited service in
1990 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
g)	for service in 1989 - $27.00 for one year of credited service in
1989 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
h)	for service in 1988 - $26,00 for one year of credited service in
1988 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
i)	for service in 1987 - $20.00 for one year of credited service in
1987 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
j)	far service in 1986 - $19,50 for one year of credited service in 1986 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
k)	for service in 1985 - $19.00 for one year of credited service in 1985 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
80
II) for service in 1984 - $17.25 for one year of credited service in 1984 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
m) far service in 1983 - $16.50 for one year of credited service in 1983 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
n) far service in 1982 - $15.00 for one year of credited service in 1982 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
o) for service in 1981 - $14.00 for one year of credited service in 1981 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
p) for service in 1980 - $13.00 for one year of credited service in 1980 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
q) for service to December 31, 1979 - the amount of monthly basic pension to your credit for service to December 31, 1979 determined in accordance with the terms of the Plan in effect to December 31, 1979.
6.	AMOUNT OF NORMAL RETIREMENT PENSION
When you retire at your normal date (age 65) you will receive a monthly basic pension from the Labatt Retirement Plan in an amount equal to the sum of your basic pension credits determined as explained in Section 5. In addition you will receive any pension which is payable to you under a previous plan (seeSection 16) and any statutory pension (such as CPP and OAS) which is payable to you under government plans. You may also qualify for a supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan under the minimum pension provision explained in Section 7.
7.	MINIMUM PENSION AT NORMAL RETIREMENT
If you retire at age 65 with at least 30 years of credited service you are entitled to a minimum monthly pension from Company plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined of:
a)	$2,075 if you retire on or after January 1, 1994;
b)	$2,150 ifyou retire on or after January 1, 1995;
81
These amounts represent the minimum monthly pension payable from Company Plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined before allowing for the provision of a spousal survivor pension. The Company pension will be adjusted to provide a survivor pension unless the spouse who will benefit from that survivor pension waives their right to receive it in writing.
You will receive a minimum lifetime pension supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan equal to the amount, if any, required to be added to your accrued basic pension from all Company plans and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits determined at the date of your retirement to provide the above minimum monthly pension.
If you retire at age 65 with less than 30 years of credited service, the lifetime supplement shall be the amount by which the minimum pension at normal retirement exceeds the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, prorated by the ratio of the number of years of credited service to 30 years and reduced by your accrued pension.
To determine what, if any, amount of supplement is needed, your basic pension from Company plans is the basic amount payable before the amount of the survivorship pension is calculated, and your CPP pension is the amount you are entitled to receive when you first become eligible at Normal Retirement Age, whether or not you actually make application for such benefits, but disregarding any increase in your CPP pension after its date of commencement.
8.	SPECIAL EARLY RETIREMENT
If you are age 60 or over and you have 30 or more years of credited service you may elect Special Early Retirement in which case you will be entitled to an immediate accrued basic pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of early retirement, without reduction for your earlier age of retirement.
This pension will be supplemented by an amount necessary to provide the minimum monthly pension amounts set out below, until you first become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits:
a)	if you retire on or after January I, 1994 - $1,743
b)	if you retire on or after January 1, 1995 - $1,798
82
Once you become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65), the supplement will be recalculated as the amount required to be added to your accrued basic pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, determined as at the actual date of your retirement, to produce the following monthly pensions:
a)	if you retire on or after January 1, 1994 - $2,075
b)	if you retire on or after January 1, 1995, - $2,150
(Once again, both sets offigures above do not take account of the reduction required to produce a survivor option for the surviving spouse.)
This recalculated supplement shall become your lifetime supplement.
In addition to this recalculated lifetime supplement, you may be entitled to receive a further supplement (if you retire before December 31, 1995.) This further supplement will represent the amount, if any, necessary to produce a total pension from Company plans equal to the pension that would be payable if you were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, your accrued pension including any escalation thereof and your related credited service at the date of your retirement. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of your lifetime supplement.
9.	85 POINT RETIREMENT
A member retiring on or after January 1, 1991 and after having attained age 55 and whose age plus years of credited service total 85 or more (butprior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement) is entitled to an immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of accrued vested pension to his credit for service to date of early retirement.
In addition, such member shall be entitled to a lifetime supplement calculated as if the member had attained age 65 on his date of retirement but using his current unreduced vested accrued pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of the member’s actual date of retirement.
83
Once a member becomes eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65) and in addition to the lifetime supplement, a member who retires under this provision (85 Point Retirement) will be paid a further supplement, if necessary, to produce a total pension from Company Plans equal to the pension that would be payable if the member were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, they accrued pension including any escalation thereof and his/her related credited service. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of the member’s lifetime supplement.
10.	OTHER EARLY RETIREMENT
At any time after you are age 55, you may request early retirement and elect to draw your pension. If you retire after having reached age 55 but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement or 85 Point Retirement, you are entitle to an immediate pension equal to the amount of vested accrued basic pension to your credit for service to the date of your retirement, reduced by 1 / 3% for each month (i.e. 4% per year) you are under age 65 when your pension commences. In addition, you will be entitled to receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 65 on the date of your retirement, but using your current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension, all determined as at your actual date of retirement.
This lifetime supplement so calculated will also be reduced by 1/3% for each month (i.e. 4% per year) you are under age 65 when your pension commences.
H. DISABILITY RETIREMENT (BEFORE AGE 65)
As long as you are eligible to receive disability benefits under the Group Insurance Plan you will receive service and basic pension credits under the Labatt Retirement Plan and you will not be retired. However, if you become partially disabled and you do not qualify for insurance benefits you may qualify for Disability Retirement. Retirement under this provision requires that:
a) you are at least age 50 and have completed 10 years of service,
and
84
b)	you are certified to be partially disabled and thereby prevented from performing any work available with the Company,
and
c)	it is mutually agreed by you and by the Company that you be retired under the Disability Retirement provision.
On retirement under the disability provision you are entitled to an immediate pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of disability retirement without reduction for your earlier age of retirement. In addition, until you qualify for the earlier of receipt of CPP disability benefits or the attainment of age 65, you will receive a monthly disability supplement equal to $14,00 multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to 30 years.
At age 65, you will then receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 6 5 on the date of your retirement, but using your current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension determined as at your actual date of retirement.
12. DEATH AFTER RETIREMENT JOINT AND SURVIVOR PENSION
Your vested accrued basic pension and minimum supplements are payable for as long as you live and cease as of the first day of the month in which your death occurs.
A plan member with an eligible spouse who takes normal, Special Early, 85 Point, Disability or other early retirement on or after January 1, 1994, shall receive a joint and survivor pension, unless the member delivers to the Plan Administrator (throughyour Human Resources office) a written waiver of such entitlement in the prescribed form within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the payment of the pension benefit.
Unless waived, your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be reduced by 10% during your lifetime. Upon your death, your eligible
85
surviving spouse shall receive a pension of 60% of your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any (subject to a further actuarial reduction if your spouse is more than 10 years younger than yourself).
13.	DEATH BEFORE RETIREMENT
If you should die on or after January 1, 1994, while in the service of the Company and after you have reached age 5 5 and have 10 years of service, your eligible surviving spouse will receive a pension for his/her remaining lifetime. His/her pension will be equal to the amount of pension they would have received from the Plan had you retired as of your date of death and elected a reduced joint survivorship pension based on your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement (without the actuarial reduction, if any), but their pension will be subject to a reduction if they are more than 10 years younger than you. Pension payments to your eligible surviving spouse are guaranteed to return any required contributions you have made to the Plan with interest to your date of death.
The lifetime supplement will be calculated as if you had attained age 65 on the date of your death, but using your current unreduced accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of your actual date of death.
If you die before your pension commences and your spouse is not entitled to a pension as explained in the preceding paragraph, any contributions you have made with interest to your date of death will be paid to the beneficiary you have named or, failing such, to your estate. You may change your beneficiary from time to time as permitted by law by completing a form which is available from your Human Resources office.
The death benefit paid above shall not be less than provided in existing pension legislation.
14.	IF YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY
If your service is terminated on or after January 1, 1994 (other than by retirement or death) and if you have completed at least two (2) years of credited
86
service with the Company, you will be entitled to a deferred monthly pension at age 65 equal to the accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement to your credit.
Instead of this deferred pension entitlement you may elect to transfer the commuted value of your pension to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial Locking-In Requirements.
If you were a member of the Plan before January 1, 1974, when your service is terminated you may either,
a) leave all of your contributions in the Plan and receive at age 65 a monthly pension equal to the basic pension to your credit December 31, 1973, which is included in the pension referred to above, or
foj withdraw your contributions plus interest to your date of termination <£ service in which case you forfeit your credited service to December 31, 1973, and any pension in respect of such service, which is included in the pension referred to above.
Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial locking-in requirements.
IS.	ESCALATION OF PENSION AFTER RETIREMENT
If you retired prior to January 1, 1994 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
If you retire on or after January 1, 1994 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension and lifetime supplement will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be increased on each January 1st following your
87
retirement by the lesser of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
Any spousal pension will also be escalated applying the same formula, with the first increase occurring on the January 1st following your death.
16. PREVIOUS PLANS (before January 1, 1958)
If you were a member of a previous Company pension plan (Government Annuity and / or Trust Plan) in effect before January 1, 1958, your benefits from that plan are payable in accordance with the provisions of that previous plan and are in addition to the benefit you receive from the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Since your period of membership in the previous plan is included in determining your total credited service, any basic pension to your credit under the previous plan is taken into account in determining the amount of any minimum pension supplement you are entitled to receive. Since your pension from the previous plan will be actuarially reduced if you retire before age 65, your basic LRP pension will include an amount equal to the difference between your actuarially reduced previous plan pension and the amount of basic previous plan pension at age 65 reduced by the same factors as are applicable to your LRP pension as explained in Section 8, 9, 10 or 11 as the case may be.
For these purposes your basic previous plan pension has been determined and fixed as that amount of pension payable from age 65 and guaranteed for a minimum of 5 years which would be available in accordance with the terms of the previous plan in effect at December 31, 1957, but excluding any pension purchased by voluntary contributions you may have made to that plan. Any increase in the amount of your Government Annuity which has resulted from an increase in interest rate from 1975 is not considered as a part of your basic previous plan pension and would be payable as an extra benefit over and above your basic pension.
After retirement your total basic pension which is subject to escalation as explained in Section 15 includes the amount of basic previous plan pension determined as explained above.

Annual Statement - You will receive a statement following each calendar year end showing the amount of benefits to your credit under the Plan.
Benefits Not Assignable - The benefits provided under the Plan are not assignable except as is specifically provided with respect to death benefits nor may you borrow against them at any time. Similarly, except as specifically provided at termination of service or in connection with death, no benefit can be surrendered.
Eligible Surviving Spouse - Your spouse i s eligible for a surviving spouse’s pension under Section 12 or 13 provided you have been married for at least one year before your retirement or death, whichever is earlier.

Income Tax - All pension payments received from Company pension plans are considered as income for tax purposes in the year in which received. Your CPP and OAS pensions must also be reported as taxable income when you file your annual tax return. Similarly, all monies received in lump sum withdrawals or death benefits must be declared as income for tax purposes in the year in which received and are taxable unless such monies are transferred to a registered retirement savings plan.
18.	GOVERNMENT PENSION PLANS
Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits payable under the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Under current legislation your CPP pension is payable when you reach age 65, or as early as age 60 on a reduced basis. The amount of your CPP pension is dependent upon the amount of your earnings on which you have made CPP contributions and the period during which you contributed. To illustrate, an employee who retires at age 65 in 1994 and who is entitled to maximum
89
benefits under the Canada Pension Plan receives a pension of $694.44 per month when he retires. After CPP pension commences it is subject to adjustment each following January 1st depending upon increases in the Consumer Price Index.
Your OAS pension is also payable from age 65 but if you take up residence outside Canada your OAS pension may be discontinued unless you have been a Canadian resident for a prescribed number of years. If you plan to move out of Canada you should check into these requirements. The amount of OAS pension is subject to quarterly adjustment upward if the Consumer Price Index increases. In January, 1994 the OAS pension was $385.81 per month.
Your spouse will also receive OAS pension benefits payable from age 65 subject to the same residency requirements specified above.
Application must be made to receive benefits from the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security and the applications should be filed six (6)) months in advance of your date of eligibility for such pensions to ensure prompt commencement of your benefits. As well as retirement pensions, the Canada Pension Plan provides certain disability, death and survivor benefits and further information can be obtained from your local Canada Pension Plan Office.

Subject: Overtime Canvassing/Administration of Article 19:14 Dear Ron:
This letter will confirm our understanding reached during negotiations regarding the simplification of the current overtime canvassing practices, and the understanding reached as related to voluntary and mandatory overtime.
It is agreed that the following stated practices will be adopted in regard to the canvassing of employees to determine their desire to work overtime:
In circumstances where overtime is scheduled in advance and it becomes practical, the company will post the details of such overtime opportunities on a designated overtime board. Employees who are interested in working the overtime will sign their name to the posted overtime signature sheet indicating their desire to be considered for such work.
After a reasonable posting period the company will remove the osign-up" sheet and those employees who have expressed a desire to work will be selected by utilizing the established and agreed to overtime selection criteria within the department.
A finalized schedule of employees to work the overtime shall be posted as soon as reasonably possible.
Where due to timing constraints it becomes impractical to follow the above stated practice outlined in the section one (1) the department manager will meet with the appropriate union representative to discuss the manpower needs to fulfill the overtime required. After reviewing the manpower needs and
102
appropriate overtime selection criteria the union representative will conduct the overtime canvass. Employees who are asked may choose or decline to work the overtime.
It is understood that should the canvass fail to identify enough willing qualified employees and it becomes necessary to force employees to work once all seniority employees in the department have been canvassed, the department manager will assign the work to probationary or seasonal employees.
Failure to satisfy the manpower requirements through the above stated procedure will result in the qualified seniority employee(s) with the least amount of seniority being required to work.
This letter will expire on December 31, 1995, As agreed this letter forms part of the Collective Agreement.
