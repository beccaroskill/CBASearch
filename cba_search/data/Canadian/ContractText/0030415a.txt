During the probationary period, dismissal for lack of aptitude shall not be the subject of grievance, however, all other terms of this Agreement shall apply. An employee's probationary period may be extended beyond thirty (30) working days to a maximum of sixty (60) working days, by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, to permit an employee (e.g. a cutter) to qualify for the job.
(a)	In matters concerning lay-off, recall, the filling of permanent
vacancies and permanent transfers of employees, the Company shall select individuals on ability and seniority and, where ability is sufficient to perform the required duties, seniority shall govern. When an employee permanently transfers to a new classification, his seniority in that new classification shall be from the initial date
23
of hire, as it was in his former classification.
The Company will provide minimum training to employees who have the required academic skills. The Company will provide training to individuals whose qualifications closely match those of the job competition. For example, a trades person requiring some computer training for an inventory/stockroom position.

in positions at a particular plant (hereinafter referred to as the "home plant"), the following sequence and process shall apply:
(1)	The vacancy shall first be posted only in the home plant of the vacancy and bargaining unit members in that plant shall have the first opportunity to apply and the successful candidate shall be selected according to the provisions of Clause 15:03:01(a);
(2)	If the vacancy is not filled pursuant to Paragraph (1) above, it shall then be posted on the bulletin boards in all other plants of the Company. Bargaining unit members in those plants shall have the next opportunity to apply and the successful candidate shall be selected according to the provisions of Clause 14:03:01(a), except if there are more than one candidate who has the sufficient ability to perform the required duties of the position, their seniority ranking shall be based upon current dates of hire. The successful candidate shall carry his Company service, but not his former plant seniority, to his new plant.
(3)	If the vacancy is not filled pursuant to Paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the casual employees in the home plant of the vacancy shall then have the opportunity to apply and the successful candidate shall be selected based upon sufficient ability to perform the required duties and if more than one such casual has that ability, the candidate with the earliest current date of hire will be selected;

(4)	If the vacancy is not filled pursuant to Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, the Company may fill the vacancy in any manner it may determine.
Vacancies and new positions of a permanent nature within the bargaining unit shall be posted on the plant bulletin board for five (5) working days, with all members of the bargaining unit having the right to apply.
Employees exercising their seniority rights in a permanent lay-off or job redundancy will be granted their preference in another job classification on a permanent move to which their seniority and ability entitles them.
An employee transferred to a new classification as a result of job redundancy whose former job re-opens within one (1) year, will have the right to return to that job without a job posting. If there is more than one employee affected, seniority will govern.
Employees who move into another job classification as a result of a temporary posting or the application of their seniority for more than three (3) days shall have all the rights with respect to the overtime distribution within that job classification as the regular employees within that job classification. Employees working in a job classification for less than three (3) days retain the rights to overtime in their regular job classification but do not acquire any overtime rights in the job classification in which they are temporarily working.
In the event of a reduction of the workforce at Port-au-Choix plant as a result of lack of work, the Unit President and Union Stewards shall be deemed to have the most seniority within their classification while holding office and shall continue to be deemed to have the most seniority within their classification for purposes of recall while holding office. Where there is more than one (1) employee in a classification to which this clause applies they should be laid-off and recalled in accordance with their actual seniority, as between them. An Executive member will have priority over a steward in his classification. Any President or Union Steward may choose to opt out of this provision if they do so in writing, filed with the Company.
In the event of a reduction of the workforce in Bonavista and Triton plants as a result of lack of work, the Unit President shall be deemed to have the most seniority within his/her classification while holding office and shall

(3)	Plant-wide seniority shall apply for all other lay-offs which extend beyond three (3) working days. Employees will be advised of lay-offs of more than thirty (30) days' duration in writing.
(4)	During a lay-off as outlined in 15:04 (2) employees with seniority shall not be displaced by employees without seniority.
Whenever the Company finds it necessary to make a selection for any of the above matters on any basis other than seniority, the Company agrees to review, before the selection is made, with the proper Union Officials or Representative, its reasons therefore.
When overtime is worked it shall be shared as evenly as possible among employees in the classification worked. Where overtime is to be offered to employees outside the classification to be worked, and, the use of such outside employees is foreseen before the end of the afternoon half shift rest period of a regular shift, then the Company will post a notice to such effect and will choose employees from outside the classification on the basis of seniority and ability of those who have indicated, to the appropriate supervisor, willingness to work.
All temporary transfers of employees for periods of three (3) working days or less shall be at the discretion of the Company.
When the Company decides to fill a temporary vacancy, as defined in clause :03 hereof, of more than three (3) working days by the transfer of other employees, it shall post a notice of its intention. Employees who have indicated that they wish to transfer on a temporary basis will be selected on the basis of seniority, provided they have sufficient ability to
26
14:07:03
14:07:04
14:08
14:09
perform the work. The successful applicant will be paid at the rate of the posted position. Should no seniority employee express an interest, the Company may temporarily transfer an employee subject to his right to decline on the basis of seniority, provided there is a more junior employee available who possesses sufficient ability to perform the work required.
Temporary vacancies for the purposes of this Clause are defined as vacancies arising from sickness, industrial accident, leave of absence, or vacation. In all other cases vacancies may only be considered temporary for a period not exceeding thirty (30) working days, except where there is mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, to permit a longer period. Temporary transfers of more than three (3) working days are related only to temporary vacancies.
Experience acquired by employees during temporary assignments or temporary transfers, or by casuals, shall not be used against regular employees, who have more seniority, in deciding on the filling of permanent vacancies or transfers.
Employees shall retain and accumulate seniority:
(a)	While on lay-off up to twenty-four (24) months;
(b)	While on sick leave, Workers' Compensation, pregnancy leave;
(c)	While on leave of absence; or
(d)	Where a seniority employee is promoted to a permanent vacancy or to a new position outside the Bargaining Unit for a period(s) totaling One (1) calendar year. Time periods shall be cumulative on the basis of appointment by calendar months, not the employees' working months.
Employees shall lose all seniority if:
(a)	Discharged for just cause
(b)	Quit;
(c)	Fail to return to work without just cause following lay-off and after being notified of the availability of work.

14:11
Early and Safe Return to Work: Local management and local Union Executives (at each site or between or among different sites) shall work together to assist employees make an early and safe return to work after being off due to serious illness or injury. This will also apply to crewmembers from the Company's vessels needing such accommodation. All parties will use their best efforts to have the employee accommodated according to the requirements of relevant legislation. However, such accommodation shall not cause the displacement of an employee having greater seniority than the employee to be accommodated. The accommodation shall be of a temporary duration only for the purpose and to the extent of enabling the accommodated employee to be able to return to his/her normal job. If, while being accommodated, the employee is occupying a job other than in his regular classification, he will be paid at the rate of his regular classification, and if that job is in another site, the employee shall still be treated as if he/ she were working in or on his/her home plant or vessel. The parties agree that this Clause fully and accurately describes, in the circumstances of the Company's operations, their duty to reasonably accommodate to the point of undue hardship employees with limited functional abilities.
The Union and the Company recognize that predictability in the quantity and/or quality of fish landed is, in practice, non-existent and that lay-offs, of necessity, must from time to time occur. In that regard, the parties with the intention of nullifying the effect of The Labour Standards Act, declare that the provisions for individual and group layoffs are more advantageous than the minimum standard set forth in the Act and further agree that the employer and the employee shall be and hereby are required to give to the other equal notice of termination of employment relationship which such notice shall be one day unless the reason is discharge for cause in which event termination shall be without notice.

26:03
26:04
26:05
26:06
This Article is intended to apply to the use of casual employees, all as defined herein, during the term of this Agreement. The Company confirms that the use of casuals shall not displace or reduce the number of regular employees required by the Company to carry out its normal operations at each plant.
For the purpose of this Article, and to assist the parties in the administration of this Agreement, casual employees are defined as individuals employed by the Company as required, to work without notice, to fill short-term vacancies or provide additional manpower, on an hourly or daily basis.
Where the local plant practice involves more than a minimal number of casuals, casuals will be ranked by either hours of work or date of hire, as per local agreement, and will be selected for work in that order, as their names appear, provided they have the ability to perform the work required. Any refusal by a casual who has the ability to perform the work offered, will result in his/her name being removed from the list.
Where casuals are hired they shall be paid at the rate of Job Grade I.
The regular hours of work in any department apply to casuals working in that department. Where applicable, work performed by casuals outside the regular hours of work in that department, would be subject to premium rates.
Where there is a shortage of regular work for seniority employees in their own department, they may replace any casuals employed in another department, provided they can perform the work required, and have advised their foreman of their desire to continue at work. Such replacements are only to apply where there is at least one-half hour of work available to the seniority employee.
When the Company posts a permanent vacancy or new position, casuals having the ability to perform the work, shall be offered permanent employment based on the ranking of the eligible casuals. Casuals offered permanent employment must accept the offer. Failure to accept a permanent position and attain seniority, will result in the individuals being placed at the bottom of the casuals list in rank. Casual employees, accepted in permanent positions, will not be required to complete the
49
26:07
26:08
probationary period, unless they have not had the equivalent of sixty (60) working days in the position to which they have been permanently assigned.
For each two hundred and twenty (220) hours worked, Casuals shall be paid eight (8) hours at their straight time rate in lieu of paid holidays under Article 13:02.
When employed by the Company, casuals have no right to attain or accrue seniority, and have no other benefits related to their employment except as provided in this Article.
50
ARTICLE 27 - Amendment
27:01

Chief Negotiator, Industrial Sector
Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union (FFAW /CAW)
P.O. Box 10
St. John's, NL A1C 5H5 Dear Mr. Pretty:
This is to confirm certain commitments and understandings on behalf of the Company relative to the renewal of the Collective Agreement, to be effective March 31, 2007.
The items to which the Company agrees herein refer specifically to maintenance employees of the Company employed in Marine and Plant Maintenance throughout the Company's operations covered by this Agreement.
1.	Where overtime is not scheduled in advance, and continues without a break from the employee's regular shift, and is in excess of two (2) hours, the Company will supply a meal to Maintenance employees. The meals will be available and will originate from two (2) sources. The maximum value of the meal will be $12.00.
2.	Maintenance employees who are required to travel on Company business will be paid to a maximum of twelve (12) hours at their straight time rate for all travel within a twenty-four (24) hour period. Hours actually worked during the period will be paid at the appropriate rates under this Agreement. Where the hours actually worked in a regular work day plus travel time exceed the normal scheduled hours for an employee, he shall be paid at the appropriate rate for such excess hours.
Employees required to travel on Saturday and Sunday will be paid at the appropriate rate, to a maximum of twelve (12) hours.
3.	For all Maintenance workers working on board Company trawlers it is agreed
that they will be made familiar with the use and have available to them Scott Air Packs.
75
4.	The Company will ensure that lunchrooms will be maintained in a clean and orderly fashion.
5.	The Company had agreed to top up apprentices' wages while attending school but have been unable to do so as a result of HRSDC rules and regulations. The Company is prepared to maintain its position should the opportunity permit them to top-up wages. The specific Company commitment is as follows:
The Company agrees, subject to any appropriate agreement that might be required from Human Resources Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), that apprentices will be given full credit for hours they attend school on the approved courses, as part of their apprenticeship training program. The Company agrees to bring the apprentices' pay for actual school time up to the regular rate the apprentice would receive while working under the provisions of these Terms and Conditions of Employment.
6.	Subject to the following terms and conditions, the Company is agreed to give preference of employment to regular employees prior to jobs being posted or filled from outside the bargaining unit. This is intended to apply to new jobs related to technological change where new equipment is installed. The Company will follow the principle of upgrading its own Maintenance employees where the employees have the necessary background to be given the training.
The training must be able to be completed within a reasonable timeframe to ensure the maintenance of orderly operations. Employees must have the ability, education, or experience at a basic level, which will permit their being trained to perform the functions required.
7.	The continuous operating period for air chippers and jackhammers will be a maximum of four (4) hours per individual employee.
8.	In the classification of shift power engineer, trawler attendant and watchman, employees will be permitted to rearrange their work schedules by mutual agreement to accommodate individual employees with respect to work during the Christmas/New Year's holiday period. The intention will be to permit employees to rotate shifts every second year to eliminate individual employees having to work during Christmas and New Year's holidays in successive years.
9.	The Company agrees to compensate journeypersons for the renewal of their certificates.
76
10.	The Company agrees to supply the following Safety items during the term of these Terms and Conditions of Employment:
(a)	Safety Hat Liners
(b)	Welding Jackets
(c)	Welding Gloves (for helpers)
(d)	Smoke Extractors
(e)	Ear Protection
(f)	Safety Gloves
(g)	Acid Coveralls
(h)	Safety Harness
(i)	Access to Toxic Gas Monitor
(j)	Cutting Goggles
(k)	Air Circulating Helmet (one (1) per Maintenance Operation (Plant, Marine))
11.	Shift power engineers will be paid for the ticket held.
12.	The Company will contact the Department of Labour and arrange to have an inspector visit each location to test welders who want to be certified as high pressure welders.
13.	The Company does not recognize any particular location where Marine Maintenance is employed as having any specific right to perform maintenance work on the FAS vessels. During the turnaround period, FAS vessels fishing shrimp will be maintained by Marine Engineers assigned to the vessels.
14.	The Company agrees that employees on international travel on Company business, will be governed by the Company's Travel Policy.
15.	Engineers will primarily be responsible for the operation, maintenance and repairs to the refrigeration, steam and ice systems. With this guideline, locals should be able to address local concerns.
16.	Engineers who are on twelve (12) hour shifts, will be permitted to take their three (3) floaters as two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts off if they have actually earned the floaters.

Greg Pretty
Chief Negotiator, Industrial Sector
Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union (FFAW/CAW)
P.O. Box 10
St. John's, NL A1C 5H5 Dear Mr. Pretty:
This is to confirm certain commitments and understandings on behalf of the Company relative to the renewal of the Collective Agreement, to be effective April 1, 2007.
1. Article 1:01
If the Company, by acquisition or merger, acquires any plants in Newfoundland and Labrador, it agrees to meet with the Union as soon as is reasonably practicable after such plant acquisition, at which time the Company will voluntarily recognize the Union to represent the employees of such plant(s) provided that the Plants Collective Agreement then in effect between the Company and the Union will not apply to such employees. However, the parties agree that they will negotiate the terms and conditions of employment applicable to such employees.
2.	Clause 10:05 Two events must occur to activate Clause 10:07:
(I)	An employee must actually work in excess of six (6) hours between the end of his last regular shift and the start of his next regular shift (e.g. between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.); and
(ii) The employee must be working at a point in time eight (8) hours beyond the end of his last regular shift (e.g. regular shift ends at 4:00 p.m. Employee is working at 1:00 a.m. - nine (9) hours after end of his regular shift). When the two (2) conditions apply, the provisions of 10:05 are activated for scheduled overtime and a call-out as per 10:09.
3.	Clause 10:09 Should an employee be called in advance to report for work prior to the start of their next regular shift, and the work runs into the next regular shift,
78
the employee will not get call-out pay as per 10:09 but the appropriate premium rate (e.g. work ends at 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, the next shift is 8:00 a.m. Wednesday. The employee is called by a supervisor at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday and asked to work starting at 6:00 a.m. on Wednesday. This would be treated as a premium payment, or overtime, as a regular application of the contract and not a call-out). A call-out would apply if an employee is called in to do a specific job immediately, at any time between regular shifts, in which case 10:09 would apply as stated. The principle of the call-out would be that the employee would be required to report immediately on receipt of the call.
4.	Article 11 - Overtime
(a)	When an employee is requested to work overtime, which is intended to start before the commencement of his next regular shift, and the work continues to the start of the next regular shift the Company will schedule such work no later than 8:00 p.m, of the previous day. An employee requested to come to work after 8:00 p.m., or an employee who is requested to come to work after the end of his regular shift and before 8:00 p.m., and the work does not continue into the start of his next regular shift, will receive a minimum of four (4) hours at the appropriate rate.
(b)	The Company is prepared to ensure that overtime scheduled on weekends for Production Maintenance, and Office Staff will not be less than two (2) hours and will follow the principle of trying to ensure sufficient work to obtain four (4) hours at appropriate rates. This commitment is made in relation to overtime hours to be worked which are not part of any minimum reporting requirement as prescribed under the these Terms and Conditions of Employment or related to a call back provision.
5.	Article 13 - Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 13 of the Collective
Agreement, it is agreed that for the duration of this Agreement, the current pilot arrangement with respect to holidays at the Port Union and South Dildo Discharge will continue with the exception of the 400-hour floater, which shall be eliminated.
6.	Article 14 - Seniority
(a) Re: Application of 14:02. In the application of this clause, the Company does not require that the first thirty (30) working days be consecutive. There are two (2) principles that apply in the application of the clause:
79
(I) There must be a reasonably sufficient amount of work that would justify the hiring of an employee on a permanent basis; and
(ii) The employee must be accepted as being satisfactory to be hired on a permanent basis.
Sporadic work throughout the year, even though it builds a fairly significant number of hours in total, does not necessarily justify the permanent hiring of an employee. However, where there is a consistent requirement for additional employees to work a significant number of weeks in two (2) to three (3) month periods, which reoccur as part of the cycles of work required at a plant, the Company is prepared to hire additional employees on a permanent basis and place them on the seniority list. At all times the number of employees on the seniority list should be assessed against the number of permanent jobs that are actually available in each classification and in total for each plant location.
(b) Re: Application of 14:04(2) and (3). Where it can be done practically and with minimum disruption in the short-term reorganization of the workforce, the Company is prepared to apply plant-wide seniority in preference to classification seniority for short-term interruptions and lay-offs of more than one (1) day and less than three (3) days in duration. Particular attention will be paid in seasonal plants to ensure that senior employees have the opportunity to remain at work when there is a reduction due to work shortages. Reviews will be undertaken at each location to see what effective practices can be put in place in such situations where there is a reduction in work beyond one (1) day and less than three (3) days.
7.	Article 17 - In addition to Article 17, "Leave of Absence" of the Collective
Agreement, the Company agrees to the following policy for employees requesting leaves to work outside the Company:
(1) If a seniority employee requests a leave of absence to work outside the Company, such leave may be granted provided the leave will be for the full production year, or balance thereof remaining, and can
80
be accommodated at the plant. During such leave the individual shall not earn seniority or service.
(2)	If the employee on such leave is recalled in the next production season and is still working elsewhere he/ she must make a decision to return to work or immediately be removed from the seniority list.
(3)	Each location will meet, separately, with the Company in an effort to continue to clean up the seniority list in each plant.
8.	Article 19 - Committees
The Company will make the following payments for lost time and expenses related to joint Committees:
(a)	Up to 8 hours for time lost from work on a regular working day, for the day on which Committee meetings are held, plus one extra day at 8 hours for related travel time where necessary, per meeting.
(b)	The Company will pay a meal per diem of $38.00 per day, accommodation expenses and cost of transportation as applied by corporate policy. Any future changes with respect to the per diem and travel allowance, during the term of these Terms and Conditions of Employment, will apply to the Union members on the Corporate Committees. The Union members will be required to submit an expense claim with receipts for the expenses incurred related to the meetings of the Corporate Committees. No receipt required for daily meals per diem.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE

Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union (FFAW /CAW)
P.O. Box 10, Cormack Building
2 Steers Cove
St. John's, NL A1C 5H5
Dear Mr. Pretty:
Following recent discussions between the Union and the Company and pursuant to Recommendation No. 2 of the majority Conciliation Board Report, the following confirms certain commitments and understandings on behalf of the Company with respect to south Dildo Discharge operations.
Statutory/Floating Holidays
1.0	All employees who have worked their last scheduled shift immediately preceding the holiday (provided this shift is in the week immediately preceding the holiday) unless absent due to sickness, accident, bereavement or other just cause permitted by the Company; and are in good standing on the seniority list shall be entitled to pay for a regular shift at straight time in addition to any monies received for hours worked on each of the following days:
New Year's Day Good Friday Memorial Day Labour Day Remembrance Day Christmas Day
1.1	The day proclaimed for each of the foregoing holidays shall be the day observed, unless the parties can agree upon an alternate day mutually acceptable to both of them.
1.2	Employees shall not be entitled to a statutory holiday when:
82
a)	they have not attained seniority;
b)	on lay-off, leave of absence, Workers' Compensation and pregnancy leave.
1.3	In addition to the Statutory holidays listed in Item 1.0 above, employees shall
qualify for floating holidays, as follows:
1st	0 hours
2nd	100 hours
3rd	200 hours
4th	600 hours
5th	1000 hours
6th	1500 hours
Such floating holiday may be taken at a time convenient to the employee, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The employee shall have the right to cancel the floating holiday upon giving the Company reasonable notice. If not taken by December 31, in any given year,the floating holiday will be paid for but not carried forward into the following year.
It is agreed that resolution of this issue is on an expressly without prejudice, without precedent basis to the positions of the parties under the Collective Agreement, or otherwise, and that the arrangement will be in effect only for the duration of the current plants agreement; i.e. December 31, 2009.
To signify your agreement with the above, please sign and return one copy of this letter to the undersigned.
Yours sincerely,
83
Memorandum of Understanding
On May 17, 2012, Richard Roberts, Company Representative and George Kelly, Union Representative signed a Memorandum of Understanding consisting of the following clause;
While production is on a three shift basis, regular cleanup hours shall be defined as any hours within the 10 hour period from 1:00 am - 11:00 am at the Port au Choix plant. Hours worked before or after this time period (for cleanup duties only) shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half.
84
