(a) Length of continuous service.
(b)	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern.

7.04	(a) Plant progression lists now in operation may
remain in operation, but shall be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any changes to progression lists will be made in consultation with the Unions. When plant progression lists are not in effect, permanent occupational vacancies above the beginner level will be bulletined within the department or filled by a job request system. A job request system may he put into a department if mutually agreed between the Union and Company. A department job request system will require employees to outline in writing requests for job moves. Departments utilizing job request systems will fill vacancies by selecting from amongst those who have submitted written requests for the job in question from within the department. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the appropriate local Union. With respect to vacancies so filled the seniority date of the successful applicant shall be noted. However, nothing in this article shall be read or construed as preventing the Company from hiring skilled employees to fill such vacancies where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness.
(b) Preference shall be given to an employee according to his seniority, subject to the ^ . requirements and efficiency of operations and 10 * V * * the ability and shill of the employee to fill the normal requirements of the job. y

7.05	The Company shall maintain seniority lists for the department. A copy of such list shall be posted every three (3) months. Two (2) copies shall also be provided to the Unions.
7.06	Where a Statute of Canada so provides, an employee shall maintain and accumulate seniority during service in the Armed Forces of Canada.
7.07	Before filling vacancies in a department or a plant with new employees, full consideration shall be given to any qualified employees who have requested a transfer to the department in which the vacancy exists.

However, in no event may an employee have more than three (3) such applications on file at any one time. The Company shall maintain a file of such “Request for Transfer” application forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, the Personnel Superintendent or designated representative shah meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
15
If there are no “Requests for Transfer” on file from employees deemed acceptable for transfer to the Flin Flon Mill, Warehouse, Surface and Transportation Department or the Flin Flon Mine Department, and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before filling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.

Article 8
REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF FORCES
8.0! The Company and the Unions are committed to exhausting all reasonable efforts to retain senior personnel. Whenever a reduction of force or a reduction {	of hours is necessary, the Company shall give four: /	-(teen (14) calendar days’notice, or fourteen (14) days’
| pay in lieu of such notice, except in the case of temporary reductions due to breakdown, accident, or other emergencies making such notice impossible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will advise employees as soon as possible after a decision is made to reduce hours or manpower.
8.02	In all cases of curtailment of operations, layoff proce-
dures shall be determined in consultation with the Unions. In all cases of reduction in the plant forces (other than temporary layoff not to exceed two (2)	!
weeks resulting from accident, breakdown or other emergency) the Company shall lay off the employees affected in the inverse order of their Company seniority ranking except in those cases where certain specialized skills and capabilities are requirecfto till fne^ normal requirements of the job.	V'
8.03	Employees laid off shall keep the Company advisec^^ of their address or forfeit their right to consideration when the working force is again restored. Notice of restoration shall be given to the employee not less than ten (10) days prior to his recall date by one of the following methods: (i) to the employee personally, or (ii) by leaving a message at the home of the employee, or (iii) by mailing it to him at his last known address by registered mail. The Secretary of the Union will be advised of the method used to try to contact the employee and whether or not the method
L0.&
was successful. Employees who, because of their seniority, have been identified for layoff but at the time of layoff are entitled to or are in receipt of Workers’ Compensation benefits or sick benefits under the Sick Benefit Plan will be laid off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such employees will continue to receive life insurance benefits and Health Plan benefits as though they had not been laid off, but pension and vacation accrual will cease at time of layoff and all earned but unpaid vacation will be paid at that time. Life insurance and Health Plan benefits will cease at the time such employee recovers from disability or at such earlier date in accordance with the terms and policies of the Croup Life Insurance Plan and the Health Plan. If such employee is in receipt of a recall notice but is unable to report for work because of a continuing disability, he shall begin accruing benefits as if he were recalled.
8.04
V?
n
If any employee has followed the above procedure, he shall not lose his seniority status because of a layoff, but his continuous service record shall not be lengthened more than one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days during such layoff.
8.05	An employee who has been recalled after being laid off for any reason outlined in this article and who has previously completed the probationary period outlined in Article 7.02 shall not be considered a probationary employee.
8.06	An employee who, for the convenience and benefit of the employee, is temporarily assigned or transferred to another department at his request instead of being laid off due to lack of work, breakdown or machinery, or other like cause, shall be paid while so employed as follows:
18
(a)	If the regular rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred or assigned is higher than the employee’s regular pay, he shall receive such higher rate provided he can perform the job to the standard normally required.
It (b) If the rate of pay for the job in the department to ^whieh he is transferred is less than the employ-V, <Q * ee's regular rate, he shall be paid a red circle T v' rate.
8.07	An employee who has been temporarily assigned or transferred under Article 8.06 shall, if an additional employee is required in the department from which he was transferred, be given the opportunity to transfer back ahead of other employees who have not worked in that department. Should the employee refuse the opportunity to transfer back to his own occupation, he will no longer retain any right of preference in this matter.
8.08	(a) If an employee is temporarily assigned to a job
by the Company he shall receive the rate for the job or his regular straight time hourly rate, whichever is the greater. This rate also applies to General Holidays if the General Holiday falls within the period of that temporary assignment. Should such temporary assignment exceed thirty (30) calendar days’ duration the employment card rate of the employee will be changed to the rate of the assigned job for the duration of the temporary assignment.
(b)	Senior employees shall receive preference for temporary assignments, provided these employees are on the same shift and are capable of doing the work. In cases of temporary assign-
19
ments extending beyond forty-two (42) calendar days in cases of vacation relief, or thirty (30) calendar days in all other cases, the preference will be given to the senior employee available regardless of the shift, provided this employee is capable of doing the work. This provision will not apply to any subsequent vacancies resulting from the above.
8.09	In this article,
(a)	(i) “Card rate” means the rate shown on the
time card for the job occupation into which an employee has been placed and as it appears on his time card.
t\ .oM
(ii) “Red circled” means a special wage rate.
(b)
v
\\.VA
If an employee as a result of technological change or organizational change is downgraded by the Company into a classification of work paying a lesser wage rate than the regular wage rate of his permanent job, the employee shall maintain the rate of the permanent job which shall be red circled. If such employee is subsequently placed into a card rate which equals or exceeds his red circled rate, he will be removed from the red circled rate and paid that card rate.
(c)	Red circle differentials established after January 1, 1995 shall be reduced by one (1) job class fifteen (15) months after they are established and they shall be further reduced by one (1) job class every three (3) months thereafter until they are eliminated. Red circle differentials established prior to January 1,1995 shall be reduced or eliminated by any increase resulting from an increase in the increment between job classes.
20
(d)
It is a condition of Article 8 that any employee affected by it be required to accept any training the Company offers him and that he accept any other higher-card rate job offered to him by the Company through assignment or promotion, and that he be an applicant for any higher card rate job in his department that is posted.

The names of the employees who will likely be affected by the proposed technological change;
(iii) The rationale for the change and the impact it will have on the Company’s efficiency and economy of operations, and
(iv) The Company’s plan to minimize the impact of the technological change on the employees affected.
As a result of discussions outlined above and where the scope of the technological change necessitates it, a committee will be established by the Union(s) and the Company and will be comprised of representatives from the Company and the affected Union(s).
21
The Company shall provide the members of the committee with materials pertaining to technological change which may be required to ensure that the fullest discussion on such matters as retraining, change of work methods, reorganization of work, change to the method of organization, etc. will take place in an effort to implement change with the least possible disruption and with the maximum possible benefits to the Company and employees. It is understood that if new skills are required, the Company shall take steps to provide training for employees so that, by and large, new skill requirements are met from within the existing work force.
The provisions of this article are intended to assist employees affected by any change described in Article 8.09 (b) to adjust to the effects of the change.
The provisions of the Canada Labour Code, Division IV, Sections 52,54 and 55 do not apply during the term of this Agreement to the Company and the Unions.
If an employee notifies the Company that he wishes his employment to be terminated rather than be downgraded as a result of technological change as now defined in the Canada Labour Code, or is required to transfer to another department in order to maintain his employment, and if such notification is given within fourteen (14) calendar days of that downgrading or transfer, the Company shall terminate his employment mid pay him severance pay of one week’s pay of forty (40) straight hours for each year of the employee’s continued service, up to a maximum of ten (10) weeks.

(a)	Subject to clause (c) below, an employee who is entitled to severance under 8.09 (i) (ii) may, at any point in time between the effective date of the layoff and a period that ends 56 weeks after the date of the commencement of the layoff, elect to relinquish all rights to recall and terminate his employment, and upon doing so, shall be entitled to receive severance pay as defined herein.
\
For the purposes of this Article, the amount that shall be paid as severance pay shall be an amount equal to:
(i) one (1) weeks pay of forty (40) straight time hours for each year of the employee’s continual service with the Company, minus
(ii) any amount paid to him under Article 8.09 (h).
23
This severance pay shall be considered to satisfy the minimum severance requirements that are set foym in the Canada Labour Code. /
(c) An employee who is on layoff for a period of twelve (12) months and who elects to receive severance in accordance with the minimum provisions of the Canada Labour Code shall be paid such severance at the end of the twelve (12) month layoff. Such employee will continue to retain any recall rights that he may have under the Collective Agreement, but will be disentitled from receiving any severance pay under the terms of this Collective Agreement.
This Article 8.09 (i) does not apply in the event of layoffs due to strikes, sit-downs, slow-downs or lockouts.
8.10	(a) There will be no direct layoff or displacement
from the bargaining unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition.

(c)	If a staff employee has never worked in the bargaining unit, he will only be able to enter the
24
bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. That is, he will not be able to displace a bargaining unit employee or be placed in a vacancy if there is notice of impending layoff. Such employee will not be able to utilize his Company seniority for the purpose of answering bulletins, progression moves or transfers for three (3) months from date of placement.
(d)	All efforts will be made to return a staff
employee to the hourly unit in which he most recently worked. Moves will be made in consultation with the affected Unions.
(e)	Staff employees returning to the unit will
receive a red circle rate equal to the rate of the last position previously held in the unit.
(f)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an hourly
employee is transferred to a staff position, there shag be a period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former job in the bargaining unit and the terms of Article 8.10 (a) and(e) will not apply.
8.11	(a) When it is necessary within a department to
remove an employee covered by this Agreement from a bulletin job or progression for technological change as defined in the Canada Labour Code, he shall be assigned to the highest permanent occupation covered by this Agreement in which he has previously held the card rate or, at the employee’s option, to an entry level job or, at the employee’s option, bump down in his present progression. All employees so affected shall be red circled. All moves will be done in consultation with the Union.
25

(b)	In all other cases other than technological change an affected employee, to retain a position, must first bump within his progression. If \ | he is unable to retain a position by this means, 1 an employee will then bump within his section. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, then the employee will bump to another section within his department. If unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump to a position outside his department in the section or progression in which he previously held the highest card rate. It is understood that an employee, in bumping, cannot bump into a job paying a higher card rate than the one he presently holds, nor can he bump into a job he has not previously held.
(c)	If an employee is unable to retain employment by the above method and he has the skill and ability to do a job at a higher rate, hp will only then be allowed to bump up, if ^chooses.
8.12	Tradesmen displaced from their jobs may elect “voluntary lay-off instead of a job in an operating department or severance under Article 8.09 (h). It is understood between the parties that a tradesman electing “voluntary lay-off will do so under the following terms:

Upon the successful completion of a period of apprenticeship training, an apprentice will, subject to the requirements of operations, be employed at the graduate tradesman’s rate in the trade for which he is apprenticed and for this purpose the job bulletin provisions of this Agreement shall not be applicable. The Company agrees to advise an apprentice at least twelve (12) months prior to his expected graduation date whether or not he will be employed at the graduate tradesman’s rate in the trade for which he apprenticed.
Apprentices registered by the Company shall be paid by the Company twenty-five (25) hours per week at their regular hourly rate while attending such government sponsored Apprentice Training Course in relat-

17.04	Subject to the terms of this Collective Agreement, apprentices removed from the apprenticeship program will be offered other employment.
17.05	No rules and regulations regarding apprenticeship training shah conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. In case of conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.
Overtime hours worked by an apprentice shah not be used to reduce the period of apprenticeship but may be used in arriving at the total number of hours required per year.
17.07 An apprentice, who has faithfully and satisfactorily completed his term of instruction will, in consideration thereof, receive from the Company a signed certificate setting forth that he has completed his term of apprenticeship. In addition, each such apprentice shah receive a bonus of $100.00. This bonus is offered solely as an inducement to apprentices to fully and satisfactorily complete their contracts and it is understood that no part thereof shall be deemed earned until the contract has been fully and satisfactorily completed. Each employee who completes his apprenticeship with the Company on or after October 1,1979 will receive $1,000.00 after one (1) year as a journeyman tradesman with the Company. In addition, each employee who subsequently attains his 2nd Class Power Engineering certificate issued by the Manitoba Department of Education shah receive a bonus of $100.00. In addition, he will receive $1,000.00 after
57
17.06
one (1) year as a 2nd Class Power Engineer with the Company. It is understood that an individual will only be eligible to receive the foregoing payments from the Company once during their lifetime. Further, if an individual is certified in one trade and enters into an apprenticeship for another trade, he shall not be eligible for the payments in question.
17.08	The starting wage rate for an employee who is accepted by the Company as an apprentice and is then receiving a wage rate higher than the starting rate for his apprenticeship shall not have his rate reduced below the “twelve (12) months” rate.
17.09	While an apprentice is assigned the responsibility of a maintenance or construction job, or the direction of other apprentices by the Company, or is responsible for the maintenance function of an operating unit such as a mine for a minimum of one (1) full shift, he shall receive a rate of pay not less than the starter rate of pay for the trade in which he is an apprentice, for all such shifts worked. The minimum of one (1) full shift requirement will be waived in cases of call-outs.
17.10	The Company agrees to pay a two (2) job class additive for journeyman tradesmen with Provincial or Interprovincial Government Certification. It is understood that this certification may have been attained through successfully completing a Government approved apprenticeship program or through examination.

Article 19
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
19.01	Personal tools broken in service or lost in inaccessible places shall be replaced by tools of equal value by the Company, unless an investigation by the Company and the Union proves that the wear or breakage or loss was due to the employee’s carelessness or neglect.
19.02	The clothing allowance now in effect shall not apply to employees of a service department assigned to any plant for regular duty. Employees assigned to the plants for temporary duty shall be recompensed for damage to clothing only when such damage and amount are approved by the department superintendent.
19.03	It is agreed that Union bulletin boards may be used for Union notices only, but it is understood that no political or non-Union contentious materials will be posted. Union bulletin boards will be provided in designated lunch rooms and Company operated cafeterias.
19.04	The Company will give to all employees a copy of this Agreement.
19.05	There will be no Union activity on Company time except that necessary in connection with the handling of grievances and the enforcement of this Agreement; but nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the officers of the Union, who are also employees of the Company, from looking after the matters of membership dues, initiation fees, assessments and solicitation of membership, provided it is done after working hours or during non-compensable
60
lunch hours and does not interfere with the operation of the plant.
19.06	(i) The Company agrees that the Unions have an
understandable concern over “contracting out” by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the employees.
I The Company will continue to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Unions agree that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1.	The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of operations and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
2.	The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the Presidents or their designate of the affected Unions prior to awarding a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside Company property. The Company will
61
also consult with the appropriate Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the affected Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
The parties understand and agree that any information referred to in this Section (2) and the disclosure of such information by the Company to the Unions is expressly subject to and contingent upon any confi-
62
dential, sensitive, proprietary, trade secrets or contractual rights or restrictions of any third party or the Company. Moreover, any such information shall be provided to the local Union Executive only, and shall be used only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and not for any other purposes whatsoever, and shall not be disclosed to any other persons or parties, including all Union members other than the local Union Executive.
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
5.	It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, the Unions and senior management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
6.	The Company agrees that no employee shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
63
(ii) Salaried supervisors whose regular jobs are not in this Agreement shall not work on any jobs which are included in this Agreement except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimenting, protecting the safety of employees or equipment, periods of production difficulties or in emergencies when regular employees are not reasonably available.
19.07	Where the departmental Safety and Health
Committee and the department superintendent agree that work is of an exceptionally hazardous nature, employees engaged in this type of work shall receive a bonus of fifteen cents (150) per hour, over and above their regular rate, such bonus to be paid for not less than one (1) full shift. This shall not apply to mining operations or rigging crews.
19.08	The Company will continue its present practice of supplying free transportation to and from a Company designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.09.
Where an employee is required by the Company to travel in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way to or from a Company designated point and the outlying job site, outside the time of his regularly scheduled shift, a travelling allowance will be paid. Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the thirty (30) minute portion will be paid. Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
64
19.09 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19.08, and in lieu of those provisions, the present special travel arrangement in respect of travel to and from Flin Flon and Snow Lake will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement.
19.10	(i)
A
P
!b
(ii)
A maximum bereavement leave of ten (10) calendar days will be granted to an employee, commencing on the day of the death of his spouse, son or daughter in order to attend the funeral. For each day the employee was regularly scheduled to work during such leave he shall be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
A maximum bereavement leave of three (3) scheduled working days will be granted to an employee upon the death of his mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-m-law, sis-ter-m-law, brother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, spouse’s grandmother and spouse’s grandfather, grandchild, and any relative permanently residing in the employee’s household or with whom the employee resides, in order to attend the funeral. In this situation the bereavement leave will be extended by two (2) scheduled working days if the employee attends the funeral outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence the employee shall be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
(iii) In the event that an employee’s bereavement leave overlaps or occurs during his vacation period his vacation time will be extended by the number of days that his bereavement leave encroaches on it.
65
(iv)	To qualify for bereavement leave pursuant to
19.10 (i), 19.10 (ii) or 19.10 (iii) the employee shall notify his immediate supervisor as soon as possible following the bereavement.
(v)	Notwithstanding the terms of 19.10(i) and
19.10(ii) under the Canada Labour Code an employee is entitled to three (3) calendar days bereavement leave immediately following the death of the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, mother, father, sister brother, mother-in-law or father-in-law. There is no requirement under the Code to attend the funeral to be eligible for such leave.

Article 20
NO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT
20.01	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any of the members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in any
66
labour organization or by reason of sex, race, national origin, colour, religion or physical disability.
DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE
21.01	The following procedure shall govern in all cases of
discipline:
(a)	The Company shall have the right to discipline any employee for sufficient and just cause.
(b)	Employees will be advised of any discipline as soon as possible following the incident giving rise to the discipline.
(c)	When an employee is formally disciplined
while at work, a steward will attend. Every reasonable effort will be made to have the attending steward be from his own jurisdiction. An opportunity will be given to the steward to discuss the circumstances surrounding the discipline with the superintendent or his representative during the discipline procedure. The employee and his Union will be made aware of any information which is being considered for use in the discipline and informed of any information which is being placed in the employee file that could be used for discipline; and
(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, there will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts. It is understood that any discipline stemming from the inves-
67
tigation will be solely determined by management. Every reasonable effort will be made to have this investigation completed within seven (7) calendar days. Suspensions will be administered at the end of an employee’s shift whenever appropriate and possible, it being understood there are circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the workplace immediately following the incident. Except in those circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the property immediately, when a suspension is imposed the suspension will not be served, if the employee decides to file a grievance on the matter, until Step 2 of the grievance procedure has been completed.
(e)	The employee and the steward in attendance will receive a written copy of the suspension slip or discharge letter. Also, the appropriate Union shall be advised promptly in writing by the Company of the reason or reasons for such suspension or discharge.
21.02	If any employee feels that he has been unjustly disciplined, he shall have the right of appeal through the grievance procedure at Step 2. Such appeal must be filed in writing by the Union with the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of notification of discipline and, unless so tiled, the right of appeal shall be lost.
21.03	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay period next
68
preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
21.04
y
3
All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of 480 hours worked (including overtime hours worked). During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shah be deemed for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
21.05	Any employee with more than one (1) year’s seniority may once annually request a formal evaluation from his supervisor. In addition, once yearly an employee may request to review his departmental employee file. The written evaluation will include items such as attendance, disciplinary action, pro-motability and attitude to work and safety.
Article 22
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
22.01	Every effort will be made to resolve differences before grievances are filed. Failing that, the parties agree that grievances and grievance meetings should be treated as opportunities for mutual problem solving. Should any difference arise between the Company and any of the employees from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, an earnest effort will be made to settle such grievance without
69
undue delay. All grievances, in order to settle them as quickly as possible, will have to be submitted to the Company representative within fourteen (14) calendar days of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the grievance and shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided. Every reasonable effort will be made to schedule Step 1 and 2 grievance meetings during the griever’s working hours. Failing that, every reasonable effort will be made to hold the meeting immediately before or after the griever’s working hours. Also, every effort will be made to include all involved parties (original steward, supervisors, etc.) in all steps of the grievance procedure.
22.02	Step 1 -- Any employee with a personal grievance must take the matter up with his front line supervisor accompanied by a Union steward of his choice from his own department. Consistent with the parties’ intent to empower stewards and supervisors, Step 1 resolutions will be made without prejudice or precedent.
22.03	Step 2 -- Failing satisfactory settlement within seven (7) calendar days after presentation at Step 1, the chief steward and/or steward shall meet with the department superintendent and present the case to him with the griever, if desired. Such meeting with the department superintendent shall take place within seven (7) calendar days of completion of Stop 1.
22.04	Stop 3 -- Failing satisfactory settlement within seven (7) calendar days after Step 2, the Grievance Committee shall present the matter to the appropriate manager or his designated representative within seven (7) calendar days thereafter. This designated representative is not to be the same individual who replied at Stop 2. The Union representative or Business Agent may be present at this step. The
70
griever and/or a department representative may also be in attendance. Such meeting with the manager or his designated representative shall take place within seven (7) calendar days of notification or at a time mutually agreed upon.
22.05	Step 4 -- If settlement is not made within seven (7) calendar days under Step 3, the Grievance Committee may refer the grievance to an Arbitration Board within thirty (30) calendar days after the answer in writing in Step 3 has been given, but not later. The Grievance Committee shall notify the Company as soon as possible within the aforesaid thirty (30) calendar days of its intention to refer the matter to an Arbitration Board.
22.06	Grievances other than a personal grievance that concern the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement may be initiated by the Union and shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this article beginning at Step 3.
22.07	(a) Personal grievances shall be presented in writ-
ing to the department superintendent in Step 2 in Article 22.03.
(b)	The department superintendent’s reply to the
Step 2 grievance shah be in writing.
(c)	Grievances other than personal grievances shall be presented in writing by the Grievance Committee to the appropriate manager in Article 22.06.
22.08	If it should be found inexpedient to carry out promptly the clauses of this article, due to absence of a Company official from the vicinity, a substitute may
71
be appointed by the Company with full power to effect settlement of grievances, or the step of grievance procedure in which said official is concerned may be eliminated from the procedure.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #10
To the Unions:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1)	Subject to the requirements of operations, every effort will be made to grant employees leaves of absence of a personal nature.
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
If an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will be considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
100
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee’s request).
Employee would only be required to take an unbooked “regular” vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
Employee would take a “special” vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
6)	In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
It was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

To the Unions:
\\
S i , RE: PROFIT SHARING PLAN
. V The Company agrees to establish a Profit Sharing Plan with effect as of January 1, 1994. The Plan, ^which shall not be amended without agreement of the K ^ * Unions, includes all employees in die Flin Flon/Snow . ' Lake ooerations. with the exception of executive officers of the Company and all others who participate in any management incentive plans other than this Profit sharing Plan.
2.	At the end of each calendar year, ten percent (10%) of the Company’s “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” if positive, as defined in point 3 of this letter, shall be distributed on the first payday following the issue of the Profit Sharing Plan Statement to the hourly and salaried employees on the following basis:
a)	Hourly and salaried employees who are employed for the full year shall receive a full and equal share.
b)	Employees who retire or are laid off during the year shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
c)	Employees who are hired or are recalled during the year and are on the payroll at year end shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
102
It is understood between the parties that employees who quit or are terminated during the year will not be afforded profit sharing. It is further understood that quarterly pro rata basis shall mean an eligible employee who was on the payroll during any portion of a quarter will be afforded profit sharing as if he worked that full quarter.
By way of example, if an employee retires in August, he would receive three (3) quarters of the profit sharing payment afforded an employee who was on the payroll for a full year.
Any negative “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” for the calendar year shall be eliminated and not carried forward to future years.
3.	For the purposes of this Profit Sharing Plan “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” shall comprise “Net Income (Loss)” calculated in accordance with Minorco's accounting policies and International Accounting Standards with the following exclusions:
(i)	The greater of Profit Sharing Plan costs or Lump Sum Payment costs
(ii)	Provisions for deferred income tax
(iii)	The Company’s portion of any gains which result in payments under a Gainsharing Plan during the year including the annual global reserve payout.
4.	There is no cap on the size of the Profit Sharing Plan.
5.	Verification
(i) Upon release of Minorco's annual results, the Company shall provide the Unions with an audited Profit Sharing Plan Statement for
103
that fiscal period. Such statement shall include verification of the exclusions per point 3 (i), (ii) and (iii).
6.	Lump Sum Payment
For the calendar years 1997 and 1998, the greater of the amount determined per the Profit Sharing Plan above or an amount determined per a Lump Sum Payment formula will be paid to employees. For greater clarity, only the greater of the Profit Sharing Payment or the Lump Sum Payment will be paid for each year.
The Lump Sum Payment formula will be based on actual operating earnings adjusted for:
(i)	Unfavourable cost/volume variance (if any) for each of the approved 1997 and 1998 budgets
(ii)	The impact of a	capital write-down as at
December 31, 1996, or any additional write-down during 1997 or 1998 arising as a result of an economic impairment (if any), on 1997 and 1998 non-cash rates.
For purposes of this Lump Sum Payment formula, operating earnings shall be defined as the “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” as defined in 3 above before:
(i)	Exploration
(ii)	Other financing costs
(iii)	Interest expense
(iv)	Taxes
The adjusted operating earnings so calculated will be compared to the following chart to determine if the amount is greater than the amount calculated per the Profit Sharing Plan.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #15 To the Unions:
RE: TRAINING AND JOB SECURITY FOR SENIOR EMPLOYEES
This will confirm discussions held at 1993 bargaining with regard to training and job security for senior employees within a trade. As agreed, in the event lay-offs become necessary during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, junior employees in a trade will be laid off unless such employees have received specialized training as a result of being the successful applicant for a plant wide training posting. Such training postings will be awarded to senior qualified applicants within a trade. It was agreed that the only posting that is deemed to be a training posting under the terms of this letter, that was filled prior to the signing of the October 1, 1993 Collective Agreement, is a posting for Specialist Welder. This agreement was made with the understanding that senior Boilermaker/Welders who wish to obtain a pressure ticket will be given the opportunity to do so.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicants for training postings, with fifteen (15) or more years of service, may be bypassed for training with the understanding employees with fifteen (15) or more years of service will be retained over junior employees within a trade with such training, in the event of a lay-off. Prior to bypassing a senior employee for such training, the President of the Union in question will be consulted.
As discussed at 1993 bargaining, the need for training that would call for plant wide training postings has not yet been determined, but the need is anticipated to be infrequent. That being the case, prior to such training being posted, the Company will consult with the President of the Union in question.
It is further understood that if a tradesman is awarded a training posting he may be restricted from work location moves or other training postings for a period of time equivalent to two
(2)	times the training period.

RE: SNOW LAKE TRAVEL
Further to negotiations with the Joint Bargaining Committee, 1987, towards concluding a Collective Bargaining Agreement effective October 1, 1987 the Company has agreed to resubmit Letters of Agreement regarding past practise of providing transportation to Snow Lake. It is, therefore, the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
112
Flin Flon employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2 l/2) hours of straight time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (2 ty2) hours of straight time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools from Snow Lake when they return from the completion of a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable. The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare, Flin Flon to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Flin Flon for a temporary period.

q RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility
119
will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company’s Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate..
b)	Trades - In order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
c)	Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a sub-committee of the HBM&S Restructuring Committee will be established consisting of one
120
(1) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (1) representative of the Association of Flin Flon Trade Unions and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills required to perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
It is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1, 1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid off unless such lay-offs are the result of the following:
121
a)	Lay-offs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Lay-offs resulting from decreased manning levels required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	Lay-offs of any employee hired after October 1,
1996.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	Lay-offs due to closure, sale or merger, or significant reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It is understood that any lay-off resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterized as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

RE: GRADUATE ELECTRICIANS
Further to discussions with the Joint Bargaining Committee 1987 regarding moves to different work locations for graduate electricians in Flin Flon, it is agreed that notices will be posted to advise of vacancies in a particular work location. The purpose of such notices will be for the graduate electrician to indicate his preference to move to the vacancy and since such moves are not considered to be an upgrading or downgrading and the rate of pay does not change, Article 7.01 does not apply.
The Company will determine who will be moved or assigned to the vacancy and, in making such determination, will consider factors such as:
1)	the work requirements in each work location, and
2)	the relative skill, ability and physical fitness of the employees to fulfil such requirements, and
3)	the graduate seniority, including time served as an apprentice with the Company since his most recent date of hire, of any electrician who has answered the notice.
If, in the opinion of the Company, there is not a suitable candidate for the vacancy from those who have applied to the notice, or if no one has applied to the notice, then the Company will select the employee to be assigned.
123
It is understood between the parties that in the event the Company decides to transfer tradesmen presently in Department 69 into operating departments, they will be considered as remaining in Department 69 for the purposes of this letter.

1)	The work requirements in each work location.
2)	The relative skill, ability and physical fitness of the employees to fulfil such requirements.
124
3)	It is understood between the parties that if specialized skills are required, those requirements will be outlined on the notice of permanent vacancy and that the Union will be consulted prior to that notice being posted.
4)	If an employee is moved from one work location to another, there shall be a period of assessment of up to forty-five (45) calendar days during which the Company may permanently reassign the employee back to his former work location.
5)	The Company also reserves the right to temporarily move employees from time to time from their permanent work location in order to:
Maintain familiarity of the various work locations among as many tradesmen as the Company deems necessary.
Carry out installations or repairs where extra manpower is required to complete the work on a timely basis.
Provide for absences due to vacations, sickness, sudden terminations or any other like cause.
It is understood that if a senior applicant is bypassed, he can approach his supervisor who will advise him of the reasons why he was not afforded the work location move.
It is understood that temporary assignments within the permanent work location known as the Outside Floor Mechanics shall be handled as they have been historically and shall not be subject to the terms of this letter. It is further understood that in the event the Company decides to transfer tradesmen presently in Department 60 into operating departments, they

RE: ELECTRONIC MONITORING
The primary function of electronic monitoring equipment is to observe, measure and monitor production difficulties, problem areas, processes, troubleshooting, etc.
Electronic monitoring equipment is not intended for invading the privacy of employees or to administer undue disciplinary action; however, employees should be aware that performance could be monitored as a by-product of electronic monitoring.
It is agreed that in the event of a criminal investigation (i.e. RCMP), employees may not be notified of the installation of electronic monitoring equipment.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #44
To the Unions:
RE: STAFF TO HOURLY -1993/94 REDUCTIONS NO LAY-OFF OR DISPLACEMENT
There will be no direct lay-off or displacement from the bargaining unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition. That being the case, for each staff employee returning to the bargaining unit, one hourly employee will be removed from the lay-off list.
It is understood between the parties that this approach may, for a time, cause the Company to carry employees beyond those required and that this excess will only be eliminated or reduced by attrition (quits, retirements, terminations, etc.) or the requirement for additional manpower (e.g. Westarm).
The accounting for this attrition will begin for Trades and Steel on the date a staff employee’s return to the individual bargaining unit would have resulted in the lay-off of an hourly employee.

RE: RECALL RIGHTS
This will confirm the agreement reached at 1993 bargaining that an employee will not lose recall rights if he turns down seasonal work, nor if he declines recall to a department other than that in which he worked at time of lay-off.
It is further understood between the parties that a tradesman will be removed from the recall list for positions certified to the United Steelworkers of America if he declines recall to any such position once laid off.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #48 To the Unions:
RE: SPECIAL VACATION ACCRUAL
The parties agreed at 1993 bargaining that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 15.10, effective October 1, 1994 employees who have three (3) or more years of service who are laid
145
off for ninety (90) calendar days or more, or who retire, will be afforded special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis at time of lay-off or retirement. That is, after three (3) years of service, employees who are laid off or who retire will be afforded one-third (1/3) of the three (3) week special vacation allotment for each full year of employment.
By way of example, special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis shall mean an employee who has been on the payroll for five (5) years and three (3) months at time of lay-off will be entitled to two weeks’ special vacation pay in addition to that earned but not taken on obtaining three (3) years of service. An employee with three (3) years and six (6) months of service at time of lay-off will be entitled to no additional special vacation.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #49 To the Unions:
RE: HBM&S AS SECOND PAYER FOR DRUGS
It is agreed between the parties that the Company will continue to be the second payer for drugs as outlined in Article 13.04. That is, the Company will be responsible for paying for only the non-recoverable portion of eligible drug costs for
146
regular participating status members and special participating group members.
It is understood between the parties that the Company will, retroactive to January 1, 1997, provide members with a vision care benefit so long as the cost of that benefit to the Company is offset by an equal amount of savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments. The vision care benefit shah be for the cost of prescription lenses, frames and contact lenses to a maximum of $100 every twenty-four (24) months for eligible members.
For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the expression “savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments” shall be defined to mean the reduced Company costs that can be established as being solely attributable to the Company being the secondary rather than the primary payer for drugs covered under Article 13.04 (c) of the Collective Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “savings”). Savings shall include savings related to all bargaining and non-bargaming unit personnel (both active and retired), and the cost of the vision care benefits shall be based on the cost required to extend the benefit to all such bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired).
The Company will review the savings that are available following each calendar quarter during the years of 1997, 1998 and 1999 to determine if there are sufficient savings available to provide the vision care benefit. Savings may be carried forward from quarter to quarter within a calendar year, but shall not be carried forward from one calendar year to the next.
Members will remit vision care claims direct to the carrier, Manitoba Blue Cross, who will in turn process and pay on a first in, first pay basis provided that the savings are available. If savings are not immediately available, the
147
claims shall be accumulated again on a first in basis and processed and paid in that order provided savings become available within the calendar year.
It is further understood that there will be no obligation by the Company to purchase any additional benefits or to make any concessions related to any subsequent savings other than those set forth herein.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #SO
RE: COMMITMENT TO COST AND MANPOWER REDUCTIONS
This will confirm the agreement reached between the parties at 1996 bargaining and their commitments with regard to cost and manpower reductions. The parties recognize the need for cost and manpower reductions in 1997 and beyond to enhance our chances of survival.
It is understood that there is a need to reduce operating costs in 1997 by $30 million and, as part of this effort, the Company has decided that the hourly Steelworker and TVades Association memberships will be reduced by 48. These reductions will be measured against the January 1, 1997 budgeted manpower number of 982 which does not include hourly employees who may need to be laid off in
148
1997 as a result of the Westarm Mine closure (37 employees as of February 7,1997).
It is understood that 48 Steelworker and Trades Association positions will be reduced by voluntary means. To this end, incentive programs have been put in place. It is understood that it may have the effect of reducing the Steelworker and Trades Association memberships by more than the target of 48.
In association with the Company’s commitment to reduce manpower by 48 by voluntary means in 1997, the Unions underscore their commitment to the terms of Letter #26 by the following:
1.	Each Union President will communicate in writing to their members the need and their support for the flexible use of employees’ skills.
2.	The parties will work together to educate the employees of the necessity for flexibility to reduce costs and improve productivity while adhering to safe working practices and standards.
3.	To not allow their demonstrated commitment to waiver in the face of disputes over other issues.

SENIORITY
7.01	In all cases of upgrading, downgrading, increase or decrease in forces or work location moves, the following factors shall be considered:
(a)	Length of continuous service.
(b)	Ability, skill and physical fitness.
(c)	If, when the Company is considering the merits of persons involved in this article, the factors of ability, skill and physical fitness appear to be relatively equal, length of continuous service shall govern. Length of continuous service will be based on Company service rather than department service.
11
It is understood between the parties that work location moves within a classification will be administered in accordance with Letter #28 of the
Collective Agreement.
7.02	All new or rehired employees shall be employed as probationary employees for a period of forty (40) straight time working shifts. Probationary employees shall have recourse to the grievance procedure in all matters and during the probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed to be for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
7.03	Students hired temporarily for the period between semesters will continue to forego seniority rights if their period of employment should extend past the probationary forty (40) straight time working shifts. Students hired for the summer period (April 15 through September 15) will be terminated at the end of the summer period (September 15) and then considered eligible for rehire as a permanent employee.

7.04	(a) Plant progression lists now in operation may
remain in operation, but shall be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Any changes to progression lists will be made in consultation with the Union. When plant progression lists are not in effect, permanent occupational vacancies above the beginner level in the department
12
will be bulletined within the department. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the expiration date of the bulletin, the Company shall choose the successful applicant, if any, and place him in the vacancy. The name of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted on the bulletin board on which the notice of such vacancy was posted and a copy of such bulletin will be forwarded to the Union. With respect to vacancies so filled the seniority date of the successful applicant shall be noted. However, nothing in this article shall be read or construed as preventing the Company from hiring skilled employees to fill such vacancies where current employees do not possess adequate ability, skill and physical fitness.
(b)	Preference shall be given to an employee according to his seniority, subject to the requirements and efficiency of operations and the ability and skill of the employee to till the normal requirements of the job.
(c)	Successful bidding on job bulletins under this clause shall be limited to three (3) per calendar year.
(d)	In the event the Company is unable to place the successful applicant in a vacancy within twenty-one (21) calendar days of being awarded a bulletin, the employee will be paid the higher of the regular hourly rate of the bulletin job or the rate of the job he is performing until he is placed in the vacancy.
7.05	The Company shall maintain seniority lists for the department. A copy of such list shall be posted every three (3) months. Two (2) copies shall also be provided to the Union.
13
7.06	Where a Statute of Canada so provides, an employee shall maintain and accumulate seniority during service in the Armed Forces of Canada.
7.07	Before filling vacancies in a department or a plant with new employees, full consideration shall be given to any qualified employees who have requested a transfer to the department in which the vacancy exists.
An employee wishing such transfer shall file a written “Request for Transfer” application form with the Employment Office at Flin Flon or the General Office at Snow Lake. An employee’s application shall lapse one (1) year after the date of filing but may be renewed from year to year at his request. However, in no event may an employee have more than three
(3)	such applications on file at any one time. The Company shall maintain a file of such “Request for Transfer” application forms. Quarterly, at the request of the Union, the Personnel Superintendent or designated representative shall meet with a representative of the Union to review any outstanding requests for transfer.
If there are no “Requests for Transfer” on file from employees deemed acceptable for transfer to the Flin Flon Mill, Warehouse, Surface and Transportation Department or the Flin Flon Mine Department, and a vacancy arises in one of these departments, the Company will post a notice and give full consideration to those applying before filling the vacancy with a new employee.
The above procedure is not necessary when an employee is transferring from one section to another within the same department.
14
If an employee is transferred there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former department and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job.
7.08	If an employee is transferred from one section to another within the same department there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former section and job. Any employee who may have been appointed by bulletin or otherwise to fill any vacancies created by such transfer shall thereupon revert to his former job. Past practice with respect to moves within plant progression lists shall remain in effect.

Article 8
REDUCTION AND RESTORATION OF FORCES
8.01	The Company and the Union are committed to exhausting all reasonable efforts to retain senior personnel. Whenever a reduction of force or a reduction of hours is necessary, the Company shall give fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice, or fourteen (14) days’ pay in lieu of such notice, except in the case of temporary reductions due to breakdown, accident, or other emergencies making such notice impossible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will
15
advise employees as soon as possible after a decision is made to reduce hours or manpower.
8.02	In all cases of curtailment of operations, lay-off procedures shall be determined in consultation with the Union. In all cases of reduction in the plant forces (other than temporary lay-off not to exceed two (2) weeks resulting from accident, breakdown or other emergency) the Company shah lay off the employees affected in the inverse order of their Company seniority ranking except in those cases where certain specialized skills and capabilities are required to fill the normal requirements of the job.
8.03	Employees laid off shall keep the Company advised of their address or forfeit their right to consideration when the working force is again restored. Notice of restoration shall be given to the employee not less than ten (10) days prior to his recall date by one of the following methods: (i) to the employee personally, or (ii) by leaving a message at the home of the employee, or (iii) by mailing it to him at his last known address by registered mail. The Secretary of the Union will be advised of the method used to try to contact the employee and whether or not the method was successful. Employees who, because of their seniority, have been identified for lay-off but at the time of lay-off are entitled to or are in receipt of Workers’ Compensation benefits or sick benefits under the Sick Benefit Plan will be laid off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such employees will continue to receive life insurance benefits and Health Plan benefits as though they had not been laid off, but pension and vacation accrual will cease at time of layoff and all earned but unpaid vacation will be paid at that time. Life insurance and Health Plan benefits will cease at the time such employee recovers from disability or at such earlier date in accordance with
16
the terms and policies of the Group Life Insurance Plan and the Health Plan. If such employee is in receipt of a recall notice but is unable to report for work because of a continuing disability, he shall begin accruing benefits as if he were recalled.
8.04	If any employee has followed the above procedure, he shall not lose his seniority status because of a layoff, but his continuous service record shall not be lengthened more than one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days during such lay-off.
8.05	An employee who has been recalled after being laid off for any reason outlined in this article and who has previously completed the probationary period outlined in Article 7.02 shall not be considered a probationary employee.
8.06	An employee who, for the convenience and benefit of the employee, is temporarily assigned or transferred to another department at his request instead of being laid off due to lack of work, breakdown or machinery, or other like cause, shall be paid while so employed as follows:
(a)	If the regular rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred or assigned is higher than the employee’s regular pay, he shall receive such higher rate provided he can perform the job to the standard normally required.
(b)	If the rate of pay for the job in the department to which he is transferred is less than the employee’s regular rate, he shall be paid a red circle rate.
8.07	An employee who has been temporarily assigned or transferred under Article 8.06 shall, if an additional employee is required in the department from which
17
he was transferred, be given the opportunity to transfer back ahead of other employees who have not worked in that department. Should the employee refuse the opportunity to transfer back to his own occupation, he will no longer retain any right of preference in this matter.
8.08	(a) If an employee is temporarily assigned to a job
by the Company he shall receive the rate for the job or his regular straight time hourly rate, whichever is the greater. This rate also applies to General Holidays if the General Holiday falls within the period of that temporary assignment. Should such temporary assignment exceed thirty (30) calendar days’ duration the employment card rate of the employee will be changed to the rate of the assigned job for the duration of the temporary assignment.
(b)	Senior employees shall receive preference for temporary assignments, provided these employees are on the same shift and are capable of doing the work. In cases of temporary assignments extending beyond forty-two (42) calendar days in cases of vacation relief, or thirty (30) calendar days in all other cases, the preference will be given to the senior employee available regardless of the shift, provided this employee is capable of doing the work. This provision will not apply to any subsequent vacancies resulting from the above.
8.09	In this article.
(a)	(i) “Card rate” means the rate shown on the
time card for the job occupation into which an employee has been placed and as it appears on his time card.
18
(ii) “Red circled” means a special wage rate.
(b)	If an employee as a result of technological
change or organizational change is downgraded by the Company into a classification of work paying a lesser wage rate than the regular wage rate of his permanent job, the employee shall maintain the rate of the permanent job which shall be red circled. If such employee is subsequently placed into a card rate which equals or exceeds his red circled rate, he will be removed from the red circled rate and paid that card rate.
(c)	Red circle differentials established after January 1,1995 shall be reduced by one (1) job class fifteen (15) months after they are established and they shall be further reduced by one (1) job class every three (3) months thereafter until they are eliminated. Red circle differentials established prior to January 1, 1995 shall be reduced or eliminated by any increase resulting from an increase in the increment between job classes.
(d)	It is a condition of Article 8 that any employee affected by it be required to accept any training the Company offers him and that he accept any other higher card rate job offered to him by the Company through assignment or promotion, and that he be an applicant for any higher card rate job in his department that is posted.
(e)	The Company shall give one hundred twenty (120) calendar days’ notice prior to introducing technological change as described in Article
8.09	(b).
19

(i)	A detailed description of the nature of the proposed technological change;
(ii)	The names of the employees who will
likely be affected by the proposed technological change;
(iii)	The rationale for the change and the impact it will have on the Company’s efficiency and economy of operations, and
(iv)	The Company’s plan to minimize the impact of the technological change on the employees affected.
As a result of discussions outlined above and where the scope of the technological change necessitates it, a committee will be established by the Union and the Company and will be comprised of representatives from the Company and the Union.
The Company shall provide the members of the committee with materials pertaining to technological change which may be required to ensure that the fullest discussion on such matters as retraining, change of work methods, reorganization of work, change to the method of organization, etc. will take place in an effort to implement change with the least possible disruption and with the maximum possible benefits to the Company and employees. It is understood that if new skills are required, the Company shall
20
take steps to provide training for employees so that, by and large, new skill requirements are met from within the existing work force.
(f)	The provisions of this article are intended to assist employees affected by any change described in Article 8.09 (b) to adjust to the effects of the change.
(g)	The provisions of the Canada Labour Code,
Division IV, Sections 52, 54 and 55 do not apply during the term of this Agreement to the Company and the Union.
(h)	If an employee notifies the Company that he wishes his employment to be terminated rather than be downgraded as a result of technological change as now defined in the Canada Labour Code, or is required to transfer to another department in order to maintain his employment, and if such notification is given within fourteen (14) calendar days of that downgrading or transfer, the Company shall terminate his employment and pay him severance pay of one week’s pay of forty (40) straight horn's for each year of the employee’s continued service, up to a maximum of ten (10) weeks.
(i)	An employee who
(i)	has at least one (1) year of continuous service with the Company, and
(ii)	is laid off after exhausting all “bumping rights” as per Article 8.02 and who is advised by the Company that he will be laid off for at least ninety (90) calendar days or who is in fact laid off for at least ninety (90) calendar days,
21
shah be entitled to payment of severance pay, as defined in this Article, as follows:
(a)	Subject to clause (c) below, an employee who is entitled to severance under 8.09 (i) (ii) may, at any point in time between the effective date of the layoff and a period that ends 56 weeks after the date of the commencement of the lay-off, elect to relinquish all rights to recall and terminate his employment, and upon doing so, shall be entitled to receive severance pay as defined herein.
(b)	For the purposes of this Article, the amount that shall be paid as severance pay shall be an amount equal to:
(i)	one (1) week’s pay of forty (40) straight time hours for each year of the employee’s continual service with the Company, minus
(ii)	any amount paid to him under Article 8.09
(h).
This severance pay shall be considered to satisfy the minimum severance requirements that are set forth in the Canada Labour Code.
(c)	An employee who is on lay-off for a period of twelve (12) months and who elects to receive severance in accordance with the minimum provisions of the Canada Labour Code shall be paid such severance at the end of the twelve (12) month lay-off. Such employee will continue to retain any recall rights that he may have under the Collective Agreement, but will be disentitled from receiving any severance pay under the terms of this Collective Agreement.
22
This Article 8.09 (i) does not apply in the event of lay-offs due to strikes, sit-downs, slow-downs or lockouts.
8.10	(a) There will be no direct lay-off or displacement
from the bargaining unit resulting from a staff employee returning to the bargaining unit. Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition.
(b)	A staff employee returning to the unit will
return to an entry level position. If possible, this move will be to the department in which he most previously worked as an hourly employee. After thirty (30) days such employee may use his Company seniority to apply for bulletins, transfers or progression moves.
(c)	If a staff employee has never worked in the bargaining unit, he will only be able to enter the bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. That is, he will not be able to displace a bargaining unit employee or be placed in a vacancy if there is notice of impending lay-off. Such employee will not be able to utilize his Company seniority for the purpose of answering bulletins, progression moves or transfers for three (3) months from date of placement.
(d)	All efforts will be made to return a staff
employee to the hourly unit in which he most recently worked. Moves will be made in consultation with the Union.
(e)	Staff employees returning to the unit will
receive a red circle rate equal to the rate of the last position previously held in the unit.
23
(f)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an hourly employee is transferred to a staff position, there shall be a period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his retransfer to his former job in the bargaining unit and the terms of Article 8.10 (a) and(e) will not apply.
8.11	(a) When it is necessary within a department to
remove an employee covered by this Agreement from a bulletin job or progression for technological change as defined in the Canada Labour Code, he shall he assigned to the highest permanent occupation covered by this Agreement in which he has previously held the card rate or, at the employee’s option, to an entry level job or, at the employee’s option, bump down in his present progression. All employees so affected shall be red circled. All moves will be done in consultation with the Union.
(b) In all other cases other than technological change an affected employee, to retain a position, must first bump within his progression. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump within his section. If he is unable to retain a position by this means, then the employee will bump to another section within his department. If unable to retain a position by this means, an employee will then bump to a position outside his department in the section or progression in which he previously held the highest card rate. It is understood that an employee, in bumping, cannot bump into a job paying a higher card rate than the one he presently holds, nor can he bump into a job he has not previously held.
24
(c)	If an employee is unable to retain employment by the above method and he has the skill and ability to do a job at a higher rate, he will only then be allowed to bump up, if he so chooses.
8.12	Tradesmen displaced from their jobs may elect “voluntary lay-oft” instead of a job in an operating department or severance under Article 8.09 (h). It is understood between the parties that a tradesman electing “voluntary lay-off will do so under the following terms:
(a)	Seniority will cease accumulating after one
hundred and twenty (120) calendar days.
(b)	Entitlement to all benefits will cease at time of “voluntary lay-off.
(c)	It is understood an employee on “voluntary layoff may at a later date elect to receive severance under Article 8.09 (h) and terminate his employment.
The foregoing will not apply to a tradesman who is removed from his job at his own request or as a result of his inability to perform the normal requirements of his job.

(b)	Day workers will normally begin work at 8:00 a.m. Day workers will be given a lunch period of one-half (V2) hour per day, but such lunch period shah not be considered as time worked. It is recognized that in order to maintain efficient operations, certain day workers must begin work earlier or later than 8:00 a.m.
(c)	Shift schedules now in effect will remain in effect and if it should become necessary to change these schedules or to establish new schedules, the Company shall, after consultation with the Union, give seven (7) calendar days’ notice of the new or changed schedules.

(b)	Notice Required on Change of Rest Days
27
In the event that an employee is assigned to a job which changes the employee’s scheduled rest days from the job he presently occupies, overtime rates shall be paid for work performed on such rest days for the first week only of the work schedule of the new job, if sufficient notice is not given by instructing the employee to that effect (or by posting) prior to the scheduled rest days of the job he presently occupies. For the purpose of this article, sufficient notice shall mean the greater of two (2) calendar days or a number of days equal to the number of rest days of the work schedule for the job he presently occupies.

hours of work for his shift and is called in for overtime work, he shall receive pay for the full time so worked plus one (1) hour, except that he shall receive pay for a minimum of four (4) hours.

9.05	(a). In this situation he shall have the
28
option of not reporting for any portion of the first four (4) hours of his next regularly scheduled shift, with no pay for the hours not so worked. In addition, if the call-out occurs between 12 midnight and 4:00 a.m. an additional payment of $25.00 shall be made to the employee.

(d)	In the event an employee is called out to perform overtime work under Article 9.05, and he completes the work for which he was called, he will not be assigned additional work unless the nature of that additional work is such that it would have otherwise warranted a call-out on its own account.
9.06	Overtime rates shall be paid to employees for all prearranged overtime worked before the regular starting time of any shift or are held after the end of a shift of eight (8) hours for the time worked in excess of eight (8) hours.

9.07	Where an employee works more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours at the request of the Company, he shall be entitled to an eight (8) hour rest period. If his
29
regular shift is scheduled to commence before the expiration of an eight (8) hour rest period he will be permitted to remain at rest for said period and will be paid his regular rate for the hours of his regular shift which fall within said rest period and for the remainder of his regular shift which he works he will also receive his regular rate of pay. Where an employee is directed by his supervisor to work on that part of his regular shift which falls within the said rest period he shall be paid at overtime rates on his base rate for those hours so worked. If not so directed the employee will remain at rest for an eight (8) hour period.
9.08	No employee shall be required to work more than six (6) hours, which includes two (2) hours overtime, without being allowed a reasonable lunch period on Company time. For each additional three (3) hours overtime such employee works, he shall be provided with an additional lunch period. For such overtime which is unscheduled, the Company shall supply to the employee a hot meal or at the Company’s or employee’s request, a meal allowance of $10.00 shall be paid in lieu of a hot meal. If the end of a three (3) hour overtime period (outlined above) coincides with the end of the overtime assignment the employee will receive a meal allowance of $10.00 which shall be paid in lieu of a hot meal and lunch period.
For the purposes of Article 9.08, overtime shall be considered as unscheduled if an employee is not provided with at least twelve (12) hours’ notice prior to the start of the overtime assignment. It is understood that the Company will provide hot meals for scheduled overtime for special projects which require employees to work extended shifts for periods longer than three (3) consecutive days. It is further understood that in such situations, meals will be provided from the first day.
30
9.09	Special arrangements in regard to hours worked and other conditions on isolated jobs may be made by mutual agreement between the Union and the Company.

REPORTING ALLOWANCE
10.01	When the Company fails to inform an employee
before his departure for work, by notice or otherwise, that work will not be available and the employee, in good faith, reports for work on schedule and finds there is no work for him, he shall receive four (4) hours’ reporting allowance at his regular rate. Such four (4) hours shall not be included in working hours which may entitle the employee to overtime pay.

When Article 10.01 applies, every reasonable effort will be made to provide alternative work. Should alternative work be unavailable, the employee will have the option to make up the lost time at a mutually agreeable date at straight time rates. This mutually agreeable date will be agreed to by the employee and his supervisor as soon as possible or during his next scheduled shift. The employee will be given the option of a make-up shift whether he has been notified or not.
10.02	When an employee returns to work after an absence and, after having complied with all plant regulations concerning returning from such absence, is instructed to return home and report to work on another shift, he shall be paid four (4) hours’ reporting allowance at his regular rate. However, such four (4) hours shall not be included in working hours which may have entitled the employee to overtime pay. However,
32
should the Company have succeeded in notifying the man of his non-requirement before his departure for work, such employee shall not be entitled to reporting allowance.

Such payment shall not form part of the employee’s straight time hourly rate and will only be paid for straight time hours worked in the quarter and will not be included for the calculation of vacation pay.

training shall conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. In case of conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

Article 19
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
19.01	Personal tools broken in service or lost in inaccessible places shall be replaced by tools of equal value by the Company, unless an investigation by the Company and the Union proves that the wear or breakage or loss was due to the employee’s carelessness or neglect.
19.02	The clothing allowance now in effect shall not apply to employees of a service department assigned to any plant for regular duty. Employees assigned to the plants for temporary duty shall be recompensed for damage to clothing only when such damage and amount are approved by the department superintendent.
19.03	It is agreed that Union bulletin boards may be used for Union notices only, but it is understood that no political or non-Union contentious materials will be posted. Union bulletin boards will be provided in designated lunch rooms and Company operated cafeterias.
59
19.04	The Company will give to all employees a copy of this Agreement.
19.05	There will be no Union activity on Company time except that necessary in connection with the handling of grievances and the enforcement of this Agreement; but nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the officers of the Union, who are also employees of the Company, from looking after the matters of membership dues, initiation fees, assessments and solicitation of membership, provided it is done after working hours or during non-compensable lunch hours and does not interfere with the operation of the plant.
19.06	(i) The Company agrees that the Union has an
understandable concern over “contracting out” by the Company because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunity for the employees.
The Company will continue to place its primary reliance on its own employees to perform all work that has historically been performed at their mines and surface plants.
The Union agrees that there are certain situations where contracting out is necessary but they will be dealt with under the following guidelines:
1.	The Company agrees to continue with its practice to perform production and maintenance work at its mines and surface plants with its own employees. To this end, the Company will give full consideration to the availability of equipment, engineering, skills, manpower, supervision and services, efficiency of operations
60
and to the time required to do the work prior to contracting out.
2.	The Company will consult as far in advance as possible with the President or designate of the Union prior to awarding a contract which would result in an outside firm having its employees work on Company property or a contractor does a major repair or rebuild costing in excess of $50,000 outside Company property. The Company will also consult with the Union President prior to going out for tender on a long term contract such as the Trout Lake ore haul or a diamond drill contract. All other considerations being equal, the Company will give preference to union contractors for such work. It is understood between the parties that contracting is the least preferred route to getting work done. Prior to going out for tender or deciding to contract out, the Union President or his designate will be contacted and all pertinent information made available to him so that a meaningful assessment of alternatives to contracting out the work can be made.
If, subsequently, the decision is made to contract out the work, the Union President will be so advised and provided with full information on the reasons for the decision. At this time, the Union will be provided with the name of contractor, nature of work, number of employees and number of estimated hours worked. When the work has been completed by the contractor, the Company will share with the
61
Union President or his designate all pertinent information which would allow the parties to assess whether the work was, in fact, more effectively and efficiently done by the contractor.
The parties understand and agree that any information referred to in this Section (2) and the disclosure of such information by the Company to the Union is expressly subject to and contingent upon any confidential, sensitive, proprietary, trade secrets or contractual rights or restrictions of any third party or the Company. Moreover, any such information shall be provided to the local Union Executive only, and shall be used only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and not for any other purposes whatsoever, and shall not be disclosed to any other persons or parties, including all Union members other than the local Union Executive.
3.	A list of work that has historically been contracted out or may be contracted out will be established to determine whether such work could be as effectively and efficiently performed by Company employees, with the goal of reducing such work to as low a level as possible.
4.	For the purposes of this Article, a joint committee will be set up with Company and Union representatives and will meet as often as necessary to deal with situations as they may arise. The committee may meet in conjunction with the Labour Management Committee.
62
5.	It is also understood that once yearly, on the anniversary date of this Agreement, the Union and senior management will meet to review and discuss contracting out issues.
6.	The Company agrees that no employee shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a result of work being contracted out by the Company.
(ii) Salaried supervisors whose regular jobs are not in this Agreement shall not work on any jobs which are included in this Agreement except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimenting, protecting the safety of employees or equipment, periods of production difficulties or in emergencies when regular employees are not reasonably available.
19.07	The Company will continue its present practice of supplying free transportation to and from a Company designated point to all outlying mines and other projects unless special arrangements are made under Article 9.08.
Where an employee is required by the Company to travel in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way to or from a Company designated point and the outlying job site, outside the time of his regularly scheduled shift, a travelling allowance will be paid. Such travelling allowance will be the number of hours in excess of thirty (30) minutes each way multiplied by his regular rate of pay.
However, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of a temporary assignment, the thirty (30) minute portion will be paid. Any applicable premiums would be paid from the start of the assignment.
63
19.08	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19.07, and in lieu of those provisions, the present special travel arrangement in respect of travel to and from Flin Flon and Snow Lake will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement.
19.09	(i) A maximum bereavement leave of ten (10) cal-
endar days will be granted to an employee, commencing on the day of the death of his spouse, son or daughter in order to attend the funeral. For each day the employee was regularly scheduled to work during such leave he shall be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
(ii)	A maximum bereavement leave of three (3)
scheduled working days will be granted to an employee upon the death of his mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, spouse’s grandmother and spouse’s grandfather, grandchild, and any relative permanently residing in the employee’s household or with whom the employee resides, in order to attend the funeral. In this situation the bereavement leave will be extended by two (2) scheduled working days if the employee attends the funeral outside Manitoba and Saskatchewan. For each scheduled working day of such leave of absence the employee shall be paid his regular rate of pay for eight (8) hours.
(iii)	In the event that an employee’s bereavement leave overlaps or occurs during his vacation period his vacation time will be extended by the number of days that his bereavement leave encroaches on it.
64
(iv)	To qualify for bereavement leave pursuant to
19.09	(i), 19.09 (ii) or 19.09 (iii) the employee shall notify his immediate supervisor as soon as possible following the bereavement.
(v)	Notwithstanding the terms of 19.09 (i) and
19.09	(ii) under the Canada Labour Code an employee is entitled to three (3) calendar days bereavement leave immediately following the death of the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, mother, father, sister brother, mother-in-law or father-in-law. There is no requirement under the Code to attend the funeral to be eligible for such leave.

Article 20
NO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT
20.01	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any of the members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in any labour organization or by reason of sex, race, national origin, colour, religion or physical disability. The
65
Company policy entitled “Human Rights Policy” dated November 14,1991 will remain in force for the duration of this Agreement.
Article 21
DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE
21.01	The following procedure shall govern in all cases of discipline:
(a)	The Company shall have the right to discipline any employee for sufficient and just cause.
(b)	Employees will be advised of any discipline as soon as possible following the incident giving rise to’ the discipline.
(c)	When an employee is formally disciplined while at work, a steward will attend. Every reasonable effort will be made to have the attending steward be from his own jurisdiction.

The employee and his Union will be made aware of any information which is being considered for use in the discipline and informed of any information which is being placed in the employee file that could be used for discipline; and
(d)	When there is an incident which could lead to a suspension of an employee, there will be a joint investigation (by Union and Supervision) to determine the pertinent facts. It is understood that any discipline stemming from the investigation will be solely
66
determined by management. Every reasonable effort will be made to have this investigation completed within seven (7) calendar days. Suspensions will be administered at the end of an employee’s shift whenever appropriate and possible, it being understood there are circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the workplace immediately following the incident. Except in those circumstances where it is appropriate to remove the employee from the property immediately, when a suspension is imposed the suspension will not be served, if the employee decides to file a grievance on the matter, until Step 2 of the grievance procedure has been completed.
(e)	The employee and the steward in attendance will receive a written copy of the suspension slip or discharge letter. Also, the Union shall be advised promptly in writing by the Company of the reason or reasons for such suspension or discharge.
21.02	If any employee feels that he has been unjustly disciplined, he shall have the right of appeal through the grievance procedure at Step 2. Such appeal must be filed in writing by the Union with the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of notification of discipline and, unless so filed, the right of appeal shall be lost.
21.03	Should it be found upon investigation that an employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged, such employee shall be immediately reinstated in his former position without loss of seniority rating, and shall be compensated for all time lost in an amount equal to his average earnings during the pay period next preceding such discharge or suspension, less any money earned by the employee during the period of discharge or suspension.
67
21.04	All new employees shall be engaged for a probationary period of forty (40) straight time working shifts. During this probationary period an employee shall be considered as being employed on a trial basis and may be discharged without notice at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and any such discharge shall be deemed for just cause. An employee terminated during his probationary period would be entitled to review under the grievance procedure up to and including Step 3.
21.05	Any employee with more than one (1) year’s seniority may once annually request a formal evaluation from his supervisor. In addition, once yearly an employee may request to review his departmental employee file. The written evaluation will include items such as attendance, disciplinary action, pro-motability and attitude to work and safety.
Article 22
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
22.01	Every effort will be made to resolve differences before grievances are filed. Failing that, the parties agree that grievances and grievance meetings should be treated as opportunities for mutual problem solving. Should any difference arise between the Company and any of the employees from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, an earnest effort will be made to settle such grievance without undue delay. All grievances, in order to settle them as quickly as possible, will have to be submitted to the Company representative within fourteen (14) calendar days of the occurrence of the incident which gave
68
rise to the grievance and shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided. Every reasonable effort will be made to schedule Step 1 and 2 grievance meetings during the griever’s working hours. Failing that, every reasonable effort will be made to hold the meeting immediately before or after the griever’s working hours. Also, every effort will be made to include all involved parties (original steward, supervisors, etc.) in all steps of the grievance procedure.
22.02	Step 1 --Any employee with a personal grievance must take the matter up with his front line supervisor accompanied by a Union steward of his choice from his own department. Consistent with the parties’ intent to empower stewards and supervisors, Step I resolutions will be made without prejudice or precedent.
22.03	Step 2 -- Failing satisfactory settlement within seven (7) calendar days after presentation at Step l, the chief steward and/or steward shall meet with the department superintendent and present the case to him with the griever, if desired. Such meeting with the department superintendent shall take place within seven (7) calendar days of completion of Step 1.
22.04	Step 3 -- Failing satisfactory settlement within seven (7) calendar days after Step 2, the Grievance Committee shall present the matter to the appropriate manager or his designated representative within seven (7) calendar days thereafter. This designated representative is not to be the same individual who replied at Step 2. The Union representative or Business Agent may be present at this step. The griever and/or a department representative may also be in attendance. Such meeting with the manager or his designated representative shall take place within seven (7) calendar days of notification or at a time mutually agreed upon.
69
22.05	Step 4 -- If settlement is not made within seven (7) calendar days under Step 3, the Grievance Committee may refer the grievance to an Arbitration Board within thirty (30) calendar days after the answer in writing in Step 3 has been given, but not later.

22.06	Grievances other than a personal grievance that concern the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement may be initiated by the Union and shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this article beginning at Step 3.
22.07	(a) Personal grievances shall be presented in writ-
ing to the department superintendent in Step 2 in Article 22.03.
(b)	The department superintendent’s reply to the
Step 2 grievance shall be in writing.
(c)	Grievances other than personal grievances shall be presented in writing by the Grievance Committee to the appropriate manager in Article 22.06.
22.08	If it should be found inexpedient to carry out promptly the clauses of this article, due to absence of a Company official from the vicinity, a substitute may be appointed by the Company with full power to effect settlement of grievances, or the step of grievance procedure in which said official is concerned may be eliminated from the procedure.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2 To the Union:
RE: TRAINING AND JOB SECURITY FOR SENIOR EMPLOYEES
This will confirm discussions held at 1993 bargaining with regard to training and job security for senior employees with in a trade. As agreed, in the event lay-offs become necessary during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, junior employees in a trade will be laid off unless such employees have received specialized training as a result of
83
being the successful applicant for a plant wide training posting. Such training postings will be awarded to senior qualified applicants within a trade. It was agreed that the only posting that is deemed to be a training posting under the terms of this letter, that was filled prior to the signing of the October 1, 1993 Collective Agreement, is a posting for Specialist Welder. This agreement was made with the understanding that senior Boilermaker/Welders who wish to obtain a pressure ticket will be given the opportunity to do so.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicants for training postings, with fifteen (15) or more years of service, may be bypassed for training with the understanding employees with fifteen (15) or more years of service will be retained over junior employees within a trade with such training, in the event of a lay-off. Prior to bypassing a senior employee for such training, the President of the Union in question will be consulted.
As discussed at 1993 bargaining, the need for training that would call for plant wide training postings has not yet been determined, but the need is anticipated to be infrequent. That being the case, prior to such training being posted, the Company will consult with the President of the Union in question.
It is further understood that if a tradesman is awarded a training posting he may be restricted from work location moves or other training postings for a period of time equivalent to two (2) times the training period.

89
1)	At an employee’s request, he will not be paid for overtime worked and payment for this work will be banked (banking of pay, not banking of hours).
2)	It is understood that this banked overtime pay may be paid out any time at the discretion of the employee (e.g. short term personal leaves of absence outlined in Letter #10).

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #10 To the Union:
RE: SHORT TERM PERSONAL
LEAVES OF ABSENCE
At the 1993 Interest Based Negotiations, the issue of granting short term personal leaves of absence was discussed in detail.
After an extensive exploration of the different interests and concerns, and after having considered a number of different options, the following general guidelines were agreed to through consensus:
1) Subject to the requirements of operations, every
effort will he made to grant employees leaves of
absence of a personal nature.
90
2)	Recognizing differences in operations in each department, individual departments will establish their own practices based on their own unique circumstances.
3)	In the granting of compassionate and medical leave every effort, including the use of overtime, will be considered.
In the granting of compassionate and medical leave, employees will not be required to use vacation days.
If an employee is designated as an executor for an estate, and the employee requests leave to carry out their function, such request will he considered as a request for compassionate leave.
4)	It is important that the front line supervisor have input to administer the leave provisions.
5)	When granting personal leaves of absence, other than for compassionate and medical reasons, the following options may be considered (depending on departmental circumstances):
a)	Leave without pay (for greater clarity, it is understood that banked overtime pay may be paid out in these instances at the employee’s request).
b)	Employee would only be required to take an unbooked “regular” vacation day after July 1st (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
c)	Employee would take a “special” vacation day at his request only (vacation days taken in this regard would not be considered a split).
91
6)	In the determination of granting of personal leave requests, individual circumstances should be taken into account (e.g. commuting) and each leave should be dealt with on its individual merit.
It was the general consensus of the group that addressed this issue that personal leave requests need to be handled in a reasonable manner by all concerned (management and employees).
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #11
To the Union:
RE: PROFIT SHARING PLAN
1.	The Company agrees to establish a Profit Sharing Plan with effect as of January 1, 1994. The Plan, which shall not be amended without agreement of the Unions, includes all employees in the Flin Flon/Snow Lake operations, with the exception of executive officers of the Company and all others who participate in any management incentive plans other than this Profit Sharing Plan.
92
2.	At the end of each calendar year, ten percent (10%) of the Company’s “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” if positive, as defined in point 3 of this letter, shall be distributed on the first payday following the issue of the Profit Sharing Plan Statement to the hourly and salaried employees on the following basis:
a)	Hourly and salaried employees who are employed for the full year shall receive a full and equal share.
b)	Employees who retire or are laid off during the year shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
c)	Employees who are hired or are recalled during the year and are on the payroll at year end shall receive a partial share on a quarterly pro rata basis.
It is understood between the parties that employees who quit or are terminated during the year will not be afforded profit sharing. It is further understood that quarterly pro rata basis shall mean an eligible employee who was on the payroll during any portion of a quarter will be afforded profit sharing as if he worked that full quarter.
By way of example, if an employee retires in August, he would receive three (3) quarters of the profit sharing payment afforded an employee who was on the payroll for a full year.
Any negative “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” for the calendar year shall be eliminated and not carried forward to future years.
93
3.	For the purposes of this Profit Sharing Plan “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” shall comprise “Net Income (Loss)” calculated in accordance with Minorco’s accounting policies and International Accounting Standards with the following exclusions:
(i)	The greater of Profit Sharing Plan costs or Lump Sum Payment costs
(ii)	Provisions for deferred income tax
(iii)	The Company’s portion of any gains which
result in payments under a Gainsharing Plan during the year including the annual global reserve payout.
4.	There is no cap on the size of the Profit Sharing Plan.
5.	Verification
(i)	Upon release of Minorco’s annual results, the Company shall provide the Unions with an audited Profit Sharing Plan Statement for that fiscal period. Such statement shall include verification of the exclusions per point 3 (i), (ii) and (iii).
6.	Lump Sum Payment
For the calendar years 1997 and 1998, the greater of the amount determined per the Profit Sharing Plan above or an amount determined per a Lump Sum Payment formula will be paid to employees. For greater clarity, only the greater of the Profit Sharing Payment or the Lump Sum Payment will be paid for each year.
The Lump Sum Payment formula will be based on actual operating earnings adjusted for:
94
(i)	Unfavourable cost/volume variance (if any) for each of the approved 1997 and 1998 budgets
(ii)	The impact of a capital write-down as at
December 31,1996, or any additional writedown during 1997 or 1998 arising as a result of an economic impairment (if any), on 1997 and 1998 non-cash rates.
For purposes of this Lump Sum Payment formula, operating earnings shall be defined as the “After Tax Earnings (Loss)” as defined in 3 above before:
(i)	Exploration
(ii)	Other financing costs
(iii)	Interest expense
(iv)	Taxes
The adjusted operating earnings so calculated will he compared to the following chart to determine if the amount is greater than the amount calculated per the Profit Sharing Plan.

RE: SPECIAL VACATION ACCRUAL
The parties agreed at 1993 bargaining that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 15.10, effective October 1, 1994 employees who have three (3) or more years of service who are laid off for ninety (90) calendar days or more, or who retire, will be afforded special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis at time of lay-off or retirement. That is, after three (3) years of service, employees who are laid off or who retire will be afforded one-third (1/3) of the three (3) week special vacation allotment for each full year of employment.
By way of example, special vacation pay on an annual pro rata basis shall mean an employee who has been on the payroll for five (5) years and three (3) months at time of lay-off will be entitled to two weeks’ special vacation pay in addition to that earned but not taken on obtaining three (3) years of service. An employee with three (3) years and six (6) months of service at time of lay-off will be entitled to no additional special vacation.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #15 To the Union:
RE: HEAVY DUTY/MAINTENANCE MECHANICS
This will confirm the agreement reached at 1993 bargaining with regard to separating the Heavy Duty trade from the Maintenance Mechanic classification. Heavy Duty Mechanics and Maintenance Mechanics were deemed to be separate and distinct classifications with the signing of the 1993 Collective Agreement.
98
Employees in either classification on October 1, 1993 were “grandfathered” and have the right to use their seniority to bump junior employees in the other classification to retain a job in the event of a lay-off. An employee will lose “grandfathering” rights on being laid off. Mechanics who bump from one mechanical classification to another to retain a job in the event of a lay-off will maintain the rate of their original job. It is understood that such Mechanics may be transferred back to their original classification by the Company when there is an opening.
It is understood that if a lay-off results in a deficiency of heavy duty skills, Mechanics with heavy duty skills who are working in the surface plants can be reassigned underground on a temporary basis for up to twelve (12) months.
Following 1993 bargaining, the parties reviewed the list of Heavy Duty Mechanics and Industrial Mechanics and agreed on which Mechanics were dual qualified. A Mechanic was considered dual qualified if he was certified in the other trade or had worked in the other trade for three (3) years or more.
For a three (3) year period beginning May 23, 1995, Industrial Mechanics who are qualified as Heavy Duty Mechanics will be allowed to compete for work location moves for Heavy Duty Mechanics and they will be considered the successful applicant if they can he released.
For a three (3) year period beginning May 23,1995, Heavy Duty Mechanics who are qualified as Industrial Mechanics will be allowed to compete for work location moves for Industrial Mechanic openings. Heavy Duty Mechanics (who are qualified) will not be considered the successful applicant for an Industrial Mechanic work location move if they cannot be released as a Heavy Duty Mechanic.
99
Industrial Mechanics who enter into a Heavy Duty Mechanic apprenticeship will be level tested and subsequently placed in the appropriate level. If the Mechanic is successful in passing Level #1 or higher, he will be compensated as follows:
Level #2	Job	Class	15
Level #3	Job	Class	17
Level #4	Job	Class	19
If the Mechanic is not successful in passing Level #1 he will enter the apprenticeship in accordance with Article 17.08 of the Collective Agreement.
After the three (3) year period outlined above (effective May 24,1998), Heavy Duty Mechanics who are qualified as Industrial Mechanics will be able to transfer (if they can be released) to an Industrial Mechanic opening before that opening is filled by hiring from the outside. Also, Industrial Mechanics who are qualified as Heavy Duty Mechanics will be able to transfer to a Heavy Duty opening (if they can be released) on the same basis. Employees wishing to transfer will have advised the Industrial Relations Office of their desire to do so prior to the opening. Such transfer requests will be valid for one (1) year from date of filing.
The foregoing only applies to Heavy Duty and Industrial Mechanics who were in these classifications prior to October 1,1993.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #16 To the Union:
RE: HBM&S AS SECOND PAYER FOR DRUGS
It is agreed between the parties that the Company will continue to be the second payer for drugs as outlined in Article 13.04. That is, the Company will be responsible for paying for only the non-recoverable portion of eligible drug costs for regular participating status members and special participating group members.
It is understood between the parties that the Company will, retroactive to January 1, 1997, provide members with a vision care benefit so long as the cost of that benefit to the Company is offset by an equal amount of savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments. The vision care benefit shall be for the cost of prescription lenses, frames and contact lenses to a maximum of $100 every twenty-four (24) months for eligible members.
101
For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the expression “savings associated with not having to pay that portion of the drug costs borne by the Saskatchewan or Manitoba Governments” shall be defined to mean the reduced Company costs that can be established as being solely attributable to the Company being the secondary rather than the primary payer for drugs covered under Article 13.04 (c) of the Collective Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “savings”). Savings shall include savings related to all bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired), and the cost of the vision care benefits shall be based on the cost required to extend the benefit to all such bargaining and non-bargaining unit personnel (both active and retired).
The Company will review the savings that are available following each calendar quarter during the years of 1997,1998 and 1999 to determine if there are sufficient savings available to provide the vision care benefit. Savings may be carried forward from quarter to quarter within a calendar year, but shall not be carried forward from one calendar year to the next.
Members will remit vision care claims direct to the carrier, Manitoba Blue Cross, who will in turn process and pay on a first in, first pay basis provided that the savings are available. If savings are not immediately available, the claims shall be accumulated again on a first in basis and processed and paid in that order provided savings become available within the calendar year.
It is further understood that there will he no obligation by the Company to purchase any additional benefits or to make any concessions related-to any subsequent savings other than those set forth herein.

RE: SNOW LAKE TRAVEL
Further to negotiations with the Joint Bargaining Committee, 1987, towards concluding a Collective Bargaining Agreement effective October 1, 1987 the Company has agreed to resubmit Letters of Agreement regarding past practise of providing transportation to Snow Lake. It is, therefore, the intention of the Company that the following travelling arrangements will be continued:
104
Flin Flon employees sent to Snow Lake for a temporary period would be paid an amount equal to two and a half (2 */2) hours of straight time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools to Snow Lake and an additional amount equal to two and a half (2 V2) hours of straight time pay to cover the transportation for themselves and their personal tools from Snow Lake when they return from the completion of a temporary job. The employees would be expected to be at Snow Lake, ready for work at the start of the shift, with their personal tools, and would work a full shift on the day they were returning to Flin Flon. The Company could reserve the right to use other means of transportation outside of the above when, in the sole opinion of Company Management it was necessary or advisable.
The Company further agrees to provide the equivalent of return bus fare, Flin Flon to Snow Lake, for each weekend during the said temporary period that does not coincide with the date of transportation at the commencement and completion of the said temporary period. The above terms and conditions will also apply to Snow Lake employees sent to Flin Flon for a temporary period.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - #26 To the Union:
RE: EMPLOYMENT SECURITY, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT AND JOB FLEXIBILITY
Notwithstanding that the I AM has withdrawn from and is no longer a member of the Restructuring Committee, the IAM agrees to renew the commitments made in Letter #26 (with the appropriate amendments) to support and work co-operatively with management to encourage further safe flexible work practices. The IAM will not allow disputes to get in the way of these objectives.
111
This will confirm our understanding and recognition that there is a direct connection between employment security, employee empowerment and the flexible use of employee skills. The parties agree that in order to meet production targets and cost cutting goals that will ensure our survival, the parties will encourage employees to perform any work provided that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the work safely. It is understood that this workplace flexibility will not result in the removal of the primary responsibilities of operation of the plant from operators to tradespersons, nor of the primary responsibility of maintaining the plant from tradespersons to operators.
The parties recognize that some employees may require additional training in order to fulfil these targets and goals and that the additional skills acquired may justify, in some instances, increases in pay.
To give greater clarity to the above:
a)	Safety - All work will be performed in the manner consistent with Article 6 of the Collective Agreement as well as the Company’s Safety Rules, the regulations issued by the Workers Compensation Board and other applicable legislation. It is recognized that some tasks can only be performed by employees who possess certain government certification and, in that instance, the work will only be performed by employees who possess the required government certificate
b)	Trades - In order to maintain flexibility, tradespersons will assist other tradespersons for the efficient operation of the plant as long as the tradesperson is capable of doing the work in a safe manner and has the necessary qualifications to do the work in accordance with paragraph a) above. Tradespersons will assist operating crews to improve the efficiency of the plants or mines.
112
c)	Operators - In order to maintain flexibility, operators will assist tradespersons and other operators in the efficient operation of the plant as long as the operator is capable of doing the work in accordance with paragraph a) above.
The parties agree that a Flexibility Committee will be established consisting of one (1) representative of the United Steelworkers, one (1) representative of the Association of FJin Flon Trade Unions, one (1) representative of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and two (2) representatives from the Company. The committee will be responsible for:
a)	Reviewing training programs which are designed to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills required to perform the additional duties safely. This committee will also review the selection criteria for such training in instances where the additional skills acquired will result in increases in pay.
b)	Providing input and guidance on the implementation of flexible work practices and seeking to anticipate and/or resolve any disputes which may arise. It is understood that an affected employee, a Union, or the Company may forward matters to the committee for resolution.
c)	Taking all necessary steps to ensure flexible work practices are utilized broadly in order to reduce costs and increase productivity.
d)	Fostering and promoting the principles of employee empowerment which is defined as having the authority and training to make decisions in workplace matters involving continuing improvements in productivity, unit cost reduction and quality and providing timely and pertinent information and the resources, authority, responsibility and accountability to enable employees to manage their work environment.
113
It is further agreed that no employee will be laid off as a direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
Effective October 1, 1996 it is agreed that no employees will be laid off unless such layoffs are the result of the following:
a)	Layoffs because of temporary shutdowns, vacation shutdowns, market conditions, interruption or cessation of feed supply, compliance with government orders or force majeure.
b)	Layoffs	resulting from decreased manning levels
required because of the shutting down or substantially reduced output levels of an existing mine, operating plant or a significant portion thereof, not including work reorganization or process modifications.
c)	Layoffs	of any employee hired after October 1,1996.
d)	Discharge for cause.
e)	Layoffs	due to closure, sale or merger, or significant
reduction in the operating or manning level which precedes final closure, sale or merger.
It is understood that any layoff resulting from the foregoing shall not be characterized as being the direct result of the flexible use of employee skills.
It is further understood that employees may be laid off if they are hired, retained or recalled for temporary periods.

To the Union:
RE: PREFERRED WORK LOCATION
Notices of permanent vacancies will be posted for all Trades occupations with more than one permanent work location in Departments 11 and 60 in order to allow tradesmen to express their preferred work location.
When filling permanent vacancies the Company will endeavour to meet the preferences of the employees concerned according to their graduate seniority, subject to the following:
1)	The work requirements in each work location.
2)	The relative skill, ability and physical fitness of the employees to fulfil such requirements.
3)	It is understood between the parties that if specialized skills are required, those requirements will be outlined on the notice of permanent vacancy and that the Union will be consulted prior to that notice being posted.
4)	If an employee is moved from one work location there shall be a probationary period of thirty (30) calendar days in which the employee or the Company may effect his reassignment to his former work location.
5)	The Company also reserves the right to temporarily move employees from time to time from their permanent work location in order to:
116
(a)	Maintain familiarity of the various work locations among as many tradesmen as the Company deems necessary.
(b)	Carry out installations or repairs where extra manpower is required to complete the work on a timely basis.
(c)	Provide for absences due to vacations, sickness, sudden terminations or any other like cause.
It is understood that if a senior applicant is bypassed, he can approach his supervisor who will advise him of the reasons why he was not afforded the work location move.
It is understood that temporary assignments within the permanent work location known as the Outside Floor Mechanics shall be handled as they have been historically and shall not be subject to the terms of this letter. It is further understood that in the event the Company decides to transfer tradesmen presently in Department 60 into operating departments, they will be considered as remaining in Department 60 for the purposes of this letter.
If a tradesman is reassigned from one work location to another as a result of a force adjustment, such tradesman will be given the opportunity for permanent reassignment back ahead of other employees. It is understood force adjustments will be carried out using Company, not IVades seniority.

Any hourly reduction resulting will be made through attrition. That being the case, for each staff employee returning to the bargaining unit, one hourly employee will be removed from the lay-off list.
It is understood between the parties that this approach may, for a time, cause the Company to carry employees beyond those required and that this excess will only be eliminated or reduced by attrition (quits, retirements, terminations, etc.) or the requirement for additional manpower (e.g. Westarm).
The accounting for this attrition will begin for Trades and Steel on the date a staff employee’s return to the individual bargaining unit would have resulted in the lay-off of an hourly employee.

RE: MODIFIED WORK
The Company and the Unions have agreed to establish a Modified Work Program which is designed to help employees return to meaningful work with minimal risk to their rehabilitation. To this end, the parties agree to the following:
1.	A committee of eight (8) representatives to oversee the program will be formed consisting of: three (3)
122
from the Company, one (1) from the Trades Association, one (1) from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, two (2) from the United Steelworkers, Local 7106 and one (1) from the United Steelworkers, Local 9338.
2.	The committee will operate by consensus.
3.	The committee will use a medical professional for consultation purposes as required.
4.	The employee must qualify for Sick Benefit or Workers’ Compensation before being eligible for the formal Modified Work Program. However, employees who fall outside the formal Modified Work Program may make arrangements with department supervision for modified work.
5.	The employee will be involved in placement decisions. All reasonable efforts will be made to meet the employee’s needs both medically and personally. Any disputes will be dealt with by the Joint Committee. Every effort will be made to place the employee on modified work in his original department and classification.
6.	Wage structure:
a)	Workers’ Compensation
The employee will receive the rate of pay for the modified work performed until a decision on make-up of wages is made by WCB. If there is no make-up of wages, then the Company will retroactively pay the red circled rate of the employee’s former job.
123
b)	Sick Benefit
The employee will receive a red circled rate for 520 hours of modified work for each unrelated occurrence of modified work. If a dispute arises over whether an occurrence is a reoccurrence, it will be referred to the Committee. Anything in excess of 520 hours will be paid at the rate of the modified work performed.
7.	The employee’s originating department will assume the costs for the first 520 hours if the employee is assigned to another department.
8.	The Modified Work Program will be co-ordinated by
the Superintendent of Loss Control who will also serve as the Company representative on the committee.
9.	Union jurisdiction:
If an employee is assigned to a job outside of his current Union jurisdiction, he will continue to pay dues to his Union for a one (1) year period. At that time it will be reviewed by the committee and the affected Unions.
10.	Transfers:
An employee on temporary	modified	work	can	only
apply for job bulletins in his original department.
11.	A meeting will take	place	between	the	department,
the co-ordinator, the employee and his Union steward to outline the restrictions and responsibilities of all involved in the modified work assignment.
