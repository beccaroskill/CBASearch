The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all the employees
19
with respect to rates of pay, hours of work and other working conditions.
2.02	FULLTIME UNION REPRESENTATIVE
The Company will release a senior Union Representative from his job on a daily basis to attend to Union business on behalf of those employees covered by this Collective Agreement. To enable the senior Union Representative to do this, the Company will provide the Union with office space at each Business Unit. The senior Union Representative will be required to keep in regular contact with the Human Resources Manager at each Business Unit and will notify him of his planned absence in advance.
The Company will pay the senior Union Representative at Job Class 28 plus C.O.L.A. and the Nickel Bonus and Sudbury Operations Employee Performance Incentive and will pay the cost of benefits premiums for those items set out in Article 31 (Pension & Health Benefits). During this appointment the employee shall accumulate seniority and credited service. Upon termination of his appointment the employee shall return to his former department and occupation if it still exists; if his occupation no longer exists the provisions of section 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days) shall be applied to determine a new occupation.
20
An employee will be granted leave of absence without pay in order to provide relief for the Local Unit Chair from January 1st to January 31st, 2013. Such employee will attend to Union Business at the sites on behalf of those employees covered by the Collective Agreement and continue to be covered by his/her benefits during this period.
2.03	BARGAINING UNIT WORK
With specific regard to the performance of work by supervisory personnel, the Company agrees with the principle of retaining for employees the work normally done by them. Accordingly, supervisory personnel shall not perform work that is normally done by employees (except work of an emergency or casual nature) where qualified employees are reasonably available to do such work. It shall not be a violation of this section for supervisory personnel to perform such work where it is done:
(a) in the course of instructing or training employees;
(b)	to overcome production and maintenance difficulties;
(c)	in the course of research and development programs; or
21
(d)	to protect the safety of employees or equipment.
2.04	NON-SUPERVISORY INDIVIDUALS
Non-supervisory individuals employed by the Company who are not employees (as defined herein) shall not perform work not normally done by them which work is normally done by employees.
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3.01	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Union agrees that the Company has the exclusive right and power to manage the plants and mines, direct the working forces and to hire, promote, transfer, demote or lay off, and to suspend, demote, discharge or otherwise discipline employees for just cause. Provided, however, that the Company agrees that any exercise of these rights and powers in conflict with any of the provisions in this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
22
ARTICLE 4 - UNION-MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIP
4.01	RELATIONSHIP
In order to overcome the many challenges facing the Business Units, it is essential that the Company and the Union maintain a professional relationship that will support the work that has to be done to increase the long-term viability of the Operations and enhance the job security of the employees. To accomplish this, the Business Units and Union will work to ensure constructive communication so that issues can be identified and resolved as early and effectively as possible through the process described in 4.02 (Union-Management Meetings) below.
4.02	UNION-MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
Matters of interest, which are not proper subjects to be dealt with under the grievance procedure may be discussed at meetings by the Union and Management at the Sudbury Mines/Mill Business Unit and the Sudbury Smelter Business Unit. There shall be no more than 5 representatives from each party at the Sudbury Mines/Mill Business Unit and 3 representatives at the Sudbury Smelter Business 23
Unit. The Union President will be present at each meeting and will be included in the numbers outlined above. The parties will meet, as required, at dates to be mutually agreed.
Before each meeting, the parties will submit agenda items for consideration. A copy of the minutes of the meetings will be given to each party.
ARTICLE 5 - CONTRACTING OUT
5.01	CONTRACTING OUT
The Company recognizes the concerns of the Union regarding the effects of contracting out on such matters as employment, job security and job opportunity and will therefore, use their best efforts to minimize the contracting out of core production and maintenance work. The Business Units agree to consider this and the following factors when making the decision on whether to contract out work:
(a)	whether the work requires specialized equipment and/or competencies which are not required on a continuous basis for core production and maintenance;
24
(b)	whether the performance of the contracted
work by employees would require hiring and/or training	of	new employees	or
replacements whose employment would not continue beyond	the	completion of	the
contracted work;
(c)	the availability	at	the Operation	of
manpower, equipment, skills, engineering, supervision and services, to operating and cost efficiency and the time required to do the work.
Furthermore, no regular	employee of	the
Business Unit shall be demoted, laid off or discharged as a direct result of any work being contracted out by his own Business Unit.
5.02	CONTRACTING, PROMOTION & RECALL OF EMPLOYEES
When contracting out work of a duration of 14 calendar days or more, the specific Business Unit where the work is required shall, having regard to the availability of manpower, equipment, skills, engineering, supervision and services, to operating and cost efficiency and the time required to do the work;
(a)	promote employees who have been demoted through the application of Article 17 (Layoffs) and;
25
(b)	recall employees who have been laid off in accordance Article 18 (Recall).
providing, however, that these employees can perform the normal requirements of the job and are readily available.
5.03	DEFINITION OF "DEMOTION"
For the purposes of this Article 5 (Contracting Out), demotion shall mean a move to a lower job classification and paid the lower job classification wage rate or being removed from a job which pays mine bonus to a job which does not pay mine bonus.
5.04	DEMOTED OR RECALLED EMPLOYEES
If it is determined at arbitration that the Company in its application of sections 5.01 (Contracting Out) and 5.02 (Contracting, Promotion & Recall of Employees) failed to promote an employee who was demoted or recall a laid off employee, the Company shall pay him the following compensation with respect to the period which is in question:
(a) earnings lost based on his regular rate for the time lost during the period when not promoted or recalled, limited to a maximum
26
of 40 hours per week, less the amount of money earned by the employee during the time lost;
(b)	shift premium applicable to his normal hours of work lost;
(c)	weekend premium applicable to his normal hours of work lost;
(d)	holiday pay he would otherwise have been entitled to;
(e)	cost of living allowance lost based on his normal hours of work lost;
(f)	premiums for any or all of Supplemental (Semi-Private) Plan, Extra Care Expenses Plan, Drug Plan, Group Life Insurance Plan, Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan and Dental Plan provided any laid off employee has actually paid such premium.
ARTICLE 6 - NO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT
6.01	NO DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT
(a) All employees are expected to treat others with courtesy and consideration and to
27
discourage discrimination and harassment.
(b)	There shall be no discrimination or harassment by the Company or the Union or its members against any employee because of Union activity or membership or nonmembership in any trade union, or because of the employee's sex, race, creed, color, nationality, ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, citizenship, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status, handicap or political opinions. Harassment will not be subject to the grievance procedure but shall, however, be investigated promptly by a Senior Human Resources Representative and the Union Services Representative who will attempt to resolve complaints.
(c)	For the purpose of this Article 6, 'Harassment' is defined as engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome where such comment or conduct consists of words or actions by persons acting on behalf of the Company or Union, the Company, a supervisor, a co-worker or any other individual employed by the Company, which denies individual dignity or respect or causes humiliation to another employee.
28
(d)	Proper discussions between an employee and a supervisor related to performance issues or disciplinary matters or work assignments or other work related items do not constitute harassment.
(e)	No person shall be required, as a condition of employment, to become or remain a member of any union or other organization, and no statements or representations to the contrary shall be made.
(f)	There shall be no solicitation of membership in any union organization or collection of union dues or any union activity anywhere on Company property. This clause shall not be construed to prevent employees from engaging in casual conversation relating to Union affairs.
(g)	Stewards, Union safety representatives or employees filling any other Union position shall not be denied any rights or benefits provided for in this collective agreement because of their Union activity.
29
ARTICLE 7 - UNION SECURITY
7.01	UNION DUES
The Company shall, during the life of this Agreement, and as a condition of each employee's continued employment, deduct an amount from each pay of each employee which in total over two pays shall equal the Union's monthly dues.

In any case in which a Board of Arbitrators shall be required under this Agreement, the Company and the Union shall each appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third.

of the Company at Stage Two of the grievance procedure (or in the case of a difference directly between the Company and the Union the written submission by the party initiating the discussion of the difference and the written reply of the other party) shall be presented to the arbitrators and the award of the arbitrators shall be confined to determining the issue set out in the written representation.
Such written representation shall state the nature of the grievance, the remedy sought and the provision of this Agreement upon which it is alleged the grievance is based, provided that:
a)	any omission of such a provision shall not prejudice the determination of the grievance on its merits at any stage of the procedure including arbitration, and
b)	reference to any provision shall not prevent the employee from relying on any other provisions of the Agreement.

44
arbitrable, shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned, but in no event shall the arbitrator be authorized to alter, modify or amend any part of this Agreement.
If an Arbitrator(s) decides that the Company failed to exercise its judgement pursuant to section 16.13 (Job Selection) in a fair and reasonable manner the Company shall fill the vacancy with the applicant having the greatest seniority, providing he has the ability, knowledge, training and skill to do the job.

(b)	the ability, knowledge, training and skill of the employee to do the job.
When in the judgement of the Business Unit, which shall not be exercised in an unfair and unreasonable manner, factor (b) is to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more employees their seniority ranking shall govern except as hereinafter provided.
Tests used in the job posting procedure will be relevant to the normal requirements of the job.
16.14	OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN
Where a Business Unit anticipates a future requirement for trained employees in an occupation in a Department or where a posting has gone unfilled the Business Unit may post an "Opportunity to Train" posting in that
71
Department. All employees in the Department, shall have the opportunity to apply for such opportunities and selection shall be based upon seniority provided they have the basic knowledge, education and ability to be trained in the work required.
During the period of training, employees will retain the rate of pay of their permanent job posting and will be ineligible to apply for a job posting until the training period has been completed.
Upon completion of the training period, the employee shall return to his former occupation.
An employee who is unable to complete the training satisfactorily shall be returned to his former occupation if it still exists or to a suitable vacancy and shall not reapply for an opportunity to train for a permanent posting in the same occupation for a period of two years.

72
16.15	RECALL OF LAID OFF EMPLOYEES
If the Business Unit determines that a job remains vacant after the posting procedures have been exhausted the Business Unit will recall the senior employee from the recall list who is qualified to fill the normal requirements of the available job in reverse order to that in which lay offs were carried out subject to the provision of Article 18 (Recalls).

74
location of his former job and his home and the location of the job he successfully applied for. The travel allowance is not applicable to any employee other than the applicant selected to fill the initial vacancy that was posted in the first instance. The name and employment number of the successful applicant for every such vacancy shall be posted for at least 7 calendar days during the aforesaid period of 14 calendar days on the bulletin board on which notice of such vacancy was posted.

When an employee on a Union leave of absence is the successful candidate for a job posting and elects to remain on leave, the Business Unit shall
75
fill the posting by selecting another successful candidate from amongst those applicants who applied for the original job posting. If the vacancy has not been filled by the foregoing, the Business Unit shall apply the provisions of Article 16 (Job Postings).
Upon completion of the leave of absence the employee shall be placed in the actual job for which he was the successful candidate and if such job no longer exists or there are surplus employees in the occupation, the provisions of Article 17 (Layoffs) will apply.
16.20	CHANGE IN TYPE OF SHIFT
When, in the interest of efficiency of operations, the Business Unit assigns an employee in any occupation from one type of shift to another in the same occupation it will, to the extent permitted by the requirements of operations, have regard to the seniority ranking of the employees reasonably available.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, an employee who fills a temporary vacancy shall at his option, on its termination exercise his seniority and displace the employee within his respective first-line supervisor's group (second line supervisor's group for maintenance departments) who has the least seniority and who occupies the same occupation on a temporary basis. Such employee who is displaced shall revert to his former occupation.
16.25	COMBINING OCCUPATIONS

79
closing down includes any layoffs) will be added to the retransfer list for that department. If the Company determines that a permanent vacancy occurs in the former department and in the occupation that the employee was transferred from, the employee can exercise retransfer rights in order of his seniority ranking on the retransfer list for his former department before the Company posts the vacancy.
The employee's retransfer rights will be in effect for 3 years from the date when the employee was transferred to the other department. The employee's retransfer rights shall be only for the original department he was transferred from for the reasons stated above.
An employee who declines a retransfer will be removed from the retransfer list and no longer have retransfer rights to his former department.
80
ARTICLE 17-LAYOFFS
17.01	COMPANY PROGRAMS
Where permanent workforce reductions have not been achieved through attrition, the following programs will apply as set out below:
(a) Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive (VERI)
In the event of permanent downsizing or permanent job loss the Company will provide employees, who are eligible to retire under the terms of the Revised General Pension Plan, with the opportunity to take advantage of a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive (VERI) in order to minimize the number of permanent layoffs. The number of VERI's offered will not be less than the number of anticipated layoffs and shall be offered on a seniority basis:
(i)	Where the permanent reductions are to occur within a production occupation, to all production employees within that area of the Business Unit (i.e. Mines Operations, Mill Operations or Smelter Operations) or;
(ii)	Where the permanent reductions are to occur within a Skilled Trades
81
Occupation, to all employees within this trade across both Business Units.
Employees who qualify and are selected according to their seniority will be scheduled for retirement dates over a period not to exceed eight (8) months in order to meet the operating needs of the company.
Those employees who actually qualify for the VERI and retire under the terms of the Revised General Pension Plan will be provided with a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive payment of $1,000 per year of service	with	a	minimum	payment	of
$20,000.
It is understood that temporary workforce reductions and workforce reductions caused by attrition will not trigger the terms of the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive.
(b) Severance pay
Severance pay for an employee shall be calculated based on a factor of $1,000 per year of service with a minimum payment of $4,000	and	a	maximum	payment	of
$30,000. Severance pay shall include any entitlement of an employee under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario and applicable regulations.
82
An employee, upon receipt of severance pay shall lose his right to recall and shall be presumed to no longer have any seniority with the Company or be deemed to be an employee of the Company.
Severance pay will not be paid to any employee who is terminated for just cause, or who leaves the employ of the Company prior to the effective date of his layoff.
17.02	LAYOFF IN EXCESS OF 14 DAYS
In all cases of reduction in the workforce of duration in excess of 14 days, including those of an emergency nature, other than as provided in section 17.05 (Vacation Shutdown) employees affected will have the opportunity to be relocated in the order of their seniority ranking in accordance with the following placement and bumping sequence:
a)	Production Occupations
I.	Placement into Vacancy within his Occupation in his Department
II.	Placement into Vacancy within his Occupation in his Business Unit
III.	Bump within his Occupation in his Department
IV.	Bump within his Occupation in his
83
Business Unit
V.	Placement into Vacancy within his job class in his Department
VI.	Placement into Vacancy within his job class in his Business Unit
VII.	Bump within his job class in his Department

Where the surplus employee in the highest Job Class with the most seniority is to bump the junior employee, where possible, in his Department or in his Business Unit in the next lower Job Class in an occupation which has been redesigned by the company, such senior employee will be allowed to exercise his seniority provided he can perform the duties of one of the former occupations which now comprise the redesigned job. If the Business Unit requires such senior employee to perform the duties of more than one of the former occupations in the redesigned job, the Business Unit shall
84
provide the senior employee with such reasonable training as will enable the employee to meet the requirements of operations.
b)	Skilled Trades/Services Occupations
I.	Placement	into	Vacancy	within	his
Occupation in his Business Unit
II.	Placement	into	Vacancy	within	his
Occupation in the other Business Unit
III.	Bump within his Occupation in his Business Unit
IV.	Bump within his Occupation in the other Business Unit
V.	Placement into Vacancy within his job class in his Business Unit

85
c)	In the application of all of the bumping language outlined in 17.02 (a) & (b) and the review process outlined in 17.03 (a) & (b) (Review Process), a Production Department employee may only bump into or be placed into a job within another Production Department. Similarly, a Maintenance Department employee can only bump into or be placed into a job within another Maintenance Department. However, in the application of 17.03 (c) and 17.04, this restriction will not apply.
17.03	REVIEW PROCESS
After the process outlined in 17.02 (Layoffs in excess of 14 days) above has been completed on paper, all of the bumping and placements will be reviewed to determine if an employee with a seniority date below the cut off line for layoffs is still retaining a position. If this is the case, notice of this position will be posted in that Department and employees in that Production Department may apply and selection will be made in accordance with 16.13 (Job Selection). If the employee retaining the position is in a Maintenance position, the position will be posted across the Business 86
Units and selection will be made in accordance with 16.10 (Eligibility to Apply for Maintenance Department Posting).
If there is no successful applicant for any such posted job, the Business Unit will select the senior employee from the Business Unit in which the vacancy occurred who had worked in the occupation on a permanent basis previously and who would otherwise be laid off and can meet the normal requirements of the job.
Should the job still remain unfilled, the Business Unit will select the senior employee who would otherwise be laid off and can meet the normal requirements of the job and place him in it.
An employee who would be permanently laid off out of seniority ranking and be unable to retain a job in his own Business Unit as per 17.02 and 17.03 will be provided with an appropriate one-time training period of up to one (1) month for the purpose of training to give him the opportunity to meet the normal requirements of the job in an occupation occupied by a junior employee in his Business Unit.
87
17.04	BUMPING BETWEEN BUSINESS UNITS
Where an employee has exhausted all opportunities within his own Business Unit, he may;
(a)	opt to be laid off from his own Business Unit and have his name placed on the recall list as per Article 18 (Recall).
(b)	providing that his seniority is higher than others who are not being laid off, bump to another Business Unit providing that he displaces the junior employee in an Occupation which he has previously held and can perform the normal requirements of the job. Failing this an employee may;
(i)	bump the junior employee in the lowest Job Class in the other Business Unit, provided he is senior to that employee.
(ii)	should there be no one in the lowest
Job Class in the other Business Unit that the employee can bump, he may bump a junior	employee in the next
progressive higher Job Class provided he can perform the normal requirements of the job and the process continues thereafter until he is unable to attain a job in this process, and then he shall;
88
(c)	be laid off from the Company and have his name placed on the recall list as per Article 18 (Recall).
17.05	VACATION SHUTDOWN
Not more than once in each calendar year between June 1 and September 15, each Operation may schedule a vacation shutdown which will not exceed 30 days. During such shutdown the Operation may require employees to work during all or some of the shutdown period. Employees not required to work will be required to take their regular vacation up to the full length of the shutdown period.
In any year in which such a vacation shut down is scheduled the Operation will not lay off employees for more than an additional 14 days in the same calendar year without recourse to seniority preference as provided in section 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days).
Notification of such a vacation shutdown shall be communicated by March 31st of the year in which the shutdown is to occur.
17.06	PERMANENT CLOSURE
In the case of a permanent closure of all or a
89
portion of a Business Unit, the Company will;
(a)	Offer the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive in accordance with section 17.01(a) (Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive). If sufficient numbers of employees do not retire under the terms of the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive, the Company will;
(b)	Implement the bumping procedure as outlined in sections 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days) and 17.04 (Bumping Between Business Units). Employees who have exhausted all opportunities to displace:
(i)	an employee within their own Business Unit as per section 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days) may; prior to displacing an employee in another Business Unit in accordance with section 17.04 (Bumping Between Business Units), opt to accept severance pay in accordance with section 17.01 (b) (Severance Pay).
(ii)	any other employee in any Business Unit, in accordance with section 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days) and 17.04 (Bumping Between
90
Business Units) may decide to accept severance pay in accordance with section 17.01 (b) (Severance Pay) or may choose to be laid off and placed on the recall list.
17.07	NORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE JOB
Except as outlined in 17.04 (3)(a) (Bumping Between Business Units), the employee must be able to perform the normal requirements of the job before he can be placed in a vacancy or displace another employee.
17.08	REQUIREMENTS OF OPERATIONS
The Business Unit may retain, by seniority, sufficient employees in each occupational classification to meet the requirements of the operations.
17.09	APPLICATION OF OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
Where there are surplus employees in more than one Occupation, the bumping process will begin with the highest job class and will proceed in
91
order from highest job class to lowest job class.
17.10	APPLICATION OF SENIORITY
Where there are two or more surplus employees in an Occupation, they shall be arranged in seniority order and the surplus employee with the most seniority starts bumping first.
When a senior employee bumps into an Occupation he will bump the junior employee in that Occupation, regardless of the location of that employee's Operation.
ARTICLE 18 - RECALLS
18.01 RECALL RIGHTS

An employee must be notified of any change in his day off or days off to another day off or days off at least 24 hours prior to the commencement of the work week. If he is not so notified he shall be entitled to be paid at the rate of one and one-half times his hourly rate for the time worked by him on such days which were initially scheduled as a day or days off.

24.17 COLLAR TO COLLAR SCHEDULE
Hoisting and lowering schedules at the Company's mines shall be no more than the hours scheduled at each particular workplace (i.e. 8 hours, 10 / hours etc.) from collar to collar for each shift, but variations from such schedules not exceeding 10 minutes which do not occur consistently shall be disregarded.

(b)	in excess of 30 minutes to 60 minutes an additional 1/2 hour at straight time,
and so on, on the same basis for delays in excess of 60 minutes. In addition, any applicable off-shift premium shall be paid.

It is understood that delays in excess of ten minutes as referred to in this section are delays in excess of ten minutes after the posted cage time.
119
24.18 PAY FOR TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS
The Company will continue to recognize the principle of paying an employee who is temporarily assigned to work in an occupation carrying a higher rate of pay than the occupation from which he was assigned the higher rate immediately.
In addition, where an employee spends at least 4 hours working in an occupation carrying a higher rate of pay than his normal occupation, he shall be paid for his whole shift at a rate not less than that higher rate.
Where an employee is assigned to temporary work in an occupation carrying a lower rate of pay than his normal occupation, he will be paid the rate he would otherwise have received in his normal occupation up to a maximum of ten working days.

When an employee, because of failure of the Company to inform him by notice or otherwise that no work will be available, reports for work on schedule, in good faith, and is advised that there is no work available, he shall receive 4 hours pay at his applicable hourly rate without being required to work the said 4 hours but such
120
4 hours shall not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply when an employee has been absent from his regular work period and has failed before reporting for work to inform his supervisor or such other supervisor designated by the Company for this purpose of his intention to return.
24.20 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
Where an employee by reason of the death of his spouse (including same sex spouse) or child, mother, father, brother or sister requires leave from work, the Company shall grant leave up to five consecutive regularly scheduled working days within the period of 7 calendar days from the date of death with pay at his regular rate exclusive of shift or other premium rate.

121
Where an employee by reason of the death of a brother-in-law or a sister-in-law requires leave from work to attend the funeral, the Company shall grant leave of one day with pay at his regular rate exclusive of shift or other premium rate.
The Company shall not unreasonably withhold additional bereavement leave without pay, in unusual circumstances.
24.21 JURY DUTY
An employee who is called for jury duty or is subpoenaed as a witness and who as a result thereof loses time from work shall receive for the time so lost the difference between what he would have been paid for the number of hours lost at his regular rate, including cost-of-living allowance and the Nickel Bonus and Sudbury Operations Employee Performance Incentive, and the jury or witness fee to which he is entitled. The Company may require the employee to furnish a certificate of service signed by the Clerk of the Court before making any such payment. Such time off will be considered as time worked for the purposes of calculating entitlement to overtime under section 24.03 (Overtime Rate).

The Company does not guarantee to provide work for any employee or to maintain the work week or working hours presently in force.
24.23 WORKWEEK
The work week shall commence at 8:00 a.m. Sundays. This section shall not be construed to mean that all employees on the day shift will start exactly at 8:00 a.m.
24.24 BANKED OVERTIME
Commencing on January 1, 2001, the banking of overtime will commence in accordance with this Article.
Other than as provided in the extended shift schedule agreement(s) and the banking of statutory holiday pay in accordance with Article 24, the Company will allow an employee to bank sufficient overtime (premium time) to enable him to take the equivalent of three (3) shifts off per calendar year. Such time may be taken at a time in such calendar year which is agreed with the employee's supervisor.
(Example: an employee who works an 8 hour 123
overtime shift would receive 8 hours of pay and be eligible to bank the 4 hours of premium pay as banked time.)
When an employee elects to take banked hours as time off, he shall be paid at his regularly posted rate of pay. Such hours taken shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of all other provisions of the collective agreement.
All banked hours not taken will be paid for in full at his regularly posted rate of pay at year end.
An employee may request to be paid for all or a portion of his banked hours at any time.

To assist in resolving problems and to afford employees a means by which they can seek review and possible reconsideration of a denied claim, an informal procedure has been established between the Union and the Company: a Union representative, who may be
172
accompanied by the employee, may go directly to the representative of the benefits carrier, an Insurance Company; this may be followed by discussion with a Human Resources representative and finally by a written submission, presented by Senior Union Officials to Senior Company Officials.
31.04 CHRISTMAS GIFT
The Company will make a gift of $100 each Christmas to each employee hired before the first day of September of the year in which the Christmas falls. A gift of $100 will also be made to each retiree and surviving spouse.
ARTICLE 32-WAGES
32.01	HOU RLY WAG E RATES
The schedule of Hourly Wage Rates hereto attached as "Schedule A" and the Schedule of Occupations and Job Classes hereto attached as "Schedule B", both forming part of this agreement, shall be in effect from 12:01 a.m. February 1, 2010 and shall remain in effect during the term of this agreement subject to any further increase in the wage rates as provided in section 32.02 (Cost of Living Allowance).
173
The foregoing shall not limit the Company from assigning a new occupation to a job class or increasing the job class of an occupation to provide for changes in the Company's operations. The Company agrees to discuss any new job class or wage rate with the Union in advance of implementation and in the event of disagreement to deal with the matter under section 10.06 (Direct Difference). In the evaluation of occupations, the Company will continue to use its current evaluation and classification method, which is based upon the CWS method.
The Company may at its' sole discretion, introduce, amend, or discontinue an incentive plan or plans developed to encourage and reward improvements in the productivity, cost, quality and overall performance of a Business Unit or part thereof. Such an incentive plan shall not result in a reduction of wages or other benefit to which an employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement and it shall not form part of this Agreement nor be subject to grievance or arbitration.
32.02	COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE
A Cost-of-Living Allowance ("COLA") based on the Consumer Price Index (1986=100) (the
174
"CPI") issued by Statistics Canada will, if applicable, be paid to each employee and calculated as hereinafter set out.
The COLA shall be computed using the CPI for December 2009 as the base CPI. The first COLA will use the difference between the base CPI and the first Comparison Month, which will be the month of March 2010. A one (1) cent adjustment (the adjustment) shall become payable for each .084 change in the CPI.
The first COLA adjustment is payable the pay period immediately following the publication of the CPI for the month of March 2010. Subsequent COLA payments will be according to the following schedule using the following Comparison Periods:
175
Adjustment Dates on the first pay period on or after publication of the CPI for:	Comparison Periods use the CPI for:
Mar. 2010	December 2009 -March 2010
June 2010	March 2010-June 2010
Sept. 2010	June 2010 -September 2010
Dec. 2010	September 2010 -December 2010
Mar. 2011	December 2010 -March 2011
June 2011	March 2011 -June 2011
Sept. 2011	June 2011 -September 2011
Dec. 2011	September 2011 -December 2011
Mar. 2012	December 2011 -March 2012
June 2012	March 2012-June 2012
Sept. 2012	June 2012-September 2012
Dec. 2012	September 2012 -December 2012
176
The COLA will not form part of the base wage but will be calculated as a float and paid in addition to the base wage. A decline in the CPI will reduce the float but will not affect the base wage for each hour worked at regular rates.
Effective the publication of the CPI for the publication dates of December 2010, December 2011, and December 2012, the COLA shall be added in to the wage rates then in effect and the adjustment shall revert back to zero.
No adjustment, retroactive or otherwise, shall be made as a result of any revision that subsequently may be made in any Consumer Price Index.
The continuance of the adjustment shall depend upon the availability of the CPI calculated on its present basis and in its present form. In the event the CPI is not so available the parties shall mutually agree to an alternative equitable arrangement.

2.	Mediation/Arbitration Process
The parties agree that for the life of this current collective agreement, the following Mediation/Arbitration Process will be used on a trial basis. A one day Mediation/Arbitration session will be scheduled on a monthly basis if required.
Where any issue grieved by either party is properly referred to arbitration following step two (2) of the grievance procedure, the parties may jointly and voluntarily agree to refer any such grievance for resolution to the following Mediation/Arbitration procedure:
1.	The Company and the Union must be in agreement on the grievance(s) to be referred to this process.
215
2.	The single mediator/arbitrator used for all mediations/ arbitrations shall be a representative from Pathe, Gardner & Associates.
3.	Each party shall share equally in the expenses and remuneration of the mediator/arbitrator;
4.	Subject to the requirements of operations and upon written request from the Union, to be given not less than 7 days in advance, the Chief Steward will be granted time off, without pay, to attend the med/arb hearing for grievances within his Operation.
5.	The mediator/arbitrator will set a date for the hearing, within a reasonable time period, and choose a neutral location, in Sudbury, Ontario, to conduct the hearing;
6.	Each party shall put its version of the issues and facts in writing, and deliver a copy (and any supporting documentation) to the other party three (3)
216
calendar weeks prior to the hearing. Either party may then request a meeting with the other party for the purpose of clarification and discussion of the information contained in their written submission.
7.	Each party shall then put its full version of the issues and facts in writing, and deliver a copy (and any supporting documentation) to the other party and to the mediator/arbitrator one (1) calendar week prior to the hearing. Neither party may subsequently introduce issues or facts not presented in the written submission.
8.	Such written statement of issues and facts as enumerated in #6 and #7 above may not be used or referred to in any forum other than the hearing for which it is prepared, and is completely without prejudice to either party's position in proceedings other than the hearing for which it is prepared.

10.	If the mediator/arbitrator is unable to affect a settlement between the parties, the mediator/arbitrator will rule on the grievance at the hearing or within 48 hours if requested.
11.	The mediator/arbitrator shall possess the same jurisdiction as an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the collective agreement, except that there will be no formal testimony or evidence.
12.	Any settlement or award produced as a result of this proceeding will be binding only in respect of that particular grievance and will neither set a precedent for future disputes
218
nor be relied upon or referred to in other proceedings.
13.	When the mediator/arbitrator rules on the grievance, the parties will present final argument only, as the facts will be as contained in the statement(s) of issues and fact. Such argument may be made orally or in writing. The normal onus of proof shall apply, as shall the normal order of presenting argument.

219
4.
Contracting Out
Supporting the Company's commitment in Section 5.01 and maintaining the significant reductions made in contractor levels, the Company commits to an ongoing process to continue efforts to reduce the number of contractors performing Production, Development, Maintenance and Services work which is normally performed by employees in our Mines and Plants. Reduction may occur through a combination of actions, which may include elimination of the work, current employees taking on the work or the hiring of additional employees.
In order to manage the contracting out the following specific commitments to manage contracting out levels are made for the term of this agreement:
1.	At each operation the Chief Steward and the Senior Management Representative at the operation will meet monthly to review current and proposed contracting at the operation in order to develop plans to minimize contracting consistent
220
with the factors described in Article 5.01 of the Collective Agreement.
2.	The Business Units will continue to provide the Union with monthly reports of the work contracted and these will be reviewed at the Union-Management meetings as provided for in Article 4.02 (Union-Management Meetings) of the Collective Agreement. This review will:
a)	Monitor the	progress	of
the Company's commitment to minimize contracting and;
b)	Monitor the effectiveness of the process at each operation.
3.	In addition, the Company commits to:
1)	Continue to	minimize
the use of Mining and Lateral Development contractors in stoping and drifting.
221
2)
Utilize 2 internal crews to perform Alimak raising within the Sudbury Mines on raises less than 300 feet. This commitment is contingent on Alimak Leaders performing the required duties and that the scope of work required necessitates at least 2 crews.
3)	Maintain a level of
Diamond	Drillers
performing underground diamond drilling at 23, provided that the scope of work required necessitates at least 23 diamond drillers.
4)	Continue to maintain the current levels (as of the date of ratification) of Mine Serviceman A's to perform underground construction at each Mine Operation.
222
5)	Maintain the gains
made in reducing the levels of Underground Heavy Duty Mechanics and	Electrical
contractors within our Mine Operations.
6)	The Construction Crew will provide service to the Sudbury Smelter, where practicable.
Once every quarter, senior management at each Business Unit will meet with the senior Union Representative (as per Article 2.02), the Unit President and the Chief Stewards from the Business Unit to discuss contracting out, hiring to replace retirements and to review progress made to minimize contracting consistent with the factors described in Article 5.01 of the Collective Agreement.
5.	Disability Benefit
The insurance carrier will provide an employee in receipt of disability benefits with at least 4 weeks notice of intention to suspend benefits. The Health and
223
Welfare Officer of the Union will receive a copy of the written notice. The notice will state intended date of suspension, the reason for suspension, and, if appropriate, any actions the employee may take to maintain benefit continuation. Should there continue to be a lack of clarity, the Disability Management Committee will meet to discuss the issues surrounding the dispute and will attempt to resolve the problem.
Where the reason for suspension results from a dispute between physicians over the ability of the employee to return to work or an interpretation of medical information submitted, the insurance carrier shall continue to provide the relative benefits received for a maximum of 4 weeks.
Where the disagreement is not resolved, the Company will organize for an Independent Medical Examination by an appropriate Examiner.
The Company shall pay for any portion of the Independent Medical Examination which is not covered by OHIP.
Where an employee must travel outside
224
of the area of Sudbury, the Company shall reimburse the employee for any reasonable incidental costs for attending such medical.
If an employee who is in receipt of LTD benefits or who has exhausted his S&A benefits is able to return to work with restrictions but modified work is not available and the employee is to be removed from the LTD benefits then the employee will be entitled to access a Disability Continuance Program benefit. The benefit shall be those of the LTD benefit program. The employee's period of entitlement shall be equivalent to his seniority with a minimum of 1 year's entitlement provided he is ready and available to perform work that the Company has or makes available. The employee must participate and cooperate in any medical examinations, rehabilitation program and provide such reports as may be required of him from time to time. Employees with 10 or more years seniority who become entitled to this benefit, will remain, subject to the terms of this provision, entitled to these benefits until age 65 or until becoming entitled to an unreduced pension, whichever is earlier. Where the Company is able to identify reasonable
225
employment outside the Company that the employee is able to perform and the employee does not actively pursue the attainment of such employment, the employee's entitlement to these benefits shall cease. For the purpose of calculating seniority, partial months shall be considered as a complete month. Benefits under the plan shall cease at the earlier of the employee obtaining age 65 or becoming entitled to an unreduced pension.
If at the conclusion of these benefits the employee still has not been returned to work he shall have the option of:
(a)	ending his employment with the Company and receiving a Transition Assistance Package which shall be equal to 2 weeks' pay at his basic rate for each year of service but in no event shall the entitlement be less than 8 weeks' pay, or,
(b)	being placed on layoff and continuing to receive Prescription Drug, Vision, Hearing, Dental and Semi-Private Hospital coverage at the same level of current active employees until the Company is in
226
a position to either accommodate him,	or, he	acquires	alternate
employment	or,	he is able to
proceed onto an unreduced early pension.
Employees	receiving	the	Transition
Assistance Package are not entitled to any other severance program offered under the	terms	of	the	Collective
Agreement.
The Disability Management Committee shall do a quarterly review of employees off under the terms of this program.
6.	Diesel Emission Reduction
The Company recognizes the impact of control technologies and maintenance practices with respect to particulate matter in diesel emissions. As such, the Company has, continued to replace underground equipment with newer, lower emission engines and will continue to do so. The company also commits to actively pursue and continually look into new control technologies, in an effort to reduce the sulphur and/or particulate matter in underground diesel 227
equipment engine emissions.
During this Collective Agreement, the Company also commits to a process of continual improvements in maintenance practices in underground operations.
As a result of this continual improvement process, any
implementation plans will be developed as necessary and reviewed and discussed with the Union. The Union will be represented by the Union President (or designate), CAW Health & Safety Coordinator and one of the Full Time Worker Health & Safety Representatives from the Mines/Mill Business Unit.
7.	Mining Crew Performance Issues
When the Company proposes to move an employee from one mining crew to another or one shift to another because of his performance, the Mine Captain or Mine Superintendent will explain to the employee and Chief Steward in the operation the reasons for this proposed
228
movement prior to the move taking place.
8.	Union Executives
The Company agrees that the leave granted to the individual referred to in Article 20.01	(b), for whom the
Company will pay the cost of benefits and pension, will, at the request of the Union, be extended from year to year during the term of this Agreement. To enable this individual to address and effectively deal with issues arising out of the Union - Company relationship, the individual will spend time on a regular weekly basis at each Business Unit. The Company will provide him/her with office space at each Business Unit.
The Company further recognizes that the Senior Union Representative referred to in Article 2.02 will be required to attend to administrative and other local Union matters at the Union's office and will provide reasonable opportunity to carry out these duties.
229
9.	Union Health and Welfare Officer
The Union recognizes the significant costs of providing benefits and agrees to work cooperatively with the Company on cost containment initiatives.
For the term of this Agreement, the Company will release a Union Health and Welfare Officer from his job on a daily basis to attend to health and welfare business on behalf of those employees covered by this Collective Agreement and to serve as a union representative on benefit cost containment projects initiated by the Company.
To enable the Union Health and Welfare Officer to do this, he will be provided with office space at each Business Unit and work in close coordination with the designated representative(s) on various cost containment issues initiated by the Company. As his duties also require him to work with retirees, surviving spouses and disabled employees, it is understood that he will also work as required at the Local 598 office. He will be required to keep in regular contact with the Human Resources Manager at each Business Unit and will notify him of his planned
230
absence in advance.
The Company will pay the Union Health and Welfare Officer at Job Class 28 plus C.O.L.A. and the Nickel Bonus and Sudbury Operations Employee Performance Incentive and will pay the cost of benefits premiums for those items set out in Article 31 (Pension & Health Benefits). During this appointment the employee shall accumulate seniority and credited service. Upon termination of his appointment the employee shall return to his former department and occupation if it still exists; if his occupation no longer exists the provisions of section 17.02 (Layoffs in Excess of 14 Days) shall be applied to determine a new occupation.
10.	Construction Crew
For the life of this agreement, the Mines/Mill Business Unit will continue to have a Construction Crew of tradesmen to do construction work. Should there be a temporary lull in construction work, it is understood that employees in the Construction Crew would perform maintenance work.
231
11.
Business Unit Structure
This is to clarify the intent of the Company in the application of sections 1.02 (Organization) and 1.03 (Changes To Organizational Structure), that for the life of this Agreement, the Company will not subdivide the Mines/Mill Business Unit and/or Sudbury Smelter Business Unit into a number of smaller Business Units. The Company further confirms that any new mines in the Sudbury District, including the potential operation of Onaping Depth, will be included in the Mines/Mill Business Unit and covered by the terms of this Agreement.
12. Fraser Morgan Project
The Fraser Morgan Project is currently in the project development phase. Should the decision be made to develop the Fraser Morgan Project, the Company will begin the transition of its employees, should they be available, during the capital development phase to perform Production, Maintenance, and Services work as well as lateral development. Should it be determined that sufficient employees will not be available to
232
operate Fraser Morgan Mine the Company will, in accordance with the Collective Agreement, hire employees throughout the transition period. Such transition will be completed when mine production achieves three months of continuous operation at 60% design capacity.
13. Covering of Annual Vacation with Stats
The Company commits that for the term of this C.A. expiring January 31, 2010, that employees who have approval to book a complete rotation off for Annual Vacation and where a Statutory Holiday as defined in article 24.08 occurs within that rotation on a day the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work, and that the employee qualifies for the stat as per article 24.11 that an additional option will be provided to that employee to allow the employee to cover that day in that rotation with the Statutory Holiday as part of the vacation scheduling process.
233
14.
Benefits
The Company is committed to working with the union to ensure that all active employees, retirees, surviving spouses, and dependants ("members") have access to prescription drugs not on the Sudbury Drug Formulary if it is considered to be medically necessary in life threatening or life sustaining situations or in cases of terminal illness that cannot be adequately substituted by a drug on the formulary. The Exception Request Process will allow members to use the services of Medi-Well Services or like service during the life of this Collective Agreement, for assistance in completing the Exception Request Form or having it reviewed if the exception request is denied by the benefits carrier, at the Company's expense. Furthermore, the Company is committed during the life of this Collective Agreement to continuing its relationship with Med-i-Well Services or like service through the Medication Management Program, including meeting annually with the Union Executive to review this program.
If the Company changes its benefits carrier or the benefits plan has been updated, the Company commits to meeting with the Union within three months to discuss the change(s). The Company further commits to providing the Union and its members with new pension and
234
benefits booklets within three months of contract ratification.
The parties, in working with Sudbury Drug Formulary, will continue to work jointly and will seek to guide themselves by the four principles below:
a)	Provide participants with access to new drugs in a timely manner
b)	Clearly state which drugs are covered
c)	Is appropriate to the health care needs of participants, and
d)	Protects the plan against unnecessary costs
15. Disability Management Principles
The following represents a statement of the intentions of the Company and the Union in the treatment of employees with disabilities as defined by the Ontario Human Rights Code.
The Parties will participate in the disability management process in a manner consistent with their duties under the Ontario Human Rights Code. For employees with disabilities, the Company has the primary duty to provide accommodation, the Union has
235
a duty to assist in accommodation and an employee seeking accommodation has a duty to cooperate in the search for accommodation.
The Company will involve the Union in the disability management process in a manner which respects its role as exclusive bargaining agent, is consistent with the Union's duty to assist in accommodation and which meets any specific requirements in the collective agreement.
The company may request medical information from employees as is reasonably necessary to verify an absence from work, to provide accommodation to disabled employees and to manage an employee's return-to-work. Any such medical information obtained will be treated confidentially in accordance with legal requirements.
In accommodating a disabled employee, the Company will first assess whether the employee can be accommodated in his or her own job. If this is not possible, the Company will assess whether the employee can be accommodated in another position, short of undue hardship. As part of this assessment, any applicable collective agreement provisions will be considered. Where it is not possible to accommodate
236
a disabled employee or where a disabled employee is unwilling to accept the accommodation offered by the Company, a representative of the Union will be involved in any further discussions.
16. Vacation Relief (2010, 2011, 2012)
The parties agree to renew their letter of August 14, 1985 with respect to the temporary recall of laid off former employees for vacation relief for the duration of the renewed Agreement as follows.

II.	receive the current P&M rate of pay for such work including C.O.L.A., holiday pay, provided he meets the criteria of section 24.08 (Statutory Holiday Definitions) of the Collective Agreement, floating holiday, and vacation pay based on earnings;
III.	have P&M benefits plans premiums as set out in section
31.02	(Health Benefits) of the Collective Agreement paid for by the Company;
IV.	acquire job posting rights for temporary vacancies only, acquire no rights as per Section

V.	accumulate seniority and credited service while continuously performing the temporary relief work, including credited service as provided in Section 15.02(c)(iii) of the Agreement;
VI.	acquire recall rights as set forth in section 18.01 (Recall Rights) of the Agreement.
Former laid-off employees rejecting the temporary vacation relief recall will not lose their recall rights.
It is understood that a temporarily recalled employee will not be placed in a permanent vacancy that was not filled through the job posting procedure unless he is senior amongst the former laid off employees, including those who are temporarily recalled, who can fill the normal requirements of the job and there is no employee with retransfer rights to the division in which the vacancy was posted.
17.	ESP
The Company commits to continuing
239
the Employee Savings Plan (formerly the Employee Share Savings Plan) under the current provisions for the term of this Collective Agreement.
The ESP shall not form any part of the Collective Agreement between the Company and the Union and any employee who elects to participate in the ESP shall do so in accordance with its' terms and conditions and shall have no recourse against the Company other than that which is available to any eligible employee under the terms and conditions of the ESP.

This Agreement shall be in effect for the period of this Collective Agreement. Either party may cancel this agreement, on submission of two weeks notice in writing, to the other party.
19.	Leave of Absence for Disaster Relief Work
Union requests for Trades employees to assist in "Disaster Relief Work" may be granted under article 20, "Leaves of Absence". The Company will consider such requests under the provisions set out in Article 20.01 and that the number of Trades employees involved at any one time will not exceed 1 for every 60 Trades employees.
20.	Mines Vacation Scheduling Process

21.	Miner Apprentice
Both parties, C.A.W. and Xstrata, are currently participating in a Tri-partite Committee with the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (MCTU), who are in the process of developing a Miner's Apprenticeship type program. This Tri-partite Committee is addressing this very issue communicated by the Union.
Should the Tri-Partite Committee implement such program, and if it is adopted, during the life of this Collective Agreement, by Mines in the province of Ontario, Xstrata Nickel will participate.
22.	Smelter Hygiene
The Company will maintain the Smelter
242
hygiene monitoring programs to assess employee exposures to designated substances. Additionally, the Company will continue to assign resources towards the determination of designated substance emissions and, where feasible, implement solutions to reduce the emission of designated substances.

Chief Stewards in harassment investigation by the end of 2010. The Company also commits to arrange training in order to familiarize the Chief Stewards with EAP programs, so that they can promptly refer the employees when the need arises.
25.	Mine Production Training
When training is required in a First Line Supervisor's Crew it shall be offered by seniority to the employees in that crew who normally perform this work within this line of progression, providing they have the basic ability, skill and knowledge to be trained in the work required.

26.	Employees Bumped Out Of Occupations By Virtue Of the February 2009 Downsizing
The purpose of this letter is to allow employees who were bumped or laid off out of their occupation or trade which they held immediately prior to the February 2009 layoff to have an opportunity to apply for job postings for permanent vacancies in their former trade or occupation in situations in which the current contract language in Article 16 makes these employees ineligible to apply for such vacancies when they are posted.
The provisions of this letter will apply for the duration of the collective agreement expiring February 1, 2013 and will override
245
the provisions of Article 16 where necessary. The provisions of this Letter apply only to permanent vacancy postings.
Trades
Those employees who were bumped out of a trade occupation which they held immediately prior to the lay-off in February of 2009 will retain posting eligibility rights for the department in which they are currently working as well as posting eligibility rights for the trade from which they were bumped (for the purposes of trades postings it is assumed they are in the trade where the vacancy exists). This applies to those employees currently bumped into Mill or Smelter production roles or laid off tradespeople who are recalled into these roles. They retain this right for the duration of this collective agreement or until they refuse a trades posting offered to them.
Production
Mine Operation Departments
246
Those employees who held a production department permanent posting immediately prior to the layoff in February of 2009 and who are currently working in the Mill or Smelter production departments or employees who are rehired into the Mill or	Smelter	Production
Departments will retain posting eligibility rights for the department in which they are currently working as well as posting eligibility rights for any mine production department postings (For the purposes of mine operation production postings it is assumed they are in the department where the	vacancy	exists). They
retain this right for the duration of this collective agreement or until they refuse a mine operation production posting offered to them.
Mill and Smelter Operations Departments
Those employees who held a Mill or Smelter production	department
permanent	posting	immediately
prior to the lay-off in February of 2009 and employees who are
247
rehired into the Mill or Smelter Production Departments will retain posting eligibility rights for postings in the department in which they are currently working as well as posting eligibility rights for the plant production department in which they were working immediately prior to the layoff (for the purposes of Mill or Smelter production postings it is assumed they are in whichever plant production departments where the vacancy exists). They retain this right for the duration of this collective agreement or until they refuse a posting to the department from which they were bumped or laid off which is offered to them.
In light of the above provisions of this Letter, and in consideration of the accommodation made herein for affected	employees, such
employees will, when working in production jobs at the Mill or Smelter, be treated as having the lowest seniority of the employees working in production at the Mill or Smelter for their first 18 months of work at either location, for purposes
248
of the selection of employees for training programs on such production jobs.
27.	Pension Review Committee
During negotiations for the renewal of the 2007 Collective Agreement expiring January 31, 2010, Xstrata Nickel and the Canadian Auto Workers, Local 598, Sudbury Mine Mill and Smelter Workers, discussed the longer term challenges with respect to the existing pension plan, which is the General Pension Plan (GPP).
The Company indicated that the current defined benefit plan (GPP) poses significant cost and legacy challenges over the longer term. The Company stressed that the need to effectively manage such risk going forward is critical to the business in Sudbury.
As such the parties are committed to the following action plan as a means of addressing this challenge:
249
Establishing a joint committee, effective April, 2010, comprising no more than 3 members from each of the Company and the Union.
Representing the Company:
Xstrata Nickel Director of Pensions, a representative from the Sudbury Operations Management Team and a member of the Company's Negotiations Committee or designate for the renewal of the 2010 Collective Agreement
Representing the Union:
The Canadian Auto Workers, Director of pensions/benefits (or equivalent), a representative of the National office of the Canadian Auto Workers, and the Senior Union Representative, Local 598, or Union President.
The parties agree to the following:
Monthly meetings for a period of 6 months, commencing in April, 2010, at which the parties will work toward improved understanding with respect to the financial
250
challenges facing the current General Pension Plan in the future.
28.	Fraser Copper Zone Workforce Transition Agreement and Permanent Rehiring of Employees
The purpose of this letter is to set out the parties' agreement with respect to the resumption of operations at the above mine. This letter amends and/or overrides certain provisions of the collective agreement in order to achieve the objectives which were discussed at bargaining and shall form part of the collective agreement expiring February 1, 2013.
Fraser Copper Zone is in the care and maintenance phase currently but has recently undergone infrastructure upgrades in order to support current plans to begin pre-production activities in February 2010.
The Company currently intends to resume mining activity in the Fraser Copper Zone provided that it remains economically viable to do
251
so. As such, in staffing the resumption of mining activities at Fraser Copper, a Workforce Transition Agreement (WTA), as set out in this letter is required in order to ensure that the requirements of the Company's other operations in Sudbury (Nickel Rim South, the Smelter and the Mill) are met and are not hampered by the staffing of Fraser Copper.
The workforce transition phase for the re-staffing of Fraser Copper will run from February 2010 through to the end of February 2011.
As discussed at Negotiations approximately 140 production and maintenance employees are estimated to be eventually required for the Fraser Copper activity and it is the Company's objective to have the full workforce complement for this activity employed as of the end of September 2010. For reasons set out below, it will not be possible however to ensure that 100% of those employees who are identified to work at Fraser Copper will
252
actually be employed at that site by September 2010.
Further to the above, the Company estimates that it will rehire approximately 100 laid off employees and that a layoff of approximately 40 production and maintenance employees, as development activities at Nickel Rim South wind down, can be avoided as a result of the execution of this WTA. The majority of these 40 employees will be relocating from NRS.
A: WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS
It is the Company's intention to conduct a workforce planning process on paper and to discuss this with the Union at the outset of the process although this will not prevent the Company from utilizing necessary employees according to the staffing plan outlined below with respect to the Fraser Copper activities while the staffing planning is still taking place.
253
The following is the order in which the Company contemplates assigning people to Fraser Copper.
1.	Care and Maintenance Department Employees
Those employees who currently hold permanent postings in the Care and Maintenance Departments of the former Craig and Fraser Mines will become part of the Fraser Mine operation.
2.	Retransfers
Those employees	who have
retransfer rights to Fraser Mine will be offered a one-time immediate retransfer opportunity, pursuant to Article 16.26	of	the	collective
agreement.
•	Production	employees
entitled	to	such	retransfer
rights currently include 26 Miner A's,	2 Diamond
Drillers, and 1 Miner B at the NRS Mine.
•	Trades	employees with
retransfer	rights	are 12
254
HDEM's, 6 Electricians, 1 Welder, and 11 Millwrights.
Note that in order to not interfere with the business operations of other departments, operations or Business Units, the Company will require a grace period within the transition phase to retransfer all of these millwrights and as a result, the Company commits to review its plans for transferring employees with the Union following the paper staffing exercise and as needed during the transition phase.
In filling vacancies at Fraser Copper either by retransfer or by using Care and Maintenance employees, it is agreed that eligible employees will be afforded one opportunity with respect to any vacant positions for which they are qualified, to secure a position at that Mine. In the event that such an employee has elected to fill a position at Fraser Copper, the employee shall not be permitted to apply for any posted vacancies until after the completion of the workforce transition phase and after the project is fully staffed.
255
3.	Process to Fill Remaining Vacancies
The job posting process in Article 16 and, where applicable. Letter 26 and Article 18 of the collective agreement will apply in filling the remaining Fraser Copper vacancies.
B: GENERAL
It is understood that the following principles are agreed with respect to the process to be followed in all instances of employee movement to Fraser Copper.
• It is understood that in order to ensure the efficiency of operations and achievement of targets at Nickel Rim South, the Smelter, and the Mill, the Company requires flexibility to phase the movement of employees over an 18-month transition period giving due preference to occupational and business requirements at Nickel Rim South and other existing operations due to the need
256
to backfill for trained employees who will be moving to Fraser Copper.
•	Movement of employees to
and	from Nickel Rim South,
the	Mine and Smelter will
only occur once any interference with the needs of the operation from which employees are leaving have been minimized, and so long as the operation from which employees are leaving continues to meet its performance targets.
•	The	Company and the Union
will	meet quarterly to review
the movement of employees and discuss any issues.
•	To provide further and future flexibility, the Company commits to posting 20 % of mine production vacancies Business Unit wide once the transition phase has ended.
Within the period of the transition
phase outlined herein, it shall be in
257
the sole discretion of the Company to determine the point in time at which an employee can be released from his current work assignment to assume duties at Fraser Copper.
On condition that the business objectives of the affected operations are being achieved, the Company anticipates that, by August 31, 2010, 75% of the transition of employees to Fraser Copper will be complete. The movement of the remainder of employees to be moved to Fraser Copper will be completed by no later than February 28, 2011.
It is understood that during the period in which Fraser Copper is awaiting the arrival of employees who have secured a position at Fraser Mine, the Company may use the recall process or the processes under the collective agreement which contemplate volunteers from the workforce to fill job requirements on an interim basis at Fraser Mine. The use of employees on an interim basis is permitted no matter which of the processes herein the employee to be transferred has
258
used to secure a position at Fraser
Copper.
It is also understood that:
•	Employees in the occupations of either Miner A or Miner B in the Sudbury operation will not be allowed to self-demote during the transition process.
•	Recall in accordance with
Article 18 will be used to fill any remaining production occupation	vacancies.
Recalled employees will be placed into vacancies considering the efficiency of the operations at Fraser Copper.
•	In consideration of the staged movement of employees associated with the staffing of Fraser Copper, travel allowance will not be paid to any employee who is changing jobs as a result of the staffing of Fraser Copper, whether or not such
259
employee is or will be working at the Fraser site.
As discussed, employees working at the Fraser Copper Zone will adopt and follow the "Swedish Schedule" with respect to their hours of work and work schedule, and more particularly, weekday shifts will be eight (8) hours and the weekend shifts will be ten (10) hours.
