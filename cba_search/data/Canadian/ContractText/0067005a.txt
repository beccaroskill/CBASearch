1.01	WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to co-operate in establishing and maintaining proper and suitable conditions in the Company which will tend to secure uniform and equitable terms of employment and conditions of labour satisfactory to the Company and the Union, and to provide methods of fair and peaceful adjustment of all disputes that may arise between the parties hereto or between those represented by them and who are affected by this Agreement, and in order to ensure, so far as possible, uninterrupted operation and general stabilization of the Company’s business, and to ensure a proper and ethical conduct of the business and relations between the Company and the employees.
SECTION 2
2.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agent for those of its employees listed and classified under the clause entitled “Wage Rates and Classifications" in this Agreement. New Classifications may be added from time to time when mutually agreed between the parties hereto.
2.02	The Company agrees that the Union may have the assistance of representatives from outside its own local in any negotiations or discussions between representatives of the parties hereto, provided that all such representatives are approved by Local #1.
2.03	Those employees not members cf the bargaining unit. shall not do the work of any employee covered by this Agreement unless with the consent of the Union.
SECTION 3 Discrimination
3.01	The Company and the Union agree there shall be no discrimination against any employee because of their race, color, sex or religious creed.
3
SECTION 4 Management Functions
4.01	The right to hire, promote, demote, discharge or discipline for just cause and to ensure the efficiency of the employees and of the Company's operation is the sole responsibility of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
SECTION 5 Union Security
5.01	All employees in the bargaining unit are required to remain members of the Union in good standing for the duration of this Agreement as a condition of employment.
5.02	All new employees shall be called Temporary Employees or Probationary Employees.
1(1) The present system for the assessment of new employees will continue to operate as it has but that in recognition of certain concerns with this present system there will be more involvement and dialogue between the Line Manager and the employee. Where the Probationary Employee has, during their period of evaluations, a reporting relationship to more than one Line Manager, then all Line Managers for whom the employee has worked shall collectively make his/her probationary assessment.
(2)	A Temporary Employee may be released for unsuitability, in the sole discretion of the Company. In the event that a Temporary Employee is terminated for disciplinary reasons the standard of cause for review of the Company's decision shall be whether the decision was arbitrary, discriminatory or is in bad faith.
(3)	The Company shall have the unfettered right to use Temporary Employees on a twelve month basis annually in order to supplement its seniority workforce. Temporary Employees do not acquire
4
seniority as a result of time worked. The Union agrees that it will neither submit nor process any grievance of its own or by or on behalf of a Temporary Employee challenging the Company's utilization of Temporary Employees within the London plant and in particular, any grievance alleging that vacancies exist in permanent jobs as a result of the Company's utilization of Temporary Employees.
(4)	A Temporary Employee shall only be entitled to those rights and benefits prescribed by statute unless he/she is specifically accorded additional benefits and rights under the collective agreement.
(5)	A Probationary Employee must work 250 days in order to achieve seniority. In the case of a probationary employee with broken service, this broken service will be allowed to accumulate over a two (2) year period.
A Probationary Employee may be released for unsuitability, in the sole discretion of the Company. In the event that a Probationary Employee is terminated for disciplinary reasons, the standard of cause for review of the Company's decision shall be whether the decision was arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.
In matters of layoff and recall Probationary Employees shall be entitled to preference over Temporary Employees.
Hiring Practices
5.03	In the matter of employment, the Company will give unemployed members of the Brewery, General and Professional Workers Union Local #1, who are in good standing with the Union and competent to perform the work, preference in employment.
5.04	Upon the employment of Probationary Employees or Temporary Employees the Union shall issue to each such employee upon payment of the required fee, a Union Permit Card.
5
Check Off
5.05	The Company will continue, as agent for the Union, the present voluntary revocable dues deduction agreement and all Union Dues and assessments shall be deducted from each weekly pay cheque. Such monies collected shall be paid to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union, not later than the 10th day of the month following the month in which the deductions were made, accompanied with the list of the names of all employees for, and in behalf of whom such deductions have been made. Monthly statements showing the names of all additions and deletions of staff shall also be forwarded to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union.
In the event that any such deductions are not made for reasons of sickness, vacations, leave of absence, etc., they shall be collected from the weekly pay cheque of the employee on their return to work. (No more than two (2) weeks arrears in any one (7) week.) The Union will inform the Payroll Department of any Union arrangements in force, regarding exemption from payment of Union Dues.
The Union can request the Company to change the amount of dues deducted no more than twice annually. Any request to change the amount of dues being deducted must be authorized by the Local Union.
SECTION 6 Union Activities
6.01	If the Union will give the Human Resources Manager twenty-four (24) hours notice of Union Executive meetings, he/she will arrange to have at least one Executive member from each of the five (5) departments released from work to attend the meeting.
Special Leave of Absence
6.02	The Company agrees to grant unpaid leave of absence, upon written application, for a period of not more than twelve (72) months or for the balance of the duration of this Agreement (whichever is longer) to any employee
6
who has been elected or appointed as an official of the Parent Union or of the Local Union or who has been elected to public office, if such duties require he/she to have leave of absence from Company duties on a full time basis.
Employees on such leave of absence may be continued as active members of the pension and welfare plans (subject to applicable legislation and/or government regulations or directions) upon payment of the total contributions to such plans whether from the Union or employee concerned. During such period of leave of absence the employee's seniority shall continue to accumulate as if he/she were employed at their regular post by the Company.
6.03	On each January 1 an Educational Leave of Absence Bank will be established which consists of one hundred (100) days total in each year for The Bargaining Unit. Upon written application by the Union President, the Union may request an Educational Leave of Absence for employees without loss of regular pay. Such application will be submitted to the Department Manager at least two (2) weeks in advance from the date for which the leave is requested. The purpose of such leave shall be limited to education related to union activities. The Department Manager will respond to the application within three (3) days of its receipt and permission for the leave of absence will not be unreasonably withheld.
Leaves of Absence must be requested for a minimum of one (I) day at a time. Any days which may remain in the Bank as of December 31st shall not be accumulated into the next year.
6.04	If an employee in the bargaining unit encounters a bona-fide picket line in the course of their normal duties there shall be an immediate conference between the parties hereto before any decision is made by either party as to whether the picket line should or should not be respected.

The Company also agrees that if the Union President is defeated in an election held by Local #1 or resigns he/she may return to their former position. This understanding is given provided the Union agrees to any crew relocation’s made necessary by the Presidents return to the work force.
SECTION 7 Seniority
7.01	The Company agrees to recognize the seniority rights of all employees who are members of the Union. Seniority is designed to give Union members an equitable measure of security based on length of service with the Company. Seniority will be the determining factor in layoff and choice of annual summer vacation period; and will be a factor in promotions and job assignments when a vacancy occurs.
7.02	Each employee will have seniority standing in the department in which he/she is employed. Except in the case of employees whose seniority rights have already been established an employee’s seniority will be established in accordance with Section 5.02 of this agreement.
7.03	An employee does not have seniority rights until he/ she completes the probationary period. Once established, an employee’s seniority date will remain unchanged except as provided for herein, and the employee’s name will be placed on the department seniority list of the department within which he/she is working.
7.04	The Company agrees to compile and post departmental seniority lists of all Union employees within three (3) months after signing of the Agreement. Such lists shall be amended and reposted quarterly. If, within one (7) month after the first posting, an employee submits proof that their seniority date should be altered and such proof is accepted by the Company and the Union, an amendment will be made accordingly. The Company will also supply the Union with a copy of the seniority lists and the correction thereto.
8
7.05	The departments referred to above shall mean:
Brewing Packaging Staging Distribution Plant Services Retail Store
7.06	The following Union Executive Officers: President, Vice-president, Secretary-Treasurer, and Recording Secretary shall hold top plant and departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of lay-off only.
7.07	Departmental Executive Members and the Union Steward shall hold top departmental seniority during their terms of office for the purpose of lay-off and transfers out of their department only. In the event that more than one employee holds top departmental seniority, then the order of their seniority for purposes of lay-off or transfer out of their department only will be interpreted as being the order in which they are mentioned above.
7.08	An employee's seniority date will be established as set out in Section 7.02 and no changes shall be made in an employee's seniority date, except as provided for therein or as in Section 8 or Section 12.11.
SECTION 8
Termination of Seniority
8.01	Seniority will cease for any of the following reasons:
(a)	Where a permanent employee voluntarily resigns. All such resignations shall be in writing and signed by the employee concerned.
(b)	Where an employee is discharged for cause and such discharge is not reversed through the grievance procedure.
(c)	Where an employee obtains leave of absence for reasons other than those given when the request was made, for accepting unauthorized employment, or for failing to pay union dues, while on leave of absence.
9
Unauthorized employment is employment not approved by the Company and the Union.
(d)	Failure to notify the Company (accepting a call back to work after a lay-off) within seventy-two (72) hours (excluding Saturday and Sunday) of recall notification by registered mail of the last address on file with the Company, and failure to report to work within seven (7) days of acceptance of recall.
(e)	When an employee has their name withdrawn from Union membership. In the event this should occur, the Union will give the Company in writing the reasons for such action.
(f)	For employees with less than two (2) years seniority, a continuous lay-off of twelve (72) months or more will result in the termination of seniority. For those employees with seniority of two (2) years or more, a continuous lay-off of twenty-four (24) months or more will result in the termination of seniority.
(g)	Where an employee is absent from work for three (3) consecutive working days without having notified the Company and received permission to be absent in advance, unless the employee can demonstrate that he/she could not obtain advance permission.
SECTION 9
Special Leave of Absence During Lay-Off
9.01	During periods of lay-off, permanent employees may apply for special leave of absence if they have obtained steady work elsewhere. Such employees shall not be called for short periods of employment during the period of layoffs, but they shall be required to comply with Section 8.01, paragraph (d), when they receive a formal recall.
9.02	The Company will not issue such formal recall unless the amount of work available is expected to last at least four (4) weeks, or unless there are no other laid-off permanent employees available.
9.03	Employees who are granted special leave of
10
absence will be required to pay Union Dues during the period of leave.
SECTION 10 Lay-Off and Recall
10.01	In the case of a lay-off, Temporary Employees, if any, and then Probationary Employees shall be laid off first plant wide, with the exception of skilled tradespersons whose services are mutually deemed to be essential for the efficient operation of the Company. Laid off employees will be allowed to replace more junior employees in other departments provided the employees exercising such rights are able and willing to do the job. Employees who exercise these rights would do so for the period of lay-off only and their security in the original department would not be affected.
10.02	Except in the case of extreme emergency, the Company will give permanent employees who are to be laid off notice on the bulletin boards three (3) working days prior to lay-off. If the employee is on leave of absence, or absent through sickness or on Worker's Compensation at the time of lay-off, the employee shall be subject to the lay-off provisions the same as if he/she were on active status.
10.03	Any employee who is laid off or continues to be laid off in violation of seniority must present a claim, in writing, to the Human Resources Department within three (3) working days from the date of notice of such employee's lay-off, otherwise it shall be deemed that compensation for time lost arising out of any wrongful lay-off is waived. The Company will promptly determine the merits of written claim and if it is found that the lay-off was unjust the affected employee will receive their straight time lost during such lay-off.
10.04	When rehiring takes place in any department, the reverse of Section 10.01 will be followed (i.e. laid off permanent employees will be recalled in order of their seniority within that department). In the event that additional
11
employees are required by that department, then permanent laid off employees holding seniority in another department will be recalled in the order of their seniority. Permanent employees recalled to work in another department will not transfer their seniority rights to the department in which they are recalled except as provided for in Section 11.
Employees who hold top departmental seniority pursuant to Article 7.07, and who are laid off will be recalled in order of seniority.
10.05	Notification of recall shall be made by registered mail to the last address which the employee shall have recorded with the Company, and the Recording Secretary of the Union shall be notified thereof. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep the Company notified of their mailing address in order that he/she may be contacted within seventy-two (72) hours as provided in Section 8.01 (d).
SECTION 11
Transfer and Work Assignments
11.01	In the event of a permanent transfer of an employee from one department to another, the said employee shall retain their accumulated seniority in the new department.
11.02	Employees may at any time apply for transfer from one permanent job to another, or from one shift to another (other than nights to days) within their department, or from one department to another, or for training programs relating to jobs within the bargaining unit.
An employee may also apply for transfer from one department to another for health reasons, providing Management and Union mutually agree this is a valid reason for application.
11.03	When permanent job vacancies arise or training programs conducted, those employees who have applied will be given first consideration, but other applications may be invited. Selection for such vacancies or training programs will be made on the basis of present qualifications or demonstrated ability to benefit from
12
training, but where other things are equal, seniority will apply. Selections made in accordance with this Article will be discussed with the Union.
11.04	Employees who apply but are not selected may discuss their application with the Department Manager concerned and if still dissatisfied may file a grievance commencing at Step 3.
11.05	Employees who voluntarily relinquish a higher hourly rated job for a lower rated job cannot return to the former job, except as provided for herein.
11.06	An employee transferred at their request to another department or to another job or shift in their department shall not be permitted to request another transfer unless he/she has spent twelve (12) months in that department, job or shift. This restriction shall not prevent an employee from applying for a posted day job at any time.
11.07	In assigning employees to daytime jobs, the senior employees shall be given preference if able and willing to do the job. A daytime job refers to a job where there is no shift work.
11.08	If any employee requests a transfer to a lower rated job because of personal preference, he/she will, if the transfer is made, be paid at the lower rate.
11.09	If any employee is transferred on the initiative of the Department Manager (and not because of a request of the employee) for the efficiency of the department, for his/ her own good, or because of undisputed disability, he/she will be paid at the lower rate unless the employee has had at least seven (7) years service, or one (1) year continuous employment at the higher rate and in such case the employee will retain their rate until such time as the job rate exceeds the rate being paid. Thereafter, the employee will be paid the contract rate for the job.
11.10	In the event that such a transferred employee is retransferred to their original department before August 1st of the following year for production work, the employee will be paid the higher rate for the balance of the calendar year in which he/she was transferred plus a maximum of ten (10) months.
13
11.11	It is agreed that in arranging personnel for the different shift crews in the Packaging Department, the Company will post an Executive Member and a Steward in each crew. The posting will be based on the list of Executive Members and Stewards submitted to the Company by the Union.
11.12	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of the Company to assign employees where necessary in order that the efficiency of the department is not impaired. Should an employee who has been transferred at their own request as outlined in Section 11.02 be required to work in other areas because of production requirements, the employee will be returned to their regular shift or department when normal conditions exist. This will not affect the employees right of transfer as noted in Section 11.02 above.
11.13	With the exception of Maintenance Mechanics who are covered independently herein, employees transferred or assigned temporarily to a job paying a higher rate of pay will be paid at the higher rate for all hours worked in the higher rated job. This section does not include employees while on work stabilization or a defined training program.
11.14	If at any time it becomes necessary to make transfers because of lack of work or departmental reorganization the following procedure will be followed:
(a)	The employee affected will first replace an employee with less seniority in his/her department, providing he/ she has the ability and qualifications to perform the work.
(b)	If there is no one with less seniority in the department, or, if they should lack the ability and qualifications, they may then exercise their right to replace employees with less seniority in other departments. At the time of the transfer the Company will advise the employee and the Union as to whether the transfer is temporary or permanent.
After the employee is advised that he/she has been permanently transferred, he/she may submit a request for transfer to job vacancies as specified in Section 11.02.
14
11.15
(a)	The Company must supply adequate manpower in all operations in all departments at all times so that an employee will not be required to perform more than a fair days work.
(b)	Clause (a) shall not be construed to mean that the manning of all operations is at present exactly adequate or that all employees are presently assigned exactly a fair days work and accordingly changes in an employee’s work load may be made so long as the resulting situation is not a violation of Clause(a).
(c)	Whenever changes are to be introduced, which may affect bargaining unit personnel, the Company agrees to notify the Union as soon as it is practicable prior to finalization of plans. A meeting will be arranged with the Union to discuss an appropriate disposition of the employees affected.
11.16	Classifications During Overhaul
When a scheduled overhaul is planned and lay-offs are avoided through work stabilization, a list of selected employees to support the mechanical trades will be made by Management. Selection will be based on aptitude and ability for work. Compensation will be based on the following criteria:
(a)	Employees assigned to work with Maintenance Mechanics to perform jobs requiring mechanical skills will be paid the Maintenance Mechanic “C” rate for such work.
(b)	Employees assigned to work with Maintenance Mechanics or Painters to do routine general maintenance or painting work will be paid the Maintenance General Rate.
It is understood that the number of employees qualifying for the “C" Mechanic Rate is dependent upon the circumstances prevailing at the time the Company requests additional supporting staff for the mechanical trades.
15
It is also understood that, from time to time, there may be employees selected whose aptitude and ability to do the work assigned to them is to be assessed. Whenever this circumstance occurs, the employees will be paid the Maintenance General Rate for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks.
It is also understood that employees who are assigned to other work stabilization jobs outside the Maintenance Department in order to avoid lay-off will be paid their regular rate.
The Company agrees to supply the Union with names of those employees who when performing work that required the use of their additional abilities would receive the “C” mechanic rate. This list will be updated from time to time as employees show their ability.
SECTION 12 Promotion and Vacancies
12.01	Promotions or allocations to better paid jobs or to more desirable jobs within the bargaining unit shall be based on seniority provided that the applicants have the ability and are qualified and considering the efficient operation of the Company. In the event that a senior employee lacks necessary training, the Company will arrange to give the necessary training wherever in the opinion of the Management, this is practicable.
12.02	Except in the Packaging Department, the Company agrees to post for fifteen (15) working days all vacancies for permanent jobs in the bargaining unit. The Company is not obligated to consider applications which are received after the expiration of the fifteen (15) working days.
12.03	The Company agrees to post summer vacancies in the Retail Store no less than fifteen (15) working days before the vacancies arise. The most senior employees will be selected from applicants provided they are approved by the Marketing department.
12.04	All permanent vacancies will be posted on all plant bulletin boards and will set out the nature of the job, the
16
qualifications required, and such other information as may be necessary. All permanent employees may apply for such jobs.
12.05	The Company agrees to fill such vacancies from the list of applicants subject to the provisions set out in "Section 72.07" above. If a vacancy cannot be filled from the list of applicants, the Company may select another candidate.
12.06	The Company shall have the right to fill vacancies temporarily pending a permanent appointment to the position.
12.07	Upon appointment to a new position, the selected employee will undergo the normal three (3) month probationary period, but such period may be extended in specific instances after discussion and agreement with the Union. If an employee demonstrates that he/she will not qualify within the probationary period, he/she may be required to return to their former position before such time without prejudice and without loss of seniority.
The selected employee may, within the above probationary period, request a return to his/her former position if he/she provides reasons satisfactory to the Company for such request. In the event that the employee is permitted to so return, he/she shall not be eligible to apply for any further posted jobs for a period of one year from the date of his/her return to their former job. This restriction shall not prevent an employee from applying for a posted day job at any time.
Line Manager and Other Non-Bargaining Unit Positions
12.08	The same posting procedure for Line Manager positions will be followed except that the Company maintains the right to invite other applicants. All Line Manager appointments shall be posted on bulletin boards as soon as the appointments are decided on and before the appointee assumes their new duties. It is agreed that before Line Manager appointments are announced, the Company will advise the Union of its selection but nothing
17
in this section shall affect the right of any applicant having greater seniority to submit a grievance if he/she feels that they have been discriminated against as a result of such decision, but such grievance shall not be arbitrable.
12.09	With qualifications for the job being given full and prime consideration, employees having the greatest seniority shall be given preference for promotions to Line Manager positions.
12.10	The Company may post other job opportunities outside the bargaining unit to give Union members an opportunity to apply but the postings of such jobs shall not be considered a contractual matter or governed in any way by the terms of this Agreement.
12.11	If a permanent employee transfers to a nonbargaining unit Company position he/she will continue to pay Union dues for a period of six (6) months from the date of their transfer, the employees seniority in the bargaining unit shall be frozen as at the date of their transfer, and the employee will forfeit his/her seniority in the bargaining unit unless he/she transfers back to the bargaining unit within six (6) months from the date of the transfer. The Company will deduct the required dues and remit them to the Union.
12.12	Withdrawal cards will be issued free by the Union to those who qualify under the constitution and By-Laws of the Union.
12.13	If an employee from the bargaining unit is selected for a position outside the bargaining unit the normal probationary period will be three (3) months, but such period may be extended in specific instances after discussion and agreement with the Union. If an employee demonstrates that he/she will not qualify within the probationary period, the employee may be required to return to their former position before such time without prejudice and without loss of seniority.
12.14	The procedure for filling temporary Line Manager positions will be the same as for permanent non-bargaining unit vacancies. While working in such a position, bargaining
18

Your AD&D insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company.
5.	Weekly Indemnity Benefit
If you become totally disabled and are prevented from working due to a non-occupational accident or a sickness not covered by Worker’s Compensation, you will receive weekly indemnity benefits provided you are under the care of a licensed physician. If disability commences during a period of lay-off you will be eligible for Weekly Indemnity benefits from the date you are reoalled to work only if you have 10 or more years seniority and you are recalled within a period of two weeks from the date of lay-off and you are totally disabled on that date.
The amount of your weekly indemnity benefit is 70% of your basic weekly earnings rate as of the date disability commences. When a general change in wage rates takes effect under the terms of the labour agreement, the amount of your weekly indemnity benefit from the effective date of such change will be 70% of the basic weekly rate to which you would be entitled if you were at work. Your weekly indemnity benefit payments will be reduced by the amount of any disability payments which you are eligible to receive from the Canada Pension Plan or any other government source.
The benefit payment is based on a seven (7) day week. For each day of absence for which a benefit is payable you will receive one-seventh of the weekly benefit. Benefits are payable from the first day of absence if disability is due to accident, or from the fourth day of disability due to illness. Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks).
78
Where it is necessary for an employee to have dental surgery, benefits will be payable commencing on the fourth day following such surgery and will continue up to a maximum of two weeks for any such claim, but only on receipt of proper certification by a dental oral surgeon.
A disability resulting from the same cause as a previous disability will be treated as a continuation of the disability unless you have completely recovered and have been back at work for at least fourteen (14) days.
Your weekly indemnity insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your weekly indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	Long Term Disability Benefit
Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits become payable only after you have received weekly indemnity benefits for the maximum period, or when you have received Worker’s Compensation payments for a continuous period of twenty-six (26) weeks.
During the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LTD benefits, your benefit will be payable weekly at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect during that period. At the end of the first seventy-eight (78) weeks, your LTD benefit will be fixed at 66-2/3% of your basic weekly earnings rate in effect in the 78th week'of the LTD benefit period and thereafter your LTD benefit will be payable in an equivalent monthly amount at the end of each month. For example, if your earnings rate in the 78th week is $23.15 per hour:
(a)	your weekly earnings rate is
40 x $23.15	=	$926.00
(b)	your weekly LTD benefit in the
78th weekis 66-2/3% of	$926.00	_	617.34
(c)	thereafter your monthly LTD benefit
is 4-1/3 x $617.34	=	$2,675.14
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker’s
79
Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
In order to qualify for LTD benefits you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first seventy-eight (78) weeks of LID benefits, be unable to perform a regular job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least six (6) months.
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. If you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefit will continue for up to twenty-four (24) months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from rehabilitative employment. For example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $2,675.14 and you earn $1,500 in rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD benefit	$2,675.14
Subtract 75% of $1,500	1.125.00
LTD benefit during rehabilitation	1,550.14
Earnings from rehabilitative employment	1.500.00
Monthly income during rehabilitation	$3.050.14
80
While you are in receipt of LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits. Please refer to the Labatt Retirement Plan section of this booklet for a description of the pension credits which will accrue to you while you are disabled.
Your LTD insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company.

such as holiday pay, vacation pay. Weekly Indemnity, LTD or Worker’s Compensation or similar benefits from more than one source for the same day or part day.
The only exception shall occur where an employee is in receipt of a Worker’s Compensation Board partial disability pension for a totally unrelated condition to that which is the basis for the Weekly Indemnity or Long Term Disability claim.
7.	Semi-Private Hospital Benefit
Your provincial health plan (OHIP) provides basic hospital benefits for you and your family but generally limits benefits for room charges to the amount payable for ward accommodation. Insured benefits are provided under the Company's plan for you and your covered dependents to supplement the provincial plan benefit and provide payment for room charges up to semi-private accommodation in a licensed hospital. If hospitalized in a private room the benefit will be limited to that which would have been paid for semi-private accommodation. These benefits-apply to all confinements approved by a licensed physician except those covered by Worker's Compensation.
Your semi-private hospital insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company except that:
(a)	If you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for up to one year for expenses incurred during the continuance of that disability.
81
(b)	If one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in hospital.
(c)	If you or your dependent spouse are pregnant on the date insurance coverage is canceled, you/she will be entitled to semi-private hospital benefits up to the date of childbirth or termination of pregnancy as if the insurance were still in force.

This is known as the “deductible” and is applied to each insured person, employee or dependent, except that the total deductible for all members of your family will not be more than $20 in each calendar year. If expenses which are included in the deductible occur
83
within the last three months of the calendar year the same expenses may be applied against the deductible for the next calendar year. If two or more insured members of your family are injured in a common accident only one deductible will be applied against their resulting combined expenses incurred in any one calendar year.
The amount of benefit payable is determined as follows:
(a)	the charges are totaled for all allowable expenses incurred by the employee or dependent during the calendar year
(b)	from this total the deductible is subtracted
(c)	the major medical expense benefit then pays 100% of the remainder
The maximum total amount payable for any individual is $25,000 per lifetime. However, after a person has been insured for a full calendar year, up to $5,000 of the original benefit will be reinstated on January 2nd of each year but at no time will the maximum exceed the original amount.
The major medical expense benefit does not cover periodic health check-ups and examinations, eye refractions or fitting of glasses, dental services, travel for health, expenses resulting from an act of war, charges for hospital room and board, hospital and medical expenses for services covered by the provincial plan, expenses for injury or illness covered by Worker’s Compensation Act, or any service for which an employee or dependent does not have to pay.
If when you retire you are entitled to group life insurance as explained in Section 3, you and your eligible dependents will continue to be insured for major medical expense benefits. You will continue to be required to pay the first $10 of expenses incurred in each calendar year as a “deductible” applied to each insured person with the total deductible for all members of your family not to exceed $20 in each calendar year.
You will then be reimbursed for 80% of any eligible expenses incurred after the date of your retirement in excess cf the deductible. The maximum total amount
84
payable for expenses incurred after your date of retirement is $10,000 for each individual member of your family.
If you terminate service and do not qualify for retired benefits your major medical insurance will be canceled as of the date on which your service is terminated, except that the following extended benefits are provided:
(a)	if you are totally disabled when your insurance is canceled, major medical benefits will be extended for up to one year, provided such expenses are incurred during the continuance of that disability
(b)	if one of your dependents is in hospital when your insurance is canceled, benefits will be extended for a maximum of one year provided the dependent remains in the hospital
(c)	if you or your dependent spouse are pregnant on the date insurance coverage is canceled, benefits will be payable for treatment as a result of that pregnancy.
9.	Dental Care Benefit
Dental Care Benefits are provided for you and your eligible dependents subject to the limitations and exclusions described below.
Eligible services are all reasonable and customary dental services which are recommended as necessary and performed by a qualified dentist or physician and for which a Treatment Plan has been submitted to and approved by the insurer before the services are rendered. The filing of a Treatment Plan is not required if the total cost of the proposed work is less than $500 or if treatment is rendered in emergency conditions. Eligible dental services are classified under three major categories:
(a)	Basic Services — examinations and cleaning of teeth (once in any six-month period), extractions, fillings and other necessary treatment for the relief of dental pain.
(b)	Restorative Services — crowns and inlays, bridge work, dentures, root canal therapy (endodontics), and the treatment of tissues and bones supporting the teeth
(periodontics).
85
(c) Orthodontia — proper fitting of natural teeth and prevention or correction of irregularities of the teeth.
You will be reimbursed for 100% of the cost of eligible Basic Services incurred by you or your eligible dependents up to a maximum for each insured person of $800 in a calendar year. You will also be reimbursed for 75% of the cost of Restorative Services and 50% of the cost of Orthodontia to a lifetime maximum benefit cf $6,000 for each insured person for Restorative Services and Orthodontia combined. An annual reinstatement of up to $600 will be provided at the beginning of each calendar year, if required, to restore the lifetime maximum to the level of $6,000. At no time will the maximum exceed the original amount. Benefits will be paid on the basis of the lesser of the actual fee charged or the amount stated in the current Dental Association Schedule of Fees in the province in which you reside. If optional procedures are possible, benefits will be payable in accordance with the procedure involving the smallest fee.
Expenses incurred for the replacement of dentures are eligible for benefits, except that if the replacement is for a denture for which benefits were payable under this plan, benefits for the replacement will be payable only if at least three (3) years have elapsed since the placement or replacement for which benefits were paid. In addition, benefits are payable for rebasing, relining or repairing of dentures. Benefits will not be paid for the replacement of dentures which have been lost, misplaced or stolen.
Dental care benefits are not payable for any service eligible for payment from another source such as provincial health insurance plans, Worker’s Compensation or government plans, expenses incurred principally for cosmetic purposes, expenses resulting from an act of war, or any service for which an employee or dependent does not have to pay.
Your dental care insurance will be canceled as of the date you retire or terminate service and claims will not be accepted for any service performed after the date on which your insurance is canceled.
86
10.	How to Claim
When you or any of your dependents are entitled to receive insured benefits, you should obtain the necessary claim forms from your foreman or department head. When you have completed the employee’s portion of the claim form you should have your physician or dentist complete his section. Then send the completed hospital, major medical or dental form to the insurance company and the completed weekly indemnity or LTD forms to the medical department.
In order to qualify for payment of benefits, claims must be submitted within the time limit set out below:
(a)	Weekly Indemnity Benefit — Claim must be filed within ninety (90) days of commencement of disability. In case of illness benefits will be paid as previously described only if you see a licensed physician no later than the fourth day of disability and remain under the doctor’s care until you are able to return to work. If you do not see a doctor by the fourth day, your benefits will be payable only from the day on which you first visit a doctor. In case of accident, you must see the doctor no later than the day following the accident in order to qualify for benefits from the first day; otherwise benefits will be payable as if the disability is due to illness. Diagnosis and prescription by telephone only does not constitute a “visit" for this purpose.
(b)	Long Term Disability Benefit — Claim must be filed within six (6) months following the date from which LTD benefits become payable but the earlier the better in order to avoid any delay in commencement of your LTD benefit payments.
(c)	Semi-Private Hospital Benefit — Claim must be filed within ninety (90) days of the date of hospitalization. Standard claim forms are available at all hospitals. Benefits will be paid to you unless you complete the appropriate section of this form to assign benefits to the hospital.
a7
(d)	Major Medical Expense Benefit — Claim must be submitted no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred except that, when your insurance is canceled for any reason, proof of claim must be submitted within ninety (90)days of the date of termination of your insurance. Itemized bills and statements showing the patient’s name, dates of service, prescription numbers for drug expenses and amount of the charges, must accompany the claim form verifying all such expenses including those which you have paid to satisfy the deductible. It is suggested that such claims not be submitted until the total bills exceed the deductible by at least $10.
(e)	Dental Care Benefit — Claim must be submitted by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred except that proof of claim must be submitted within ninety (90) days of the date on which your insurance is canceled for any reason. A separate claim form must be filled out for each member of your family for whom you are making claim. The dentist’s statement on this form, or any bills supporting your claim, must show the patient’s name, dates and nature of the treatment and the charge. If the total cost associated with proposed dental work is $500 or more, a Treatment Plan must be submitted to the insurer as explained in Section 9. You should have your dentist complete a claim form setting out details as to the proposed treatment and the cost and send this form to the insurance company for their review. You will then be advised as to the charges, or portion thereof, which the insurer considers eligible for benefits. Upon completion of the dental treatment you again submit a claim to receive payment of the approved benefits.
Failure to see your doctor promptly or to submit your claim together with the doctor’s or dentist’s report or other itemized statements within the above time limits will result in the rejection of your claim.
88
Provincial Hospital and Medical Plans
The provincial health plan (OHIP) provides basic health benefits for you and your eligible dependents. OHIP provides benefits for standard ward care, medical services such as doctor's calls at office, hospital and home, surgical procedures, administration of anaesthetics, diagnostic procedures and x-rays, chiropractic and osteopathic treatments*,chiropodistic* and podiatric treatments* (*limited to annual dollar maximum), eye tests and specified dental procedures, as stipulated by government regulations.
The Company pays the required payroll tax for the financing of the provincial health plan. All employees will be covered for benefits, provided you apply for coverage for yourself and your dependents through the local Ministry of Health Office.
The major medical benefit for which you are covered after retirement will be continued to your spouse on your death.
Please see your Human Resources Department for any further information.

Appendix “D”
Labatt Retirement Plan
For Brewery Workers In London
This section of the booklet is a summary of the main features of the "Labatt Brewing Company Limited Retirement Plan for Wage Employees" as amended January 1, 1996 with respect to Brewery Workers employed by Labatt Brewing Company Limited in London, Ontario. A complete description of the Plan which is the governing document is available for reference at your Human Resources Office. If you have any questions do not hesitate to seek the answers from your Manager or Human Resources Staff.
Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits provided by the Labatt Retirement Plan (LRP).
1.	Eligibility For Membership
A new employee becomes a member of the Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the attainment of seniority and his/her seniority date will then be established as his/her date of employment for purposes of this Plan.
You will be advised when you are eligible and are enrolled as a member and you will be asked to submit proof of your age.
2.	Contributions
You are not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of your service after January 1, 1974. Any required contributions which you have made in respect of service before January 1, 1974 remain to your credit .in the Plan and will be applied to provide benefits in respect of your service before January 1, 1974.
The Company contributes whatever amount is necessary, along with the required contributions made by employees
91
in respect of service before January 1, 1974, to provide the benefits called for under the Plan. The Company also pays the full cost of administering the Plan, and in addition, matches your contributions to the Canada Pension Plan.
All contributions to the Plan are paid over to the Royal Trust Company to be invested and held in trust for the purpose of paying benefits as provided in the Plan.
3.	Normal Retirement Date
Normal retirement is at age 65. Your pension commences as of the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following your 65th birthday.
4.	Service And Credited Service
Your service to qualify for certain of the benefits under the Plan is the total number of years from your date of employment as established under the Plan to the date on which you retire, die or terminate service.
The number of years of your "credited" service determines the amount of pension you are entitled to receive. Credited service is calculated as explained below:
(a)	From January 1, 1974 you receive a credit of one year for 1800 or more hours of work in a calendar year while a member of the Plan or a prorated partial year of credit for less than 1800 hours. For example, if while a member of the Plan you work only 900 hours in a year, your credit for that year will be one-half year (900 divided by 1800). If you are absent due to disability, you will receive service credits for any periods during which you are totally disabled and receive weekly indemnity or long term disability insurance benefits or Worker's Compensation payments, but in no event will you receive more than one year of credited service for any one calendar year.
(b)	Your credited service for the period from January 1, 1958 to December 31, 1973 is the number of years for which you have made the required contributions to the Plan.
92
(c)	If you were a member of a previous company pension plan before January 1, 1958 when the Labatt Retirement Plan became effective, your credited service to December 31, 1957 is the period from your date of employment to December 31, 1957 but excluding any periods when you were eligible to but did not contribute to the previous plan.
5.	Calculation Of Basic Pension Credit
You receive credit for a monthly basic pension payable
from your normal retirement date (age 65) calculated as
follows:
a)	for service after January 1, 1995 — $33.50 multiplied by the number of years of your credited service after January 1, 1995.
b)	for service after January 1, 1994 — $33.00 multiplied by the number of years of your credited service after January 1, 1994
c)	for service in 1993 — $32.00 for one year of credited service in 1993 or prorated amount for less than one year
d)	for service in 1992 — $31.00 for one year of credited service in 1992 or prorated amount for less than one year;
e)	for service in 1991 — $30.00 for one year of credited service in 1991 or a prorated amount for less than one year:
f)	for service in 1990 — $28.00 for one year of credited service in 1990 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
gj for service in 1989 — $27.00 for one year of credited service in 1989 or a prorated amount for less than one year:
h) for service in 1988 — $26.00 for one year of credited service in 1988 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
93
Ii) for service in 1987 — $20.00 for one year of credited service in 1987 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
j)	for service in 1986 — $19.50 for one year of credited service in 1986 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
k)	for service in 1985 — $19.00 for one year of credited service in 1985 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
I)	for service in 1984 — $17.25 for one year of credited service in 1984 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
m)	for service in 1983 — $16.50 for one year of credited service in 1983 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
n)	for service in 1982 — $15.00 for one year of credited service in 1982 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
o)	for service in 1981 — $14.00 for one year of credited service in 1981 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
p)	for service in 1980 — $13.00 for one year of credited service in 1980 or a prorated amount for less than one year;
q)	for service to December 31, 1979 — the amount of monthly basic pension to your credit for service to December 31, 1979 determined in accordance with the terms of the Plan in effect to December 31, 1979.
6.	Amount Of Normal Retirement Pension
When you retire at your normal date (age 65) you will receive a monthly basic pension from the Labatt Retirement Plan in an amount equal to the sum of your basic pension credits determined as explained in Section 5. In addition you will receive any pension which is payable to you under a previous plan (see Section 16) and any statutory pension (such as CPP and OAS) which is payable to you under
94
government plans. You may also qualify for a supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan under the minimum pension provision explained in Section 7.
7.	Minimum Pension At Normal Retirement
If you retire at age 65 with at least 25 years of credited service you are entitled to a minimum monthly pension from Company plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined of:
a)	$2,256	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1996;
b)	$2,356	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1997;
c)	$2,456	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1998;
d)	$2,556	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1999;
e)	$2,656	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2000;
f)	$2,756	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2001;
These amounts represent the minimum monthly pension payable from Company Plans and the Canada Pension Plan combined before allowing for the provision of a spousal survivor pension. The Company pension will be adjusted to provide a survivor pension unless the spouse who will benefit from that survivor pension waives their right to receive it in writing.
You will receive a minimum lifetime pension supplement from the Labatt Retirement Plan equal to the amount, if any, required to be added to your accrued basic pension from all Company plans and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits determined at the date of your retirement to provide the above minimum monthly pension.
If you retire at age 65 with less than 25 years of credited service, the lifetime supplement shall be the amount by which the minimum pension at normal retirement exceeds the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, prorated by the ratio of the number of years of credited service to 25 years and reduced by your accrued pension.
95
To determine what, if any, amount of supplement is needed, your basic pension from Company plans is the basic amount payable before the amount of the survivorship pension is calculated, and your CPP pension is the amount you are entitled to receive when you first become eligible at Normal Retirement Age, whether or not you actually make application for such benefits, but disregarding any increase in your CPP pension after its date of commencement.
8.	Special Early Retirement
If you are age 60 or over and you have 25 or more years of credited service you may elect Special Early Retirement in which case you will be entitled to an immediate accrued basic pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of early retirement, without reduction for your earlier age of retirement.
This pension will be supplemented by an amount necessary to provide the minimum monthly pension amounts set out below, until you first become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits:
a)	$1,904	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1996;
b)	$2,004	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1997;
c)	$2,104	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1998;
d)	$2,204	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1999;
e)	$2,304	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2000;
f)	$2,404	if you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2001;
96
Once you become eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65), the supplement will be recalculated as the amount required to be added to your accrued basic pension and the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits, determined as at the actual date of your retirement, to produce the following monthly pensions:
a)	$2,256	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1996;
b)	$2,356	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1997;
c)	$2,456	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1998;
d)	$2,556	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	1999;
e)	$2,656	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2000;
f)	$2,756	if	you	retire	on	or	after	January	1,	2001;
(Once again, both sets of figures above do not take account of the reduction required to produce a survivor option for the surviving spouse.)
This recalculated supplement shall become your lifetime supplement.
In addition to this recalculated lifetime supplement, you may be entitled to receive a further supplement (if you retire before December 31, 2007.) This further supplement will represent the amount, if any, necessary to produce a total pension from Company plans equal to the pension that would be payable if you were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, your accrued pension including any escalation thereof and your related credited service at the date of your retirement. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of your lifetime supplement.
9.	85 Point Retirement
A member retiring on or after January 1, 1991 and after having attained age 55 and whose age plus years of credited service total 85 or more (but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement) is entitled to an
97
immediate accrued pension equal to the amount of accrued vested pension to his credit for service to date of early retirement.
In addition, such member shall be entitled to a lifetime supplement calculated as if the member had attained age 65 on his date of retirement but using his current unreduced vested accrued pension and his related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of the member’s actual date of retirement.
Once a member becomes eligible to receive unreduced Canada Pension Plan Retirement benefits (on attaining age 65) and in addition to the lifetime supplement, a member who retires under this provision (85 Point Retirement) will be paid a further supplement, if necessary, to produce a total pension from Company Plans equal to the pension that would be payable if the member were then retiring at normal retirement, based on the normal retirement minimum pension and full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit both determined as of that date, they accrued pension including any escalation thereof and his/ her related credited service. This further supplement shall then be added to and form part of the member’s lifetime supplement.
10.	Other Early Retirement
At any time after you are age 55, you may request early retirement and elect to draw your pension. If you retire after having reached age 55 but prior to having qualified for Special Early Retirement or 85 Point Retirement, you are entitle to an immediate pension equal to the amount of vested accrued basic pension to your credit for service to the date cf your retirement, reduced by 1/3% for each month (i.e. 4% per year) you are under age 65 when your pension commences. In addition, you will be entitled to receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 65 on the date of your retirement, but using your current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada
98
Pension Plan Retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension, all determined as at your actual date of retirement.
This lifetime supplement so calculated will also be reduced by 1/3% for each month (i.e. 4% per year) you are under age 65 when your pension commences.
11.	Disability Retirement (Before Age 65)
As long as you are eligible to receive disability benefits under the Group Insurance Plan you will receive service and basic pension credits under the Labatt Retirement Plan and you will not be retired. However, if you become partially disabled and you do not qualify for insurance benefits you may qualify for Disability Retirement. Retirement under this provision requires that:
a)	you are at least age 50 and have completed 10 years of service,
and
b)	you are certified to be partially disabled and thereby prevented from performing any work available with the Company,
and
c)	it is mutually agreed by you and by the Company that you be retired under the Disability Retirement provision.
On retirement under the disability provision you are entitled to an immediate pension equal to the amount of basic pension to your credit for service to your date of disability retirement without reduction for your earlier age of retirement. In addition, until you qualify for the earlier of receipt of CPP disability benefits or the attainment of age 65, you will receive a monthly disability supplement equal to $14.00 multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to 30 years.
At age 65, you will then receive a lifetime supplement calculated as if you had reached age 65 on the date of your retirement, but using your current unreduced vested accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit
99
and the normal retirement minimum pension determined as at your actual date of retirement.
12.	Death After Retirement Joint and Survivor Pension
Your vested accrued basic pension and minimum supplements are payable for as long as you live and cease as of the first day of the month in which your death occurs.
A plan member with an eligible spouse who takes normal, Special Early, 85 Point, Disability or other early retirement on or after January 1, 1996, shall receive a joint and survivor pension, unless the member delivers to the Plan Administrator (through your Human Resources office)a written waiver of such entitlement in the prescribed form within the twelve (72) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the payment of the pension benefit.
Unless waived, your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be reduced by 10% during your lifetime. Upon your death, your eligible surviving spouse shall receive a pension of 60% of your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any (subject to a further actuarial reduction if your spouse is more than 10 years younger than yourself).
13.	Death Before Retirement
If you should die on or after January 1, 1996, while in the service of the Company and after you have reached age 55 and have 10 years of service, your eligible surviving spouse will receive a pension for his/her remaining lifetime. His/her pension will be equal to the amount of pension they would have received from the Plan had you retired as of your date of death and elected a reduced joint survivorship pension based on your reduced accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement (without the actuarial reduction, if any), but their pension will be subject to a reduction if they are more than 10 years younger than you. Pension payments to your eligible surviving spouse are guaranteed to return any required contributions you have made to the Plan with interest to your date of death.
100
The lifetime supplement will be calculated as if you had attained age 65 on the date of your death, but using your current unreduced accrued basic pension and your related credited service, the full unreduced Canada Pension Plan retirement benefit and the normal retirement minimum pension all determined as of your actual date of death.
If you die before your pension commences and your spouse is not entitled to a pension as explained in the preceding paragraph, any contributions you have made with interest to your date of death will be paid to the beneficiary you have named or, failing such, to your estate. You may change your beneficiary from time to time as permitted by law by completing a form which is available from your Human Resources office.
The death benefit paid above shall not be less than provided in existing pension legislation.
14.	If You Leave The Company
If your service is terminated on or after January 1, 1996 (other than by retirement or death) and if you have completed at least two (2) years of credited service with the Company, you will be entitled to a deferred monthly pension at age 65 equal to the accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement to your credit.
Instead of this deferred pension entitlement you may elect to transfer the commuted value of your pension to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan. Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial Locking-In Requirements.
If you were a member of the Plan before January 1, 1974, when your service is terminated you may either,
a) leave all <£ your contributions in the Plan and receive at age 65 a monthly pension equal to the basic pension to your credit December 31, 1973, which is included in the pension referred to above, or
101
b) withdraw your contributions plus interest to your date of termination of service in which*case you forfeit your credited service to December 31, 1973, and any pension in respect of such service, which is included in the pension referred to above.
Any amount so transferred may be subject to Provincial locking-in requirements.
15.	Escalation Of Pension After Retirement
If you retired prior to January 1, 1996 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
If you retire on or after January 1, 1996 from the service of the Company pursuant to any of the types of retirement listed above, your pension and lifetime supplement will be reviewed from January 1st of each year which follows your retirement date. Your accrued basic pension and lifetime supplement, if any, shall be increased on each January 1st following your retirement by the lesser of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the preceding year and 2%.
Any spousal pension will also be escalated applying the same formula, with the first increase occurring on the January 1st following your death.
16.	Previous Plans (before January 1, 7958)
If you were a member of a previous Company pension plan (Government Annuity and / or Trust Plan) in effect before January 1, 1958, your benefits from that plan are payable in accordance with the provisions of that previous plan and are in addition to the benefit you receive from the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Since your period of membership in the previous plan is included in determining your total credited service, any
102
basic pension to your credit under the previous plan is taken into account in determining the amount of any minimum pension supplement you are entitled to receive. Since your pension from the previous plan will be actuarially reduced if you retire before age 65, your basic LRP pension will include an amount equal to the difference between your actuarially reduced previous plan pension and the amount of basic previous plan pension at age 65 reduced by the same factors as are applicable to your LRP pension as explained in Section 8, 9, 10 or 11 as the case may be.
For these purposes your basic previous plan pension has been determined and fixed as that amount of pension payable from age 65 and guaranteed for a minimum of 5 years which would be available in accordance with the terms of the previous plan in effect at December 31, 1957, but excluding any pension purchased by voluntary contributions you may have made to that plan. Any increase in the amount of your Government Annuity which has resulted from an increase in interest rate from 1975 is not considered as a part of your basic previous plan pension and would be payable as an extra benefit over and above your basic pension.
After retirement your total basic pension which is subject to escalation as explained in Section 15 includes the amount of basic previous plan pension determined as explained above.
17.	Other Information
a)	Annual Statement — You will receive a statement following each calendar year end showing the amount of benefits to your credit under the Plan.
b)	Benefits Nnt Assignable — The benefits provided under the Plan are not assignable except as is specifically provided with respect to death benefits nor may you borrow against them at any time. Similarly, except as specifically provided at termination of service or in connection with death, no benefit can be surrendered.

c)	Eligible Surviving Spouse — Your spouse is eligible for a surviving spouse's pension under Section 12 or 13 provided you have been married for at least one year before your retirement or death, whichever is earlier. Under certain circumstances a common-law spouse may qualify and the Human Resources Department will answer your questions in this respect.
d)	Income Tax — All pension payments received from Company pension plans are considered as income for tax purposes in the year in which received. Your CPP and OAS pensions must also be reported as taxable income when you file your annual tax return. Similarly, ail monies received in lump sum withdrawals or death benefits must be declared as income for tax purposes in the year in which received and are taxable unless such monies are transferred to a registered retirement savings plan.
18.	Government Pension Plans
Statutory benefits from government plans such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the pension under the Old Age Security Act (OAS) are in addition to the benefits payable under the Labatt Retirement Plan.
Under current legislation your CPP pension is payable when you reach age 65, or as early as age 60 on a reduced basis. The amount of your CPP pension is dependent upon the amount of your earnings on which you have made CPP contributions and the period during which you contributed. To illustrate, an employee who retires at age 65 in 1996 and who is entitled to maximum benefits under the Canada Pension Plan receives a pension of $727.08 per month when he retires. After CPP pension commences it is subject to adjustment each following January 1st depending upon increases in the Consumer Price Index.
Your OAS pension is also payable from age 65 but if you take up residence outside Canada your OAS pension may be discontinued unless you have been a Canadian resident for a prescribed number of years. If you plan to move out
104
of Canada you should check into these requirements. The amount of OAS pension is subject to quarterly adjustment upward if the Consumer Price Index increases. In January, 1996 the OAS pension was $394.76 per month.
Your spouse will also receive OAS pension benefits payable from age 65 subject to the same residency requirements specified above.
Application must be made to receive benefits from the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security and the applications should be filed six (6) months in advance of your date of eligibility for such pensions to ensure prompt commencement of your benefits. As well as retirement pensions, the Canada Pension Plan provides certain disability, death and survivor benefits and further information can be obtained from your local Canada Pension Plan Office.
19.	Pension Examples
The following examples have been based on the Labatt Retirement Plan provisions as amended January 1, 1996 and assume the employee is credited with at least 1800 hours in each year until retirement. Minimum pension supplements are determined by taking into account the actual CPP benefit which a retiree receives at age 65.
105
‘EXAMPLE A’: NORMAL RETIREMENT PENSION
(65years of age with 25 years of credited service)
This example is based on a member who retires on July 1, 1996 at age 65 with 25.58 years of credited service.
Total Basic Pension
This member is entitled to receive a minimum monthly pension of $2,256 from the Company and CPP plans. For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member’s actual CPP entitlement.
From age 65, the member’s monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement CPP (as in 1996)
Total monthly pension from Labatt pension and CPP
Add OAS pension (as in 1996)
Total monthly income at age 65
$1,528.92
727.08
$2,256.00
394.76
$2,650.76
106
'Example B’: Surviving Spouse's Pension
This example is based on a married member who retires as in Example A' and dies shortly after retirement.
The basic pension and lifetime supplement in ’_Exampie“A’ are reduced by 10% to provide the 60% spousal benefit. This example assumes that the spouse is less than 10 years younger than the retiree. If the spouse is more than 10 years younger than the retiree, there is a further actuarial reduction in the member's and spouse's pension.
Total Surviving Spouse’s Pension
The member's monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement Total Labatt pension reduced by 10%
($1,528.9Z 90%)
Add CPP fas in 1996)
Total from Labatt pension plan and CPP Add OAS pension (as in 1996)
Total monthly income at age 65
Total Surviving Spouse's Income
Following the member's death, the surviving spouse would receive a monthly income of 60% of the above from Company plans and CPP.
The spouse's monthly income is calculated as follows: Total member pension from
Labatt Pension Plan	$1,376.03
Reduced to 60%	825.62
Add 60% of CPP* (as in 1996)	436.25
Total spouses's monthly income from Labatt and CPP	$1,261.87
In addition, if the surviving spouse is age 65 or over, they would qualify for the OAS monthly benefit of $394.76.
*This assumes that the spouse is age 65 or older. The amount of CPP spousal pension depends on the spouse's age at the time of the member's death.
107
$1,528.92
1,376.03
727.08
$2,103.11
394.76
$2,497.87
‘Example C’: Normal Retirement Pension with less than 25 Years Credited Service
(65years of age)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1, 1996 at age 65 with 20 years of credited service.
Total Normal Retirement Pension with less than 25 Years Credited Service
At age 65, the member is entitled to a supplement to provide a pro-rata minimum pension. For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member’s actual CPP entitlement.
Minimum pension in 1996 for 25 or more years of credited service
Subtract CPP pension (asin 7996)
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 25 years of credited service
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 20 years cf credited service (20/25 x $1,528.92)
Add CPP pension (as in 1996)
Total monthly pension from Labatt pension plan and CPP
Add OAS (as in 1996)
Total monthly income at age 65
$2,256.00
727.08
1,528.92
$1,223.14
727.08
$1,950.22
394.76
$2,344.98
108
‘Example D’: Special Early Retirement
(60 or more years of age and 25 or more years of credited service)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1, 1996 at age 64 with 25 years of credited service.
Total Special Early Retirement Pension
At retirement age 64, the member’s pension is calculated as follows;
Minimum total Labatt basic pension,
lifetime and temporary supplement
(assuming the member does not elect
the 90/60% spousal option)	$1,904.00
One year later, on January 1, 1997, the member’s pension is recalculated at age 65 as follows:
Minimum total Labatt basic pension and
lifetime supplement	$1,614.38
Estimated 1997 CPP	741.62
Minimum total monthly income from
Labatt pension and CPP	$2,356.00
Add estimated 1997 OAS pension	402.66
Total monthly income at age 65	$2,758.66
109
‘Example E’: 85 Point Retirement
(at least age 55, and age plus credited service add up to 85 points or more)
This example is based on a member who retires as of January 1, 1996 at 58 years of age with 27 years of credited service.
Total 85 Point Retirement Pension
For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member’s actual CPP entitlement. From age 58 to age 65, the member’s monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Minimum monthly pension in 1996 for 25
or more years of credited service	$2,256.00
Subtract 1996 CPP	727.08
Total monthly company pension from
Labatt from age 58 to age 65	$1,528.92
From age 65, in year 2003, the member’s monthly retirement income is calculated as follows:
Total Labatt basic pension and lifetime supplement
Add estimated CPP in year 2003
Total from Company plan and CPP
(equal to the estimated Normal Retirement pension for the year 2003)
Add in estimated OAS pension in year 2003 Total monthly income at age 65
$2,035.00
835.00 $2,870.00
453.00 $3,323.00
110
‘Example F’:	Early Retirement
(age 55 with 10 years of service)
This example is based on a member who retires on January 1, 1996 at the age of 55 with 20 years of credited service.
Total Early Retirement Pension
If the member had retired at age 65, he would be entitled to a pro-rata minimum pension. For the purposes of the plan, the minimum pension provided by the Company takes into account the maximum CPP for a member age 65, regardless of the member’s actual CPP entitlement.
The pro-rata minimum pension would be calculated as follows:
Minimum pension for 25 or more years of credited service in 1996
Subtract 1996 CPP
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 25 years of credited service
Minimum from Company pension plan based on 20 years of credited service [20/25 x 1,528.92]
At retirement (age 55) the member is entitled to his/her total basic pension as shown above reduced by 4% for each year before his/her normal retirement age. In this example, the pension would be reduced by 4% for each of the 10 years prior to age 65. Therefore, would be reduced by 40%
Total pension from the Company plan
Reduction of 40% of Company pension at age 65
Total monthly income from age 55
his/her pension
$1,223.14

$733.89
$2,256.00
727.08
$1,528.92
$1,223.14
111
At age 65, the member’s monthly retirement income would be calculated as follows:
Total monthly income from Labatt pension plan $733.89 Add estimated CPP (1996 level)*	727.08
Add estimated OAS in year 2006	481.00
Total monthly income at age 65	$1,941.97
*ln order to collect the maximum CPP pension at age 65, a member must have made the maximum CPP contributions for ten years prior to age 65. This example assumes that as the member retired at age 55, no CPP contributions are made for the 10 years prior to age 65. As such, it is estimated that this member would receive the CPP pension as at 1996.

Re: Group Leader Program
Philosophy and Term
It is the Company's intention to provide opportunities to employees to function as Group Leaders (selection will be based on ability). These positions provide relief for vacation, sickness, training, seasonal line-loading requirements and mutually agreed-upon special projects. Use and timing of Group Leaders will be communicated and mutually agreed to consistent with the intent of this letter.
A Group Leader term is defined as four (4) years. Should the position continue to be required, Group Leader positions will be posted upon the expiry of the four (4) year term. A posting will be put up immediately after ratification to replace existing Group Leaders who have been in place more than the four (4) year term if the Company continues to need that Group Leader position filled.
Upon completion of any term, and providing a need exists, a new posting will initiated. Employees with Group Leader experience may re-apply, however, preference will be given to new applicants who possess the required qualifications.

During 1995 negotiations the Union raised concerns regarding potential legislative changes to the existing Occupational Health and Safety Act which in their view may negatively impact on the Health and Safety Program at the London Plant.
Joint Committees
The committee will have at a minimum one Worker Representative from each department (except Retail Store), appointed by the union and those members will comprise at least fifty percent (50%) of the Joint Health and Safety Committee.
There shall be two 0 co-chairs of the committee, one which will be appointed by the union.
Training
At least two members of the worker representatives on the JHSC will be certified which requires at a minimum level III training from the Workers Health and Safety Centre or its equivalent.
Appropriate additional training will be provided for all members of the JHSC on an annual basis.
133
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter of Understanding No 15
Cont’d.___________________________Page 2_________________January 23, 1996
Alternates
The union will provide the company with the name of the certified member and their alternate on an annual basis. The certified member will notify the company if the alternate is to act in their place. If any worker member of the JHSC withdraws from their role on the committee, training will be provided to the new member as soon as reasonably possible.
Reports
Workplace inspections will be conducted on a monthly basis. All such reports will form part of the monthly minutes of the JH&SC. All health and safety policies, training materials and WCB Form 7’s that relate to current, active members of the bargaining unit on an individual request basis will be provided to the designated certified worker representative. Any confidential reports are expected to be kept in a secure place.
Rights of Workers
Should the current legislation be changed, the workers, members of the committee and the members of the Union will receive the greater protection and rights of either the legislation or this document.
This letter will form part of the Collective Agreement.
Yours truly

Mr. Les Sparling Brewery Manager Labatt London Plant London, Ontario
Dear Les:
As discussed during 1996 Negotiations the parties came to the following understandings:
•	Union and Management agreed to mutually identify opportunities of multi skilling and the means of implementation in regard to:
■	operators trained to perform “minor maintenance”
■	skilled trades running of machines for set-up trial purposes
•	In regard to “Call Back" and “Change of Shift" pay practices in the Plant Services Department the following will apply.
’’Change of Shift”: will apply where an individual's normally scheduled shift (as posted by 3 p.m. Wednesday deadline) has been changed by two (2) or more hours (including call back situation where employee works into their regular shift). Appropriate payment will only apply to the 1st such change in any given week.
135
Mr. Les Sparling
Letter of Understanding No 16
Cont'd.___________________________Page 2________________January 23, 1996
‘‘Call Back”: (4 hours min. payment) as per the Collective Agreement with the understanding that it no longer applies when an individual is “called back” within the two (2) hour period immediately preceding his regular start time. In this case it will be paid as pre shift overtime with no four (4) hour minimum. In this case the individual will continue working into their regular shift.
“Change of Shift” and “Call Back” pay do not apply when an individual is called in to “replace an employee who is ill”. This is covered off as “Pre Shift Overtime” and payment is determined by “Article 19.15" of the Collective Agreement.
I trust this appropriately reflects our understanding on the above stated issues.
As a agreed, this letter forms part of the Collective Agreement.

Dear Mr. Blain:
Re: Manpower Force Reduction Allowance /M.F.R.A.)
The following represents our agreement with respect to the payment of a M.F.R.A. by the Company to certain employees who qualify for and take 85 Point Retirement during the period in which they are in receipt of 85 Point Retirement pension benefits. It is understood that the M.F.R.A. is only available to employees who elect to retire during the term of the Collective Agreement.
The M.F.R.A. will not be paid to any employee who qualifies for and takes his pension at Normal Retirement Date, or an S.E.R, Other Early or Disability Retirement pension. Moreover, an employee who is in receipt of any separation, severance or other periodic payments which are designed to bridge him/her to pension benefits shall not be entitled to receive the Allowance while in receipt of such benefits. If an employee takes his separation pay in a lump sum, he/she shall not be eligible to receive the Allowance for the period represented by the number of weeks of separation pay he/she has received commencing from the date his/her employment is terminated and regardless as to whether he/she is in receipt of 85 Point Retirement Benefits. It is understood and agreed that the payment of this M.F.R.A. is made solely from Company operating revenues and that no part of this Allowance shall be treated as a pension benefit payable out of the pension plan.
140
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter of Understanding No 18
Cont'd.	Page 2	January 23, 1996
Each year of the Collective Agreement some employees will be eligible for the Allowance based on any of the following combinations of age at retirement and completed years of credited service.
Age At Retirement	Minimum Completed Years of Credited Service
55	30
56	29
57	28
58	27
59	26
The amount of the M.F.R.A. paid to qualifying employees by the Company shall be determined as at the date of retirement. The initial benefit which an employee is entitled to at date of retirement shall not increase for any reason during the period in which he/she is entitled to receive the Allowance. In no case shall benefits paid subsequent to the date which an employee commences to receive his/ her pension at Normal Retirement Date.
No other combination of age and minimum years of credited service other than those listed above will qualify an employee for a M.F.R.A. However, in the event of a brewery closure the M.F.R.A. will be allowed to those qualifying employees in the closing brewery only who have 85 points composed of a minimum age of fifty-five (55) at the time of closure and may not have the required twenty-five (25) years of minimum service that would normally be required.
141
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter <f Understanding No 18
Cont’d,	Page 3	January 23, 1996
The monthly allowance to be paid to qualifying employees shall be as follows:
1.	Employees retiring on or after
January 1, 1996	$375.00
2.	Employees retiring on or after
January 1, 1997	$389.00
3.	Employees retiring on or after
January 1,1998	$403.00
4.	Employees retiring on or after
January 1,	1999	$417.00
5.	Employees retiring on or after
January 1,	2000	$431.00
6.	Employees	retiring on or after
January 1,	2001	$445.00
Since the Allowance does not form part of the Pension Plan for Labatt Wage Employees, no payments by the Company on account of the Allowance will be made to the employees surviving spouse in the event that the employee dies while in receipt of the monthly Allowance.
Finally, we agreed that the Company would deduct the total amount of M.F.R.A. benefits paid to employees from any gratuitous general enhancement fund given to the Union for its use by the Company in the event of a plant closure.
This letter and obligations arising hereunder shall expire and cease to have binding effect from and after December 31, 2001, provided that any employee who commenced to receive benefits hereunder prior to December 31, 2001 shall continue to receive benefits as stipulated herein.
For the Union.

Brewery General and Professional Workers Union Local #1
London, Ontario Dear Mr. Blain:
Re: Brewery Closure/Transfer Rights
During negotiations there were extensive discussions between the parties concerning the possibility of a plant closure during the life of the Agreement. The parties agreed to the following items in the event that the Company closes the London plant during the term of this Collective Agreement.
1.	The Company will announce a tentative date for the plant closure (“the closure date”). Following this announcement, a determination will be made as to the eligibility of London employees to transfer to vacant jobs in Toronto as follows.
Eligibility for Transfer
All London plant seniority employees will be eligible to transfer to vacant jobs in Toronto or to be added to the Toronto seniority list as recall list employees except for the following groups of employees:
1. Any employee who, on the closure date, is or who will be sixty-five (65) years of age i.e.: N.R.D. pension age.
143
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter of Understanding No 19
Cont'd.	Page 2	January 23, 1996
2.	In the event that the Company decides to maintain a London-based transport fleet, and/or garage and/or warehouse, any employees who are required by the Company to continue working in Distribution and/or Staging in London.
3.	Any employee who, at the date of the closure announcement is in receipt of L.T.D. benefits or who has been continuously in receipt of Workers' Compensation benefits for the six (6) month (or longer) period immediately preceding the date of such announcement until the employee is fully recovered and able to do the normal duties of the plant.
Those employees remaining who are not disqualified as set out above will have the following options:
1.	Elect to take separation pay under the collective agreement and terminate their employment without any further entitlements;
or
2.	Transfer to the Toronto seniority list as an active or recall list employee.
General
An employee who takes separation pay in equal weekly installments may continue to accrue pension credits for the period he is in receipt of weekly severance payments. However, this pension credit accrual shall not be available to an employee who takes the M.F.R.A.
Conditions Upon Transfer
An employee who elects to transfer to Toronto, whether as an active or a recall list employee at the time of transfer shall irrevocably forfeit his/her right to separation pay under
144
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter of Understanding No 19
Cont'd.___________________________Page 3________________January 23, 1996
the collective agreement based on his/her years of service at the London plant.
Such employee will carry his/her company service to Toronto for the purpose of determining future vacation entitlement and vacation bonus and group insurance, sick leave, GWP credits and pension benefit and eligibility and entitlement;
In the year of transfer, such employee will carry his/her unused entitlement to vacation pay, vacation bonus, sick pay and GWP credits to Toronto and shall be paid such accrued entitlements as if he/she had been employed in Toronto throughout the year. In no case, however, shall the employee be entitled to receive more than the annual entitlement that he/she would have received had the employee been employed in London for the entire year. An employee who is transferred after the close of the vacation selection period shall be treated as if he/she failed to choose his/her preferred vacation weeks.
In the event that the transferring employee is not immediately actively employed in Toronto or is laid off in Toronto following a period of active employment, he/she shall be permitted to draw GWP benefits to the extent that he/she so qualifies pursuant to the provisions of the GWP.
Establishment of Seniority in Toronto
The parties agree that transferring employees should carry their London seniority to Toronto for layoff, recall and vacation selection purposes as amongst themselves and accordingly, the date that a transferring employee commenced to work in Toronto shall not be relevant for purposes of establishing seniority ranking. Once all of the transferred employees have arrived in Toronto, the Company will publish a seniority list which shall rank the transferred employees in order of their London plant
145
Mr. Ron Blain
Letter of Understanding No 19
Cont'd.	Page 4	January 23, 1996
seniority. However, once an employee has transferred to Toronto and has completed any necessary training on his/ her new job, he/she shall not be displaced from such job by a subsequently transferred senior employee unless the subsequent senior transferee must displace the junior employee from that job in order to avoid a layoff. In such case, the senior employee seeking to displace the junior employee may do so in accordance with the layoff language of the collective agreement.
Work Assianments/Qualifications
With the exception of tradesmen, all transferring employees shall be employed in the Packaging Department unless vacancies in other positions exist at the time of the transfer for which transferees are then qualified.
At the time of the transfer, a qualified transferee shall be permitted to displace a temporary employee who is employed in the same Department as the transferee was in London. Furthermore, a qualified transferee shall be awarded a vacant position in his/her former Department in preference to a senior unqualified transferee.
Selection for skilled trades positions shall be made on the basis of seniority provided the individual has the demonstrated skills, ability and qualifications and the Company will retain the right to evaluate them.
Tradesmen who transfer shall be employed in the appropriate trades function unless no vacancies exist in their trade in which case they shall be employed in the Packaging Department.

Letter of Understanding No 19
Cont'd.	Page 5	January 23, 1996
Creation of Vacancies Voluntary Resignation
In a further attempt to create vacancies for eligible employees who wish to transfer from the closed Ontario plant, the Company will offer a voluntary resignation bonus on or before the tentative date announced for the plant closure.
An employee who elects to accept such voluntary resignation bonus shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equivalent to twenty weeks pay (i.e. 800 hours multiplied by his/her straight time hourly rate). Such employee who elects voluntary resignation pursuant to the Company's offer, shall be terminated on a date determined by the Company and shall have no further rights or entitlements.
