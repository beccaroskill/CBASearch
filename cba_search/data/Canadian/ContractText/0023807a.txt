MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT entered into this 15th day of February, 2002, BETWEEN:
THE CANADIAN SALT COMPANY LIMITED hereinafter called the “COMPANY”
and
THE NATIONAL AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE, TRANSPORTATION AND GENERAL WORKERS UNION OF CANADA (C.A.W.) AND ITS LOCAL 1959
hereinafter called the “UNION”.
WITNESSETH THAT: WHEREAS the Company is operating a Salt Mine and Mill, located at Windsor, Ontario, known as the Ojibway Mine and hereinafter referred to as the “said Mine”, and WHEREAS, the Company and the Union wish to cooperate in obtaining efficient and unrestricted production of the said Mine, in maintaining a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees and in providing a method of settling in an amicable manner any differences or grievances which may arise from time to time at the said Mine.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereto have agreed as follows:
1
ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION
1.1.0	This agreement shall be pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and covers all employees of the Company employed at the said Mine save and except, shift bosses or forepersons, assistant forepersons, acting forepersons and persons above the rank of shift boss or foreperson, office staff and security guards.
1.2.0	The Company recognizes the Union during the term of this agreement as the exclusive bargaining agent of the employees for the purpose of collective bargaining in respect of wages, hours, seniority, grievance procedure and other working conditions.
1.3.0	The Union recognizes the right of the Company to manage the said Mine and direct the working forces including the right to hire, promote or transfer any employee and to demote, suspend, discipline or discharge any employee for just cause. In the interest of the efficient operation of the said Mine, the Union agrees that the Company may change hours of work, determine or change work assignments or methods and select the materials to be handled, processed or manufactured and to determine all other matters concerning the operation of the Company’s business not specifically dealt with elsewhere in the agreement. Any such action of the Company shall not be inconsistent with the express terms of this agreement and any such action which results in individual hardship or injustice, shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
1.4.0	The Union further recognizes the right of the Company to make and to alter from time to time rules and regulations to be observed by the employees, which rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement or laws of the Province of Ontario and shall be written and posted whenever practicable. The Company agrees to discuss, with the Union, changes in such rules and regulations before posting.
2
1.5.0	This agreement shall be binding upon the successors to and the assigns of the Company in the same way and to the same extent as if such successors or assigns were parties of this agreement.
1.5.1	It is agreed that should the Company close the said Mine and relocate to some other location in Ontario that seniority employees may be transferred to the new location, if they so desire, provided they have the necessary qualifications.
1.5.2	It is also agreed that employees so transferred would retain existing service and Company benefits.
1.6.0	The Company and the Union agree that neither will discriminate against any employee on account of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status, handicap, political affiliation, record of offences or Union membership.

Recognized service means the period of recognized employment with The Canadian Salt Company Limited or a
19
designated subsidiary of predecessor’s company calculated in accordance with the Company’s Service Rules.
3.	Retirement Policy
It is the policy of the Company that an employee shall retire on the first day of the month following his 65th birthday. This date is referred to as the Normal Retirement Date.
Any employee who has completed at least thirty (30) years of recognized service may retire early on or after July 1, 1987 at his/her option on the first day of any month after his/her fifty-fifth (55) birthday with full pension credits. Such employee will receive a Pension Supplement of $450 per month to age 60, reducing to $400 per month to age 65, as revised February 1999. For employees retiring after March 1, 1999, a supplement of $450 per month will be provided to age 60 reducing to $400 per month to age 65.
4.	Pension Benefit
The amount of annual pension benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age, or age 55 with 30 years’ service, is the sum of the following:
(a)	For each year of recognized service prior to December 31, 1971, one (1) percent of the average earnings received by a member during the five calendar years in which the member’s earnings were the greatest.
(b)	For each year of recognized service from January 1, 1972, 1% of the member’s average earnings received during the five calendar years in which the member’s earnings were the greatest, plus an additional 0.6% of any portion of the same average earnings over the Year’s Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) under the Canada Pension Plan in the year prior to that in which the member retires.

Vesting then continues at a rate of 10% per year until the 20th year of recognized service when full vesting takes place.
Where applicable Provincial Government Pension legislation is in excess of the Company rules governing vesting, the Government legislation will prevail.
Where the vested monthly pension payable at age 65 is less than $25.00 per month, the employee will usually receive a lump sum settlement, calculated on an actuarially equivalent basis, payable twelve months after the date of termination.
Vested interest is finalized twelve months after termination of employment. In the event the employee returns to regular employment with the Company within his twelve month period, vesting is cancelled but he is reinstated in the Plan with accumulated pension credits.
It is the responsibility of the individual to apply for the vested pension benefit on reaching Normal Retirement Age.
6.	Termination of Employment
Upon completion of two years of service after January 1, 1987 the member is entitled to a deferred pension upon termination.
In respect to service prior to January 1, 1987, after completion of six years of service the member shall be entitled to a deferred pension as laid out in Vested Interest, upon termination.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, a member who terminates
employment prior to age 55 may elect to receive the commuted value of his/her deferred pension.
21

•	transferred to another pension plan
•	used to purchase a deferred life annuity from an insurance company.
7.	Pension Payments

Any other employee who retires with the consent of the Company during the ten years prior to Normal Retirement Date may elect one of the following options:
(a)	A deferred pension calculated in accordance with the formula in Section 4 payable at the Normal Retirement Date, or
(b)	A deferred pension actuarially equivalent to that in (a) payable at any date between the Early Retirement Date and Normal Retirement Date, or
(c)	An early retirement pension calculated on an actuarially equivalent basis to that in (a), payable in the Early Retirement Date.

22
disability pension at a reduced rate calculated on an actuarially equivalent basis, if they have not reached 55 years of age. If the employee has completed 15 years of recognized service and has attained the age of 55, the pension will represent full benefits earned to the retirement date with no actuarial reduction.
The pension supplement is not payable to employees retiring due to disability unless they have 15 years of service and have reached the age of fifty-five (55) at the time of disability retirement.
10.	Death Benefits

In the event of the death of a member who is fifty-five (55) years of age or older prior to the commencement of his/her pension, the spouse of such member will be entitled to receive the pension benefits he/she would have received had the member retired on the date of death, with such benefits calculated on earnings and service through that date and with no early retirement reduction.
11.	Pension Options
(a) Joint and Survivor Option
Each member with a spouse on the date pension payments are to commence will receive a reduced pension payable for the member’s lifetime. If the member is survived by his/her spouse, the spouse will receive the remainder, if any, of the 60 months guaranteed payments which have not been received by the member. The spouse will then receive a
23
pension equal to 60% of the deceased members pension, until death.
