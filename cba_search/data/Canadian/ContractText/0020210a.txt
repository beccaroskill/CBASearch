12
Company representatives, shall meet with the Grievance Committee and the Shop Steward who signed the grievance (with the employee or employees concerned encouraged to attend) and render his decision within seven (7) days of referral of the grievance, provided however, the time may be extended by mutual consent.
ARBITRATION:
In the event that any grievance has not been settled through the procedure outlined above, either party may, within fourteen (14) days after the General Manager’s decision in Step 3, submit the grievance to an Arbitrator.

14
7.06	The Grievance Committee shall consist of four employees only. The Union Local President may also attend grievance meetings.
7.07	Grievances alleging violations which directly involve more than one employee and which are sufficiently common in nature that they may be conveniently dealt with together, by mutual agreement, may be submitted as one grievance at either Step 1 or 2. Policy grievances will be filed at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. The time frames for submission and progression, and the representation at the meetings, will be the same as in the steps set out preceding, except that normally not more than two of the employees will attend.
7.08	There shall be a maximum of twelve Shop Stewards at the Highvale Mine covered under the scope of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 8 SENIORITY:
8.01	The seniority and service of an employee shall be mine site wide and shall be based upon continuous service with the Company and shall date from the time he last entered the service of the Company, subject to the following:

The Company will conduct a performance evaluation for each probationary employee after 360 regularly scheduled hours.
If the employee’s performance is called into question, the Company will meet with the Local Union President, or his designate, to discuss the employee’s performance prior to the completion of the probationary period.
15

i.	Dismissal for just and reasonable cause;
ii.	Voluntary resignation;
iii.	Failure to report for work within 10 working days after being notified to report following a layoff, unless the employee can give a reason satisfactory to the Company for his failure to report within the time prescribed;

NOTE: Should an employee break service or lose seniority for any of the foregoing reasons and be subsequently rehired, such employee shall commence employment as a new employee and shall not have any service or seniority from any previous employment with the Company.
c.	Subject to 8(b)(iv) an employee’s seniority and service shall accumulate during a period of layoff due to lack of work.
8.02	Employees shall not be laid off, recalled, promoted or demoted until the Union has been notified of the names of the persons affected and the reasons for such action and a consultation with the Union has taken place in respect to the matter.
16

designate, will be notified, as soon as possible, but not
beyond the next working day.
8.03	The Company agrees to prepare and post not later than January 31st and July 31st of each year, or at such other time as may be mutually agreed upon, in places easily accessible to all employees, a list of the names of all employees, showing their job classifications, rates of pay and combined seniority standing, the latter being open to protest by employees for 30 days from the date of such submission. Upon proof of error being established by a representative of the Union, correction shall immediately be made. The Company will supply the Union with a copy of seniority lists and corrections thereto, within two working days excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
ARTICLE 9 REDUCTION IN BARGAINING UNIT
EMPLOYEES:
9.01	When reducing employees, senior employees, ability being sufficient to perform the duties required for the position to be filled, shall be retained.

9.02	a. The Company shall give employees written notice of
permanent layoff of at least:
One week after three months;
Two weeks after two years;
Four weeks after four years;
Five weeks after six years;
17

Benefits will be maintained for 45 days following layoff, exclusive of STD, LTD, Life Insurance and AD&D.
b.	Employees who are laid off and where the layoff is effective immediately and without notice will be entitled to pay in lieu of notice.
9.03	a. In the event of reduction of work in a classification, the employee affected shall be given up to 24 consecutive hours to displace any other employee in any classification provided the employee has more seniority than the employee displaced. Circumstances may arise where an employee may require more time to displace another employee.

and there is a reduction in the workforce, the apprenticeship position can only be displaced by a bargaining unit person who has more seniority and equal or better qualifications.

For the purpose of evaluation only, the 480 hour trial period will begin once the employee has advanced to his bid unit.
11.05	Employees who do not successfully complete the trial period will revert to their former position. Such employees will not be eligible to rebid for that position for a period of (18) eighteen months, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Company and the Union.

RE: Alternative Training
1.	The Company and the Union Executive shall meet monthly to discuss and review the training requirements on the mine site.
2.	It is in the best interests of the Company and the Union to have a sufficient number of trained and qualified employees to provide coverage due to illness or for vacation relief.
The Company reserves the right to train as manpower and equipment are available.
3.	Crew requirements will be monitored to ensure that there is sufficient coverage during regular employee absences. All training records will be kept current.
4.	An alternative training program for out of classification training for each mine operations crew will be set up for that crew’s employees. Each classification of equipment where training is required will be posted on a separate bulletin board.
94
5.	All mine department employees will be eligible to apply for the alternative training on their crew. A list of three employees eligible for alternative training will initially be identified for each classification from the applicants on the basis of seniority; most senior first then second and third. Once the most senior employee has completed his/her training the other two employees will move to the first and second positions and the third position will again be filled from the crew by seniority. Standard bid sheets will be used for this process. Active alternative training will only occur with the listed senior employee.
6.	Training time may not be continuous. Once 480 hours has been achieved within a twelve month period a field assessment will be done by the regular shift foreman or the training department foreman. The results of this field assessment will determine if the employee fails, is given a time extension, or is allowed to write the final exam. Upon successfully completing the final exam and 480 hours in
a twelve month period the employee will be considered qualified.
7.	Employees who are currently being trained on a permanent bid as outlined in article 11 are ineligible to apply for alternative training until they have successfully completed the final exam, and operated their bid unit for 4 months after their 480 hour training. Employees may train in only one (1) classification at any given time. Employees are only eligible to train on two (2) different classifications of equipment per year.
8.	The only other restriction from being eligible to apply for alternative training would be if an employee has a 18 month bid restriction resulting from the application of article 11.05 for a particular classification.
95
9.	Refresher training will be required for employees who have previously been in a classification but have not operated equipment in that classification for three (3) years, or have been in another department out of classification for one (1) year. New employees who have previous mining experience may be Highvale refreshed without participating in the alternate training, however priority will be to train the senior employee who’s alternate training is already under way.
10.	The Union and the Company will jointly monitor this alternative training program for fairness and consistency.
