A copy of such letter will be given to the employee’s Shop Steward on the same date it is given to the employee.
21
(b)	When an employee is to be suspended or discharged, he shall be advised of his right to have his Shop Steward present and if requested, shall have his Shop Steward present for such meeting. The reasons for his suspension or discharge will be given. In any event, an employee who is suspended or discharged will be given the opportunity to discuss the matter with his Shop Steward during working hours and prior to leaving the Company’s premises. Such suspension or discharge shall be confirmed to the employee by the Company, in writing, and a copy of such letter will be given to the employee’s Shop Steward on the date it is given or mailed to the employee.
(c)	The Company agrees that in the event an employee is disciplined for just cause, the records of such disciplinary action shall be removed from such an employee’s personnel files, and destroyed, after a period of twelve (12) months (two (2) years in the case of suspension) from the date the employee was officially advised in writing to such discipline, provided the employee has not been subject to further discipline within such period. In any event, discipline imposed will not be referred to after the expiry of three (3) years from the date of discipline.
(d)	It is further understood and agreed that records relating to discipline reversed or withdrawn under the grievance or arbitration
22
procedure shall not be kept or recorded in an employee’s personnel files.

Upon request, the Company will also provide an employee with a copy of any material or documents in an employee’s personnel files, which if inaccurate, shall be corrected.
(e)	The Company agrees that the discharge of any employee shall only be made by the Personnel Officer, after the grounds upon which the discharge for just cause are based have been thoroughly investigated by the Company, and the employee has been given an opportunity, with his Shop Steward present, to respond to the reasons stated for the discharge.
23
5.05
Saturdays, Sundays and observed holidays shall not count as "working days” as referred to in this Article 5.
5.06
The Company will only consider grievances the circumstances of which are alleged to have occurred not more than fifteen (15) working days prior to the presentation of the grievance, in writing, unless the employee is prevented from doing so by unusual circumstances.
5.07
Arbitration
(a)	Should any grievance or dispute arise which is not satisfactorily determined under the foregoing provisions, and should the grieving party desire to carry the matter further, the matter may then, by notice in writing given to the other party within ten (10) working days from the date when a decision was given, or should have been given, as provided for above, be referred by the grieving party to arbitration as provided for below.
(b)	Any matter referred to arbitration under this Agreement, shall be submitted to a single Arbitrator.

(e)	The Arbitrator shall hear the grievance and shall issue a decision, within fifteen (15) days, or within such other period as the parties may agree upon or the Arbitrator may reasonably require, following the hearing, which shall be final and binding upon the parties and any employee affected by it.
25
(f)	The Arbitrator shall not have the power to alter or amend any of the provisions of this Agreement.
(g)	Where an Arbitrator determines that an employee has been discharged or otherwise disciplined by the employer for just cause, the Arbitrator may substitute such other penalty for the discharge or discipline as to the Arbitrator seems just and reasonable in all the circumstances.
(h)	The parties and the Arbitrator shall have access to the employer’s premises to view working conditions, machinery, or operations, which may be relevant to the resolution of a grievance.
(i)	The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to determine whether a grievance is arbitrable.

8.07
Application of Seniority - Vacancies, Promotions, Demotions Transfers, etc.
(a)	In filling posted vacancies, including promotions, demotions, transfers, training positions, newly created or established jobs or preferred jobs, within the bargaining unit, seniority shall govern, provided the senior employee has the ability to perform the job.
(b)	Employees selected under 8.07 (a) above, shall be given an appropriate training and trial period, during which they must demonstrate ability progressing towards satisfactorily fulfilling the normal requirements of the job.
39
(c)	If within the training and trial period an employee is demoted or transferred back due to his inability to satisfactorily perform such new duties, he shall be permitted to revert to his former position and wage rate, without loss of seniority and the employee who has been promoted or transferred because of the re-arrangement of positions shall also be returned to his former position and wage rate without loss of seniority.
(d)	In the event that a job vacancy occurs or a new job is created or established, an opportunity for promotion, preferred job, or for a training position occurs or becomes available in the bargaining unit, notice of such vacancy shall be posted on the Union bulletin boards for a period of ten (10) working days for the information of all employees in the bargaining unit. The notice shall set out the job description, qualifications required by the job, the classification and wage rate. All brewing department postings (brewhouse, carbonating, fermenting, kegging) both permanent and relief shall be held for a minimum of one (1) year.
40
(e)	During the period referred to in
(d)	above, any employee in the bargaining unit may make application for the job posted. All applicants shall receive consideration in accordance with the provisions of this clause 8.07. Employees in the bargaining unit having the ability to perform the job in accordance with this clause
8.07	which shall include those employees having preferential rights for recall or rehiring, shall receive the job in preference to persons outside of the bargaining unit. The Company may fill any job vacancy temporarily, pending completion of the Job Posting procedures set out in this Agreement.
(f)	The Company will deliver to the Union a copy of each Job Posting, a list of all applicants, and will also advise the Union of the name of the successful applicant, in writing, prior to declaring and posting such information.

Employees who do not hold a permanent position may not hold more than two (2) relief or temporary positions at any one time, except for Brewhouse which shall be limited to one
(1)	position within that occupational group, other than training or upgrading positions. Employees
holding relief positions through a job posting shall be assigned to perform work on such jobs in order of seniority. Employees who must be replaced partway through any shift may be replaced for the remainder of that shift by the most readily available person who can do the job. Employees will be limited to two posting changes in any twenty-four (24) month period, either relief or full time.
42
(j)	The Company will assign regular employees to work on skilled jobs, prior to assigning temporary employees to such jobs, provided regular employees are able and willing to do the job and are not at that time assigned to an equally paid skilled position.
8.08
Layoff and Recall From Layoff
(a)	In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce staff, seniority shall govern. The Company shall first lay off all temporary employees and then all probationary employees, in order of first day hired. If further reduction of staff is required, it shall be made impartially and in strict reverse order of seniority, provided the senior employee is able to perform the work available, in accordance with the provisions of clause 8.07 of
this Agreement. Any employee transferred to another job under these seniority provisions in order to avoid layoff shall immediately be paid at the rate of the job to which such an employee is transferred.
When the working force is increased following a layoff, the employees will be recalled, in order of seniority, in the case of regular employees, or in the order of first day hired, in the case of probationary and temporary employees, to their former jobs, or to jobs which they are able and willing to perform.
43
(b)	The Local President, Vice President and Chief Shop Steward shall be exempt from temporary layoffs as long as there is work in their respective departments, provided they can satisfactorily fulfil the normal requirements of the job. Should one or more of these Union Officers be absent for any reason at any time during the layoff, the most senior steward otherwise on layoff will be recalled to work for such period of absence, for the purpose of maintaining union representation.
8.09
(a)	The Company shall maintain a list of employees laid off by it for the bargaining unit, and such lists shall show the seniority of such
employees, or the first day hired in the case of temporary and probationary employees. When workers are required for the bargaining unit, the layoff list will be examined and, to the extent of the number of jobs available, the employees will be recalled from transfer or layoff in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 8. Such lists shall be revised regularly, with copies of each such list posted on the plant bulletin boards and delivered to the union.
44
(b)	If, following such recalls, there is still a deficiency of workers in the bargaining unit, probationary employees and then temporary employees on the lay-off list, in order of the first day hired, shall be offered such vacancies provided the employee can satisfactorily fulfil the normal requirements of the job. Probationary and temporary employees shall retain preferential rights for recall after lay-off for a period of twelve (12) months from the date following the date of their last lay-off provided their previous employment was satisfactory.
(c)	If, at the time of recall, a regular employee is not in the active employment of the Company, a notice shall be sent to him by registered mail, addressed to the last address which he shall have recorded with the Company. Such notice shall indicate the job for which the individual is considered qualified, the proposed time and place of rehiring (which shall not be less than seven (7) working days from the date of mailing such notice by the Company) and shall state that if the individual desires to be rehired for such job, he shall so notify the Company by telegram, or by registered mail, within five (5) working days of receipt of such notice from the Company. A copy of each such notice shall be delivered to the Union.
45
(d)	The individuals to whom such notices are sent and who report ready for work at the time and place of rehiring as set out in such notices, or at such other time as may be mutually agreed upon between the Company and such employees, shall, if they are then so qualified to fill the jobs available, be rehired. The Company shall not be required, however, to rehire at any time, any individual who failed to notify the Company of his desire to be rehired, or who failed to report for
rehiring in accordance with and at the time stated in any such notice sent to him. The company shall be entitled to fill any jobs available on a temporary basis, pending rehiring of those having preferential rights for rehiring. If the employee is not available when required, the Company may then recall the next employee on the recall list, but he is subject to being replaced if the employee first recalled does report within seven (7) working days. On such rehiring, there shall be deemed to have been no break in such employee’s service if the employee had acquired seniority rights prior to his last layoff.
8.10
Illness or Disability
Illness or disability, which qualifies under the Long Term Disability Plan or Worker’s Compensation, will not be considered cause for discharge of a regular employee. An employee who has been continuously
46
absent from work due to illness or disability, for a period of up to twenty-four (24) months, shall be allowed to return to their former job and work, if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the work required. If after recovery, such an employee is unable to perform his former duties, or in the event he has been continuously absent from work due to
such illness or disability for a period in excess of twenty-four (24) months, and if there is at that time a regular job in the bargaining unit, which is either vacant or has been created by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, he shall be transferred to such position, if he is capable of satisfactorily performing the required duties.
8.11
Progress Report - New Employees
The Company must advise the union in all cases of unsatisfactory progress or performance of new employees.

under the terms of the Guaranteed Wage Plan, attached hereto and forming part of this Agreement as Appendix "B" - Guaranteed Wage Plan. The Guaranteed Wage Plan is a supplement intended to provide assistance to eligible employees who are laid off as a result of the application of the layoff provisions of this Agreement, but this is not to be construed as altering the layoff provisions specified in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
9.01	(a) If, during the life of this Agreement, the Company wishes to make a technological change in its operations, which would have the effect of substantially altering or abolishing any existing classifications, or creating new classifications, or which would result in the layoff of any regular employee, the Company agrees that it will meet with the Union and engage in meaningful and constructive discussion of the matter and attempt to resolve the problems created by such technological changes, as well as to attempt to lessen the impact of technological change on the employees affected.
(b) When the Company is considering the introduction of a technological change, the Company agrees to notify the Union as far as possible in advance of its intention and to update the information provided as new developments arise and modifications are made. The Company shall provide the Union with a detailed description of the project it intends to carry out, disclosing all foreseeable effects and repercussions on employees.
49
(c)	If, as a result of a technological change in the Company’s operations, an employee is assigned to a job having a lower rate of pay than the rate of pay he formerly received, he shall continue to be paid at his former rate of pay until the job rate for his new classification equals his former rate.
9.02	If, during the life of this Agreement, the Company wishes to establish any new classification, it will advise the Union in writing and negotiate the classification and rate of pay with the Union.
9.03	In the event that, during this collective agreement, the Company plans to introduce a major technological change which it anticipates will directly result in the permanent layoff of ten (10) or more regular employees, the following shall apply:
50
(a)	The Company will give the Union notice of such technological change at least sixty (60) days before the date on which the technological change is to be effected. After giving notice, the Company shall identify by job classification, the number of jobs to be displaced. The jobs to be displaced shall be grouped by the Company for the purposes of paragraph (c) herein.
(b)	The Company will meet and discuss with the Union the redeployment of the affected regular employees in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement and the provisions as set out in the Guaranteed Wage Plan (GWP); and, in so doing, shall designate the employees to be permanently laid off;
(c)	During the first thirty (30) days of the notice period and prior to effecting any layoffs or separations under the collective agreement, the Company shall canvass employees eligible for special early retirement (‘eligible employees’) as to their willingness to elect special early retirement. Such eligible employees shall be approached within each group determined in paragraph (a) in order of
51
seniority and, if they choose to take special early retirement within the above thirty (30) day period and actually retire within thirty (30) days thereafter, will receive a Technological Change Bonus (TCB). The TCB will be determined by dividing the total amount of the GWP separation pay entitlement of all the employees designated for permanent layoff in paragraph (b) above, by the total number of employees so designated. The number of special early retirees in any group who may receive the TCB will not exceed the number of jobs in that group which are to be permanently displaced by the technological change and, if a greater number of eligible employees in any group so elect to take special early retirement, the TCB will only be paid to the most senior of them.
9.04	If (a) the number of eligible employees in any group who elect to take special early retirement is less than the number of jobs in that group to be permanently displaced by the technological change, or
(b) the Company did not anticipate the number of layoffs but the introduction of the major technological change actually directly results in the permanent
52
layoff of ten (10) or more regular employees, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) The employees ultimately designated for permanent layoff hereunder, who are eligible for participation in the GWP, will be permitted to elect separation and to terminate from the Company prior to their scheduled date of layoff. Those employees so electing and terminating from the Company shall be entitled to receive the amount of separation payment calculated in accordance with Section 10 of the Guaranteed Wage Plan. If any of those employees who are eligible for participation in the Guaranteed Wage Plan were classified as regular employees prior to May 1, 1985, their separation payment calculation shall include an additional eight (8) weeks of benefit entitlement for the purposes of paragraph (b) of Section 10 of the Guaranteed Wage Plan;
53
(ii) those employees designated for permanent layoff hereunder who do not elect to terminate from the Company pursuant to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, and who are eligible for participation in the Guaranteed Wage Plan, shall receive the benefits provided for under that Plan. In addition, if any employee who is eligible for participation in the Guaranteed Wage Plan was classified as a regular employee prior to May 1, 1985, he shall receive an additional eight (8) weeks of benefit entitlement under the plan, subject to the following conditions:
(a)	An employee may use the additional eight (8) weeks of entitlement only once during his employment, and not withstanding Section 8 of the Plan, the eight (8) weeks can never be restored;
(b)	the additional eight (8) weeks of entitlement shall be the first weeks used.
54
ARTICLE 10

55

ARTICLE 11
ADEQUATE MANPOWER
11.01
The Company will supply adequate manpower on all operations in all departments at all times so that an employee will not be required to perform more than a fair day’s work.
11.02
Clause 11 .01 shall not be construed to mean that the manning of all operations is at present exactly adequate or that all employees are presently assigned exactly a fair day’s work and, accordingly, changes in the manning of crews and changes in an employee’s workload may be made so long as the resulting situation is not a violation of clause 11.01.
57
ARTICLE 12
WAGES AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
12.01

Disabilities arising from pregnancy are covered, however, no benefits are payable during any period:
(a)	for which benefits are paid under the Employment Insurance Act.
(b)	of maternity leave taken pursuant to provincial or federal law or pursuant to mutual agreement between the employee and the employer, or

LONG TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE
Elimination Period

For a period of total disability which is a result of pregnancy, the elimination period commences on the date the pregnancy terminates, or, if earlier, the date the employee is totally disabled. Ceasing to be actively at work with the employer does not, by itself, mean than an employee is totally disabled.
Definition of Disability
Totally disabled means you are in a continuous state of incapacity due to illness which, during the first 26 weeks and during the following 24 months of incapacity, the disability prevents you from performing each and every duty of your normal occupation; and thereafter, prevents you from engaging in any occupation for which you are or become reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.

-one day, if the two periods of total disability are due to unrelated causes; or
-six continuous months, if the two periods of total disability are due to the same or related causes.
If the period of total disability is considered to be a continuation of a previous period of total disability, benefits will be resumed in the same amount but without the application of another elimination period. Unless you have been at work for at least two weeks, your monthly indemnity will be based on the amount of your basic earnings prior to your original disability.
140
Benefit Reduction
The purpose of this insurance is to extend to you a reasonable level of income when you are disabled, but it is not designed to give you income which would exceed or even equal your normal take-home pay when you are working. For this reason, the benefits that you receive from the plan will be reduced by any income from the following sources.
Direct Offsets
1.	any amount of income provided for you and your dependents by reason of your same or subsequent disability under the legislation of any government or emanation thereof, other than Employment Insurance. However, any increase in the disability under the Quebec/Canada Pension Plan because of an automatic adjustment in the cost-of-living index occurring while you are receiving monthly indemnity of monthly rehabilitative income is not considered income for the purpose of determining the amount payable.
2.	any amount of income provided to you under
any Workers’ Compensation Law or similar legislation.
In addition, if your monthly indemnity exceeds 85% of monthly basic earnings, your monthly indemnity will be further reduced by the amounts received from the following sources.
141
Indirect Offsets
1.	any amount of income provided for you from any employer by reason of the same or subsequent disability;
2.	any amount of income provided for you under any other group insurance or group pre-payment plan, including any policy issued to you as a result of your membership in an association of any kind;
3.	any amount of income provided for you under any retirement or pension plan of your employer;
4.	where permitted by law, any amount of income provided for you for the same disability under a contract of motor vehicle insurance which provides mandatory disability income benefits under the legislation of any government;
5.	when permitted by law, any amount of income provided for you under the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Act or similar legislation,
142
Rehabilitation
If, after having received payments, you are unable to return to your former full-time position but can engage in some work (approved by the insurer) for remuneration, the benefits will continue but will be reduced by 50% of your rehabilitative earnings provided your total income during a rehabilitative program does not exceed 100% of your pre-disability income. The benefits will cease once you are no longer classified as being totally disabled or on attainment of age 65.
Limitations
Your long term disability income continuance benefit does not include coverage during which:
-	you are not under the regular care of a doctor; or
-	you engage in any occupation or employment for wage or profit, other than rehabilitative employment; or
-	beyond your 65th birthday.
143

145
DENTAL CARE INSURANCE
Dental care insurance has been designed to help you pay for your family dental expenses, both for routine care and for expenses for unforeseen treatment.
To be considered as a "covered expense”, the charge for a particular service must be reasonable and customary for the service provided in the area when the expense is incurred.
The plan covers necessary dental treatment by a dentist, physician or other qualified personnel under the direct supervision of the dental or medical profession. (e.g., dental assistants, dental hygienists) and will also cover services rendered by specialists, dental mechanics, denturologists, denturists, therapists, etc. where permitted by law to deal directly with the public. If there is no fee schedule for these practitioners in your province, payment will be based on the appropriate General Practitioners’ schedule.
146
Treatment Plan
-	before your dentist starts a course of treatment, he will, upon request, prepare a “treatment plan” -a written report describing his recommendations as to necessary treatment and cost.
-	you will be required to submit a "treatment plan” to the insurance company before treatment commences for any Routine Treatment expected to cost more than $200. This enables the insurance company to determine in advance the share of the cost of the proposed treatment and thus allows you to know the extent of any part of the costs you will have to pay.
-	if you do not submit a “treatment plan” where required, you may find that your claim, or a portion of it, may not be covered.
