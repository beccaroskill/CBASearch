II	Work Methods
Change in working methods:When the introduction of new equipment makes a material change which is expected to result in the closing of a department or a substantial reduction in the number of employees in a department, the Company will inform the Union of such change at least ninety days in advance of the contemplated change and the parties will discuss what is expected to take place and how the matter may best be handled.

- 51 -

The Company shall inform a representative of the Union prior to bringing contractors into the plant, unless an emergency
-52 -
situation arises in which case the union shall be immediately notified once the emergency is over.
Should an arbitration committee be called on to review the Company’s action, it may consider the revelant factors referred to above, in order to determine the reasonableness of the Company's action with regard to all circumstances, should the arbitration committee find the Company's action was not reasonable, the committee will direct that the Company choose between having the work performed by its employees or ceasing such operation, and the Company shall have a reasonable time to effect the decision.
This provision does not apply to cafeteria operations, to “Out of town” deliveries, and to installation and construction work. The Company may at times experiment to determine if work can be performed effectively and economically by its own employees.

RE: Weekly Indemnity Sick Plan-
Right of Subrogation
This will confirm our understanding that the language adopted in Article 15-2(C) regarding the right of subrogation will notbeapplied retroactively to support claims of recovery by the Insurance Carrier underwriting the Weekly Indemnity Sick Plan, arising prior to this date.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT R E Long Term Disability
Effective June 1st., 1983, the Company will arrange to have an insurance carrier provide a Long Term Disability Plan which will include the following provisions;
Full time employees actively at work on the effective date are eligible for the Plan on attainment of ONE year's seniority. Employees absent from work on the date they would otherwise have been eligible must return to work and satisfactorily complete two months full time work to be eligible. Long Term Disability benefits will be payablewhere an employee is unable to perform any employment for remuneration or profit soley by reason of total disability through sickness or accident. The sole determination of cases qualifying for benefits will be made by the Insurance Company based upon continuing medical evidence of such disability as it considers satisfactory. To qualify, any case involving alcohol or drug related conditions will require active supervision by and continuing treatment from a rehabilitation centre or a provincially designated institution. Any case involving mental illness will require continued treatment under an approved specialist, and will only be paid in cases of severe conditions involving personality disorganization (psychotic conditions). An employee in receipt of Long Term Disability benefits will be subject to the provisions of Article 11-6 of the Collective Agreement.
The amount of benefit will be$1,100 per month less any benefit for which the employee is eligible under the Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit,
71
Worker's Compensation or other Government or Government sponsored plan, excluding any preexisting disability benefit.
The Employee will be presumed eligible for such government benefits until satisfactory evidence is presented that his application for them has been denied.
An Employee in receipt of a benefit under the Company’s Pension Plan cannot be in receiptof a benefit under the Long Term Disability Plan.
The benefit will commence after the Employee has been absent due to the disability for one year or after his sick pay entitlement has expired whichever is earlier, and will be payable until recovery, actual retirement date, normal retirement date, or death, whichever comes first.
Should an Employee return to work after collecting Long Term Disability Benefits and subsequently again cease work as a result of the same or a related disability, the benefit will recommence without a waiting period provided the disability recurred within a year of the Employee’s return to work; otherwise the Employee will be subject to the normal waiting period before the benefit commences.
Where an Employee returns to work under an approved rehabilitation program of up to 24 months, the benefit will be reduced by 50% of any earnings, provided the total gross income from all sources does not exceed 90% of the pre-disability normal gross wages.
No benefit will be paid for intentionally self-inflicted injuries or for disabilities arising from a declared or undeclared act of war, participation in a riot or insurrection, em loyment with another employer, or commission oPa crime.
72
Effective June 1, 1983 the disability retirement clause in the Company's Pension Plan will be removed. However, the benefits under the clause will still be available for up to one year thereafter for those employees who were eligible for the disability retirement provision but who were not eligble for Long Term Disability due to absence from work on the effective date.
