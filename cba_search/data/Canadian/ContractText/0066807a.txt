On the first working day of each calendar year, a notice will be posted on ail bulletin boards for 2 weeks advising employees that it is permissibleto forego their summer vacation and take that year's entire vacation entitlement in one continuous period outside the regular summervacation time. Those desirous of doing so are to listtheir names. In order of seniority and within occupationalgroups, where applicable, the Company will approach those who have applied and will complete and post a schedule in conformity with the following two paragraphs.
The periodwill commence on the first Mondayfollowing September15 and end on the last Friday priorto the second Monday in June the following year. '
The following is the maximum number of men per week to be granted this privilege and, once confirmed, cannot be revoked by either the employee or the Company.

Kegging	1
Employees waiving summer vacation and taking all their vacation in the off season cannot be bumped from their preferred time by someone cf higher seniority who has had summer vacation.

Dear Mr. Greco:
This will confirm our verbal understanding regarding placement on the Maintenance seniority list of those employees enrolled in the Apprenticeship Program. It is understood that this understanding overrides the provisions <£ the Collective Agreement and, in particular, Articles 11.01 and 11.02.

We have agreed that any apprentice whose seniority transfers to the Maintenance Department from another department, will be placed at the bottom of the Maintenance Department seniority list as of the first day that he commenced lo work in the Maintenance Department regardless of his ordinary seniority date.
For all other purposes however, the employee's ordinary seniority shall govern.
If the above accurately reflects our agreement, please sign two copies of this letter and return them to me.

HE: Scheduling cfBottlinq/Cannina/Palletizinq/Shlppina Employees
The Company agrees that it will endeavorto assign employees to work groups based on their expressed preference and seniority. In stating their preference, employees will be expected to learn and demonstrate the core operational aspects of all jobs within that work group. The employee will be assigned to a single job selection within the work group giving consideration to seniority, skills, and training. Work group preference and job selection will be recorded and assigned during the month cf January 2000 for a period of two years. Thereafter, on an annual basis, the BM/UE will review individual, work group and departmental skill needs and requirements to determine potential changes to work group preference and job selection.
Weekly scheduling will be done based on the above mentioned work group preference and job selection. It is understood that absenteeism, vacation, shift level variations and training activities will affect the Company's ability to accommodate the employee's preference and selection. With the intent cf maintaining work group stability and minimizing employee movement, the BM/UE will develop guidelines which will be followed by the Supervisorto deal with daily adjustments to the schedule.
124
If a new job is established in a work group, employees within that work group will be able to re-select their jobs in accordance with seniority. If a new work group is established, employees will be given the opportunity to transfer into the work group based on a process established by the BM/UE.
Projects or tasks which are assigned through the volunteer process will not be treated as a new job.

During negotiations leading to the renewal f the current collective agreement the parties agreed to the following terms and conditions in connectionwith the following:
Commitment to Learning
For an Organization to really change, it must Learn to change. It must implement ways to explore and identify opportunitiesto change, designing howthe organization will respond to this opportunity lo change, and helpingthe people within the organization make this transition from the old to the new. In short, it must become a Learning Organization. Training is a tool to help people learn.
During negotiations the Union raised, with the Company, the need for a serious commitment to Training by the Company. Training is essential to all employees in order to successfully implement and sustain the changes that are required in becoming a "World Class Brewery”.
Both parties recognize that a "Training System Standard" needs to be jointly developed and implemented. In order to achieve this, each department will have a management training SPA that will work jointly with the site trainers. This new Training Standard will serve as the foundationfortheBM/UE to develop and implement a Training Plan for the Toronto Brewery.
The primary reason for providing training is to assist Toronto in achieving its business goals and to improve organizational and individual performance.
A needs analysis will be performed before any training is delivered.
158
Needs analyses will be done usingthe following methods:
1.	Identificationand prioritizationcf performancegaps (organizational, operational, individual)
2.	Determinationof causes.
3.	Recommendation of solutions.
4.	Consultation with critical partners: those affected by the result of the training and those to be trained.
Training Planning Analysis
1.	Identifyorganizational/departmental goals and strategies. (Analyze plans, mission & strategies.)
2.	Determine pivotal jobs, roles and processes.
3.	Determine new performance requirements..
4.	Identify knowledge and skill requirementto support performance.
5.	Identify preliminary training and learningactionswith consensus from all stake holders.
6.	Prioritize, design, deliver and document.
In order to demonstrate the Company's commitmentto Training, a minimum of 4% cf all hours worked by Union members (Brewing, Packaging, Warehouse, Trades) will be dedicated to Training (Capital Project, H&S, Transition to Technician, Trades upgrade, temporary training, etc...) every year, for the term cf this agreement. Any additional needsfortraining will bejustified on a “Return” basis (Continuous improvement).

During negotiations leading to the renewal of the current collective agreement the parties agreed to the following terms and conditions in connection with the following:
Learning Transition
All operators and trades within the Molson Etobicoke Brewery will continually strive to become a highly Reliable "World Class BreWery”. Both parties recognize that the implementation cf a "Technician Environment"is essential in achieving that objective.
The Company recognizes that, as the organization transits towards becoming a 'World Class Brewery", operators and trades will need tools and support in order to learn and apply new skills, and contribute to their lull potential.
In order to get full commitment from operators and trades in going through this intense phase of changes, the Company recognizes that utilizing operators and trades in the performance of new tasks, will not result in any regular maintenance employees losing his employment within the maintenance department or any other regular employee losing his employment with the Brewery.
Both parties recognize that this commitment to change by all employees is the best strategy to implement in order to attract more volume for the Toronto Brewery, and sustain employment.

DearMr. Greco:
LETTER OF INTENT
Not to be included in the Collective Agreement RE: Departmental Boundaries
This will confirm our understanding at negotiations regarding the movement of employees across departmentalboundaries in order to achieve a true flow to work in the daily operations. Flow to work across departmentalboundaries will ensure that our quality is not compromised, the highest level cf customer service is attained and operational efficiencies and costs are met.
The following was agreed to with regards to Kegging, Warehouse and Packaging flow to work without a premium penalty.
1. When an operational need exists for full goods to be removed from the Palletizer discharge conveyors Shipping employees shall flow to work and assist the Packaging employees in moving product to prevent quality issues or ensure that efficiency and productivityare not affected.
162
2.	When kegs are -required for loading in the warehouse, employees from the warehouse will flow to work in the keg room to retrieve up to 4 lifts cf staged kegs per order that are required to meet the customer demand and ensure on time delivery when Keg room employees are not on shift.
Other situations may arise where flow to work opportunities may arise. These situations will be discussed at the BMUE.

Mr. G. Greco, President Component325 1 Carlingview Drive Etobicoke, Ontario M9W 5E5
Dear Mr. Greco:
LETTER OF INTENT
Incorporating the following principles.
RE: WAREHOUSE RESTRUCTURING
There are 3 restructuring possibilities beingconsidered/brthe warehouse, all of which involve certain warehouse work remaining onsite.
1.	The warehouse work stays onsite with new restructuring initiatives.
2.	The warehouse wade is moved off site as a Molson Facility.
3.	The warehouse work is performed by The Beer Store.
Underscenariol
(a)	Company will commit' that, for the ife of the collective agreement, the current 68 warehouse regular employees will not be laid off from employment or cause the layoff from employment of another regular employee currently in the bargaining unit through the exercise cf seniority bumping rights.
164
(b)	The Company may use temporary employees to assist in the performance of the required onsite warehouse work in a warehouse ratio not to exceed 2 temporary employees for each regular employee.
(c)	Shipping employees will continue to assist the company in improving output in order to achieve the warehouse targets.
Underscenario 2
Same as scenario 1 (a), (b) and (c) and, in addition
(a)	The Company will offer eighteen (18) early retirement packages to warehouse employees on a seniority basis in the same time frame as the movement of the warehouse work offsite.
Thereafter, any warehouse employee who will be l aced with layoff from the warehouse department as a result cf the movement to the offsite facility will be permitted to transfer to the offsite facility rather than exercisingany interdepartmental bumping rights in the Brewery. Employees who transfer lo the offsite facility hereunder must return to a Brewery warehouse position when one becomes available, with no loss of seniority. Such return will be in order cf seniority.
If the company subsequently triggers Scenario 3, those employees who moved fromthe Breweryto the offsite warehouse may exercise their seniority to return to the Toronto Brewery.
(b)	The Company will recognize the Union as the bargaining agent at the new offsite facility. The parties will negotiate a separate, new collective agreement covering that facility which will incorporate the comparable monetary terms as the current Brewery collective agreement and the principles regarding use of temporary employees and work standards set out herein. There shall be no common seniority or movement rights between the two agreements.
165
Under scenario 3
Same as scenario 1 (a) & (b) and scenario2 (d).
*	based on current volume levels in the Toronto Brewery and
warehouse and the present state of technology in the Department. In the event that volume levels experience a significant decrease from the present levels, or the Companyintroduces new or modifteaequipment which significantlyalters manpower requirements in the warehouse, this commitment will no longer be binding.
Yours truly,
Dan Markou
