THIS AGREEMENT made the 11th day of May, A.D., 2000, effective the 1st day of May, 2000.
BETWEEN:
UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, CLC, for itself and on behalf of its Local 7552
(hereinafter called “the Union”)
OF THE FIRST PART
AND:
AGRIUM, Vanscoy Potash Operations (hereinafter called “the Company”)
OF THE SECOND PART
15
ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
1.01	This Agreement is entered into for the purpose of promoting and continuing the existing harmonious relations between the parties, to establish settled conditions of employment and to ensure the prompt and equitable disposition of any grievances which may arise.
ARTICLE 2. EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT
2.01	The word “employees” as used in this Agreement means all employees of the Company in its Potash Operation except supervisors, forepersons, superintendents, managers, office and clerical staff (including clerical staff in warehouse), laboratory staff, plant security and any persons having, and regularly exercising, authority to employ or discharge employees or regularly acting on behalf of management in a confidential capacity, at the mine site situated approximately seven km North of No. 7 Highway between Vanscoy and Delisle, Saskatchewan.
2.02	Words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine.
ARTICLE 3. UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes the Union
as the exclusive representative for the purpose
16
of conducting collective bargaining regarding rates of pay, hours of work, working conditions and other employment conditions of employees and will continue to do so as long as the Union retains its rights to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of such employees under the law.
3.02	(i) The Company reserves the right
to employ independent contractors to perform work at the Operation it deems necessary or desirable. However, the Company recognizes the Union’s concern over the Company employing contractors to work as part of regular maintenance crews or to perform routine maintenance work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunities for the employees. The Company will therefore attempt to minimize the employment of such contractors having due regard to the needs of the efficiency of the Operation, the time available to do the work and to the availability of equipment, skills, manpower, engineering, supervision and services. While
17
the Company may also contract out work not normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit, it shall, whenever practicable, and especially during layoffs, have such work performed by employees within the bargaining unit.
(ii)	The Company agrees that it will
not contract out any work at the Operation if, as a direct result, an employee will be demoted or laid off, and such employee is qualified to perform the work.
(iii)	The Company will inform the Union prior to the beginning of each month of the number of contractors scheduled or expected to be used during the coming month and the nature of their work. The Company will also, during the month, advise the Union of any additional contractors scheduled to work on the property during the month. For purposes of this Section, contractors shall mean any contractor employing trades or labourer employees on site.
18
(iv)	Following receipt of the notification provided in (iii) above, the Union may request a meeting with the Company to discuss the information provided. Such meeting shall be limited to the Union President and the Union Vice President, or their designates, and will occur either immediately prior to or following the monthly Company -Union meeting. At such time, the Company will also be prepared to review, with the Union, contracts issued for off-site work.
3.03	The Company recognizes that it is not the function of forepersons, acting forepersons, supervisors and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement to repetitively perform work which is currently being performed by an employee in the bargaining unit where qualified employees are reasonably available to do such work, except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimentation, protecting the safety of employees or equipment or in emergencies. This clause will not apply in cases where due to the small size of a crew the Company considers it necessary for a supervisor to carry out some plant duties.
19
ARTICLE 4. TERM OF AGREEMENT
4.01	This Agreement shall remain in effect from and including date of ratification up to and including the 30th day of April, 2003.
ARTICLE 5. MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
5.01	The Union recognizes the undisputed right of the Company to operate and manage its business in all respects in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities and to make and alter from time to time rules and regulations to be observed by employees, which rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The Union further recognizes that the Company retains all the customary rights, responsibilities, functions and prerogatives of management, except as expressly modified or restricted by a clause of this Agreement.
5.02	Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate the Company to continue to operate any of its plants or properties or any part thereof.
5.03	The Company shall always have the right to hire, to discipline, demote and discharge employees for just and sufficient cause; and to retire an employee at age sixty-five (65). The selection of supervisors shall be entirely a matter for the Company's decision.
20
ARTICLE 6. NO DISCRIMINATION
6.01	The Company agrees that there shall be no intimidation or discrimination against any employee by reason of his/her legitimate activities as a member, shop steward, or officer of the Union. The Union agrees that there shall be no intimidation or discrimination on its part towards any employee of the Company by reason of his/her not being a member of the Union.
6.02	The parties agree that there shall be no discrimination against any employee with regard to race, religion, creed, colour, sex, sexual orientation, family status, marital status, disability, physical size or weight, age, nationality, ancestry, place of origin, or receipt of public assistance.
The parties also recognize the right of employees to work in an environment free from sexual or racial harassment and the parties shall undertake to investigate all alleged occurrences between or among employees with all possible dispatch. If sexual or racial harassment has taken place, the parties shall take whatever joint action is appropriate to ensure harassment ceases.
ARTICLE 7. NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
7.01	The Company shall not cause or direct any lockout of employees during the life of this Agreement; and neither the Union nor any representative thereof, nor any employee,
21
shall in any way authorize, encourage or participate in any strike, walkout, suspension of work, or slow-down on the part of any employee or group of employees during the life of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 8. UNION ACTIVITIES ON COMPANY TIME
8.01	No person shall solicit membership in the Union or in any other labour organization, or collect dues for the Union or any other labour organization, or engage in any Union or labour organization activity on Company time or within the plants of the Company, except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement.
8.02	The time spent away from the job by employees in performance of duties as designated members of a jointly-recognized safety committee will be considered as time worked and payments shall be on the basis of straight time. Under no condition shall overtime rates be paid. Time to be paid for under 8.02 shall be limited to thirty (30) hours per month. In the event that the time spent by employees in the performance of duties as members of such recognized safety committees exceeds thirty (30) hours in any month, the Company agrees to discuss the matter of such excess time with the Union.
22
8.03	The time spent away from the job in investigating and settling disputes by employees delegated by the Union for that purpose shall be considered as time worked. Payment shall be on the basis of straight time. Under no conditions shall overtime rates be paid. Time to be paid for under this shall be limited to thirty (30) hours per month. In the event that the time spent by employees in investigating disputes exceeds thirty (30) hours in any month, the Company and the Union agree to discuss the matter of such excess time.
8.04	The Company will provide the Union up to two hundred and forty (240) hours paid leave per calendar year at straight-time rates to be authorized by the President or designate.
ARTICLE 9. LEAVES OF ABSENCE FOR UNION PURPOSES
9.01	The Company agrees to grant leave of absence without pay to employees for the business purposes of the Union or of the International of the United Steelworkers of America for the purposes and in the manner specified below.
(i) Any employee elected or appointed to an office of Local 7552 or of the Union or of the International of the United Steelworkers of America, necessitating a leave of
23
absence, shall be granted such leave of absence without pay provided it does not exceed one (1) year.
Written application for such leave must be made to the Superintendent, Human Resources, of the Company two (2) weeks in advance of the commencement date of the leave. The Company shall not be required to grant the privilege under (i) to more than one (1) employee at the same time. The time spent on leave shall not in any way jeopardize an employee’s seniority, nor service for pension purposes, but shall not be considered as time worked for the purpose of determining vacation or other benefits.
(ii)The Company agrees to grant leave of absence without pay to employees who are delegated by the Union for the purpose of attending conventions, labour arbitrations, labour contract negotiations, labour seminars or grievance matters. The aggregate leave of absence granted under (ii) shall
24
not exceed three hundred (300) days in any one (1) calendar year.
Permission for such leave(s) shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Union agrees to give as much advance notice as is possible of the requirement for such leave(s) of absence.
9.02	The Company may grant a personal leave of absence in exceptional circumstances where the denial of such leave of absence would cause undue hardship to the employee.
ARTICLE 10. SAFETY
10.01	The parties desire to maintain high standards of safety and health in the Company's operations and agree to co-operate in the continuing objective of eliminating safety and health hazards, promoting safe work practices and enforcing safety rules.
10.02	The Company and the Union shall cooperate in the operation of Joint Safety Committees as prescribed in the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. These Committees shall consist of management representatives along with three (3) employees selected by the Union for surface operations and three (3) employees selected by the Union for underground operations. The Committees shall
25
have those duties and perform the functions provided for in Section 19 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 and shall include responsibilities for:
a)	Making regular inspections of the plants and areas of operation. Designated Union area safety representatives will be included in these inspections as appropriate.
b)	Meeting regularly to take up such safety and health matters which may be brought before it by either the Union or the Company.
c)	Investigating as soon as possible all accidents involving fatalities, disabling injuries or incidents involving, or having potential for, extended loss of time of an employee, and making recommendations for remedial or preventative action.
d)	The Co-chairs or designates of both committees along with the Union President shall, together with the management representative, tour the surface and underground operations at six (6) month intervals.
26
In the event that either committee is unable to resolve a problem or has a concern in their respective areas, the problem or concern shall be referred to a Property Committee comprised of the Co-chair from the Underground Committee, the Co-chair from the Surface Committee, the Union President, the General Manager, Potash Operations, the Superintendent, Surface Operations and the Superintendent, Mine or their designates. This committee shall meet at least every six months.
10.03	An employee shall immediately report to his/her supervisor any equipment, conditions or practices which he/she feels are unsafe, and the supervisor shall investigate the equipment, condition or practice so reported and shall take such steps as deemed necessary in the supervisor's opinion to correct the situation.
If the employee is not satisfied with the decision of the supervisor, the employee may contact an Occupational Health Committee member who will discuss the matter with the supervisor and the employee concerned in an attempt to resolve the situation.
If the employee is not satisfied with the decision of the supervisor, the Occupational Health Committee member may notify the Employee Co-chair of the Occupational Health Committee who together with the employee concerned and the Committee member and the
27
Employer Co-chair of the Occupational Health Committee may discuss the matter.
10.04	As provided for in Section 23 of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993, the following language shall apply:
“A worker may refuse to do any particular act or series of acts at work which the worker has reasonable ground to believe are unusually dangerous to the worker's health or safety or the health and safety of any other person at the place of employment until the Occupational Health Committee or the Occupational Health Officer has investigated the matter and advised the worker otherwise.”
“No discriminatory action shall be taken against any employee by reason of the fact that the employee has exercised the right conferred on the employee by Section 27 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.”
10.05	(i)A Committee member who is
required to attend a safety meeting or inspection during a time the member is normally scheduled to be off work will be paid the member's normal straight time hourly base rate for time so spent. The time paid for under this section shall not be considered as time worked for any other purpose.
28
(ii) The Company will make environmental monitoring results available to the Occupational Health Committee. In addition, one (1) member of the Union Occupational Health Committee, selected by the Union, will, on a quarterly basis for underground and every six (6) months for surface, for educational as well as awareness purposes, accompany the Company technician or representative on workplace environmental monitoring. (The specific type of monitoring will be determined by the Company.)
10.06	If it is necessary for a Union-designated area safety representative to take time off during the representative's working hours in connection with work associated with the Occupational Health Committee, the representative must first receive permission from the representative's immediate supervisor. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.07	An employee who is injured on the job and is unable to continue working will have the employee's normal base rate earnings maintained for the balance of the employee's scheduled shift on the day of injury.
29
10.08	The Company shall inform the Employee Co-Chair of the Occupational Health Committee of impending process revisions and installation of new production equipment.
The Company shall also provide the Employee Co-Chair of the Occupational Health Committee with a list of all materials, compounds or substances used, handled or produced at the Operation as soon as possible. Such lists shall be kept up to date as from time to time substances are eliminated or new substances are introduced.
10.09	Education of employees as to their rights under the Occupational Health Act and Regulations will be carried out through effective, joint programs for presentation at safety meetings. To achieve this goal, the Company will utilize the appropriate Union Committee Co-chair or member for assistance in safety presentations as appropriate.
ARTICLE 11. BULLETIN BOARDS
11.01	The Company agrees that sections of plant bulletin boards shall be made available to the Union for its purposes, provided that the use of such boards shall be restricted to the posting of notices regarding the business affairs, meetings and social events of the Union and the reports of the various committees of the Union,
30
and provided that no such notice may be posted unless the approval of the Company to the posting has first been obtained and a notation of the approval endorsed on the notice. Until further notice from the Company to the Union, the approval referred to need not be obtained.
ARTICLE 12. SENIORITY
12.01	Seniority shall be established on the basis of an employee's service with the Company's Potash Operation, whether broken or continuous, according to the records of the Company. The only exception is when it applies to an employee who voluntarily quits and is subsequently rehired.
In such cases, seniority will commence from the new date of hire for the purpose of calculating plant seniority. All new and prior service will be used in calculating pension and benefits coverage.
However, employees hired prior to March 23, 1987, shall continue to be credited with their total Company Employment Service. It is recognized that an employee’s security shall increase in proportion to the employee’s length of service and in accordance with the provisions of 12.03.
12.02	Employees shall not be deemed to have any seniority until they have worked 520
31
hours (excluding Jury Duty) after they were last hired by the Company.
12.03	In all cases of promotion, filling permanent positions, layoff and recall from layoff or transferring into established training programs, a senior employee shall be entitled to preference provided that the employee has the ability, qualifications and physical fitness to meet the normal requirements of the job.
12.04	Persons originally hired by the Company for a special assignment of work may be discharged when their employment at such special assignment of work comes to an end notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary. The Union shall be notified of such employees and their status in writing. Special assignments will be limited to a maximum duration of one (1) year.
12.05	(i) In the event of a reduction of crew
or layoff, employees affected shall be laid off in inverse order of their seniority and in accordance with Article 12.03. If an affected employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability, to meet the normal requirements of another job, that employee can displace a junior employee. A displaced junior employee can then exercise
32
the option to displace a more junior employee provided that employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of that job.
When it is necessary to increase the workforce, former employees with more than ninety (90) days service shall be re-employed as closely as possible in the inverse order in which they were laid off, providing they have the qualifications, ability and physical fitness for the job for which they are being recalled.
In the event of a reduction of crew or layoff that exceeds twenty-one (21) days or recall for a temporary position that is expected to exceed twenty-one (21) days, the Company will provide up to five (5) working days for familiarization training for the employees exercising the displacement option. If the employee demonstrates the qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of the job by the end of the fifth day, the employee will be put into the job. The determination as to whether or
33
not an employee has acquired the necessary skills and ability for the job shall be made by the Company. The Company shall make the determination in a fair and equitable manner.
The Company will provide four (4) positions in total (in the three progressions - mine operating, mill operating, warehousing) to which senior employees, displaced in the event of a crew reduction or layoff, could move without having the qualifications for the job; provided that the senior employee has the ability and physical fitness to do the job and the junior employee to be displaced does not need to be retained because of skills or certification for the ongoing required work.
The employee's maximum wage loss will be one wage rate unless this is higher than the top wage rate in the new job. In this case, the employee's new rate would be the top rate in the new job.
The Company and the Union will meet prior to any crew reduction or layoff to explore all possible options
34
for employees being displaced and who are qualified to do other jobs.
(ii)	It shall be the responsibility of a laid-off employee to notify the Company of any change in the employee’s postal address. Laid-off employees who have complied with the foregoing procedure shall be notified by the Company, either personally or by registered mail at their last known address, of the date on which they are to report for work; and should an employee fail to report within ten (10) days of being notified personally or within ten (10) days of the postal registration date of the written notice, the employee shall lose the right of re-employment. In any case, the Company shall not be obligated to re-employ any former employee who has been laid off for a period equal to the lesser of the employee's seniority or twenty-four (24) months, or thirty-six (36) months if the employee’s service is greater than ten (10) years.
(iii)	Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen (14)
35
days during the twenty-four (24) months prior to an announced layoff will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than:
-	One week’s notice if the employee's period of employment is less than three years;
-	Three weeks’ notice if the
employee's period of employment is three years or more.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six (6) days or less, or if any employee is recalled for a specific, limited period of work during a general layoff. The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
12.06	The Company will not transfer staff employees who were previously members of the Bargaining Unit back to the Bargaining Unit. Any staff employee who was previously a Bargaining Unit member who desires to return to a Bargaining Unit job would return, assuming a job is available, with no seniority. Such employee would first have to resign as a staff employee.
An employee who transfers after May
36
1,1994 from an hourly-rated job to a staff position outside the Bargaining Unit shall retain all seniority held at the time of the transfer and will reactivate such seniority if the employee returns to the Bargaining Unit within a six (6) month period following such transfer. In the event the transfer is for more than six (6) months, the employee shall lose all retained seniority. This paragraph does not apply to temporary acting supervisory positions.
12.07	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, an employee shall be on probation until such person has worked five hundred and twenty (520) hours, computed from date of last hire. Upon completion of such probation period the employee shall be credited with seniority from the date of hire. During the probationary period the Company may terminate the employee's employment for cause, without reference to any other provisions of this Agreement. Union activity shall not be considered as a reason for discharge under this Section. This clause shall not apply to employees reemployed in accordance with Section 12.05.
12.08	The Company shall maintain and post a seniority list including occupational classifications, which list shall be revised semi-annually. Two (2) copies of the list shall be provided to
37
the Union.
ARTICLE 13. PROCEDURE FOR SETTLING DISPUTES
13.01	Should a dispute arise between the Company and any employee or employees regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement, an earnest effort shall be made to settle the dispute in the following manner:
13.02	Stage 1. The employee or employees concerned, in person, with or without their shop steward in attendance, shall first seek to settle the dispute with the immediate supervisor.
13.03	Stage 2. Failing a satisfactory settlement within seventy-two (72) hours after the dispute was submitted under Stage 1, the employee or employees concerned, in person, with or without the Grievance Committee of the Union in attendance, or through the Grievance Committee of the Union, may submit the dispute, which at this stage must be stated in writing, to the Superintendent who may appoint members of his/her staff to assist in investigating the dispute.
13.04	Stage 3. Failing a satisfactory settlement within seventy-two (72) hours after the dispute was submitted under Stage 2, the Grievance Committee of the Union may submit the dispute, which shall be stated in writing, to the management of the Company, or the
38
accredited representative or representatives of the management, who may at their discretion require the employee or the employees concerned, and the members of the supervisory staff concerned in, or having knowledge of, the dispute, to appear before them and give evidence regarding the dispute.
The Grievance Committee of the Union may request the presence of the employee or employees concerned at Stage 3 proceedings, but where this necessitates the absence of the employee from the place of work, the employee shall first obtain the consent of the Company and it shall be at a time and a duration that does not interfere with the Company's operations.
The person whom the Union has designated as its Area International Union Representative may appear with the Grievance Committee at the Stage 3 presentation of a grievance. The Company shall be advised by letter from the United Steelworkers of America, CLC, of the identity of the Area International Representative.
13.05	Stage 4.
(i) Failing a satisfactory settlement at Stage 3 both parties may then mutually agree to take the matter to Expedited Arbitration. Expedited Arbitration will be binding, set in an informal
39
atmosphere, and used when a difference arises between both parties relating to the dismissal, discipline, or suspension of an employee, or to the interpretation, application, operation, or alleged violation of the Agreement including any question as to whether a matter is arbitral.
The parties agree that the purpose of Expedited Arbitration is for the fair and quick settlement of disputes. Once the parties agree to Expedited Arbitration, the selection of an arbitrator shall be from the panel listed in
13.05	(ii). If there is no arbitrator available from 13.05 (ii), a substitute may be agreed to by the parties within ten (10) days. The rotational system for arbitrators as outlined in 13.05 (ii) will be used to determine who will hear the dispute. The arbitrator shall:
(a)	investigate the difference
(b)	define the issue in the difference
(c)	not alter, modify or amend this agreement in any respect
(cl) render a decision within five working days of the hearing.
The arbitrator may, with discretion, render a verbal award to the parties at the conclusion of the hearing, but in
40
all cases a brief written decision shall be rendered within the above time frame. This five-day time limit does not run in respect of the grievance procedure.
The procedures for Expedited Arbitration shall be as follows: A maximum of four (4) people from each party shall attend. The grievor shall be considered as one of the four (4) members of the Union’s committee. No case law, jurisprudence, or witnesses shall be used.
The hearing shall be in an informal setting with no need for swearing-in testimony. Both parties shall have fifteen (15) days to notify the other in writing of their wish to proceed to Expedited Arbitration.
(ii) Formal Arbitration If either party does not wish to utilize the Expedited Arbitration procedure as outlined in this article, the Union or Company may, on giving fifteen (15) days’ notice in writing to either party of its intention, refer the dispute to arbitration. The selection of an arbitrator shall be by rotation from the panel listed below.
41
1 .Danish
2.	Ted Priel
3.	Ken Norman
If an arbitrator so selected is unable to serve, then the next arbitrator on the panel shall be selected. If an arbitrator on the panel is permanently unable to serve, then the parties shall jointly select a replacement. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days, the appointment shall be made by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Saskatchewan upon request of either party. The decision of the arbitrator in respect of an interpretation or alleged violation of this Agreement, shall be final and binding upon the parties, but in no event shall the arbitrator have the power to alter, modify or amend this Agreement in any respect. Each party shall pay the expenses incurred in connection with the presentation and preparation of its own case. The parties shall bear in equal shares the expenses of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall render his decision within a maximum of thirty (30) days following arbitration.
42
13.06	If a dispute (i) is not submitted under Stage 1 within fourteen (14) calendar days after the occurrence or discovery of the act or decision giving rise to the dispute, or (ii) is not advanced to the next stage under Stages 2, 3, or 4, within seven (7) days after a decision was made or should have been made, then the dispute shall be deemed to be abandoned, and all rights of recourse to the dispute procedure shall be at an end. Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action must be taken under (ii) above.
13.07	The Company shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Grievance Committee of the Union. Failing a satisfactory settlement within seven (7) days of the submission in writing of the dispute by the Company, the Company shall have the right to refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with this Article.
13.08	Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as preventing employees from presenting their own case in turn to their immediate supervisor, plant supervisor, activity (departmental) superintendent, and the management of the Company.
43
13.09	In the meantime, and in all cases while disputes are being investigated and settled, the employee or employees and all other parties involved, except an employee serving a disciplinary suspension, must continue to work, but where an employee or employees has or have been discharged by the Company, employee or employees shall not remain in the employ of the Company while the case is being investigated and settled. If the claim be made within five (5) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) that an employee or employees has or have been unjustly discharged, the case shall be dealt with according to this Article, and if it is proven that the employee or employees has or have been unjustly dealt with, the employee or employees shall be reinstated. If a claim is made for compensation for time lost in cases where reinstatement has followed, it shall be left with the Grievance Committee of the Union and the Management to decide what amount, if any, is to be paid, and failing agreement, with the same arbitrator that dealt with the claim and who shall fix such compensation.
13.10	The procedure for settling disputes set out in this Article shall be strictly adhered to, but the Union shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Company at
44
Stage 3 where:
1.	There is no aggrieved employee or employees possible of identification at the time the dispute arose; or
2.	The grievance involves Company policy in which case the grievor or grievors possible of identification shall be noted on the face of the grievance form.
All Union grievances filed at Stage 3 shall be signed by the Chief Steward.
13.11	Notwithstanding marginal paragraphs
13.02,13.03,13.04,13.05	and 13.06 above, in a grievance involving a discharge the grievance must be presented directly at Stage 3 of the grievance procedure by the Grievance Committee of the Union. The Stage 3 reply shall be given within five (5) working days of the presentation of the grievance at Stage 3.
13.12	As much as is practical and except in a case of gross misconduct and/or a case requiring immediate action, it is the Company's intention that an employee, accompanied by the employee's Shop Steward and the Grievance Committee Chairperson or delegate, if the employee so chooses, will be given the opportunity for a hearing with the supervisor(s) in question prior to receiving a disciplinary suspension or a discharge. Such hearing will be without preju-
45
dice to any subsequent grievance or arbitration procedures.
13.13	If it is necessary for a steward or other employee to take time off during working hours in connection with a grievance, the steward or employee must first receive permission from his/her immediate supervisor. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13.14	Any time limits provided for in this Article may be varied by the mutual consent of the Company and the Union and confirmed in writing.
ARTICLE 14. WORK WEEK, HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME
14.01	The normal work shift for the purpose of the Article shall be eight (8) hours, or twelve (12) hours as defined by the Letter of Understanding on the 4 x 4 shift schedule. For surface employees assigned to eight (8) hours steady day shift schedules, the work shift shall be eight (8) hours inclusive of meal time. For employees working underground or assigned to shift work schedules, the work shift shall include meal periods in accordance with present practice, at the convenience of the Operation. The starting time for shifts shall not vary more than one and one-half (IVa) hours from 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m. and midnight.
14.02	Schedules of work shall average forty
46
(40) hours per week over any complete cycle. Overtime rates shall be paid for hours worked in excess of this schedule.
14.03	A “work day” is any day an employee is normally at work according to the employee's work schedule. A “rest day” is an employee's assigned day off according to the employee's work schedule. A “work day” and a “rest day” both begin at 12 a.m. and continue for 24 hours. A “work week” begins at 12 a.m. Sunday and ends at 12 p.m. the following Saturday. A “work period” is an employee's complete period of work and rest days commencing with the first scheduled work day and concluding at the termination of the last scheduled rest day.
14.04	Overtime occurs when an employee is required to work in excess of the employee's regularly scheduled hours in any work day, or on a scheduled day of rest. For all overtime worked by an employee, the rate of pay shall be two (2) times the employee’s base hourly rate.
14.05	Notwithstanding current Company practice, overtime which is in excess of four (4) hours overtime during an employee’s work period shall be on a voluntary basis, i.e. an employee shall not be obliged to perform such work unless the employee agrees to do so.
14.06	When an employee is called out to work
47
at a time other than the beginning of the employee's regular shift, the employee shall receive either the overtime rate for the time actually worked, exclusive of the employee's regular shifts, or six (6) hours’ pay at the employee’s base rate, whichever is the greater. Upon completion of the work for which the employee was originally called out, the employee may choose to remain at work provided work is available and the employee is qualified to do such work, and completion of the callout falls within the eight (8) hour period prior to the commencement of the employee's next regularly scheduled shift. Payment for hours worked between completion of the callout and commencement of the employee's next regularly scheduled shift shall be at the overtime rate. The six -hour minimum rule does not apply, however, if the overtime continues into the employee's regular work shift, if the employee elects to remain at work upon completion of the work for which the employee was originally called out, or if the employee is called back to work before leaving the premises.
14.07	If an employee is called out, and works any portion of the time between midnight and 5:00 a.m., the employee will not be required to report for day shift that day until eight (8) hours have elapsed from the time the employee finished the callout work. The employee will be paid at the employee's base straight time rate
48
for any time missed on the employee's regular day shift due to this provision. If there is less than two (2) hours left in the employee’s regular shift after the required eight (8) hours rest period, the employee will not be required to work the remainder of the shift but will not receive pay for this additional time missed.
14.08	When employee(s) report on their regular shift and are sent home because no work of any kind is available or so that they may come to work at a later time, they shall be paid eight (8) hours pay at their base rate for reporting on their regular shift. If they are assigned to work at a later time, they shall be paid straight time for such work up to eight (8) hours.
14.09	If the Company changes an employee's work schedule and the employee is required to work on the normal rest days of the employee's old schedule, the employee shall be paid overtime rates for those days. This new schedule will become the employee's regular schedule at the conclusion of the rest days from the employee’s old work period.
In addition, when an employee is notified of a change of shift while at rest, and that rest period is reduced due to this change, the first shift of the new schedule will be at overtime rates.
14.10	Overtime rates will apply when an
49
employee is required to start work less than twenty-four (24) hours after the start of the employee’s previous work day. Overtime rates will only apply for hours worked during the 24-hour period calculated from the start of the employee's previous regular shift.
14.11	If an employee works for more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the employee will be entitled to an 8-hour rest period. If the employee's regular shift is to commence before the 8-hour rest period has expired, the employee will be permitted to stay at rest for those eight (8) hours and be paid for said hours of the regular shift. If the employee returns to work after the eight hour rest period, the employee will be paid the employee's regular rate of pay until the completion of that shift. If an employee at the request of the employee's supervisor consents to return to work before the expiration of the 8-hour rest period, the employee will be paid at two (2) times the employee's base rate for all work performed on the employee's regular shift. If not so requested to return to work, the employee will remain at rest for an 8-hour period.
14.12	If it is necessary to change an employee's regular shift, and this new shift change causes the employee to start work more than twenty-four (24) hours following the com-
50
pletion of the employee's last regular shift, the Company shall be required to give the employee a minimum of thirty-two (32) hours notice before the start of this new shift. If sufficient notice is not given, overtime rates shall apply to all hours worked during this newly scheduled shift. If the employee has received overtime rates according to this marginal paragraph, and if the employee returns to the original shift following completion of one shift, the provisions of marginal paragraph 14.10 shall not apply.
14.13	When the Company temporarily changes an employee's shift schedule or hours of work for four (4) shifts or less, with or without 32 hours of notice, the first shift will be at two times (2x) base hourly rate. No penalty shall be incurred by the Company when the employee is returned to the shift or work schedule he/she worked prior to the temporary change.
ARTICLE 15. TRAINING PROGRAMS, POSTINGS, TRAINING COMMITTEE, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PREFERRED SHIFT POSITIONS
15.01	The Company shall pay basic wage rates to its employees in accordance with the wage scale shown in Schedule A which forms part of this Agreement. An employee's advancement on this wage scale will be depen-

The Company will make training available to employees from time to time in accordance with its requirements. The opportunity for training shall be made available in accordance with the seniority provisions of this Agreement.

1.	The employee's acquisition of skills and knowledge during the progression through the training program is
52
satisfactory to the Company.
2.	The employee does not elect during the term of the training program to forego any training provided by the Company. An employee who elects to forego training during the course of a training program will be maintained at the hourly base rate of the Occupational Classification the employee has attained until such time as the employee elects to re-enter the training program and is again accepted by the Company.
Upon acceptance to a training program an employee will be slotted at an Occupational Classification commensurate with the employee's skills and knowledge as related to the program being entered.
An employee who is accepted for entry to the training program will normally advance from one Occupational Classification to the next at intervals of not more than twelve (12) months provided the employee successfully demonstrates the qualifications to advance by practical, oral or written examinations from time to time. The Company shall determine qualifications in a fair and equitable manner.

To further this goal the Company and the Union shall establish a Joint Training Committee. The Committee shall consist of four (4) members appointed by the Union and four (4) members appointed by the Company. The Union members shall be two (2) employees from surface and two (2) from underground, all of whom shall be Operator Journeypersons. The responsibilities of the Joint Committee will be to:
1.	Review training procedures and guidelines used in job training and advancement programs.
2.	Review the written, oral and practical examinations which plant supervision will use to evaluate employee skills and knowledge.
3.	Meet from time to time to discuss problem areas and to make recommendations for changes to the
54
training system.
15.06	(i) It is recognized that it is in the
interest of the Company and the employees that the Company take advantage of technological change. Both parties also recognize the importance of lessening the effect of such change upon the employment security and the earnings of employees as a result of such change.
(ii)	Technological change shall mean a change in work methods or duties as a result of mechanization or automation of equipment which results in the displacement of an employee from his/her regular job.
(iii)	The Company will notify the Union of a technological change that affects the employment security or earnings of the employees, as far as possible in advance of the date on which such change is to be effected. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state:
(a)	The nature of the technological change;
(b)	The date upon which the Com-
55
pany proposes to effect the technological change, and,
(c)The names, seniority dates and classifications of the employees affected.
(iv)
(a)	An employee displaced from his/her job who suffers a reduction of income as a result of technological change shall have an opportunity to fill any vacancy for which he/she has seniority and for which he/she is qualified, and if there is no vacancy, shall have the right to displace employees with less seniority as provided by Article 12.03.
(b)	If an employee is displaced due to technological change, the employee will be paid a wage rate commensurate with his/her skills and knowledge, but in any event not less than one (1) wage grade below that received by the employee prior to his/her displacement due to technological change.

(c)Employees with one (1) or more years of service who are placed in a layoff position or select layoff status as a result of technological change shall receive a severance payment of one (1) weeks pay at the employee's base wage rate at the time of layoff, for each completed year of service prior to this layoff, up to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks' pay.
If an employee chooses to accept severance pay, such employee's seniority and employment rights will be terminated.
15.07	If an employee is transferred to another Training Program at the request of the Company, the employee's wage rate will be maintained at the wage rate he/she was in receipt of immediately prior to the transfer.
If an employee requests a transfer to another Training Program and is accepted by the Company, the wage rate will be commensurate with the skills and knowledge of the employee in the Training Program to which the transfer was requested , but in any event not less than one (1) wage grade below that received by the
57
employee immediately prior to the transfer.
15.08	In recognition of the desirability for preferential work schedules, the Company agrees to post permanent positions in the following areas to allow employees to apply for any such positions which hereinafter become vacant (number of permanent positions in brackets).

Nothing in this marginal paragraph shall preclude the Company from eliminating these positions as a result of job elimination due to technological, mechanization or automation changes. It is understood that this clause only applies during normal operation of the Company.
Vacancies will be advertised for a period of eight (8) calendar days during which time bids will be accepted by Human Resources. Employees who have been accepted for any such job postings shall not be eligible to bid for another advertised job for a period of one (1) year from the time of such acceptance. The one-year time period shall not be used to restrict an employee from applying for an apprenticeship.
The successful employee to a job posting will be selected and placed in the job as soon as possible having regard to the efficiency of the Operation, but in any event, no later than sixty (60) calendar days from date of posting.
ARTICLE 16. SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL, SUNDAY PREMIUM AND UNDERGROUND PREMIUM

(iv)	If a public holiday occurs during the employee's annual vacation and the employee would normally have been paid for the public holiday had the employee not been on vacation, the employee will qualify for public holiday pay for that day, or another day taken in lieu thereof as provided for in Article 17.03, in addition to the employee's vacation pay.
(v)	An employee who qualifies for public holiday pay shall receive an amount equal to eight (8) hours pay at the base rate plus shift differential, if any, (but exclusive of any overtime payments) at the rate paid for the last shift worked prior to the holiday.

In the event an employee is required to be a pallbearer at the funeral of another Company employee or retiree, the Company will grant the necessary time off and the employee will not lose pay for their regularly scheduled shift. Paid leave under the terms of this marginal paragraph will not disqualify an employee for statutory holidays but will not be regarded as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime on a work day.

COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE
1.	Each employee covered by this Agreement shall receive a cost of living allowance (COLA) during the term of this Agreement as hereinafter provided.
2.	The cost of living allowance shall be based on the Consumer Price Index (all items-base 1961 = 100) published by Statistics Canada (hereinafter referred to as CPI).
3.	The cost of living allowance shall be equal to one cent (10) for each 0.3 point rise in the CPI as hereinafter determined counting as a full cent any fraction of one-half cent (1/20) or more.
4.	Adjustments to the cost of living allowance shall be made as follows:
(a) Should the CPI for March, 1983 (as published in April, 1983) exceed the CPI for March, 1982 by more than twelve percent (12%), a COLA will be generated
87
to pay one cent (10) for each 0.3 point rise in the CPI in excess of twelve percent (12%).
(b) The COLA generated by this formula will become payable the first full pay period following publication by Statistics Canada of the official index for March, 1983 and will be incorporated into the hourly base rates in effect at that time as indicated in Schedule A.
5.	The parties to this Agreement agree that the continuance of the cost of living allowance will depend upon availability of the monthly Statistics Canada CPI in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the index for November, 1978.

If agreement is not reached the parties agree to request Statistics Canada to make available for the life of this Agreement a monthly CPI in its present form calculated on the same basis as the index for November, 1978.

90
ADDENDUM B
Addendum B to the Agreement between Agrium, Vanscoy Potash Operations, and the United Steelworkers of America, CLC, Local 7552.
COMPRESSED WORK WEEK
A.	PREAMBLE
Agrium, Vanscoy Potash Operations at the request of Local 7552, United Steelworkers of America, agrees to institute a twelve (12) hour shift schedule for all employees who work on a continuous shift basis or who periodically are scheduled to work on the continuous shift schedule.
The implementation and continuation of the Compressed Work Week is subject to the following conditions:
1.	Approval by the Minister of Labour for the Province of Saskatchewan which the Company and the Union agree to jointly seek, to permit the hoistmen to work the longer shifts required must be obtained.
2.	The Compressed Work Week must be agreed to by a minimum of 75% of those affected.
3.	The new schedules must not lessen safety, efficiency, housekeeping or
91
productivity within the workforce.
4.	In the event 12-hour shift schedules affect compliance with government Occupational Health and Safety regulations, the Company has the option to revert to 8-hour shifts.
5.	The Company reserves the right to schedule all its employees on an eight (8) hour shift schedule during a period of any emergency that would cause normal operations to cease without having to pay overtime if incurred as a result of schedule change. As much advance notice as possible will be given to the employees.
6.	The Company or the Union may terminate the Compressed Work Week by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.
B.	GENERAL CONDITIONS
All the provisions of the Collective Agreement in effect between the parties shall apply to the employees covered by this Agreement save and except as specifically otherwise herein provided.
92
C.	WORK WEEK, HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME
(14.05) Notwithstanding current Company practice, overtime which is in excess of four (4) hours overtime during an employee’s work period shall be voluntary, except that in any operation where a qualified replacement is not available the employee will be required to remain at work to a maximum of six (6) hours.
D.	SUNDAY PREMIUM
(16.02)	The Sunday premium shall be paid for all work performed by employees on their regularly assigned shifts starting at 8:00 p.m. Saturday until 8:00 p.m. Sunday. The premium shall be paid for straight time hours only.
E.	PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
(17.02)	Statutory holidays will begin at 8:00 p.m. on the day preceding the holiday and terminate at 8:00 p.m. on the statutory holiday.
F.	VACATIONS WITH PAY
Employees working the twelve (12) hour shift schedule must take their vacation hours in full shifts only, rounded upward to the nearest whole shift.
If after rounding, an employee is required to take more hours of time off than that specified in 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, and 18.04; then such extra time will be regarded as
93
leave of absence without pay.
G.	LUNCH PERIODS
The daily lunch periods for employees working with the twelve (12) hour shift schedule shall be two (2) twenty (20) minute breaks, on Company time, during which time the employee shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
H.	STANDBY
The parties recognize that the most significant benefit to this schedule to employees is the additional days free from work. The Parties also recognize that absenteeism problems increase costs and reduce productivity and replacement employees must be available when employees are absent. These replacements will, of necessity, have to come from employees on their days off. The necessity to work employees on their days off negates the primary benefits of the schedule to employees and increases significantly the cost of overtime coverage to the Company. In recognition of the above, the Parties agree:
a)	To encourage 100% attendance by all employees.
b)	To establish procedures for cover-
94
ing “No Shows” and standby provisions for those on days off.
The Union agrees to establish a voluntary call board system to assist in replacing absent employees. Employees on time off, who are available to work, will enter their names on the board prior to leaving work and will be available for work if called. Employees who are not relieved may be required to remain at work on overtime rates by the Company until call board relief arrives on the job. In the event that not enough qualified employees are available to meet the requirements of the operation, it is understood and agreed for the continuance of the Compressed Work Week that the Company will have the right to establish a compulsory rotation selection of such operating personnel or terminate the Compressed Work Week schedule
