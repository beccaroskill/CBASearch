Working Relationship
The Company, in recognizing the need to improve the relationship with the BCTGM Union and its members, is prepared to agree to the following, during the life of the agreement:
•	The parties will work together on obtaining the help of an outside consultant who will lead us into a high performance workplace.

•	The Company and the Union agree on die need to solicit the help of a third party to lead the parties into the development of a labour-management partnership.
Joint Technology
The Company and the union agree on the need to create a means through which they can mutually discuss the content and the implication of technological change at the Lakeshore Biscuit Plant. Both parties agree to the creation of a “Joint Technology Committee” (JTC) to accomplish these ends. The JTC will be comprised of the BCTGM elected union executive members (President, Vice-President, FinancM Secretary, Recording Secretary, and WSIB Representative) and members of Management.
•	New job classifications created as a result of technological change will be reviewed with the JTC committee
•	It is recognized that highly skilled technical jobs may fall under the IAM agreement, and that management may access information and will have the need to input data.
•	The Company agrees that there will be no concerted effort to transfer bargaining unit work to management at the Lakeshore Biscuit Plant due to technology.
Part-time Employees
Employment of part-time employees will not result in a reduction in the regular complement of full time employees. The Company agrees that if part-time employees are hired they will be
employed to work in the EH&S Department to provide services that can only be performed when production is ceased.
In the EH&S Department the Company will use part-time employees to provide coverage on the Friday midnight shift if scheduled employees do not report for work. During the weekend in the EH&S Department if there are insufficient volunteers for overtime, then the Company will use part-time employees. In the event that additional work is scheduled after overtime has been solicited, the work will be offered to the EH&S employees before using part-time workers.
The Union and Company will agree to the following process:
•	If a regular EH&S employee calls in after 3:00pm then the Company can first go to the part-time employee list and call in a part-time employee(s).
•	If a regular EH&S employee calls in before 3:00pm then the Company will offer the opportunity to existing members via overtime. If there are no volunteers, the Company will return and go to the part-time employees list and call in a part-time employee(s).
