1.01	The general purpose of this Agreement is to establish mutually satisfactory relations between the Company and its employees and to provide machinery for the prompt and equitable disposition of grievances, and to establish and maintain satisfactory working conditions, hours and wages for all employees who are subject to the provisions cf this Agreement, keeping in mind at all times that the welfare and prosperity of the employees are contingent upon the Company’s ability to successfully compete in the trade and in the sale of its products.
ARTICLE II- RECOGNITION AND SCOPE
2.01	(a) The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining
agent for the bargaining unit composed cf all employees cf the Company in its Plant #1,1030 Erie Street and its Plant #2,703 Douro Street, in the City of Stratford, Ontario, save and except supervisors, persons above the rank of supervisors, timekeepers and time clerks, office and sales staff and plant guards.
(b) The said plants, while they are in operation, shall be treated as separate divisions for the purposes of this Agreement and the employees in each division shall have separate plant committees and separate seniorities and seniority lists but both &vi-sions shall have a single grievance committee, as hereinafter provided.
2.02	Wherever the word employee or the word employees is used throughout this Agreement it shall mean the employee or employees within the respective divisions (hereinafter sometimesreferred to as the divisions or division) as provided in Sections2.01 (A) and (B).
2.03	As a condition of employment, any employee hired or transferred into a division shall become a member of the Union not later than 30 days following their hire or transfer into that division and shall maintain membership in the Union as a condition cf continued employment. During the orientation process, the new employee will be introduced to their Union steward.
2.04	Any employee may take up any personal matter directly with the Company at any time.
1
2.05	In the event that the Company moves or transfers a portion of the production and equipment at Plants 1 and 2 in Stratford to a new factory owned or leased or operated by it, then in that event, the Company will give the Union notice of such a move or transfer as far in advance as practicable and will meet with the Union for the purpose of working out a transfer or production agreement covering employees laid off as a result of such move or transfer, provided always however, that there is no Collective Agreement to which the Company is a party or is bound fcy reason of the provisions of the Labour Relations Act or amendments thereto, covering a bargaining unit at the new factory. In the event there is a Collective Agreement covering a bargaining unit at the new factory, employees laid off as a result of the move or transfer shall, subject to said Collective Agreement, be offered the opportunity to transfer with their jobs.
ARTICLE III - UNION DUES CHECK-OFF AND INITIATION FEE
3.01	(a) The parties agree that there shall be set up, as of the date hereof, a checkoff of Union dues, compulsory upon all employees who come within the bargaining unit, in which this agreement applies. The check-off shall continue during the life of this agreement. Every employee within the bargaining unit shall become eligibleto the check-off upon completionof forty (40) hours worked in the first calendar month of employmentwith-in the Compary.
The amount to be deducted shall be such sum as may, from time to time, be assessed by the Union on its members, according to its constitution and by-laws, for general Union purposes, as regular weekly Union dues. This check-off of Union dues shall be deducted from a pay cheque for the calendar month in which the first forty (40) hours of employment are completed and remitted to the financial secretary of CAW Local 4451, prior to the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month.
(b) The Company shall also deduct from the pay cf every employee who comes within the bargaining unit and who has completed
2
thirty (30) calendar days of employment with the Company, one (1) Union initiation fee during their employment with the Company provided the employee has not, at an earlier time, paid an initiation fee to the Union, with proof. The amount of the initiation fee shall be the amount fixed by the constitution and by-laws of the Union. The initiation fee shall be deducted from a pay cheque in the calendar month following the month in which the said thirty (30) calendar days of employmenthave been completed, and remitted to the financial secretary of the Local along with the next remittance cf Union dues as aforesaid.
3.02	The Company agrees to deduct Union dues and/or the equivalent of Union dues according to the constitution of the CAW from all employees in the bargaining unit beginning with the first month in which forty (40) hours of employmenthave been completed. The Company will agree to take dues off weekly and will agree to show annual union dues deducted on the employee’s T4 tax form. Retroactive payments and initiation fees will be deducted once per month.
Monthly dues will be equivalent to two hours 20 minutes straight time pay including COLA for all members who work 40 hours or more in a calendar month. Since dues are deducted weekly, this may result in arrears situations when a member works less than a full month. Any arrears will be deducted from subsequent pays. Anyone working less than 40 hours in a calendar month will not be required to pay dues for that month.
The list will contain the employee’s name, badge number, address, postal code and telephone number along with the amount of such deductions and the reason, if any, why no deductions were made from certain employees.
The financial secretary of the Local Union shall notify the Company, in writing, of any corrections to be made in the sums deducted.

(A) First, to provide for:
(1)	The continuation cf annuities in the form in effect with respect to them immediately prior to the plan’s termination for those persons who are pensioners, beneficiaries and contingent annuitants under the plan at its termination;
(2)	The payment of an immediate annuity, in an amount equal to the retirement benefit they would have received had they retired on the date cf termination to each participant who on the date cf termination qualifies for a normal retirement benefit under Section 5.01;
(3)	The payment of a deferred annuity commencing at age
101
sixty-five (65] in an amount equal to their vested deferred retirement benefit to each person who terminated employment and is eligible for such a benefit pursuant to Section 5.04;
(4) The payment of a deferred annuity equal to the vested deferred retirement pension to which they would have been entitled if the date of the plan's termination were the date of termination of their employment, to each other participant not in any class above who at the date of the plan's termination is at least age forty-five (45) and has completed at least ten (10) years of credited service.
There shall be no priority among the above. Ary person, whether in Group (1),(2),(3) or(4), stands on the same rung cf the ladder with a person in any other group.
(B) Second, if any such assets remain after complete allocation for the purposes of (A) above, they shall be allocated after first establishing classes cf participants who are less than age sixty-five (65) on the date of termination and are potentially eligible for a normal retirement benefit by treating each successively younger five (5j year age group as a class using the age sixty-five (65) as a base. An order of allocation priority shall then be established beginning with the oldest class. The assets shall then be allocated to participants in each such class who have an interest herein on account of credited service prior to the date of termination of the plan in an amount equal to the actuarial value of such interest. The allocations of the amounts, if any, in each class for full or reduced retirement benefits for such participants shall be on the basis of annuity values providing for the payment of such benefits (commencingat the age of first eligibility for a normal benefit) in the form, applicable to such participants, which would have prevailed had the plan not been discontinued with application for reduction cf retirement benefits, as in (A) above.
Such allocation shall be accomplishedthroughthe continuance cf the trust fund which shall be maintained without earmark as
the severable equitable interests of those having a share allocated as above. The allocation of assets in this Section is merely for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the trust fund to provide reserves for retirement benefits of a certain monthly amount, and is not intended to give any participant such right, title and interest in the trust fund as to entitle them to a segregation cf their aliquot share of the trust fund as a separate account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, F the trustees, upon finding that it is not practicable or desirable under the circumstances to continue the trust fund with respect to some of all of the groups listed above, the trustees may provide for the disposition of all or a part of the trust fund in a manner other than by the continuance of the trust fund with respect to some or all cf the groups listed above, but no change shall be affected thereby in the order cf precedence and basis for allocation above established.
Further, F required to dispose cf the trust fund other than by its continuance because of agovemmentrule or statute, such trust fund shall be disposed cf in accordance with such rule or statute, If any allocation produces a retirement benefit cf less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per year for any person, the trustees may pay in lieu of a retirement benefit a lump sum cf equivalent actuarial value,
Anything in this plan which might be construed to the contrary notwithstanding however, it shall be impossible at any time for any time for any part of the corpus or income cf the trust fund to revert to the Company.

Amendments to this plan may be made in writing by mutual consent of both parties.
