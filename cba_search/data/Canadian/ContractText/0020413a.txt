15
b) Suitable hot meals will be delivered to employees assigned to duties, which require the employee to remain at his place of work. Other employees will be allowed to eat their meals at the camp kitchen.
6.05	When an employee is required to make a special trip in order to work overtime or when he is "called out" at other than regular shift change times, transportation will be provided at Company expense.

6.06	If an employee is assigned to work on a schedule different from his regular schedule and his starting time on the new schedule is more than one hour sooner or later than the starting time under his schedule immediately prior to the change, he shall be paid two (2) times his base hourly rate for the first shift worked of the new shift schedule, unless the change is made:
16
a)	As an accommodation to or for the convenience of the employee.
b)	As a result of the employee being upgraded or promoted on a permanent basis.
c)	In returning an employee to his original schedule within 28 days, which he worked prior to the change.

b)	The Company will post overtime lists on all relevant area bulletin boards bi-weekly.
c)	Refusal of overtime shall be considered as overtime worked for record purposes and will be recorded on the bi-weekly overtime list.

e)	For record purposes, an employee who is absent from his regular duties on leave of absence or due to illness/injury for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days shall be assigned the current average overtime hours for all other employees within the classification or area upon his return.
17
f)	Any distribution of overtime, found to be in violation of the provision of the Collective Agreement, will be resolved through mutual agreement between the wronged employee and their supervisor. Such agreement is limited to an overtime assignment of equal duration, at a time acceptable to both the employee and the supervisor, not more than forty-five (45) calendar days after the original overtime assignment giving rise to the claim or the date such original assignment was determined to be in violation, whichever is later. In the event the employee and the supervisor are unable to reach agreement to satisfy this forty-five (45) day limitation, the matter will be deemed to be settled and the employee will be recorded refused overtime for the number of hours in question. This forty-five (45) day period will be extended by the number of shifts an employee is absent from regular duties on an approved leave of four (4) or more consecutive days.
Such overtime assignment will not result in another employee being denied overtime as per the Chit Systems in Appendix "B" and "C".
g)	In accordance with the chit systems in Appendix B and C where two (2) or more employee's overtime hours are equal, the employee with the greatest area seniority will be offered the overtime first.
6.09	If an employee reports for an overtime assignment which has been cancelled or shortened with less than eight (8) hours prior notice, he will be permitted to perform an alternate assignment of equivalent hours on that day.
6.10	An employee's overtime shall be calculated to the next quarter hour, in accordance with Article 6.01.
6.11	In no case shall payments be pyramided or paid under more than one provision of this agreement unless specifically provided for.

Articles 8.01 or 8.02 will receive their regular salary while on vacation. In addition an employee may qualify for a vacation pay adjustment based on the following. Total vacation pay will be based on a percentage of an employee's regular salary as recorded for all time worked during 26 bi-weekly pay periods preceding the last pay period of the calendar year in which the vacation is taken. This percentage will equal 0.05% for each hour of vacation taken between the 25th pay day of the previous year and the 25th pay day of the current year. If the result of this calculation is a sum greater than the regular salary paid as vacation taken during the same period the difference will be paid on the 26th pay day of the year as vacation pay adjustment.

21

b)	In the case of an employee who has become entitled to a vacation in accordance with Articles 8.01 or 8.02, he shall receive vacation pay based on 0.05% of his accumulated base salary for each hour of vacation for which he is eligible, and as calculated for all straight time hours worked from his anniversary date in the year in which he last took vacation, less any vacation pay already received during the calendar year in which he terminates.

ARTICLE XI - PROMOTION, SENIORITY, TRANSFERS, TRAINING AND PROGRESSION CHARTS
11.01 a) i) ii)	Permanent progression within any area shall be in accordance with progression charts and notes, Appendix "B". Qualification is based on the employee's knowledge of the theories, procedures and equipment related to the job in question. The Company undertakes to evaluate the qualifications of employees in a fair and just manner. The Company agrees that all employees will be given every opportunity to qualify for the next higher jobs within the minimum time periods, as set out in the progression charts. Employees shall be provided with special instruction, instructional material and/or any other advice or means for self-improvement. If an employee has not qualified for the next higher job because the Company has not given him the opportunity to train within the minimum time period, the Company agrees that within a further ninety (90) day period the employee shall receive the opportunity to train and qualify. Providing the employee qualifies during this ninety (90) day period he shall receive his wage increment retroactive to the date of completion of the minimum time period as outlined in Appendix "B". When a permanent vacancy occurs the most senior man in the next lower classification or phase will be given the job provided he is qualified for move up or phase progression. In the event that it is found that an employee has not sufficient qualification for move up or phase progression he will be informed as to the areas in which he is expected to improve and will be given extra assistance in those areas. If time is such that it would not be practical for re-evaluation of said employee before the vacant job must be filled, the next most senior employee will be given the job, subject to the same conditions. It is agreed that the
32
senior employee will be given the same opportunity for all subsequent vacancies in the next higher classification or phase. However, if the senior employee, providing he meets the certification requirements where required as outlined in Appendix "B", has not been given the opportunity to train for the job, the position will be filled on a temporary basis for up to thirty (30) working days, during which time the senior employee will be given the opportunity to train and qualify, iii) Pay classification seniority will be the governing factor to determine move up, however if pay classification seniority is the same, the qualified employee with the most area seniority will be given the job. If the area seniority is the same, then the qualified employee with the most Company seniority will be given the job. Pay classification or area seniority begins on the date an employee is given a permanent assignment in the pay classification, phase or area. If there is no one qualified in the given pay classification, phase or area, then persons in the next lower pay classification or phase will become eligible. An employee may, with the approval of the Area Superintendent, decline a permanent move up. In such case his rate of pay will be fixed at his currently assigned position rate in accordance with Appendix "B". This agreement will remain in effect until cancelled by either party with 30 days written notice. The date of cancellation will determine the employees pay classification seniority for subsequent progression.
b)	Move-ups caused by temporary vacancies as well as training for the next job shall be in accordance with the Progression Charts and Notes for each area.
c)	Temporary shift vacancies will be filled by the next most senior employee on the shift concerned, or as outlined in Appendix "B", provided the employee has sufficient
33
training. If it is determined that a temporary job opening will last in excess of thirty (30) days, it shall be considered as a permanent job opening and shall be filled by the normal procedure as defined in 11.01(a) except as follows:
i)	When filling job vacancies on a temporary basis, resulting from vacations, injury, sickness, leave of absence, training or emergency, the temporary procedure may apply beyond thirty (30) days.

34
pay. An employee who transfers at a rate of pay below "H" rate will maintain his rate of pay. However, on such transfer, he shall be established at the Trainee or equivalent start level in his new department or area, and his classification and area seniority will begin on the day of his transfer.

12.02	a) In the event that it is necessary for the Company to reduce the working force, the lay-off shall be made by the Company in the reverse order of Company seniority within the trade or progression concerned within each Department of the plant, providing employees retained are qualified to do the work remaining. However, in the event of lay-off in a trade or progression common to more than one Department, then the junior of the qualified employees affected will be laid off regardless of the department, with the remaining employees being transferred to fill the resulting vacancies.
b)	i) If an employee who has transferred from one department to another while employed by the company is to be laid off, he may exercise his Company seniority to displace the junior employee in the trade or progression where he worked in his last previous department provided the junior employee has less company seniority and has the least company seniority in the trade or progression in his last previous department and provided he is qualified to fill the position.
39
ii) Employees who are not able to retain employment through (b)(i) above may use their qualifications and seniority to displace the employee who has less Company Seniority and who has the least Company Seniority in any entry level position provided that no more than twenty-five (25%) percent of such employees in an area are displaced. For the purpose of this provision, entry-level positions are Labourer, Trainee, Warehouse Technician, and Mine Operator. In the case of Mine Operators, the Company reserves the right to phase in the displacement of a large number of operators if to do otherwise would not be in the best interest of the business. In the case of Labourers, there are no restrictions on displacement.
c)	i) The recall of employees will be in the reverse order of layoff, provided the employee has not been laid off for more than twelve (12) months and further provided the employee(s) recalled are qualified to perform the work available.
ii)	Employee who decline a Recall for work expected to last less than one hundred and twenty (120) Calendar Days will not lose their position on the Recall List because of declining.
iii)	Employees on the Recall List are responsible to inform the Company of their whereabouts so that they may be contacted for Recall. The Company will notify the employee by telephone. Failing that, the Company will notify the employee by Registered Mail or other form of delivery which demonstrates the attempt to contact was made at the last known address of the employee and a copy of the notices to be sent to the Union.
40
iv)	The employee has forty-eight (48) hours to respond to contact by telephone and must report for work within an additional seven (7) days or some longer period if longer notice can be given by the Company. The employee has fourteen (14) days from the date a Registered or similar Letter of Notice is dispatched from the Company in which to respond and must report for work within an additional seven (7) days or some longer period if longer notice can be given by the Company.
d)	For the purpose of "continuous service", an employee recalled will be deemed to have continuous service.
e)	An employee who accepts recall to other than the position that he held prior to layoff will retain his position on the recall list until such time as he has had an opportunity to return to the position held prior to layoff, provided the employee has not been on the recall list for more than twelve (12) months.
12.03	For the purposes of layoff the date and time of notification of layoff shall be deemed the commencement of layoff and the date and time of notification of recall shall be deemed the official time of the recall regardless of which shift a recalled employee actually works in accordance with regular work schedules.
12.04	In the event that any classification or position is cancelled for any reason and the employee in that classification is lowered to a lower classification, he will maintain his regular salary.
12.05	Should an employee accept an opportunity to transfer to another position rather than be laid off, the employee will have his regular rate of pay maintained until he qualified for a higher rate or until subsequent adjustments in regular rates of pay qualify the employee for an increase. For this maintenance of rate provision to apply, an employee who is permanently reassigned must meet the progression requirements in accordance with this agreement.
41
12.06	In preference to being laid off, an employee who has at least one (1) year of continuous service with the Company may request in writing to accept the following severance pay and to terminate his employment with the Company. In this case, the employee shall have no recall rights under this Agreement. Severance pay will be provided based on the greater of:
a)	four weeks' pay multiplied by 1.15; or
b)	two weeks' pay plus two weeks' pay for each year of Continuous Service multiplied by 1.15, provided in either case the employee has at least one (1) year of Continuous Service with the Company. Severance pay for a partial year of service will be calculated on a prorated basis. A weeks' pay shall equal 40 hours at the employee's base hourly rate.

APPENDIX "B"
MASTER MAINTENANCE PROGRESSION NOTES
1.	New Hires
a)	When filling vacancies in skilled positions, the Company agrees to give first preference to Journeymen with an appropriate ticket.
b)	When a non-fully qualified employee is hired, he will be classified either as Apprentice IV, which employee will be additional to the existing complement of apprentices, or in accordance with the Area Progression Notes.
2.	The following table relates the various levels of the apprenticeship
program to the levels of the Suncor Energy Inc. Maintenance
Progression Charts:
JOURNEYMAN: A holder of a certificate of proficiency or certificate of qualification in his trade recognized by the Province of Alberta. Journeyman with twelve (12) month's service is a certified Journeyman who has been employed in a maintenance capacity at Suncor Energy Inc. for 12 months or longer.
APPRENTICE IV:	Completed	the third year of	a	four-year
apprenticeship program, or the second year of a three-year apprenticeship program.
APPRENTICE III:	Completed	the	second year of	a	four-year
apprenticeship program, or the first year of a three-year apprenticeship program.
APPRENTICE II:	Completed	the first year of	a	four-year
apprenticeship program.
APPRENTICE I:	An employee upon being indentured into an
apprenticeship program shall be classified as an Apprentice I.
63
3.	While every effort will be made by the Company to ensure that an employee is given the opportunity to complete his annual course work and examination prior to each twelve month point on his progression being reached, it is recognized that scheduling difficulties arising from the necessity of maintaining the efficiency of the Suncor Energy Inc.; Maintenance Departments may result in the completion of such course work and examination at a date after the twelve (12) month period(s). In such cases of Company occasioned delays and upon successful completion of his apprenticeship for a given year, including the passing of the examination, the apprentice who, as a direct consequence is reclassified according to Note 2 above, shall receive a retroactive pay adjustment for all hours worked from the anniversary date upon which he was eligible for reclassification, pending only the successful completion of the apprenticeship examination and preceding course work.
4.	a) While the Company has every desire and intention to continue
the apprenticeship program indefinitely, it reserves the right to amend, alter, suspend, or cease the program or any part of it, should conditions so indicate. In such event, however, the Company would still allow all apprentices then enrolled to complete their Journeyman qualifications through the apprenticeship program. This provision does not preclude layoffs under Article XII.
b)	Notwithstanding (a) above, before the Company exercises its right to amend, alter, suspend or cease any part of the apprenticeship program, it shall only be done after consultation with the Union.
c)	When an apprentice successfully completes the apprenticeship program and becomes a newly classified journeyman, his placement will be pursuant to the respective area reassignment process. Where there is no area in which to be reassigned, then this provision shall not apply.
5.	The Apprenticeship and Industry Training Act of Alberta shall apply in the resolution of disputes over job assignments of apprentices, if not otherwise covered by the Agreement.
64

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2
This letter outlines the intentions of the parties with respect to Article 6.08 (a). It is not intended to affect the operation of existing chit systems.
It is understood and accepted that this provision is a "best efforts" overtime opportunity and not an absolute equalization clause. It is not intended that a Supervisor endeavour to equalize overtime on a day-today or a week-to-week basis, nor is it intended that he always offer overtime to the employee with the least hours in the pay classification.
Overtime lists are zero at the beginning of each calendar year. The list published mid-year is used as check point to determine where the emphasis should be to have the overtime opportunity distribution reasonably equalized by the end of the year.

RE: HARASSMENT
The Company and the Union recognize the right of employees to work in an environment free from sexual or workplace harassment, and to be treated fairly and with respect in the workplace. The purpose of this letter is to outline activities for both the Company and the Union to provide a workplace environment that is productive and promotes both the dignity and self-esteem of all employees.
For the purpose of this joint initiative, Sexual Harassment means any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that causes offence or humiliation to any employee or that might be perceived by the employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on any employment relationship.
Workplace harassment means any unwelcome behaviour, which creates an intimidating, threatening or hostile work environment such that an employee's performance is impaired, the employment relationship is adversely affected or the employee's dignity or respect is denied.
For the purpose of administering this joint initiative, two (2) harassment Co-ordinators shall be jointly responsible to:
-	Assist in communicating/educating all employees on the parties' policies and procedures.
-	Act as contact/resource people for harassment complaints.
These co-ordinators (preferably one of each gender with one selected by the Company and one selected by the Union) will be trained to carry out their duties. Knowledge and awareness is a critical part of combating harassment. The co-ordinators will recommend programs to inform and encourage fellow workers to recognize the problem and take control of their own situation through exercising their rights. It is both a right and a responsibility of all employees who believe that they have been subjected to unacceptable behaviour to first ask the instigator to stop the unwelcome behaviour.

RE: BANKED OVERTIME
This will confirm our discussions with respect to personal time off needs of employees assigned to "R" type shifts. These employees normally would not work on Statutory Holidays and therefore have limited opportunity to accumulate banked time.
The Company will undertake to modify the Payroll system to accommodate banking of overtime for Bargaining Unit personnel assigned to "R" shifts.
"R" Shift employees will be permitted to accumulate up to fifty-six (56) hours of banked time, inclusive of Banked Statutory Holiday time. This means that for each Statutory Holiday hour banked, one less overtime hour bankable. (If all of the Banked Time is due to Statutory Holidays, then the Collective Agreement provisions apply in full.) Banking of overtime hours will be either two (2) for each hour worked or one (1) banked, one (1) paid for each hour worked. The most cost effective of these will be used in the programming of the payroll system.
Debanking of banked overtime will normally only be permitted provided overtime does not result on that day and provided the supervisor can reschedule the work the person would otherwise do that day. It is intended that best efforts will be made to accommodate the employees request with due regard to the cost effectiveness of the operation.
