LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Pension Plan Exit
During the 1988 round of negotiations, the following agreement was reached between the parties.
The employees of Monarch Fine Foods, members of Local 647 had collectively requested of the Union executive that they be allowed to exit from the Multi-Employer Pension Plan which exists for Local 647 members. The Union executive agreed to negotiate this demand and presented it during the collective bargaining process.
The Company agreed to this based on complete exit of the plan by all members of our bargaining unit.
The Company agrees to pay directly to employees the sum of $12.50 per week which represented the Company’s portion of the premium paid on behalf of each member of the Pension Plan.
Deduction of the employee portion of the premium will cease. These changes will become effective when, following ratification of the amended contract, the Union executive arranges with the Plan Administrator for the completion of the exit procedures required by law in an expeditious manner as can be reasonably expected.
For the purpose of this contract, we will assume the effective date to be October 1, 1988. The exact date will be determined by the Union and the Plan Administrator.

NOTICE
PACKAGING PLANT OVERTIME
The following procedure for obtaining overtime in the Packaging Plant has been agreed between the Company and the Union after study by an Overtime Committee.
Overtime is a most sensitive subject and all parties involved in these discussions acknowledged that there is no system that will be considered best by everyone.
It is most important however that we do adopt a system and it is everyone's interest to make this system work.
In order that you can be easily contacted for overtime, please ensure your current phone number is registered with Packaging Plant Supervision.
There is no change in the system to be adopted for packers except that sample checkers (when applicable) will be placed on the bottom of the packers rota and receive priority for the overtime in their classification.
The agreed system is then as follows:
1.	Vacation positions are first filled by any spare trained persons before an overtime list is consulted.
2.	Overtime lists are formed as follows:
Personnel are listed by classification and shift. When overtime is offered, the appropriate hours are listed against the person's name. New employees are inserted in their place of seniority and new or transferred employees will be charged with the average hours of the list to which they are transferred. (New employees are those who have recently started with the company and successfully completed probation,)
3.	An acceptance, refusal, or failure to contact is counted equally. Persons unavailable due to sickness, leave of absence, compensation, absence, other business or vacation will be counted as if overtime had been offered to them. Overtime will be charged ac— 44 —
cording to number of hours offered. The only exception being Union steward(s) attending negotiations will not be charged overtime hours.
4.	Persons in training for a skilled position or on probation will be eligible for overtime only when their training or probation if fully complete or when all others in their classification have refused.
5.	Overtime is first offered to the people in whose classification the overtime exists.
Example:
"B” Shift overtime is first offered to classified “A” Shift then classified "C" Shift.
“A” Shift overtime is first offered to classified "C" Shift then classified "B" Shift.
"C” Shift overtime is first offered to classified “B” Shift then classified “A” Shift.
6.	Once the list of classified persons has been exhausted as above, then qualified persons are offered the overtime. In this case, overtime will be offered by going to the person with lowest hours in Craft Group I.
7.	Overtime hours worked/offered are to be accumulated daily.
8.	On a weekly basis, a copy of the overtime sheets will be publicly posted.
