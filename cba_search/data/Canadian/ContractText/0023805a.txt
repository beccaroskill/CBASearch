4.	Pension Benefit
The amount of annual pension benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age, or age 55 with 30 years' service, is the sum of the following:
(a)	For each year of recognized service prior to December 31, 1971, one (1) percent of the average earnings received by a member during the five calendar years in which the member's earnings were the greatest.
(b)	For each year of recognized service from January 1, 1972, 0.9% of the member's average earnings received during the five calendar years in which the member's earnings were the greatest, plus an additional 0.6% of any portion of the same average earnings over the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) under the Canada Pension Plan in the year prior to that in which the member retires.
