ARTICLE 1 - GENERAL PURPOSE
1.0! The parties are agreed that the general purpose of this Agreement is to promote the mutual interests of the Company and its employees; to provide for the operation of the plant under methods which will further to the fullest extent possible the safety and welfare of the employees, economy and efficiency of operations and quantity of output, cleanliness of plant; to provide orderly collective bargaining relations between the Company and the Union; to secure prompt and equitable disposition of grievances; and to maintain mutually satisfactory hours, wages and working conditions for the employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2 - RECOGNITION AND COVERAGE
2.01	During the life of this Agreement, the Union shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of this Company, save and except foremen, shift bosses, persons above the rank of foremen or shift bosses, office staff, technical staff, engineering department staff, head assayer and students temporarily employed for school vacation periods.
Should the Company expand its present Macassa Division gold mining operations, all the employees of the Company covered by the certification shall be covered and governed by the present collective agreement and the Union shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining agency for those employees.
2.02	The word “employee” or “employees” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean employees of the Company as defined in the certification mentioned above. Wherever the masculine gender appears in this agreement, it shall also mean the feminine gender, unless the context requires otherwise.
2.03	Non Bargaining unit employees will not do work normally performed by a member of the bargaining unit, except in the case of safety training, emergency cases, when the safety of the em-ployee(s) or the security of the Company property is involved and in the case of demonstration to the employees. However, in a case when a skip/cagetender fails to report for work and a replacement cannot be found from the men at work, this shall be considered as an emergency and the supervisor shall then do whatever is necessary to assure that the work is performed. This would not apply in the event qualified people are not available for work. Also this would not apply where assignment is given to a workman, provided that a member of the bargaining unit is not deprived of overtime.

This clause is not intended to prohibit supervisors from aiding bargaining unit employees on “spur of the moment incidents.”
Examples are: re-railing cars or locos; handing tools to employees; where a heavy lift or push is required; where a bargaining unit employee mutually agrees to a short break, etc.

— 11 —
physical fitness of the employee to perform the available job in an efficient manner.
b)	In any case of reduction in force (other than a temporary layoff due to unforeseen circumstances to a maximum of sixty (60) days duration), the employee with the lesser or least departmental seniority shall be the first to be transferred, demoted or laid off.

8.03	The departments shall be as follows:
a)	Underground
b)	Mill and Assay
c)	Mechanical and Electrical
d)	General Surface & Dredging

8.06	Application of Plant Seniority - In all cases where employees are laid off due to lack of work,
- 12 -
plant seniority shall be the deciding factor provided the employee or employees are qualified to do the work which is available.
8.07	Application of Departmental Seniority - In all cases of posting to fill a vacancy other than promotions of a temporary nature (14 days or less) departmental seniority shall apply providing the employee affected has the necessary qualifications to fill the vacancy.
8.08	Job Posting - The Company shall post notice on the special bulletin boards Plant-wide stating the location, job description, rate of pay and qualification of the job. At the same time, a copy will be sent to the Union. The notice shall be posted for five (5) working days. The senior man applying for the job will receive the appointment within three (3) days provided he can fulfil the normal requirements of the job.
The Company may fill the vacancy temporarily while the notice is posted pending the filling of the vacancy permanently. If no suitable employee is found available as a result of job posting, the Company may fill the vacancy with a new employee, who will meet the posted job qualifications and requirements.
When an employee has accepted a posted job, he shall not again apply for a period of two (2) months. This does not apply to Line of Progression Jobs.
a)	A vacancy to be filled from a posting exists when a man leaves a job for any reason and a replacement is required on a permanent basis, or a new job is created. The hiring of additional underground labourers at the minimum rate is not considered a vacancy.
b)	The Company does not have to post a new stope, drift or raise, but preference will be given to men within these classifications not currently working in their classification. However, the Company will post notice
- 13 -
prior to starting new stopes, and/or the selection of new drift crews.

d)	The location of the vacancy, if a stope, including level and stope number, will be shown on the posting.
e)	Each job vacancy shall be posted separately.
f)	Where a line of progression exists only the bottom job in the line need be posted.
g)	Job posting application forms shall be made available by the Company and will be completed and signed by the employee applying for the posted vacancy. A copy of the posting will be given to the employee upon request.
h)	When an employee has been accepted in conjunction with the job posting, he shall be given the posted job without any undue delay (meaning within 1 to 5 days), providing the vacancy still exists. The Company will inform the Union by mail of the successful applicant’s name. The job vacancy created by the posting shall be posted immediately (unless in the case of line of progression or the job becomes redundant) in accordance with this section.
In few job classifications, a delay may be necessary in order to obtain a replacement for the newly created job vacancy.
i)	Where an employee is off work due to illness or vacation, his name may be posted in absentia providing the employee is capable of filling the job in a reasonable time (maximum 8 weeks).
j)	Where a job vacancy occurs which is suitable for an employee who is unable through
- 14 -
injury or illness or advancing years to perform his normal duties, job posting will be waived providing both Company and Union agree.
k)	Fulfil the normal requirements of the job means the ability to perform the requirements of the job following an appropriate familiarization period.
In the event an employee is unable or cannot satisfactorily perform the job, he shall be returned to his former position and any other employee who has been promoted or transferred because of the rearrangement of positions, shall also be returned to his former position.
l)	Employees who accept job posting for surface labour or mill labour will receive helper’s rate.
m)	Limited jobs are jobs of 75 days duration or longer. They shall be posted for vacancies where a replacement is required. These jobs are open to employees qualified to fill the vacancy. The posting shall state that the job is limited, and shall indicate the estimated duration of the job. Upon termination of a limited job, the employee filling the vacancy shall be returned to his classification and job location (if it still exists) in which he last worked which was not a limited job. If a permanent job vacancy is posted, such employee holding the limited job will be allowed to bid on the new posting. If the employee in the limited job is successful in his bid for a permanent job posting, the Company will complete the temporary job from employees in the department. The parties agree that the employee who accepts a limited job will not create more than one (1) vacancy.
n)	In the case of a known temporary vacancy (more than 4 days, and less than 75 days) due to vacation, sickness or injury, etc., the senior employee not working in his present classification will be given preference providing the
15
employee affected has the necessary qualifications to fill the vacancy. These temporary vacancies (of more than 4 days and less than 75 days duration) shall be filled from the shifter’s or captain’s work area where the vacancy occurs before approaching men from a different beat.
8.09	Temporary Transfers - If an employee is temporarily transferred, he shall receive the rate for the job or his regular rate, whichever is the greater.
a)	During the period of October 1st to April 30th, Underground employees shall be given a 24 hour advance notice of transfer to Surface job.
8.10	A newly hired employee shall be considered on probation and shall have no seniority rights during the first forty-five (45) shifts worked, during which time he shall be subject to transfer, demotion, layoff, dismissal, or discharge at the Company’s discretion. After completion of such probationary period, seniority shall date back from the first day of hire.
The Company and the Union will meet and agree in each instance prior to the hiring of temporary employees who are to be employed to perform bargaining unit work where there are vacancies due to:
1.	A temporary excess of work.
2,	Extended absence due to illness or injury.
3,	Difficulty in obtaining suitable candidates to fill permanent vacancies.
4.	Leaves of absence.
Such employment shall not exceed three (3) months in each case except as extended by mutual written agreement, The only exception to this is the effluent treatment plant where temporary employees will be hired for up to four (4) months.
A temporary employee shall have no rights under the agreement (other than the right to require payment of the applicable rate of the job to which assigned) and the Company shall be free to discharge such a person at anytime it sees fit.

The list will be corrected and brought up to date every six (6) months. An employee may make a complaint as to the correctness of his seniority to his supervisor and/or to the Main Office. When the seniority lists are posted, three (3) of the same, will be mailed to the Union.
8.14	Employees laid off due to a curtailment of operations shall be called back in the inverse order to that in which they have been laid off provided each employee has the qualifications to do the job which is available. When recalling employees who
- 17 -
retain their seniority, the Company will notify the employee by registered mail stating the job which is available and the time of starting which shall not be less than twenty (20) days from the date of mailing of the letter. At the same time, a copy of the letter in question would be mailed to the Union. The notice will be sent to the last address of the employee on record with the Company. Failure to notify the Company in writing within five (5) days if possible following the mailing of such notice by the Company that the employee will report for work at the time specified, or having so notified the Company, failure to report at the time stated on the notice, shall be considered as termination of employment.

- 18 -
paid leave(s) of absence. Any request for leave of absence for Union business must be submitted in writing to the Mine Manager one
(1)	week in advance of such leave.
e)	Any employee who absents himself from work without first obtaining permission from the Company or without sufficient reason such as proven sickness or accident shall be subject to discipline, demotion or discharge by the Company.
f)	Any leave of absence shall be in writing and no such leave shall affect any employee’s seniority rights when used for the purpose granted.
g)	If an employee works for some other Company or person while on leave of absence, unless by written pre-arrangement with the Company, he shall be subject to discipline or discharge.
h)	An employee who has been away on account of sickness or for other reasons will give the Company one day’s notice of his return to work.

An employee who finds he is unable to report for work because of sickness or other reasons will notify the Company. The Company recognizes that there may be times when personal contact between the employee and his supervisor is not possible prior to the start of his shift.

1. No. 2 Winze/Shaft Crews:
In an effort to develop and maintain safe, efficient and reliable crews (not missing shifts) and in order to further promote safety at the Mine, those crews will be required to look after the Housekeeping on the stations. Accordingly, all regular, normally scheduled crews at the No. 2 Winze will receive the following Company Time Bonus, as follows:
However, the Company Time Bonus, is subject to obtaining our objectives as per the aforementioned. Should the Company decide to resume production at No. 2 Winze, the above rates shall be renegotiated to properly reflect the work being done.

47
sary and providing that a majority of the employees involved wanted a change back to the 1/2 hour earlier starting time of 6:50 a.m. (now 7:20 a.m.) then we could consider the change for the summer months of June, July and August.

SCHEDULE “I”
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
October 20th, 1992 RE: 12 Hour Workday On December 1st, 1980, at our Union-Management meeting the employees made a formal request for beginning a 12 hour workday. The people affected with the 12 hour day are the ball mill and solution operators who normally work an 8 hour shift on around the clock basis - seven day week operation (operators and alternates).
Terms:
The basic understanding of entering into this agreement is that the 12 hour workday does not cost the Company any more that it would under the normal 8 hour arrangement and also that the employees would earn no less than they would under the 8 hour workday.
Since both Company and Employees agree, then additional language will not be necessary, if questions should arise concerning work schedules, overtime, vacations, etc. all questions would be answered by referring to our Collective Agreement and applying the basic understanding.
- 53 -
(8.16)	Eligibility for bereavement pay would be on the basis of 12 hours for each scheduled day of work while on bereavement leave, but in no event more than the amount that they would have been eligible for under the 8 hour provision for the duration of the bereavement leave.
(8.17)	Jury duty for those employees called to serve as a juror or crown witness (witness for the state) would be paid for all hours lost from scheduled work, less any amounts that they received from the court for their appearance.
(9.02)	Floating holidays will be based on actual hours, example 3 floaters on 8 hour day would represent 2 floaters on 12 hour day.
(9.03)	& (11.05) Holiday premium would be paid at the rate of time and one half for all hours worked except for Christmas, Boxing Day, and New Year’s where the holiday premium would be paid at two times the hourly rate for all hours worked.
(9.04)	A holiday not worked but which the employee was entitled to holiday allowance would be paid at 8 times the employee’s normal hourly rate. (9.07) & (11.04) & (11.05) The work schedule, a copy of which is attached, provides for an average of 42 hours of work per week in a four week scheduling cycle. Our labour agreement provides for overtime to be paid after 40 hours in a work week or 8 hours in a workday.
Our arrangement with the 12 hour workday is that the employees will be paid the premium rate for work in excess of 12 hours in a scheduled workday and for work in excess of 36 hours in a work week in which they are scheduled to work 36 hours and in excess of 44 hours in a work week in which they are scheduled to work 48 hours.
It is agreed that an employee would not be required to work more than 16 consecutive hours before being excused to go home.
54
Replacement coverage, when required, will be selected in the following manner:
a)	An available employee who is on the same shift.
b)	An employee in the same classification on days off.
c)	Any other employee on their days off.
The foregoing arrangement is subject to withdrawal or cancellation by either the Union or the Company following a 30 day notice to the other party.
