DEAR MR. CLEMMER,
RE; INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
CURRENT AND FUTURE TRENDS IN MANUFACTURING HAVE REQUIRED INDIVIDUAL WORKERS TO TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY AND BE MORE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR TEE PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPLEX TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, MORE HIGHLY AUTOMATED PROCESSES, INTRICATE PROBLEM SOLVING METHODS AND SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION CONCEPTS, NECESSITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX NEW SKILLS BY THE WORKFORCE THROUGH RETRAINING.
AS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, BOTH PARTIES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO THE WORKFORCE WHILE ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY SKILLS TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES. WITH THIS OBJECTIVE IN MIND, IT IS AGREED THAT:
(A)	THE'UNION WILL BE NOTIFIED (AT THE TIME OF PROJECT APPROVAL) WHEN THE INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE WORKFORCE EITHER BECAUSE OF REDUCTION IN JOBS OR WHERE NEW SKILLS WILL NEED TO BE ACQUIRED.
(B)	WHERE THE SUCCESS OF A CHANGE TO EQUIPMENT, OPERATION,
OR PROCEDURE IS DEPENDENT UPON THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYEE, RETRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED.
(C)	IF IT IS REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL TO DO SO, THE COMPANY WILL REDUCE THE WORKFORCE THROUGH ATTRITION WHEN A TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE NECESSITATES A'REDUCTION IN THE WORKFORCE .
