Section 8.	(a) In cases of increases in the
working forces, rehiring shall be in reverse order

(b)	In case of layoff, other than in the event of emergencies herein referred to, employees shall be given one (1) working day’s notice for every completed six (6) months seniority, with a minimum notice of two (2) working days. In the case of an emergency due to causes beyond the Company’s control which results in the closing of a part or whole of the plant, employees shall be given one (1) calendar day’s notice for every completed six (6) months’ seniority with a maximum notice of five (5) working days’ notice and with a minimum notice of two (2) working days, but such two (2) days shall be exclusive of Saturday and Sunday. If the Company determines that additional work, not to exceed three (3) days is available at the time any layoff is to become effective, then the notice shall be deemed to be extended for the period represented by such additional days of work.
(c)	Employees with seniority may be temporarily recalled for ten (10) working days or less, as casual help with no layoff notice given, provided that this shall not be used as discrimination
20
to any employee, and provided that the employees and the Union are informed that such work is of a temporary nature.

February 15, 1985 - 2 week's vacation, with pay based on four percent (4%) of gross earnings between February 15,1984 and December31,1984. Time must be taken prior to December 31, 1985.
January 1, 1986 - 2 weeks paid vacation or four percent (4%) of gross earnings for the calendar year 1985, whichever is greater. Time must be taken between January 1, 1986 and December 31, 1986.
January 1, 1987 - 2 weeks paid vacation or four percent (4%) of gross earnings for the calendar year 1986, whichever is greater. Time must be taken between January I, 1987 and December 31, 1987.

Examples of Vacation Entitlements Present Employee
Date of hire ■ June 1, 1980
January 1, 1985 • 3 weeks vacation, with pay calculated at six percent (6%)of gross earnings between June 1, 1984 and December 31, 1984. Time must be taken between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1985.

ARTICLE XI - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Should differences arise between the Union or its employee members and the Company as to the manner and application of the provisions of this Agreement, the Union will not authorize, promote, direct, condone or encourage any strike, stoppage or suspension of work, any slowdown or other restriction of production, or interference with work in or about the Company’s plant or premises, nor will employees take part in any such action.
The Company agrees not to lock out employees during the term of this Agreement. An earnest effort will be made to settle all matters promptly in the following manner.
When an employee is suspended, dismissed, or given written discipline the Company shall have a Union representative present at the time of such action.
Sectionl. Shop Stewards may initiate discussions with the supervisors on any potential grievances within their departments. If this action does not solve the matter, a representative of the Union will be allowed to further investigate. In the event that either the Union Steward or a
27
Union representative must leave his job or department in connection with the matter, he shall first notify his supervisor as to what department he is going to and give an explanation why he is going.

Section 2. Step 1. The employee shall first take the question up with his department steward and his department supervisor at the same time.

Section 4. Step 3. In the event that no conclusion is reached in the two (2) preceding steps, a meeting shall be scheduled between the Grievance Committee and the Company. An outside Union representative may attend this meeting. Also, the aggrieved employee may attend to present his evidence.
Section 5. All grievances after Step 1 shall be in writing, and when a settlement is reached it shall be final and binding and signed by both parties.
Section 6. If an employee is dismissed for any reason and feels that he has been unjustly dismissed, he shall within three (^working days from receipt of notice of dismissal, notify the Grievance Committee. The Grievance Com-
28
mittee will in turn notify the Company on the same day they receive such notice from the employee.
The dismissal in question then shall constitute a grievance and shall be dealt with as such, beginning at the third step.
Section 7. If subsequently it is decided that the employee was unjustly dismissed, he shall be reinstated to his former position and shall be compensated for any benefits or lost time. The rate to he used for lost time is his applicable rate of pay.
Section 8. There shall be time limits of two (2) working days between each step of the grievance procedure, unless changed by mutual agreement.

Section 2. Where the foregoing procedure for the settlement of disputes has been employed, and the dispute remains unsettled, the dispute shall be referred to an Arbitration Committee consisting of three (3) members, one to be appointed by the Union, one by the Company and
29
the third who shall act as Chairman to be mutually agreed upon by the other two. If agreement cannot be reached within one (1) week as to the appointment of a third member, he shall be appointed by the Minister of Labour for the Province of British Columbia.

In reaching its decision the Committee shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement. Decisions rendered shall be final and binding upon all parties concerned. The Company and the Union agree to bear an equal share of expense incurred, if any, by reason of employment of a third member of an Arbitration Committee.

Section 3. There shall be a joint Company-Union safety inspection committee composed of four representatives from the Company and four representatives from the Union who shall meet and carry out inspections once a month. The Company-Union safety inspection com-
30
mittee may recommend to the Superintendent of the plant, improvements in safety conditions and shall be informed of the disposition made of their recommendations.

working or laid off.
Section 2, Employees who accept separation pay under the provisions of this clause shall on doing so terminate their seniority and employment relationship with the Company and shall have no further rights under this Agreement or under any other Agreement between the signing parties.
Section 3. In the event that part of the plant remains open, employees eligible to receive separation allowance may elect to remain onthe seniority list for possible recall.

Section 4. In respect of those employees who are eligible for separation allowance under this Article, the Company will continue to contribute

Letter of Understanding
LONG TERM DISABILITY
Effective June 1, 1983, the Company will arrange to have an insurance carrier provide a Long Term Disability Plan which will include the following provisions:
-	- Full time employees actively at work on the effective date are eligible for the Plan on attainment of one year’s seniority. Employees absent from work on the date they would otherwise have been eligible must return to work and satisfactorily complete two months full-time work to be eligible.
-	- Long Term Disability benefits will be payable where an employee is unable to perform any employment for remuneration or profit solely by reason of total disability through sickness or accident. The sole determination of cases qualifying for benefits will be made by the insurance company based upon continuingmedical evidence of such disability as it considers satisfactory. To qualify, any case involving alcohol or drug related conditions will require active supervision by and continuing treatment from a rehabilitation centre or a provincially designated institution. Any case involving mental illness will require continued treatment under an approved
51
specialist, and will only be paid in cases of severe conditions involving personality disorganization (psychotic conditions).
Any employee in receipt of Long Term Disability benefits will not receive any credited service during the period of time that he received such benefits.
• • The amount of benefit will be $1,100.00 per month for new claims arising after July 1, 1986 less any benefit for which the employeeis eligible under the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan Primary Disability Benefit, Workers’ Compensation or other government or government sponsored plan, excluding any pre-existing disability benefit. The employee will be presumed eligible for such government benefits until satisfactory evidence is presented that his application for them has been denied.
-	- The benefit will commence after the employee has been absent due to the disability for one year or after his sickness and accident pay entitlement has expired, whichever is earlier, and will be payable until recovery, actual retirement date, normal retirement date, or death, whichever comes first.
-	- Should an employee return to work after collecting Long Term Disability benefits and subsequently again cease work as a result of the same or a related disability, the benefit will recommence without a waiting period provided the disability recurred within a year of the employee’s return to work otherwise, the employee will be subject to the normal waiting period before the benefit commences.
52
-	- No benefit will be paid to an employee under the Company’s Sickness and Accident Plan where the employee is entitled to receive benefits under the Long Term Disability Plan and no employee shall receive a benefit under the Long Term Disability Plan while he is receiving benefits under the Company’s Sickness and Accident Plan.
-	- Where an employee returns to work under an approved rehabilitation program of up to 24 months, the benefit will be reduced by 50% of any earnings, provided the total gross income from all sources does not exceed 90% of the pre-disability normal gross wages.
-	- No benefit will be paid for intentionally self-inflicted injuries, or for disabilities arising from a declared or undeclared act of war, participation in a riot or insurrection, employment with another employer, or commission of a felony.
-	- Where an employee is absent from work and receiving Long Term Disability benefits for a period of three consecutive years or longer then as of the end of the third year his seniority and employment with the Company shall be deemed broken and thereafter there shall be no obligation on the part of the Company to rehire him. Notwithstanding the foregoing proviso as to a period of three or more consecutive years, if an employee returns to work after collecting Long Term Disability benefits and if within one year thereafter he again ceases work as the result of the same or a related disability and receives Long Term Disability benefits, then such further period of absence from work while receiving Long Term Disability benefits shall be deemed to be con-
53
secutive with the immediate previous absence and such further period of absence shall be taken into account and added onto the previous absence in determining whether the employee has been absent from work and received Long Term Disability benefits for a period of three consecutive years or longer.

PART-TIME WORKERS
The Company may employ part-time workers, if agreed to by the Union, for work performed on calendar Saturdays or Sundays under the following conditions:
1.	Full time employees with seniority who are on layoff status shallbe called in order of seniority and given the option of working or not at the part-time rate as detailed in (4) below, provided they are qualified to perform the work to be done.
2.	If the company fails to secure workers as indicated in (1) above, they may hire new employees.
3.	The company shall notify the Union prior to any work performed on a calendar Saturday or Sunday by part-time workers, and notify the Union in writing for the reasons therefore.
4.	The rate of pay for part-time workers who perform work on a calendar Saturday or Sunday shall be $9.38 per hour ($9.77 effective April 1, 1987), plus the premium as detailed in Article VII, Section 5 (d).
54
In respect to this memorandum, the Union agrees to co-operate with the Company, provided the conditions hereof are met, and that the request for the Saturday or Sunday work can be reasonably justified.

In the event they wish to work, they have the option to do so at the part-time rate as detailed herein. If the company specifically requests full-time employees to work on weekends, they will be paid the applicable overtime rate.
