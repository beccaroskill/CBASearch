RE:	LOCAL 324 SENIORITY AND DEPARTMENTAL SENIORITY
Effective the date of Certification Local 324 employees will be established in one of the following groups:
1.	Esker Logging ■ Mechanics and Road Construction
2.	Ear Falls Contracting - Mechanics and Road Construction
3.	Ear Falls/Red Lake - Cutting force
4.	Dryden	- Cutting force
5.	Kirouac Contracting - Wood Haul
Kirouac Contracting employees will have their own seniority list and will be protected from bumping from other groups and will have no bumping rights to other groups.
Employees in Mechanical and Road Construction groups will accrue seniority behind all employees presently listed on the Canadian Pacific Forest Products Limited seniority list. New employees will accrue seniority behind these employees.
Bidding
Job openings i n groups 1 to 4 will be posted in all groups and will be filled by the senior qualified bidder.
However, existing employees (date of certification) in each department shall have preference on postings within that department.

No bumping between present cutting force and groups 1 and 2,
New hires can be bumped by any of the groups, subject to Article
12.
Bumping on Layoff
- 44
On temporary layoffs, bumping with qualifications will be applied only when operations continue in other districts for more than one week. This would also apply between Ear Falls and Red Lake.
On permanent layoffs bumping into other groups may commence on the first day of layoff, subject to the bumping clause above.
Departmental Seniority
Seniority will be set up and maintained on a departmental basis. One department will be comprised of all employees engaged in the production of forest products (stump to roadside). Two other departments, one at Ear Falls Contracting and one at Esker Logging, will be comprised of all employees engaged in the construction and maintenance of camp roads, landings and main roads, scarification and mechanical maintenance and repair.
For the purpose of departmental layoffs, any employee posting to a new department will begin to accrue seniority in that department on the date of his transfer.
Should such an employee be bumped or suffer a layoff he may bump to any position for which he is qualified within his original department, given he has the seniority.	Should an employee forfeit his posting
after the trial period, he may return to the junior position within his original department.
The provisions of the Collective Agreement will apply to all matters relating to Seniority that are not dealt with specifically by this document on Local 324 Seniority and Departmental Seniority.

Recognition - Jurisdiction
It will be the Company’s policy not to change the present source of supply of wood fibre for its mills, if by so doing it would deprive employees with seniority from gainful employment with the Company,
If, however, during the term of this agreement dated October 1, 1987 to September 30, 1990, circumstances beyond the control of the Company were to arise and force the Company to alter its supply and affect the employment opportunities for its employees, that volume of supply produced on operations not covered by a Collective Agreement with the Union will be reduced on a proportional basis.
In moving back to former levels of operation, the volume of supply produced on the Company’s Woods operations will be increased at least proportionately to the volume of increase of supply from other sources.
It is understood that purchase wood fibre supply will be limited to 33 1/2% (within one percent) of the total mill wood fibre supply requirements.
