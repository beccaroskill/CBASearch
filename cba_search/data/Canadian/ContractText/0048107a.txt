TIME LOST DUE TO STORMY WEATHER:
In cases of severe bad weather (e,g, snow storms) which prevent employees generally from getting to work on time or at all,
C.A.'s policy is to pay only for time worked.
2. a) However, a "grace period!! of two hours will be allowed so that employees who arrive at work within two hours of their normal starting time will suffer no loss in pay.
b)	The "grace period" will only apply where the General Manager, in the case of Moncton operations, or the management person in charge at a location outside Moncton, rules that the storm did, in fact, constitute "severe bad weather".
c)	Such ruling will be made by the end of the first day after returning to normal operations and the manager making the ruling will be guided by the degree of absenteeism in the C.A. operation (s) during the storm and the observed severity of the storm.
3. a) None of the foregoing will apply where an employee was notified at least one-half hour before his/her normal starting time not to come to work.
b)	Such notification may be by way of a general announcement over the local radio station or by a telephone call or personal visit to the employee’s place of residence.
c)	It will be the responsibility of each employee, in times of stormy weather, to monitor the appropriate radio broadcasts and to see that he/she or some other adult is available to receive a message at his/her place of residence.
4.	Failing such notice any employee who shows up for work will be paid for a minimum of four hours (including any "grace period" whether or not there is work available.
5.	a) Where weather conditions deteriorate after commencement of
the work day (or shift) and management decides to shut down the operation employees then at work will be paid to normal quitting time or two hours beyond actual punching out time, whichever is less.
b) However, no employee shall receive more than two hours pay for time not worked in any one day except as necessary to meet the minimum reporting pay requirements.
6.	a) Any employee who requests permission to leave early in the
face of deteriorating weather conditions shall not be unreasonably denied such permission.
b) However, he/she shall be paid only for time worked unless the operation is subsequently shut down, in which case he/she will be entitled to the same "grace period" as any other employee in that section receives for that day.
