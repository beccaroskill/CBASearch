APPENDIX - B - WEEKLY INDEMNITY PLAN
AMOUNT OE DTSARTT.TTY BENEFITS:
--------------------3---------
The amount of 'disability benefit shall be 70% of an employee's wage up to the maximum as detailed in the Collective Agreement immediately preceding the date of disability.
DESCRIPTION OF PLAN:
The plan will be for a period of fifty-two (52) weeks payable on the first day of disability resulting from a non-occupational accident and after three (3) continuous working days from the commencement of disability due to a sickness. For twelve (12) hour shift workers, the waiting period remains three (3) days, but in no case shall an employee lose more than twenty-four (24) hours of pay. Where sickness causes an employee to be hospitalized, benefits will be paid from the first day of such disability. Weekly indemnity payments shall be paid every two weeks.
ELGIBILITY OF PAYMENT:
In order to be eligible for weekly indemnity payments an employee must be actively employed by the Company at the onset of the disability and must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician. In cases of disability due to mental illness, certification of said illness and disability must be by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. Also the employee must notify the Company immediately of his/her disability and ensure that the proper forms are completed by his/her physician and promptly returned to the Company. Benefits under this plan shall not pay in the event the absence is a result of:
a)	Any injury arising out of or sustained while doing any act or thing pertaining to any occupation or
employment for renumeration or profit, or
b)	during normal maternity leave, or
c)	self-destruction or any self-inflicted injury, while sane or insane, or
d)	any injury or illness resulting from insurrection
or war, whether war be declared or not, or from

Benefits under this plan will not be payable following the normal retirement date or early retirement date of an employee, if early retirement was approved prior the onset of disability.
DISPUTED W.C.B. CLAIM:
If an employee covered by the W.I. Plan suffers a disability for which payment is in dispute with the W.C.B., W.I. payment will be made retroactively if requested by the employee and provided he has been off work for at least one month due to the disability without W.C.B. having accepted the claim and provided the employee is subject to the rules and regulations covering the W.I. plan for a period of ninety (90) days. However if the dispute is caused by an error or appeal on the employer's part, the employee would be eligible for W.I. payments for up to fifty-two (52) weeks. In these cases in order to verify if the dispute is caused by the Company, a copy of the Form #7 will be shown to a member of the Union Committee. Before any payment is issued the employee will have signed all forms or waivers required by the Company.
If the dispute is over a claim that involves a previous employer the Company will have to be satisfied that the employee is actively pursuing his W.C.B. claim to be eligible to the above.
If the W.C.B. claim is subsequently established, the employee will then repay the W.I. payment (s) received to the appropriate fund or insurance company.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The Company and/or insurer reserves the right to require periodic physical examination throughout the duration of the employee's absence due to disability. Such examinations shall be conducted by a physician designated by the Company and/or insurer.

APPENDIX F - EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE (BONUS) SYSTEM INTRODUCTION
This system has been developed between the Company and the Canadian Paperworkers' Union Local 37 in order to permit all of the employees to participate in the growth of the Company and to consistently remind each employee of the importance of his or her individual efforts in the general profitability of the Company. This system of participation or bonus permits the firm to renumerate its employees at a rate that is consistent to and compatible with its ability to pay its people according to its potential profits.
It is of upmost importance that each and every employee realize that their individual and collective endeavours in maintaining minimal cost and maximum quantity and -quality of production will result in ensured future employment and a higher pay.
The rules and regulations of this bonus plan have been developed by the joint committee in order to ensure that the administration of the plan is consistent and fair and equitable. However, as the system develops, changes and modifications may be made by the joint-committee in order to maintain the objectives.
INCENTIVE SYSTEM AND DESIGN AND RULES AND REGULATIONS
MEASUREMENT AND CALCULATION OF PRODUCTION:
All of the products manufactured at Waferboard Corporation Ltd. are measured in number of square feet per thickness and all production calculations are converted to a common thickness for each production line in the plant. Production on the waferboard line is calculated in 5/16 of an inch thickness equivalent. Production on the high density particleboard and the thinboard lines is calculated in 3/4 of an inch thickness equivalent.
AVERAGE PRODUCTION PER SHIFT FOR THE MONTH:
BY measuring the total number of square feet produced on each line during a calendar month and dividing that figure by the number of scheduled production shifts for the month the figure of average production per shift is arrived at.
Production shifts are scheduled in advance and are all shifts during which we plan and intend to produce. The number of scheduled shifts per calendar month may vary due to variation in scheduled maintenance shifts and plant shutdowns. Maintenance shifts are not counted as production shifts and any products manufactured during a
produced will be deducted at 100%.
For the high density particleboard line only the prime board at the press will be calculated and any downgraded material will not be counted in the production figures. On the thinboard line two types of particleboard are produced, fibre face and thinboard and different low quality deductions are used for both products. With fibre face all #2 material will be calculated at 70% and any other low quality material is deducted at 100%. With thinboard all #2 board production will be calculated at 70%,	#3 will be calculated at 50% and any #4 material
produced will be deducted at 100%.
ELTGTBTLTTY FOR PARTTCTPATTON TN PLAN:
Also excluded from participation in the incentive system are those employees who have not yet completed their 45 day probationary period.
All other employees, from the Plant Manager to the labourers are included in the system and will participate in the method outlined in Division of Money Amongst Employees.
CALCULATTON OF TOTAL PRODUCTTON FOR PLAN:
Measurement and tabulation of production for each line will be maintained during the course of each calendar month. All employees will be kept informed of the production by shift and of the accumulated production during the month.
At the end of the period the total production for the month is converted to the amount of production for bonus purposes. This is done by recalculating the downgrade production as previously explained. Tn calculating the amount of low quality material produced during the period the figures on downgrade material maintained in the plant will be used, but on a regular basis these figures in low quality material will be compared to our sales department figures and any necessary adjustments made.
The base line is then multiplied by the number of scheduled production shifts and this figure is compared to the amount of production for bonus puproses. Any differences +/- between these two figures is then multiplied by the amount of money per thousand square feet allocated for the bonus system. These calculations are done for each production line. Then the amount of money + /- for each production line is added together to form a total amount payable.
maintenance shift will be added to the total monthly production.
Exclusions for any part of a production shift from this calculation for testing of new products or other reasons will be determined by the joint administration committee.
BASE LINES OR ROLL-IN OF INCENTIVE SYSTEM:
A base line, which is considered to be the minimal acceptable average production per shift, has been developed for each production line. Any production over and above the base line is- production on which a value in dollars will be placed and the total amount of money will be divided amongst the employees.
The base lines for the waferboard production line are 87,000 square feet when producing 7/16" and 78,900 square feet when producing 1/4" average production per shift for the month calculated in 5/16" equivalent.
The base line for the high density particleboard line is 3,000 square feet in 3/4" equivalent average production per shift for the month.
The base line for the thinboard line is 26,248 square feet in 3/4" equivalent average production per shift for the month.
These base lines can be expressed in many ways and in shop language could be expressed as approximately 81 press loads 7/16" waferboard, 47 press loads of 3/4" high density particleboard, 82 press loads of 5/8" fibre face on the thinboard line average shift production.
DEDUCTIONS FOR LOW QUALITY MATERIAL:
Low quality material, which is commonly expressed as number 2, number 3, or number 4, is sometimes produced on the production lines. It is obvious that this low quality material is not sold at the same price as the number 1 products, but costs the Company the same amount of money to produce. Therefore any manufacturing of low quality material impedes the profitability of the plant and reduces the firm's ability to pay its employees. Therefore deductions for low quality are a necessary part ot the incentive system.
It was previously explained in the Measurement and Calculation section that production is measured in square feet per thickness. The simplest way to calculate the deductions for low quality material is to calculate the different grades, #2, #3, and #4 at a percentage of the real measurement. These percentages reflect the value of the low quality boards as compared to #1 board.
For the waferboard line all #2 board production will be calculated at 85% of the real measuement on a deduction of 15%. All #3 board production will be calculated at 50% of the real measurement on a 50% deduction. Any #4 board
ALLOCATION OF MONEY FOR INCENTIVE SYSTEM:
The amount of square feet of material as arrived at above will be multiplied by fifteen dollars ($15.00) per thousand feet and by an adjustment factor of $1.53 for the thinboard line. The total amount of money is then divided amongst the employees.
DIVISION OF MONEY AMONGST EMPLOYEES:
All hours worked by eligible employees, as previously outlined, during the calendar month will be added together to form a total number of hours worked. Any hours worked by employees at a premium rate (overtime) will be calculated as one hour (not as one and a half or two hours). For the purpose of calculating hours for staff employees, 4,000 hours per month shall be used.
The total amount of money to be paid out for the period will be divided by the total number of hours worked during the period equaling an amount of money per hour. This amount of money or rate per hour will be mutliplied by the number of hours worked during the period by each individual resulting in the amount of money to be paid to each employee for the month.
PAYMENT OF CAPTIAL EXPENDITURES:
The amount of money to be paid to each employee, the calculated hourly rate times number of hours worked, will be done so by a separated payroll check to be issued not later than the 15th day of the month following, provided that the joint administration committee has furnished the payroll department with the calculations within a reasonable time.
EFFECT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES:
The base lines detailed in this plan shall remain fixed except; in cases where a capital expenditure of the value of $10,000.00 or over, or a process change made by the Company that increases or potentially increases the minimal acceptable average production per shift. In these cases the base lines or roll in of the incentive system shall be increased by 80% of the increase in production of the respective production line.
The only exception to this rule is the construction and installation of the proposed storage bin between the debarker and chipper.
JOINT ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND REVISION OF PLAN:
The joint administration committee comprised of three employees appointed by the Union, three members of the plant management team and an appointed Chairman are responsible for the incentive system plan. This responsibility encompasses the authority to develop and modify rules and regulations, calculating and verifying all data, revising production and downgrade figures, validation of hours to be calculated in the bonus system, etc.
This document has been developed by the joint administration committee as a guideline to the management of the plan and will be reviewed and revised as time progresses.
