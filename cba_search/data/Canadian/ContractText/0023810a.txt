Skilled Trades Maintenance overtime occurring underground and on surface shall be distributed by classification among the employees normally performing the work to be done pursuant to Article 7. This provision shall not preclude the temporary assignment of duties in one area to employees normally working in the other area.
A Skilled Trades employee in the Maintenance Department will not be eligible, nor will the employee be charged for an overtime assignment, which by working, would make the employee ineligible to work his/her regular shift or previously scheduled overtime shift, except where no other employee is available to work the assignment.
Where a breakdown has occurred causing a stoppage or reduction of production hoisting operations or boatloading, the Maintenance persons performing that repair may remain on the job after normal shift change to a maximum of two (2) hours regardless of their credited overtime until the succeeding shift has arrived on that job.
When weekend Skilled Trades overtime shifts are scheduled prior to 12:01 A.M. Thursday and subsequently other Skilled Trades overtime is required, employees may be selected from those not previously scheduled.
Employees who are absent from work for any reason after 12:01 a.m. Thursday will be considered to have worked until the end of their last regularly scheduled shift for the purposes of determining overtime eligibility.
Employees transferring to Skilled or Non-Skilled Trades classifications in the Maintenance Department shall assume the highest plus one overtime hours in their destination.
If such a transfer was not made through a permanent job posting, upon return to his/her original department, the employee’s overtime record shall be adjusted to reflect only the overtime hours worked or charged in the other department in addition to the overtime hours he/she had at the time of the transfer.
New Skilled Trades employees hired into the Maintenance Department, shall assume the overtime hours of the highest credited overtime employee in the classification, plus one (1).

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 41
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT
The Union and the Company recognize the issues related to sexual and racial harassment in the workplace and are committed to ending it. Harassment is not a joke. It is cruel and destructive behavior against others that can have devastating effects.
It is an expression of perceived power and superiority by the harasser(s) over another person, usually for reasons over which the victim has little or no control: race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, record of offences, marital status, same-sex partnership status, family status or disability.
Harassment on any of these grounds can be made the basis of a complaint to most provincial and federal human rights commissions.
Harassment can be defined as any unwelcome action by any person, whether verbal or physical, on a single or repeated basis, which humiliates, insults or degrades.
“Unwelcome” or “unwanted” in this context means any actions which the harasser knows or ought to know are not desired by the victim of the harassment.
Sexual harassment is any unwanted attention of a sexual nature such as remarks about appearance or personal life, offensive written or visual actions like graffiti or degrading pictures, physical contact of any kind, or sexual demands.
Racial harassment is any action, whether verbal or physical that expresses or promotes racial hatred in the workplace such as racial slurs, written or visually offensive actions, jokes or other unwanted comments or acts.
The experience of harassment can be overwhelming for the victim. People often react with shock, humiliation and intense anger. Therefore, the victim of harassment may not always feel comfortable going through the normal channels for resolving such a problem.
Because of the sensitive personal natures of harassment complaints, especially racial and sexual harassment, the victims may prefer initially to seek other assistance. This could be by any local Union elected person or official. This person could assist the harassment victim in bringing the incident(s) to the attention of the local Union leadership.
The local Union president and the unit chairperson must contact the CAW national representative, and if necessary, they will meet with a senior Company representative(s) to carry out an investigation. The issue must be handled with confidentiality, and is to be resolved expeditiously. The investigation will be conducted with Union involvement in accordance with the Company’s Respect In The Workplace Policy.
Where an investigation determines that harassment has occurred, any resolution of such a harassment complaint must reflect the serious nature of such acts and send a clear signal that they will not be tolerated.
106
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 42
OVERTIME DISPARITY
Within 60 days following ratification of the collective agreement, and at 90 day intervals thereafter as necessary, the Company and the Union will meet to discuss the issue of disparity in overtime hours among employees within certain Skilled Trades classifications with the objective of identifying the cause(s) of these issues and solutions to same.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 43
SURFACE MAINTENANCE OUTSIDE STACKER
Any work involving maintenance or repair of the Outside Stacker will be performed by two (2) Surface Maintenance Skilled Trades employees. In some instances a Maintenance Skilled Trades employee may be accompanied by a supervisor or a nonskilled Maintenance Department employee.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 44
PAY CONTINUANCE
The Company will pay the members of the Union for unpaid union business from work for business arising out of the collective agreement that is not covered elsewhere in the agreement or for business related to duties associated with the Executive of Local 1959. The Company will then submit a bill to Local 1959 for timely reimbursement of any monies paid as described herein.

4.	Pension Benefit
The amount of annual pension benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age, or age 55 with 30 years' service, is the sum of the following:
(a)	For each year of recognized service prior to December 31, 1971, one (1) percent of the average earnings received by a member during the five calendar years in which the member's earnings were the greatest.
(b)	For each year of recognized service from January 1, 1972, 1 % of the member's average earnings received during the five calendar years in which the member's earnings were the greatest, plus an additional 0.6% of any portion of the same average earnings over the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) under the Canada Pension Plan in the year prior to that in which the member retires.
5.	Vested Pension
An employee who has completed two years of service with the Company on or after January 1, 1987 acquires a Vested Interest of 100% in the pension plan.
Before January 1, 1987 Minimum Vesting of 5% occurs after six years of recognized service, progressing at the rate of 5% for each additional year of recognized service when the employee acquires 50% vesting. Vesting then continues at a rate of 10% per year until the 20th year of recognized service when full vesting takes place.
Where applicable Provincial Government Pension legislation is in excess of the Company rules governing vesting, the Government legislation will prevail.
Where the vested monthly pension payable at age 65 is less than $25.00 per month, the employee will usually receive a lump sum settlement, calculated on an actuarially equivalent basis, payable twelve months after the date of termination.
Vested interest is finalized twelve months after termination of employment. In the event the employee returns to regular employment with the Company within his twelve month period, vesting is cancelled but he is reinstated in the Plan with accumulated pension credits.

-	used to purchase a deferred life annuity from an insurance company.
7.	Pension Payments
Pension payments commence on the actual retirement date. Payments continue for the lifetime of the employee. Should an employee die during the five years following commencement of the pension, pension payments will

In the event of the death of a member who is fifty-five (55) years of age or older prior to the commencement of his/her pension, the spouse of such member will be entitled to receive the pension benefits he/she would have received had the member retired on the date of death, with such benefits calculated on earnings and service through that date and with no early retirement reduction.
11.	Pension Options
