LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
RE: TPM Activities
As an integral component of our TPM initiatives, management employees are required to undertake Autonomous Maintenance activities on a selected "pilot" line within the Packaging Plant.
These activities will be confined to the one (1) pilot line as selected by the Steering Committee. Activities will not involve actual operation of the line for production purposes.
The purpose of these activities is to facilitate practical learning and understanding of TPM principles as well as barriers to TPM implementation for the Management team. This practice is consistent with fundamental TPM philosophies to reinforce theoretical principles with practical experience.
Activities will be focused on A.M. Steps 1 to 3. They will begin on the first month following ratification and will finish upon the completion of Step 3, 9 months from the starting date.
Step 3 includes operators performing tentative standards for cleaning, inspection and minor lubrication.
Major lubrication activities remain the responsibility of the Maintenance Department.
At no time will the presence of management employees in these activities result in a reduction of the normal crewing of hourly employees.

NOTICE
PACKAGING PLANT OVERTIME
The following procedure for obtaining overtime in the Packaging Plant has been agreed between the Employer and the Union after study by an Overtime Committee.
Overtime is a most sensitive subject and all parties involved in these discussions acknowledged that there is no system that will be considered best by everyone.
It is most important however that we do adopt a system and it is everyone's interest to make this system work.
In order that you can be easily contacted for overtime, please ensure your current phone number is registered with Packaging Plant Supervision.
There is no change in the system to be adopted for packers except that sample checkers (when applicable) will be placed on the bottom of the packers rota and receive priority for the overtime in their classification.
The agreed system is then as follows:
1, Vacation positions are first filled by any spare trained persons before an overtime list is consulted.
2 , Overtime lists are formed as follows:
Personnel are listed by classification and shift. When overtime is offered, the appropriate hours are listed against the person’s name. New employees are inserted in their place of seniority and new or transferred employees will be charged with the average hours of the list to which they are transferred. (New employees are those who have recently started with the Employer and successfully completed probation.)
3,	An acceptance, refusal, or failure to contact is counted
equally. Persons unavailable due to sickness, leave of absence, compensation, absence, other business or vacation will be counted as if overtime had been offered to them. Overtime will be charged according to number of hours offered.
44
The only exception being Union steward(s) attending negotiations will not be charged overtime hours.
4 , Persons in training for skilled positions will be eligible for
overtime as their training progresses to a level of competency for each individual work station. Probationary employees will be eligible for overtime only when all others in their craft group have refused.
5. Overtime is first offered to the people in whose
classification the overtime exists.
Example:
" B"	Shift	overtime is first offered then classified "C" Shift.	to	classified	"A"	Shift
"A"	Shift	overtime is first offered then classified "B" Shift.	to	classified	"C"	Shift
"C"	Shift	overtime is first offered then classified "A" Shift.	to	classified	"B"	Shift
6. Once	the	list of classified persons has been exhausted as above, then qualified persons are offered the				
overtime. In this case, overtime will be offered by going to the person with lowest hours in Craft Group I.
7.	Overtime hours worked or offered will be charged at the
overtime premium rate.
8.	On a weekly basis, a copy of the overtime sheets will be
publicly posted.
9 , Each week the overtime lists are re-drawn with the person with
lowest hours at the top. The hours are returned to zero annually.
10.	Overtime on Saturday "B" and "C" Shifts and Sunday "A",	"B"
and "C" Shifts will be offered to persons in whose classification the overtime occurs. The person with lowest hours to get choice of shift.
11,	Employees who are awarded make up overtime, due to an
administrative error, will be allowed three weeks from date of settlement to work this overtime.
12,	Overtime will be offered in eight hour blocks. Should an
employee who is offered eight hours prefer to work four hours, he/she will indicate this to their Supervisor when asked. The Supervisor will then go to a phone list which has been established indicating those employees who are willing to work the second half of the shift. If no one is willing to work the second half of the shift, the Supervisor will continue to offer eight hours to other employees. Only employees who signed a list indicating they wished to be phoned at home for overtime will be contacted.
13	. Start-up overtime is exempt from these procedures but overtime
hours worked will be charged.
14	. An employee transferred from one shift to another, will carry-
over their existing overtime hours, to their new shift, should no other employees exist within their job classification on the new shift.
In witness of the parties, hereto mentioned this Agreement has been agreed.

WELFARE PLAN SUMMARY

Unilever Canada Inc.
All of the Welfare Plan Benefits stipulated in this Collective Agreement are provided through The Milk Drivers and Dairy Employees Local 647 Welfare Trust Fund. This Fund is managed by four Trustees representing Employers contributing to the Fund under this and other Collective Agreements, and four Trustees appointed by Local Union 647.

Short Term Disability (STD)--
Non-Occupational Disability Only (Employee Only)
Unilever Canada provides disability benefits to ensure that some or all of your income continues during sustained periods of nonwork related illness or accidental injury. STD benefits paid by Unilever under the Benefit Options Program are designed to help you when your time away from work due to illness or accidental injury lasts twenty-six (26) weeks or less. After twenty-six (26) weeks, Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits may be available through a third party insurer.
Commencing on the third day of absence disability due to an accident, the Plan pays a Weekly Benefit as per the schedule
51
below. Under the terms of the Short-Term Disability Plan, you are "disabled" if you are unable to perform the essential duties of your own occupation or other suitable work within the company due to a medically verifiable illness or injury.
You must apply for STD Benefits for any absence greater than two (2) consecutive business days.
A Statement of Impairment (SOI) for absences beyond two (2) consecutive business days must be received by the Disability Management Service Provider within ten (10) business days of the first day of absence.
Your HR Representative will arrange for you to receive the STD Benefits Package.
The Disability Management Service Provider has sole responsibility for the assessment of whether or not the definition of disability is met based on information provided to them by Unilever Canada, you and your physician/dentist/clinical psychologist.
To be considered for Short Term Disability, a Statement of Impairment (SOI) within ten (10) business days of the first day of absence, signed by a licensed physician/dentist/clinical psychologist, must be submitted to the Disability Management Service Provider. Unilever Canada must receive confirmation of the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the definition of disability from the Disability Management Service Provider. Failure to provide medical verification upon request may result either in the discontinuation of benefit payments.
You will be entitled to receive up to twenty-six (26) weeks of STD benefits for periods of absence due to the same or related illness or injury. If a reoccurance occurs for the same or related illness or injury, and is separated by two (2) consecutive weeks or less of returning to work at full time regular duties, the calculation of your benefit for the successive disability will be determined according to the benefit remaining as per the schedule from the initial disability.
Benefits are not payable unless the disabled employee is losing wages on account of the disability. Therefore, benefits are not payable for periods of time during which there are no lost wages,
