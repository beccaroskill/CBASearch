The Company will notify the Union of the name(s) of the successful applicant(s) and place their name(s) on the plant bulletin board.
12.03	Employees wishing consideration for transfer must complete a Transfer Application provided by the company and present it to the Human Resources office. Periodically, the Human Resources office will notify transfer applicants of the necessity to renew their applications. Failure to renew within seven (7)
18
calendar days of this notice will invalidate a transfer application.
12.04	Transfer applicants will be considered at the time of a job
vacancy. Transfer applicants for another department cannot be accepted if they have been successfully transferred in the preceding six (6) months. Newly hired employees will not be eligible for transfer until they have completed six (6) months' service with the Company unless there are no other successful applicants. Further, transfer applicants will be interviewed by the Employee Relations Coordinator (or designate or selection committee, where appropriate) and evaluated in view of the requirements of the job vacancy. The person selected will be the person who in the judgment of the Company has the following:
(a)	Qualifications to perform the job.
(b)	Ability to perform the j ob.
Qualities of reliability and responsibility.
Seniority will govern if other requirements are met.

19
If the Union Executive representative wishes to inspect these documents it will be done in the presence of the hiring supervisor and the Employee Relations Coordinator (or their designates) within nine (9) calendar days of the posted notice showing the successful applicant.
Any applicant with more seniority than the applicant accepted will have the opportunity to discuss the refusal of their application and the reasons thereof, with the Supervisor of the department doing the hiring in the presence of the Employee Relations Coordinator (or designate) and the employee's Union Steward before the notice showing the successful applicant is posted.
None of the foregoing will preclude the Company going outside the Company for applicants if suitable applicants are not available among the present employees.

12.06	Should a transferred employee prove unsatisfactory within their respective probationary periods of transfer, the employee will be returned to their former position and department. If the employee's former position in a particular group or shift has been filled, the employee may be compelled to go into another group or shift where there is an opening. Further, the employee will be advised of reasons for unsatisfactory performance by the Supervisor of the department or section doing the hiring, in the presence of the Employee Relations Coordinator (or designate), and the employee's Union Steward.
20

If the employee has passed the salaried probationary period, but is still within twelve (12) calendar months of the original transfer and if for any reason either on behalf of the Company or on behalf of the employee there is a need to move from salaried back to hourly, the employee will be given the opportunity to accept ajob which in thejudgment of the Company is suitable to the employee's qualifications and ability in the Department employing the least senior person in the Company at that particular time. The employee will regain their seniority, including that time period while on Baytech Plastics Inc. salaried staff. The least senior employee then will be laid off.
Zi

17.02	It is agreed that for the purpose of this Article, technological changes shall be defined as the effect upon employees of the permanent elimination of an operator or majority of an operator's time brought about by major changes in machinery design. This, in no way, is to be interpreted in a manner which would prevent the Company from making normal improvements and savings through increased efficiency or establishing new work standards by altering or improving the production methods and efficiency of machinery or personnel, provided such acts are consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
17.03	The Company shall notify the Union not less than thirty (30) calendar days before the introduction of any technological change and shall endeavour to furnish all information necessary to an understanding of the proposed change and shall discuss with the Union methods of achieving the change to ensure that the interest of the Company and the employees are fairly and effectively protected.

17.05	In the event a technological change creates a j ob classification that immediately requires skilled employees the Company will have the right to hire skilled employees. If, however, a technological change creates a job classification whereby the Company has sufficient time to train present employees for this position, then the employees in the department will be given the opportunity, in order of seniority, to train for the position, provided in the judgment of the Company the employee or employees concerned have the necessary qualifications to be trained for the job.
34
17.06	When a technological change creates a newjob classification the Company will set the rate of pay for this job. If the rate is not satisfactory to the employee concerned it may become the subject of a grievance.
