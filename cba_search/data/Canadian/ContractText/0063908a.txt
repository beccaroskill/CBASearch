APPENDIX "C" VARIABLE COMPENSATION
Purpose:
To have hourly & salaried employees seek to achieve results by sharing common targets
To provide a market competitive base hourly rate of pay to be combined with an
opportunity to supplement this base hourly rate of pay based on achievement of targets
Pay for performance
Principles for the Variable Plan:
This plan applies to full-time, active employees only
The variable component will be calculated based on the base hourly rate multiplied by the active hours worked to a maximum 2080 hours in a calendar year. For greater clarity, hours worked does not include hours lost due to layoff, WI, WCB, LTD, sickness, or leave of absence.
Payout will be made in the form of a one-time annual lump sum payment no later than March 31 of the following year and will be subject to normal statutory deduct i ons.
This variable component will not be rolled into the base hourly rate.
For greater clarity, the following will apply for partial years of work:
(a)	Termination - not eligible for any payment
(b)	Resignation - not eligible for payment
(c)	Retirement - pro-rated based on number of hour worked (including vacation)
based on the calendar year
(d)	Layoff/closure- based on hours worked
How the calculation works:
Management will set a list of common targets (combined Brewery and Logistics) each year and the percentages for each
Each target will be weighted and the sum of all targets will be 100%
Results will be based on full calendar-year performance and will be either achieved in full or considered not achieved (no partial completion)
49
The sum of the achieved targets will determine the overall percentage achievement for the entire brewery and logistics group
Possible Site Targets:
Target	%
Brewery VIC/hl	25%
Brewery FIC ($)	25%
Brewery	15%

Sample Calculations:
For the following calculations, it is assumed that the maximum number of hours is worked during the year (2080 hrs)
Operator A @ $26.45
2080hrs x $26.45 x 4% opportunity x 75% achievement = $1,650.48 gross Operator B@ $20.00 (2007)
2080hrs x $20.00 x 6% opportunity x 75% achievement = $1,872.00 gross Maintenance @ $30.17
2080hrs x $30.17 x 4% opportunity x 75% achievement = $1,882.60 gross

APPENDIX 'J' WAREHOUSE AND BREWING RELIEF
This letter will serve to document the agreement reached during the 1993 Negotiations on the issue of department staffing and plant rightsizing. I n these discussions, it was agreed that to initiate, all relief postings will be re-posted January , 1994. Successful candidates will relieve in their respective positions for vacations and sickness. (It should be noted that during low production periods, relief may not be required).
It i s further agreed that when a full time posted position becomes available, the most senior person holding the relief position moves into that position. This creates a natural flow from the relief position to the full time posted position. The vacant relief position would be posted as per our usual method.
I n addition, when Logistics relief positions are not required within Logistics department, they will be utilized in packaging or other departments. Brewing relief positions will be drawn from a specific group to be called “E Group” in packaging.
Finally, it was agreed that the plant relief positions would be as follows:
Relief Warehouse	2
Relief Forklift Relief Receiver Relief Drivers
Relief Cellars	1
Relief Fermenting	1
Relief Brewhouse	1
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
1.	During calendar 1994, greaser relief will be covered by those individuals currently trained and capable of doing the job. With improved operator training and auto lub systems, this short term requirement will be eliminated.
2.	Any additional relief for the plant will be supplied by students during the time periods of April 1 to September 15 and November 15 to December 31. (Assuming no regulars or preferred temporaries are on layoff.)

Payments continue as long as you are disabled, up to a maximum of 26 weeks for each period of disability. (Refer to Long Term Disability insurance for benefits payable if disability continues for more than 26 weeks.)

Your Weekly Indemnity insurance will be cancelled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the Company and your Weekly Indemnity benefits will cease as of that date.
6.	LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT

Your LTD benefit will be payable at the end of each month at 66 2/3% of your basic monthly earnings rate as of the date your LTD benefit commences. For example, if your hourly earnings rate in the 26th week after you become disabled is $26.45 per hour:
(a)	Your Weekly earnings rate is 40 X $26.45	= $1,058.00
(b)	Equivalent monthly earnings rate is
($1,058 X 52 weeks) divided by 12	= $4,584.66
(c) Monthly LTD benefit is 66 2/3% of $4,584.66	= $3,056.13
Your LTD benefit payments will be reduced by any disability payments you are eligible to receive from Worker's Compensation, the Canada Pension Plan, or other government source.
I n order to qualify for LTD benefits, you must be under the continuing care of a licensed physician, and during the first 2 years of LTD benefits, be unable to perform the duties of your normal occupation or any other job available in the bargaining unit; thereafter you must be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for any employer for which you are reasonably qualified by training, education or experience. If you are again disabled due to the same or a related cause, your absence will be treated as a continuation of disability under the LTD benefit unless you have been back at work for at least six (6) months.
99
Payment of benefits will require submission of such appropriate medical evidence as may be requested by the insurer from time to time. You will be entitled to benefits during the continuation of disability as defined above except that in no event will benefits be paid beyond your normal retirement date. I f you should elect to retire early, LTD benefits will cease as of your date of early retirement. No benefits will be payable for absences due to disabilities caused by self-inflicted injuries while sane or insane, insurrection, war, service in the armed forces of any country, or participation in a riot, or during disabilities resulting from working for another employer.
If you engage in rehabilitative employment, your LTD benefits will continue for up to 24 months but will be reduced by 75% of what you earn from rehabilitative employment, for example, if you are receiving a monthly LTD benefit of $3,056.13 and you earn $800 in rehabilitative employment:
Monthly LTD Benefit
Subtract 75% of $800
LTD benefit during rehabilitation
Earnings from rehabilitative employment
Monthly income during rehabilitation
$3,056.13
600.00
2456.13
800.00
$3,256.13
Provided your employment with the Company has not been terminated, while you are in receipt of LTD benefits you will continue to be covered for all other group insurance benefits.
Your LTD insurance will be cancelled as of the date you retire or terminate service with the company.
NOTE: You may not receive wages or other allowances such as Holiday pay, vacation pay, weekly indemnity, long term disability,
Worker's Compensation or similar benefits from more than once source for the same day or part day.
7.	SUPPLEMENTARY HOSPITAL BENEFITS

Insured benefits under the Company's plan for you and your covered dependents supplement the provincial plan benefit and provide payment for room charges up to semiprivate accommodation in a licensed hospital. If you or your dependents are confined on the recommendation of a medical practitioner because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, benefits will be paid as follows:
(a)	Semiprivate Accommodation - if you or your dependents are
Confined in a semiprivate room, the plan provides for payment of an amount equal to the difference between the normal daily room and board charges made by the hospital for semiprivate
