15
employee is working more than 5 hours since the meal period referred to in (a) above, then a further 15 minute paid rest break shall be provided; and the Company will either provide a meal, or pay the employee a $6.00 meal allowance, which shall be added to their gross earnings for that week.
6.09	Employees required to work more than five (5) hours without a meal period shall be compensated at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular hourly rate for all time worked in excess of five (5) hours until a meal period is granted. Employees engaged in continuous shift operations (engineers and first aid attendants) shall be exempt from this clause, but shall be entitled to a lunch period of thirty (30) minutes on Company time. In the event of an earlier than normal start the Company shall have the right to change the time of the meal period in order to avoid the double penalty.
6.10	(a) Continuous shift operations shall be given
forty-eight (48) hours notice of change of shifts except in an emergency. Employees who because of an emergency are required to change shifts shall be paid the applicable overtime rate until the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour notice.

reasonable time for the sharpening of tools, knives, etc. This time is to be scheduled and handled by the Supervisor of the department, the same as any other work assignment. A qualified operator shall be available as needed to sharpen knives of those desiring this service.

It is agreed that except in cases of personal necessity, employees shall not ask for additional time off during the day. It is mutually agreed that rest periods shall not be abused.
6.13	The Company and the Union agree that in the event of a work shortage, ways and means will be discussed in an attempt to shorten the working hours of the week, in preference to laying off of employees.
17
6.14	When other than emergency overtime is to be worked, every reasonable effort will be made to rehire employees who may be on layoff status in the department where overtime is to be worked.
6.15	A holiday shall be an employee's regular shift on a holiday.
6.16	Whenever an employee performs work outside their regular schedule the employee need not be required to take time off to bring their hours down to the standard working week.
ARTICLE 7 - STATUTORY HOLIDAYS
7.01	Ten (10) statutory holidays shall be recognized and a regular hourly paid employee, who is not exempt from the weekly pay guarantee as set out in Article

If an employee works on any such holiday or, in the case of off-shift, the day in lieu of, the employee shall receive in addition, pay for hours actually worked on the holiday (or day substituted in the event of the holiday falling on Sunday), at two (2) times their job rate.
The statutory holidays referred to herein are:
New Year's Day Good Friday Victoria Day Canada Day First Monday in August
Labour Day Thanksgiving Day Remembrance Day Christmas Day Boxing Day
and any other holiday declared by either the Federal or Provincial Governments.
18
Employees absent on the regularly scheduled work days next preceding or next following any public holiday shall not be entitled to pay for such holiday unless the absentee received permission from the Company to be absent or was absent because of sickness or for other good cause arising from circumstances beyond their control. The Company will advise the Union in writing of such deductions.
7.02	In the event of a holiday falling on Sunday it shall be observed on the day substituted by the Federal Government. If the Federal or Provincial Governments proclaim some other day to be generally observed, hourly rated employees required to work on it shall for the hours so worked receive three (3) times their regular hourly rates provided that if such day is in substitution for a holiday hereinafter specified, the penalty rate shall not apply to both days. If a paid Statutory Holiday falls on a Saturday, the Friday prior to the Saturday shall be observed as the holiday. If a paid Statutory Holiday falls on a Sunday, the Monday immediately following the Sunday shall be observed as the holiday.
7.03	Any employee having fifteen (15) days accumulated service with the Company, who is laid off prior to a recognized holiday in the same payroll week in which such holiday occurs shall be entitled to receive pay for such holiday.
7.04	An employee who is absent from work and receiving benefits for reason of sickness, compensable or non-compensable accident, during the period in which a recognized paid statutory holiday occurs, shall receive the
19
difference between their compensation or Weekly Indemnity pay and their regular rate of pay.
When a recognized paid statutory holiday falls during the 3 day waiting period for Weekly Indemnity benefits, an employee eligible for these benefits shall be paid eight (8) hours pay at their regular rate of pay for each such statutory holiday.
Any employee who is no longer eligible for Weekly Indemnity benefits and is still disabled shall receive eight (8) hours pay at their regular rate for any statutory holiday following within three (3) calendar months from the onset of such disability.
7.05	If any of the paid holidays referred to in this Article occur while an employee is on leave of absence to attend Union functions the employee shall be paid eight (8) hours pay at their regular rate.
7.06	An additional floating statutory holiday shall be granted to all employees with seniority. This statutory holiday is to be granted at the discretion of management, but it is understood that the months June through September are the most likely months in which no employees would be accommodated should they request their entitlement.
It is also further understood that the preferable days of Monday or Friday will be granted upon request, but again at the Company's discretion.
There is to be no carry-over from one calendar year to the next and thus all entitlements must be taken prior to December 31st of each year. However, if an employee is prevented from taking the floating statutory holiday prior to December31
20
because of a compensable accident, sickness or an approved leave of absence, then the holiday will be carried forward past December 31st and must be taken in the next calendar year.
New employees will not be entitled to a floating statutory holiday in their first calendar year of employment if they are hired on or after July 1st in that year.
7.07	New employees are not eligible for statutory holiday pay during their first 30 calendar days of employment.

Transfers to jobs will be made within ten (10) working days from the date the posting was awarded with the provision that wherever this proves impossible, suitable arrangements will be arrived at after consultation with the Union. An employee who is absent when a vacancy is filled shall receive equal consideration provided the department steward notifies the Company in writing that an employee in their department wishes to apply for the vacancy.

22
special exemption is granted by Management. In the event an employee fails to qualify for a job posting they shall be transferred to the help qualified pool.

(i)	the Company will post a list of anticipated vacancies for the following week no later than Wednesday noon;
(ii)	employees shall indicate interest by signing the list prior to Thursday midnight;
(iii)	scheduling will be done by the Company on Friday for the following payroll week;
- 23 -
(iv)	if there are no qualified applicants, the Company may schedule the work according to Article 8.04 (d) above;

24
employee left the Company service voluntarily.
(c)	Has been laid off for a period longer than the time allowed in the following schedule:
Length of Seniority Length of
at Date of Separation Allowable Time Off Payroll
Less than one year	One Year

(d)	Is absent without leave for more than five (5) working days, unless a reasonable explanation for the absence is provided.
8.08	Absence from work because of sickness, compensable or non-compensable accident or leave of absence, shall not break continuity of seniority rights and an employee shall return to the position held prior to the absence or to one of equal rating. This is provided the employee is able to perform the work that is available within the customary trial period of not more than eight (8) weeks.
8.09	In the case of reduction in the working force the order of layoff shall be as follows:
(a)	Probationary employees, i.e., those with less than sixty (60) days worked.
(b)	Those with plant seniority.
In the latter case, seniority shall be the determining factor provided the senior operator, after a reasonable time to qualify, is capable of doing the work performed by an employee with less seniority except
25
where immediate essential qualifications are necessary for the efficient operation of the plant. In such cases the Company will discuss the matter with the Union.
8.10	(a) In cases of increases in the working forces, rehiring shall be in the reverse order to that of layoffs. The Company shall advise the Union when a layoff is about to take place and shall give the Union a list of employees to be laid off or rehired. In cases where it is necessary to secure workers in less time than the required notice, the Company, if unable to make contact with the senior eligible employee, may recall the next senior employee and so on down the list until the vacancies are filled. However, should the senior employee subsequently report within the required time, the employee shall be given the work for which the next senior employee was recalled.

not to exceed three (3) days is available at the time any layoff is to become effective, then the notice shall be deemed to be extended for the period represented by such additional days of work.
(c)	Employees with seniority may be temporarily recalled for ten (10) working days or less, as casual help with no layoff notice given, provided that this shall not be used as discrimination to any employee, and provided that the employees and the Union are informed that such work is of a temporary nature.
8.11	When it is necessary to permanently transfer employees to lower rated jobs because of a shortage of work, the employees with the lowest seniority will be required to take the transfer.
8.12	In cases of gang reduction or increases, an employee may elect to take a layoff or continue to be laid off if it is mutually agreed that the work which is available could prove detrimental to the health of the employee.
8.13	Employees shall notify the Company at once of all changes of address and telephone numbers, temporary or permanent. Failure of the employee to do so will relieve the Company of any responsibilities they may have under this Agreement to notify the employee.
8.14	Upon an employee accepting promotion outside the bargaining unit, the Company will inform the Chief Steward of the Union by letter as to the date of acceptance. Said employee shall be allowed six (6) months in which to prove their capability of
27
filling the position concerned. If said employee does not qualify within such time, the employee shall report to the help qualified pool without prejudice and loss of seniority.
8.15	Duty to Accommodate:	Where the duty of the
