ARTICLE 2. EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT
2.01	The word “employees” as used in this Agreement means all employees of the Company in its Potash Operation except supervisors, foremen, superintendents, managers, office and clerical staff (including clerical staff in warehouse), laboratory staff, plant security and any persons having, and regularly exercising, authority to employ or discharge employees or regularly acting on behalf of management in a confidential capacity, at the mine site situated approximately seven km North cf No. 7 Highway between Vanscoy and Delisle, Saskatchewan.
2.02	Words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine.
ARTICLE 3. UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes the Union
as the exclusive representative for the purpose
16
of conducting collective bargaining regarding rates of pay, hours of work, working conditions and other employment conditions of employees and will continue to do so as long as the Union retains its rights to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of such employees under the law.
3.02	(i) The Company reserves the right to
employ independent contractors to perform work at the Operation it deems necessary or desirable. However, the Company recognizes the Union’s concern over the Company employing contractors to work as part of regular maintenance crews or to perform routine maintenance work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit because of its effect upon such matters as job opportunities for the employees. The Company will therefore attempt to minimize the employment of such contractors having due regard to the needs of the efficiency of the Operation, the time available to do the work and to the availability of equipment, skills, manpower,	engineering,
supervision and services. While the
17
Company may also contract out work not normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit, it shall, whenever practicable, and especially during layoffs, have such work	performed	by
employees within the bargaining unit.
(ii)	The Company agrees that it will not contract out any work at the Operation if, as a direct result, an employee will be demoted or laid off, and such employee is qualified to perform the work.
(iii)	The Company will inform the
Union prior to the beginning of each month of the number cf contractors	scheduled or
expected to be used during the coming month and the nature of their work. The Company will also, during the month, advise the Union of any additional contractors scheduled to work on the property during the month. For purposes of this Section, contractors shall mean any contractor employing trades or labourer employees on site.
18
(iv)	Following receipt of the notification provided in (iii) above, the Union may request a meeting with the Company to discuss the information provided. Such meeting shall be limited to the Union President and the Union Vice President, or their designates, and one contracting out committee member and will occur either immediately prior to or following the monthly Company - Union meeting. At such time, the Company will also be prepared to review, with the Union, contracts issued for offsite work.
3.03	The Company recognizes that it is not the function of forepersons, acting forepersons, supervisors and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement to repetitively perform work which is currently being performed by an employee in the bargaining unit where qualified employees are reasonably available to do such work, except for the purpose of training, giving instruction, experimentation, protecting the safety of employees or equipment or in emergencies.
19

The parties also recognize the right of employees to work in an environment free from harassment of the above grounds, and the parties shall undertake to investigate all alleged occurrences between or among employees with all possible dispatch. If it is found that any of these types of harassment has taken place, the parties shall take whatever joint action is appropriate to ensure harassment ceases.
ARTICLE 7. NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
7.01	The Company shall not cause or direct any lockout of employees during the life
21
of this Agreement; and neither the Union nor any representative thereof, nor any employee, shall in any way authorize, encourage or participate in any strike, walkout, suspension of work, or slow-down on the part of any employee or group of employees during the life of this Agreement.

Until further notice from the Company to the Union, the approval referred to need not be obtained.
ARTICLE 12. SENIORITY
12.01	Seniority shall be established on the basis of an employee’s service with the Company’s Potash Operation, whether broken or continuous, according to the records of the Company. Should such records not be
31
available, then other Company validated documentation may be used. The only exception is when it applies to an employee who voluntarily quits and is subsequently rehired.
In such cases, seniority will commence from the new date of hire for the purpose of calculating plant seniority. All new and prior service will be used in calculating pension and benefits coverage.
However, employees hired prior to March 23, 1987, shall continue to be credited with their total Company Employment Service. It is recognized that an employee’s security shall increase in proportion to the employee’s length of service and in accordance with the provisions of 12.03.
12.02	Employees shall not be deemed to have any seniority until they have worked 700 hours (excluding Jury Duty) after they were last hired by the Company.
12.03	In all cases of promotion, filling permanent positions, layoff and recall from layoff or transferring into established training programs, a senior employee shall be entitled to preference provided that the employee has the ability, qualifications and physical fitness to meet the normal requirements of the job.
12.04	Persons originally hired by the Company for a special assignment of work
32
may be discharged when their employment at such special assignment of work comes to an end notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary. The Union shall be notified of such employees and their status in writing. Special assignments will be limited to a maximum duration of one (1) year.
12.05	(i) In the event of a reduction of crew
or layoff, employees affected shall be laid off in inverse order of their seniority and in accordance with Article 12.03. If an affected employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability, to meet the normal requirements of another job, that employee can displace a junior employee. A displaced junior employee can then exercise the option to displace a more junior employee provided that employee has the seniority, qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of that job.
When it is necessary to increase the workforce, former employees who have completed their probation period shall be reemployed as closely as possible
33
in the inverse order in which they were laid off, providing they have the qualifications, ability and physical fitness for the job for which they are being recalled.
In the event of a reduction of crew or layoff that exceeds twenty-one (21) days or recall for a temporary position that is expected to exceed twenty-one (21) days, the Company will provide up to five (5) working days for familiarization training for the employees exercising the displacement option. If the employee demonstrates the qualifications and ability to meet the normal requirements of the job by the end of the fifth day, the employee will be put into the job. The determination as to whether or not an employee has acquired the necessary skills and ability for the job shall be made by the Company. The Company shall make the determination in a fair and equitable manner.
The Company will provide four (4) positions in total (in the three
34
progressions - mine operating, mill operating, warehousing) to which senior employees, displaced in the event of a crew reduction or layoff, could move without having the qualifications for the job; provided that the senior employee has the ability and physical fitness to do the job and the junior employee to be displaced does not need to be retained because of skills or certification for the ongoing required work.
The employee’s maximum wage loss will be one wage rate unless this is higher than the top wage rate in the new job. In this case, the employee’s new rate would be the top rate in the new job.
The Company and the Union will meet prior to any crew reduction or layoff to explore all possible options for employees being displaced and who are qualified to do other jobs.
(ii) It shall be the responsibility of a laid-off employee to notify the Company of any change in the
35
employee’s postal address. Laid-off employees who have complied with the foregoing procedure shall be notified by the Company, either personally or by registered mail at their last known address, of the date on which they are to report for work: and should an employee fail to report within ten (10) days of being notified personally or within ten (10) days of the postal registration date of the written notice, the employee shall lose the right of re-employment. In any case, the Company shall not be obligated to re-employ any former employee who has been laid off for a period equal to the lesser of the employee’s seniority or twenty-four (24) months, or thirty-six (36) months if the employee’s service is greater than ten (10) years.
(iii) Employees who have been laid off for more than fourteen (14) days during the twenty-four (24) months prior to an announced layoff will be entitled to subsequent layoff notice or pay in lieu of notice which shall not be less than:
36
-	One week’s notice if the employee’s period of employment is less than three years;
-	Three weeks’ notice if the employee’s period of employment is three years or more.
The above provisions do not apply if the period of layoff is for six (6) days or less, or if any employee is recalled for a specific, limited period of work during a general layoff. The Company may elect to pay base rate for that portion of the notice period in respect of which notice was not given.
12.06	The Company will not transfer staff employees who were previously members of the Bargaining Unit back to the Bargaining Unit. Any staff employee who was previously a Bargaining Unit member who desires to return to a Bargaining Unit job would return, assuming a job is available, with no seniority. Such employee would first have to resign as a staff employee.
An employee who transfers after May 1, 1994 from an hourly-rated job to a staff position outside the Bargaining Unit shall retain all seniority held at the time of the transfer and will reactivate such seniority if the employee
37
returns to the Bargaining Unit within a three (3) month period following such transfer. In the event the transfer is for more than three (3) months, the employee shall lose all retained seniority. This paragraph does not apply to temporary acting supervisory positions.
Effective January 1, 2007 the Company will limit an individual’s acting foreman assignment to one thousand and forty (1040) hours worked in any calendar year subject to the needs of the operation. The employee will not accumulate seniority for any hours worked in excess of the one thousand and forty (1040) hours for that calendar year as long as he/she continues in the assignment.
12.05	(i) The Company agrees to provide
copies of all acting foreman hours to the Union on a quarterly basis.
12.07	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, an employee shall be on probation until such person has worked seven hundred (700) hours, computed from date of last hire. Upon completion of such probation period the employee shall be credited with seniority from the date of hire. During the probationary period the Company may terminate the employee’s employment for cause, without reference to any other provisions of this Agreement. Union
38
activity shall not be considered as a reason for discharge under this Section. This clause shall not apply to employees re-employed in accordancewith Section 12.05.
12.08	The Company shall maintain and post a seniority list including occupational classifications, which list shall be revised quarterly. Two (2) copies of the list shall be provided to the Union.
ARTICLE 13. PROCEDURE FOR SETTLING DISPUTES
13.01	Should a dispute arise between the Company and any employee or employees regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement, the employee or employees concerned shall first seek to settle the dispute with the immediate supervisor. Both parties agree that this should be the first step in a dispute resolution process and nothing in this Article shall prevent an employee from discussing the dispute with the Company.
Grievance Procedure
13.02	Stage 1. Failing an employee’s satisfactory settlement of a dispute with the Company, the employee or employees concerned, in person, with their shop steward in attendance, shall first seek to settle the dispute with the immediate supervisor.
39
13.03	Stage 2. Failing a satisfactory settlement within five (5) working days after the dispute was submitted under Stage 1, the employee or employees concerned, in person, with their shop steward and/or a member of the Grievance Committee of the Union in attendance, or through the Grievance Committee of the Union, may submit the dispute, which at this stage must be stated in writing, to the Superintendent who may appoint members of his/her staff to assist in investigating the dispute.
13.04	Stage 3. Failing a satisfactory settlement within five (5) working days after the dispute was submitted under Stage 2, the Grievance Committee of the Union may submit the dispute, which shall be stated in writing, to the management of the Company, or the accredited representative or representatives of the management, who may at their discretion require the employee or the employees concerned, and the members of the supervisory staff concerned in, or having knowledge of, the dispute, to appear before them and give evidence regarding the dispute.
The Grievance Committee of the Union may request the presence of the employee or employees concerned at Stage 3 proceedings, but where this necessitates the absence of the employee from the place of
40
work, the employee shall first obtain the consent of the Company and it shall be at a time and a duration that does not interfere with the Company’s operations.
The person whom the Union has designated as its Area International Union Representative may appear with the Grievance Committee of the Union at the Stage 3 presentation of a grievance. The Company shall be advised by letter from the United Steelworkers, CLC, of the identity of the Area International Representative.
13.05	Arbitration.
(i) Expedited Arbitration: Failing a satisfactory settlement at Stage 3 both parties may then mutually agree to take the matter to Expedited Arbitration. Expedited Arbitration will be binding, set in an informal atmosphere, and used when a difference arises between both parties relating to the dismissal, discipline, or suspension of an employee, or to the interpretation, application, operation, or alleged violation of the Agreement including any question as to whether a matter is arbitral.
41
The parties agree that the purpose of Expedited Arbitration is for the fair and quick settlement of disputes. Once the parties agree to Expedited Arbitration, the selection of an arbitrator shall be from the panel listed in 13.05 (ii). If there is no arbitrator available from 13.05 (ii), a substitute may be agreed to by the parties within ten (10) days. The rotational system for arbitrators as outlined in 13.05 (ii) will be used to determine who will hear the dispute. The arbitrator shall:
(a)	investigate the difference
(b)	define the issue in the difference
(c)	not alter, modify or amend this agreement in any respect
(d)	render a decision within five working days of the hearing.
The arbitrator may, with discretion, render a verbal award to the parties at the conclusion of the hearing, but in all cases a brief written decision shall be rendered within the above time frame. This five-day time limit
42
does not run in respect of the grievance procedure.
The procedures for Expedited Arbitration shall be as follows: A maximum of four (4) people from each party shall attend. The grievor shall be considered as one of the four (4) members of the Union’s committee. No case law, jurisprudence, or witnesses shall be used.
The hearing shall be in an informal setting with no need for swearing-in testimony. Both parties shall have fifteen (15) days to notify the other in writing of their wish to proceed to Expedited Arbitration.
(ii) Formal Arbitration: If either party does not wish to utilize the Expedited Arbitration procedure as outlined in this article, the Union or Company may, on giving fifteen (15) days notice in writing to either party of its intention, refer the dispute to arbitration. The selection of an arbitrator shall be by rotation from the panel listed below.
43
1.	Robert Pelton
2.	William Hood
3.	Ken Norman
If an arbitrator so selected is unable to serve, then the next arbitrator on the panel shall be selected. If an arbitrator on the panel is permanently unable to serve, then the parties shall jointly select a replacement. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days, the appointment shall be made by the Minister of Labour of the Province of Saskatchewan upon request of either party. The decision of the arbitrator in respect of an interpretation or alleged violation of this Agreement, shall be final and binding upon the parties, but in no event shall the arbitrator have the power to alter, modi or amend this Agreement in any respect. Each party shall pay the expenses incurred in connection with the presentation and preparation of its own case. The parties shall bear in equal shares the expenses of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall render a decision.
44
13.06	If a dispute (i) is not submitted under Stage 1 within fourteen (14) calendar days after the occurrence or discovery of the act or decision giving rise to the dispute, or (ii) is not advanced to the next stage under Stages 2, 3, or arbitration, within fourteen (14) calendar days after a decision was made or should have been made, then the dispute shall be deemed to be abandoned, and all rights of recourse to the dispute procedure shall be at an end. Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action must be taken under (ii) above.
13.07	The Company shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Grievance Committee of the Union. Failing a satisfactory settlement within seven (7) days of the submission in writing of the dispute by the Company, the Company shall have the right to refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with this Article.
13.08	In the meantime, and in all cases while disputes are being investigated and settled, the employee or employees and all other parties involved, except an employee serving a disciplinary suspension, must continue to work, but where an employee or employees has or have been discharged by the Company, employee or employees shall not
45
remain in the employ of the Company while the case is being investigated and settled. If the claim be made within five (5) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) that an employee or employees has or have been unjustly discharged, the case shall be dealt with according to this Article, and if it is proven that the employee or employees has or have been unjustly dealt with, the employee or employees shall be reinstated. If a claim is made for compensation for time lost in cases where reinstatement has followed, it shall be left with the Grievance Committee of the Union and the Management to decide what amount, if any, is to be paid, and failing agreement, with the same arbitrator that dealt with the claim and who shall fix such compensation.
13.09	The procedure for settling disputes set out in this Article shall be strictly adhered to, but the Union shall have the right to refer any dispute regarding the interpretation or a violation of this Agreement to the Company at Stage 3 where:
1.	There is no aggrieved employee or employees possible of identification at the time the dispute arose; or
2.	The grievance involves Company policy in which case
46
the grievor or grievors possible of identification shall be noted on the face of the grievance form.
All Union grievances filed at Stage 3 shall be signed by the Grievance Chair or a designated member of the grievance committee, or the union executive members. The union will provide the company with a list of these designates.
13.10	Notwithstanding marginal paragraphs 13.02, 13.03, 13.04,13.05 and 13.06 above, in a grievance involving a discharge the grievance must be presented directly at Stage 3 of the grievance procedure by the Grievance Committee of the Union. The Stage 3 reply shall be given within five (5) working days of the presentation of the grievance at Stage 3.
13.11	As much as is practical and except in a case of gross misconduct and/or a case requiring immediate action, it is the Company’s intention that an employee, accompanied by the employee’s Shop Steward and the Grievance Committee Chairperson or delegate, if the employee so chooses, will be given the opportunity for a hearing with the supervisor(s) in question prior to receiving a disciplinary suspension or a discharge. Such hearing will be without prejudice to any subsequent grievance or arbitration procedures.
47
13.12	If it is necessary for a steward or other employee to take time off during working hours in connection with a grievance, the steward or employee must first receive permission from his/her immediate supervisor. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13.13	Any time limits provided for in this Article may be varied by the mutual consent of the Company and the Union and confirmed in writing.
13.14	The company agrees to provide copies of employee discipline, terminations and suspensions to the Union within five (5) calendar days.
13.15	In all cases involving discipline or suspension, the disciplinary notice will remain on the employee’s file. However, after a period of three (3) years without further incidents of discipline, it will not be used to elevate subsequent disciplinary action.
ARTICLE 14. WORK WEEK, HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME
14.01	The normal work shift for the purpose of the Article shall be eight (8) hours, or twelve (12) hours as defined by the Letter of Understanding on the 4x4 shift schedule. For surface employees assigned to eight (8) hours steady day shift schedules, the work shift shall be eight (8) hours inclusive of meal time. For
48
employees working underground or assigned to shift work schedules, the work shift shall include meal periods in accordance with present practice, at the convenience of the Operation. The starting time for shifts shall not vary more than one and one-half (11/2) hours from 8:00 am, 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m. and midnight.
14.02	Schedules of work shall average forty (40) hours per week over any complete cycle. Overtime rates shall be paid for hours worked in excess of this schedule.
14.03	A “work day” is any day an employee is normally at work according to the employee’s work schedule. A “rest day” is an employee’s assigned day off according to the employee’s work schedule. A “work day” and a “rest day” both begin at 12 a.m. and continue for 24 hours. A “work week” begins at 12 a.m. Sunday and ends at 12 p.m. the following Saturday. A “work period” is an employee’s complete period of work and rest days commencing with the first scheduled work day and concluding at the termination of the last scheduled rest day.
14.04	Overtime occurs when an employee is required to work in excess of the employee’s regularly scheduled hours in any work day, or on a scheduled day of rest. For all overtime worked by an employee, the rate of pay shall be two (2) times the employee’s base hourly rate.
49
14.05	Except in the case <f emergencies, all overtime shall be on a voluntary basis.
14.06	When an employee is called out to work at a time other than the beginning of the employee’s regular shift, the employee shall receive either the overtime rate for the time actually worked, exclusive of the employee’s regular shifts, or six (6) hours’ pay at the employee’s base rate, whichever is the greater. Upon completion of the work for which the employee was originally called out, the employee may choose to remain at work provided work is available and the employee is qualified to do such work, and completion of the callout falls within the eight (8) hour period prior to the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift. Payment for hours worked between completion of the callout and commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift shall be at the overtime rate. The six -hour minimum rule does not apply, however, if the overtime continues into the employee’s regular work shift, if the employee elects to remain at work upon completion of the work for which the employee was originally called out, or if the employee is called back to work before leaving the premises.
14.07	If an employee is called out, he or she will not be required to report for their next
50
regularly scheduled shift until eight (8) hours have elapsed from the time the employee finished the callout work. The employee will be paid at the employee’s base straight time rate for any time missed on the employee’s regular shift due to this provision. If there is less than two (2) hours left in the employee’s regular shift after the required eight (8) hours rest period, the employee will not be required to work the remainder of the shift but will not receive pay for this additional time missed.
14.08	When employee(s) report on their regular shift and are sent home because no work of any kind is available or so that they may come to work at a later time, they shall be paid their regular scheduled hours that shift, at their base rate for reporting on their regular shift. If they are assigned to work at a later time, they shall be paid straight time for such work up to eight (8) hours.
14.09	If the Company changes an employee’s work schedule and the employee is required to work on the normal rest days of the employee’s old schedule, the employee shall be paid overtime rates for those days. This new schedule will become the employee’s regular schedule at the conclusion of the rest days from the employee’s old work period.
51
In addition, when an employee is notified of a change of shift while at rest, and that rest period is reduced due to this change, the first shift of the new schedule will be at overtime rates.
14.10	Overtime rates will apply when an employee is required to start work less than twenty-four (24) hours after the start of the employee’s previous work day. Overtime rates will only apply for hours worked during the 24-hour period calculated from the start of the employee’s previous regular shift.
14.11	If an employee works for more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the employee will be entitled to an 8-hour rest period. If the employee’s regular shift is to commence before the 8-hour rest period has expired, the employee will be permitted to stay at rest for those eight (8) hours and be paid for said hours of the regular shift. If the employee returns to work after the eight hour rest period, the employee will be paid the employee’s regular rate of pay until the completion of that shift. If an employee at the request of the employee’s supervisor consents to return to work before the expiration of the 8-hour rest period, the employee will be paid at two (2) times the employee’s base rate for all work performed on the employee’s regular shift. If
52
not so requested to return to work, the employee will remain at rest for an 8-hour period.
14.12	If it is necessary to change an employee’s regular shift, and this new shift change causes the employee to start work more than twenty-four (24) hours following the completion of the employee’s last regular shift, the Company shall be required to give the employee a minimum of thirty-two (32) hours notice before the start of this new shift. If sufficient notice is not given, overtime rates shall apply to all hours worked during this newly scheduled shift. If the employee has received overtime rates according to this marginal paragraph, and if the employee returns to the original shift following completion of one shift, the provisions of marginal paragraph 14.10 shall not apply.
14.13	When the Company temporarily changes an employee’s shift schedule or hours of work for four (4) shifts or less, with or without 32 hours of notice, the first shift will be at two times (2x) base hourly rate. No penalty shall be incurred by the Company when the employee is returned to the shift or work schedule he/she worked prior to the temporary change. None of the above provisions mentioned shall apply to continuous shift workers.
53
ARTICLE 15. TRAINING PROGRAMS, POSTINGS, TRAINING COMMITTEE, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PREFERRED SHIFT POSITIONS
15.01	The Company shall pay basic wage rates to its employees in accordance with the wage scale shown in Schedule A which forms part of this Agreement.

(iii) The Company will notify the Union of a technological change
57
that affects the employment security or earnings of the employees, as far as possible in advance of the date on which such change is to be effected. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state:
(a)	The nature of the technological change;
(b)	The date upon which the Company proposes to effect the technological change, and,

and
UNITED STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, ALLIED INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION (UNITED STEELWORKERS) on behalf of it’s Local 7552 (Hereinaftercalled the “Union")
Revised Date: August 28, 2009
A.	PREAMBLE
Agrium, Vanscoy Potash Operations and Local 7552, United Steelworkers, agree to institute a twelve (12) hour shift schedule for all
99
Surface employees who work on a continuous shift basis or who periodically are scheduled to work on the continuous work schedule.
The continuation of the “Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule” is subject to the following conditions:
1)	The new schedule must not lessen safety, efficiency, housekeeping or productivity within the workforce.
2)	In the event the Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule affects compliance with government Occupational Health and Safety regulations, the Company has the option to revert to 8-hour shifts.
3)	The Company reserves the right to schedule all its employees on an eight (8) hour shift schedule during a period of any emergency that would cause normal operations to cease without having to pay overtime if incurred as a result of the schedule change. As much advance notice as possible will be given to the employees.
B.	TERM OF AGREEMENT
The Company or the Union may terminate this “Surface Continuous Twelve
100
(12) Hour Work Schedule” by giving to the other party thirty (30) days written notice of such intention.
Should the “Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule Agreement” be terminated, all employees will revert back to an (8) hour shift schedule and the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at that time will apply. Overtime will not be paid if incurred as a result of implementing or discontinuing the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule.
The work schedule will continue, subject to the right of the Company, pursuant to Article 5.01 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, to discontinue it and replace it with any schedule the Company deems appropriate.
C.	SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
The terms of this Agreement are only applicable to surface employees who work on a continuous shift basis or who periodically may be scheduled to work on the continuous work schedule.
For the purpose of this Agreement, “those employees affected” shall include surface employees on continuous operations including the Powerhouse crew and those surface electricians and surface mechanics who may periodically work on the continuous operations.
101
D.	GENERAL CONDITIONS
All the provisions cf the Collective Agreement in effect between the parties shall apply to the employees covered by this Agreement save and except as specifically otherwise herein provided.
1.	WORK WEEK, HOURS OF WORK, OVERTIME
14.01 Employees on continuous operations working the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule shall be employed on schedules providing for forty (40) hours of work in the defined work week over the averaging period.
The work day for employees on surface continuous operations shall be divided into two equal shifts <f twelve (12) hours each, the first shift (night shift) being the shift starting nearest to 8:00 p.m. and the second day shift being the shift starting nearest to 8:00 a.m. To achieve the 40 hour average work week and for training considerations, work schedules will require shifts of less than 12 hours at periodic intervals. Schedules as attached in Appendix A shall not be altered without mutual consent of the Company and the Union.
102
2.	SUNDAY PREMIUM
(16.02)	The Sunday premium shall be paid for all work performed by employees on their regularly assigned 12 hour shifts. The premium shall be paid during the 24 hour period from the beginning of Saturday night shift to the end of Sunday day shift. The premium shall be paid for straight time hours only.
3.	PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
(17.02)	Statutory holiday provisions will apply during the 24 hour period beginning at the start of the night shift preceding the holiday and terminate at the end of day shift on the Statutory Holiday.
4.	VACATIONS WITH PAY
Employees working the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule must take their vacation hours in full shifts only, rounded upward to the nearest whole shift. If after rounding, an employee is required to take more hours of time off than that specified in 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, and 18.04; then such extra time will be regarded as leave of absence without pay.
103
5.	LUNCH PERIODS
The daily lunch periods of an employee working on the Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule shall be two (2) twenty (20) minute breaks, on Company time, during which time the employee shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of services.
6.	STANDBY
The Parties recognize that the most significant benefit to this schedule to employees is the additional days free from work. The Parties also recognize that absenteeism problems increase costs and reduce productivity and replacement employees must be available when employees are absent. These replacements will, of necessity, have to come from employees on their days off. The necessity to work employees on their days off negates the primary benefits of the schedule to employees and increases significantly the cost of overtime coverage to the Company. In recognition of the above, the Parties agree:
104
a)	To encourage 100% attendance by all employees.
b)	To establish procedures for covering absent employees and standby provisions for those on days off.
The Union agrees to establish a voluntary call board system to assist in replacing absent employees. Employees on time off, who are available to work, will enter their names on the board prior to leaving work and will be available for work if called. Employees who are not relieved may be required to remain at work on overtime rates by the Company until call board relief arrives on the job. In the event that not enough qualified employees are available to meet the requirements of the operation, it is understood and agreed for the continuance of the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule that the Company will have the right to establish a compulsory rotation selection of such operation personnel or terminate the Surface Continuous Twelve (12) Hour Work Schedule.
