LILYDALE ATTENDANCE PROGRAM
Whenever an employee is unable to attend work a loss is incurred both by the employee and the Employer.
We all understand that there will be occasions during everyone's work life when they will be unable to attend work, but it would seem to make good sense to work together to find ways of avoiding the avoidable absences, or working together in a genuine attempt to create and maintain an environment both physical and social that will promote regular attendance at work, along with an understanding that we have a shared interest in lowering the incidence of absence.
The Lilydale Attendance Program was a first attempt to start down this road of co-operation. Some of the employees found the program intimidating and felt it was negative, rather than positive, as intended. Hopefully the following revisions will help to alleviate these impressions.
SECOND PART
LILYDALE ATTENDANCE PROGRAM
It is understood that the Lilydale Attendance Program is to be revised to incorporate the following changes:
1.	That absences as a result of occupational illness or injury (W.C.B.) shall not be within the scope of the Program.
2.	That reference to "termination of employment", as outlined in the Lilydale Attendance Program, shall not apply to those employees covered by the curreni Collective Agreement, but will be determined in accordance with the provisions of
Article 4.13.
3.	That the Program will be changed in such a maimer as to reflect its positive intent.
4.	The Company agrees to amend the Attendance Program letters on employee files that refer to W.C.B. absences or termination of employment.
