He will work alone at times performing assignments in keeping with his training.

In this case, as the probationary period for apprentices is three (3) months, apprentices will not enter school prior to the completion of their three month probationary period.
10.	Thereafter, entry into school will depend on the schedule of school sessions set up by the
Apprenticeship Board. The Company will make up the difference between the Canada Manpower Training and Assistance Program Allowance and the employee's normal earnings (based on the regular straight time hourly rate multiplied by 40 hours per week) for the duration of the school term. Upon completion of each period of training in an approved vocational school, apprentices will be required to pass examinations set by the Apprenticeship Branch. In the event of failure to pass the examination, apprentices shall be required to be re-examined within 12 months.

Apprentices removed from the program will return to their original position. in the event the original position no longer exists, he will return to one with an equivalent rate.
Existing Maintenance employees hired prior to September 1, 1981 and still in our employ who have not obtained a Journeyman's ticket will be encouraged to enter the program at a level to be individually determined by the Apprenticeship Branch.

41
employed as journeymen, and if a person presently employed as a journeyman fails to pass the test for a voluntary Technical Qualifications Certificate, he can then become indentured as an apprentice.

SAWMILL TRAINING PROGRAM
The parties have committed to continue to work to redesign the sawmill training program. If the work on this is not completed by August 31, 1996 it will be referred back to the negotiating committee for completion.
The purpose of this program is to provide on the job training in order that employees may better exercise their seniority as job vacancies occur, to improve the knowledge and skill of the employees employed in the operation and to provide suitable trained employees for skilled jobs within the operation.
1.	The Company will provide a list of key jobs that require an extended and intensive training program. Employees training on key jobs will be given supervised training until they are thoroughly familiar with the fundamentals of the job. Practice time will then be scheduled until the trainee is qualified.
The following is the list O key jobs:
1.	Slasher operator
2.	Debarker operator
3.	Log loader operator
4.	Large log line operator
5.	Small log line operator
6.	16 ft. chipping edger operator
7.	Trimmer ope rator
8.	Forklift operator
9.	Kiln operator
10.	Oiler
11.	Grader
12.	Planer feeder
13.	Mill stores
14.	Reman stud operator
15.	Filing room
2.	Definitions
Regular:	Defines the status of the current incumbent
employed on a full time basis.
56
Spare:	Defines	the	status	of	an employee who has
previous successful job tenure and/or successfully completed the plant trainee program.
Trainee:	Defines	the	status	of	an employee currently
training in this program.
3. The length of training period will be determined by the trainee's progress and management will endeavour to qualify
personnel concerned in the shortest possible time.
4. (a) Selection of trainees shall be in accordance with the appropriate provisions of Article 12 - Seniority of the
current Collective Bargaining Agreement. No one posted to a key job may bid on a trainee posting.
(b) Job bids under this program shall be valid for 90 calendar days.
5.	(a) No employee shall be permitted to train for more than one job at a time and no more than three jobs within a twelve month period.
(b)	Trainees who of their own accord give up the training job or are disqualified shall maintain full rights to train for two more jobs within the twelve month period.
(c)	A twelve month period is defined to commence with the employee's initial bid into the program.
6.	Trainees will be notified in writing of their progress at intervals during the training period.
7. The Company will notify the trainee, the local Union, and the Plant Committee in writing when he is qualified as a spare or
he is removed from the training program.
8. Rates of pay for trainees will be their regular job rate except that they will not receive more than the established rate for
the job that they are training for. However, in the absence cf close supervision (close supervision is defined as a supervisor or qualified operator in the immediate vicinity of the key job, thereby enabling such supervisor or qualified operator to instruct or oversee job performance) if the trainee performs the job in excess cf one hour per day he shall receive the job rate for the actual hours worked.
57
9.	Regular status employees cannot be displaced by a "spare" even though the "regular" may have less seniority, unless
due to a reduction of forces by plant seniority. On recall from such curtailment (by plant seniority) the regular status employee will return to his original job.
10.	The Company shall determine the number of spares and/or trainees required for any one job, and the length of the
training period may be established where necessary.
11.	The "utility man" will be a posted job and everything being equal, the senior man will be awarded the job. He will be
used to fill the gap between trainees, spares, and regular operators, but the "utility man" will never permanently fill one particular job. This clause is not intended to restrict in any fashion the provisions of this program.
12.	Spares who refuse for other than proper cause to accept vacancies for which they are trained, shall lose their spare status on the second refusal.
13.	The Company shall supply a list to the local Union and Plant Committee of employees who are now qualified or now
training and the terms of the plan will apply to them just as if they had been selected under the provisions laid out herein.

PROGRESSION LINE JOB BIDS
In an effort to provide relief for progression lines with minimal
disruption to other areas and reduced training and related costs,
the Company and the Union agree to the following:
1.	Future bids for progression line vacancies be posted as "relief" bids.
2.	Employees in "key" positions will be eligible to bid. Employees in other progression lines will not be eligible to bid.
3.	Those employees who have accepted another bid within the last four (4) months will be ineligible to bid, per Article 13:01 (c).
4.	The incumbent to a "relief" position will automatically assume the next permanent position should a permanent vacancy occur within this progression line. In the event two vacancies should occur simultaneously within a progression line, the "relief" promotes to permanent, and another permanent bid and "relief bid would be posted.
5.	Employees will not be allowed to hold more than one "relief" position at any one time.
6.	This letter will supersede Schedule "L-2" Sawmill Training Program, of the Collective Agreement.
7.	It is understood that it is not practical for tradesmen to hold relief bids. In the event that a tradesman accepts a relief they will be transferred to production. If a vacancy exists at the time of the transfer the tradesman may elect to transfer to this vacancy. If no vacancy exists or if the tradesperson decides not to transfer to the vacancy they will displace the junior labourer in the mill and will be allowed to accept one job bid (relief bids excluded) in future without losing their relief status.

If he bids to a trainee job he will only be released if there is a qualified replacement and if released he must return and complete his assignment.
5)	It is understood that this letter supersedes Art. 13:01 (e)ar\d is intended to complement Schedule "L-2" of the Collective Agreement for Lumber Division employees.
