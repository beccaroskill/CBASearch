(a)	a work permit will be paid to the Union by the Company for every month or part
1
thereof that a contractor is engaged by the Company;
(b)	the engagement of a contractor shall not have the corresponding effect of causing a reduction of employees or of the regular operations of the department affected subject to the usual seasonal changes in the operations of the Company;
(c)	where both contractors and Union members perform the same work, subject to Article 2:03, Union members will be laid off in accordance with Article 12:06 or such other Article as may be specifically applicable, only if the contractors performing the same work have ceased to perform the same.
2:03 The Company may continue to engage contractors to exclusively perform the following work

3
(c). His departmental seniority will not be transferred if he is not presently in that department.
