GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
5.01
Employees are urged to attempt to settle any complaints or grievances with their immediate shift bosses or supervisors before proceeding with the Grievance Procedure.
4
5.02
It is agreed that the settlement of any grievance shall not be construed as a precedent and shall not be binding on the Company or the Union in respect to any other grievance.
5.03
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or impair the right of any employee to present any complaint directly to any representative of the Company.
5.04
Should any difference as to the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement arise between the Company and the Union or any employee and in the latter case, if the employee should wish to present his difference through the procedure set out below instead of presenting it directly to a representative of the Company, an earnest effort shall be made to settle such difference in the following manner:
STAGE ONE:
5.05
The employee (accompanied and represented by a Steward who is reasonably familiar with the work on which the employee is engaged) shall, providing it is done within ten (10) calendar days after the circumstances giving rise to the alleged grievance have originated or arisen, present his complaint in writing to his immediate Supervisor, and if within seven (7) calendar days from the time when such complaint was made to the immediate Supervisor a decision satisfactory to the employee is not given to him, then—
5
STAGE TWO:
5.06
Before proceeding further with the matter such representations shall be stated by the employee in writing signed and presented by him (accompanied by his Steward), within seven (7) calendar days after the decision of the immediate Supervisor for Stage One has been given or if no decision was given, then within seven (7) calendar days from the expiry of the time period for giving such decision. Such written representations shall be presented to the Department Superintendent or his designate from time to time to handle such matters at Stage Two. The Department Superintendent or his designate may be accompanied by other officials of the Company. The Department Superintendent or his designate shall give his decision in writing within seven (7) calendar days from the date upon which such representations were presented to him and if the matter is not satisfactorily disposed of, then—
STAGE THREE
5.07
Notice in writing requesting further consideration of the matter shall, within seven (7) calendar days after the decision of the Department Superintendent or his designate for Stage Two has been or should have been given, be given by the Grievance Committee to the Mine Manager or his designate to handle such matters at this Stage Three. The Mine Manager or his designate shall notify the Union of the time and place at which he will meet the Grievance Committee to discuss the matter. At such time, the representations in writing presented at Stage Two indicating the nature of the grievance and the remedy sought shall be presented to the Mine Manager or his designate by the employees and not less than two (2)
6
and not more than three (3) members of the Grievance Committee. The Mine Manager or his designate may, if he desires, be accompanied by other officials of the Company. At this meeting, such representations and the decision of the Department Superintendent or his designate for Stage Two shall be considered. At the inception of or during this Stage Three, the Company or the Union may require that a Staff Representative of the Union be present at such meeting. Every effort will be made to settle such difference within seven (7) calendar days from the date upon which the Mine Manager or his designate for Stage Three received written notice of the matter as above set forth and the Mine Manager or his designate shall give the decision in writing on behalf of the Company within the seven (7) calendar day period.
GENERAL
5.08
The Company will forward to the Union written notification of Management Representatives or the position designated to handle the matters of the Grievance Procedure.
5.09
If no Management Representative shall have been designated by the Company for any of the stages through which a matter must proceed, such matter may proceed directly to the next higher stage for which a Management Representative has been named.
5.10
Any and all time limits fixed by this Article for the taking of action by either party or by an employee may at any time be extended by agreement in writing signed by the Management Representative of the Company for
Stage Two or Three and a Steward or the Local Staff Representative.
5.11
Any difference which arises directly between the Union and the Company concerning the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement (which shall not include matters upon which an employee(s) is personally entitled to grieve) will be submitted in writing by either party to the other within seven (7) calendar days following the origination or occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the alleged grievance at Stage Three. The decision of the Company or the Union, as the case may be, shall be given within seven (7) calendar days after such meeting.
5.12
Where two (2) or more employees in the same department have identical complaints concerning the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement, such complaint shall constitute a group grievance and commence at Stage Two within seven (7) calendar days after the circumstances giving rise to the alleged grievance have originated or occurred. A group grievance shall be presented by at least two employees from the group concerned or a greater number if mutually agreed on, accompanied by the appropriate number of Stewards or Grievance Committeemen as permitted in the various Stages.
5.13
In the event that any difference concerning the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement shall not have been satisfactorily settled under the foregoing provisions, the matter may then, by notice in writing given by one party to the
8
other within fourteen (14) calendar days from the giving of the decision of the Management Representative at Stage Three or the decision in Section 5.11 be referred to arbitration as hereinafter provided. If no decision be given within the applicable period allowed above for the purpose, notice of arbitration may be given within fourteen (14) calendar days after the expiration of such period.
5.14
Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union or between the Company and any employee concerning the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of this Agreement, or should any discharged employee believe that he has been discharged in violation of the provisions of this Agreement and should either party or an employee desire to take advantage of the procedure provided for in this Article, each step in such procedure (including any reference to arbitration) required to effect a satisfactory disposition of the matter shall be taken by such party or such employee within the time limits set forth in this Article or in the Article concerning Discharged Cases, as the case may be, or the matter shall be deemed to have been settled or abandoned.
5.15
If any dispute affecting an employee's rate of pay is finally settled in his favour and provided that the grievance was presented in writing within seven (7) calendar days after the employee received his cheque for the pay period in which the grievance first occurred, any adjustment shall be made retroactive to the date the grievance first occurred. If the grievance was not presented before the expiration of such seven (7) calendar day period, any adjustment shall be made effective as of
9
the day the grievance was presented in writing.
5.16	(a)
Any misunderstanding in relation to contract bonus received will not be considered under the Grievance Procedure until it has been taken up with the Bonus Department by the employee who is directly concerned within seven (7) calendar days after receiving the bonus cheque or the posting of the “bonus sheet” whichever is the later.
5.16	(b)
(1)	For the information of those employees involved, the Company will post contract rates in the mine dry for all elements of measurable work used in monthly calculations of bonus earned.
(2)	Print-outs of each month's bonus calculation for

10
5.18
The Union shall from time to time notify the Company in writing of the names of the employees who are serving as Stewards and Grievance Committeemen, together with the areas each represents. The Company shall not be required to recognize them until so notified.
5.19
Grievance meetings shall, as far as possible, be carried out during the regular hours of the day shift.

5.20
The Union acknowledges that Stewards and Grievance Committeemen have regular duties to perform on behalf of the Company. If a Steward or Grievance Committeeman requires time off during working hours to attempt to settle a grievance or attend a meeting with the Company, he shall request the permission of his immediate super. visor, stating the reason for his request, which permission shall not be unreasonably denied.
5.21
If an attempt to settle a grievance involves any employee entering any department or section of the property other than his authorized working place, or if it involves the investigation of the condition of a working place or of equipment, he must carry a written permission for that purpose from his Department Head or the Manager to be obtained through his immediate Supervisor. He will be accompanied on such investigation by the Manager or his designated representative and the immediate Supervisor in the department, section or place concerned.

7.02
The Company agrees that it will not cause nor direct any lock-out of employees.
ARTICLE 8 DISCHARGE CASES
8.01
If an employee who has completed his probationary period be discharged from his employment after the date hereof and believes that his discharge results from an unjust application of the provisions of this Agreement, he may have the matter dealt with under the Grievance Procedure. Any such matter may be presented at the Third Stage of the Grievance Procedure within seven (7) calendar days after written notice of such discharge has been given and not otherwise.
14
8.02
In the event that it should be finally decided that the discharge of any such employee resulted from an unjust application of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall reinstate such employee and pay his full compensation (less amounts of money earned by the employee during the time lost) at the employee's regular basic rate for the hours lost which he normally would have been scheduled to work after written complaint against such discharge has been received by the Company. Upon such reinstatement, there shall be deemed to have been no break in the employee's continuous service by reason of such discharge. Accordingly, such grievances may be settled under the Grievance and Arbitration Procedures by:
(a)	confirming the employee’s dismissal;
(b)	reinstating the employee with or without com-
pensation for the time lost; or
(c)	any other arrangement mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, or which is just as determined by a Board of Arbitration appointed pursuant to this Agreement.

9.01
15
lay-offs where he shall maintain, but not accumulate, seniority.

of one (1) year if the employee has one (1) or more years of service or for the period of his service if he has less than one (1) year of service, or
works for another employer while absent from his employment with the Company whether he is on official leave of absence or otherwise except when the Company approves such other work.
9.03
In any case of reduction in working force (except lay-offs considered by the Company to be temporary only) the Company shall consider the factors to determine who is laid off:
(a)	Company Seniority and,
(b)	The Skill and Ability of the individual to im-
mediately perform the job.
follow/ing two (2)

9.03	(a)
An employee laid off can apply his seniority to displace laterally or downward another employee with less seniority provided he has the skill and ability relatively equal to
16
that of the incumbent and is able to immediately perform the job concerned.

Employees must exercise their seniority within seven (7) calendar days of being informed of such displacement or they will have deemed to have made an election under
(c).
9.03	(c)

9.04
For a period of one (1) year (where the employee has one or more years of service) or for the period of his service (where the employee has less than one year's service) from the day of lay-off for lack of work of any employee he shall have preferential rights for re-hiring (but only for jobs whose occupants would be classified as employees and which are not of a temporary or an emergency nature) in accordance with the following provisions:
those most' recently laid off within the qualifying periods outlined above shall, to the extent of the number of workers at any one time required by the Company, be sent notices by mail by the Company stating the jobs available and the proposed time of hiring which shall not be less than ten (10) calendar days from the date of such mailing. Such notices shall be mailed by registered mail to each such person addressed to the last address which he shall have recorded with the Company. The persons to
17
whom such notices are sent and who report ready A/ for work shall if they are qualified and physically able to fill the job available be re-hired in the inverse ' v order to that in which they were laid off. The Company shall not be required however tore-hire at any time any persons who shall have failed to report for re-hiring in accordance with and at the time stated in any such notice sent to him.
9.05
The seniority article of this Agreement shall not apply to the selection or appointment for the job of Concentrator Leader and Concentrator Operator.
JOB POSTING
9.06

(iii)	Where there is a line of progression within the Department, the Company may promote up the line of progression without posting the position.
18
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)
Employees who wish to be considered for the job vacancy must file an application with their Supervisor. The Company will provide the appropriate forms.
To determine the successful candidate, the Company shall consider:
(a)	Company Seniority and,
(b)	The skill and ability of the individual to
immediately perform the job.
Where the skill and ability of an individual to immediately perform the job concerned is relatively equal as to between two (2) or more candidates, the employee with the most seniority will be awarded the job. Integrity and reputation will apply to certain jobs such as handling of gold.
The job posting procedure as set out shall apply only to the filling of the initial vacancy and up to one (1) further vacancy which may be created by the transfer of successful applicants. Further vacancies created by the job posting procedure shall be filled as may be determined by the Company, either by internal promotion, transfer, or by hiring a new employee.
Following awarding of the position, the Company shall post the name of the successful applicant for such job within four (4) working days,

(ix)	An employee shall not apply for more than two (2) job vacancies at any one time. The Company will
19
not be obliged to consider applications for the posted jobs from those employees who have successfully applied for another posted job within the previous one (1) year.
(x)	The job posting procedure will not apply in filling vacancies in the Mine Dry, Gatehouse, #8 Shaft Deckroom, #3 Shaft Deckroom, #8 Shaft Bit and Salvage Shop. In filling these vacancies, the Company will give preference to employees who are unable to perform their regular jobs due to health problems.
(xi)	The job posting procedure will not apply if the vacancy is filled with a presently inactive employee, who due to health problems, requires rehabilitation. Such an employee will be identified to the Union prior to placement in the job.
9.07
(a)	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to preclude the transfer of a person excluded from the bargaining unit to a position where he is included in the bargaining unit or vice versa, provided that no employee shall be thereby laid off or demoted except in the event there is a general reduction or curtailment of the entire working force under Section 9.03. Persons employed by the Company who are transferred into the bargaining unit will be credited with full seniority based on length of service.
(b)	Where an employee within the bargaining unit accepts a position with the Company outside the bargaining unit and thereafter returns to the bargaining unit, such employee shall regain the Company seniority acquired prior to date of transfer out of the bargaining unit and shall continue to accumulate additional company
20
seniority as of the date of his transfer back to the bargaining unit, provided the return occurs within six (6) months.
TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
9.08
A temporary employee is one who has been hired for a specific job of a temporary nature, which in each case, shall not exceed a period of six (6) months.
9.09
On completion of the job, the services of such temporary employee shall be terminated; however, should he be required as a regular employee he shall be re-hired in that capacity, progress through the probationary period as outlined in Section 9.01; and his seniority shall then be as outlined in Section 9.01.
ABSENCE
9.10
When hereafter an employee is absent on leave of absence or otherwise for a period in excess of one (1) month, except in case of disabling accident or sickness, such period shall not be counted and shall be excluded in computing his Company seniority.

Any leave of absence permit must be in writing and signed by an authorized Company official.
Leave of absence for reasons other than those listed in Section 9.14, may be granted to an employee if a request is made in writing at least five (5) days in advance. The leave will be granted for reasons acceptable to the
21
Company and only if it does not interfere with operations. The Company may waive the five (5) day notice if the circumstances are in its opinion sufficiently urgent.
An employee desiring to return to work after an unauthorized absence may be required to give at least one (1) day’s notice to the Company of his intention at which time he will be told on which shift to return.
An employee who is unable, for any reason, to report for work must, if possible, notify his foreman before the beginning of his shift.
When an employee misses a shift, he will notify his foreman of his intended date of return, as soon as possible. The foreman will confirm the intended date of return as the date of return.
