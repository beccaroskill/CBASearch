When considered necessary by the Company, employees shall be requested to perform overtime work in excess of the regular hours of work.
Employees with a justifiable reason shall be excused from working overtime. However, it is agreed that if sufficient qualified employees are not voluntarily available, then one (1) or more of the above excused employees, having the lowest Overtime Worked Total, shall be required to work. No employee shall be required to work if they have already worked twenty (20) hours or more overtime in any given week.
An employee on an 8 hour schedule shift requesting a Friday or Monday off 7 days in advance, in writing, will be given the option to indicate if they are available for OT from the end of their last regularly scheduled shift until they report to work on their next regularly scheduled shift. This will be indicated on the time off request form. All time off must be approved by his foreman.
8.2.1	The Company shall endeavor, as far as reasonably practicable, over a period of three (3) months, to distribute overtime equitably among qualified employees in the department by classification in which
21
such work becomes necessary.
Lists will be posted every three (3) months indicating, by department, overtime worked and refused. Overtime will be recorded as equivalent straight time hours.
A copy of the Overtime Distribution list will be sent to the Union Executive Members and posted in each department weekly.
In the event of inequities of more than twenty-four (24) hours existing at the end of a three (3) month period, they will be corrected by assigning overtime available to the applicable employee(s) as soon as practicable.
8.2.2	The three (3) month periods referred in Article 8.2.1 shall be defined as follows:
Period number one:	January (first Monday following
last Sunday in December) to March (last Sunday in March) Period number two:	April (first Monday following the
last Sunday in March) to June (last Sunday in June)
Period number three: July (first Monday following the last Sunday in June) to September (last Sunday in September)
Period number four: October (first Monday following the last Sunday in September) to December (last Sunday in December).
Overtime worked and refused during these four (4) periods will be charged as follows:
1.	At the end of each three (3) month period, the total
22
number of hours worked and refused for each employee will be reduced by the lowest employee total in the respective classifications. The lowest employee total(s) within the respective classifications will be set to zero (0).
2.	A list showing the new totals will be posted the first week of the new period.
3.	This list will also include a year to date total of hours worked and refused. This total will restart at zero (0) each January.

8.2.4	On completion of his probationary period, a new employee will be credited with the average overtime hours of the employees in his classification.
Probationary employees shall not be eligible for overtime until all qualified, regular employees in the classification in the department have been offered said overtime.
The following guidelines will be used to administer the Equalization of Overtime System:
1.	All employees, except those who have signed out of the system, who are requested to work overtime, will be charged with having worked or refused.
2.	Overtime which is the result of a penalty payment, such as a Company initiated change of shift, will not be charged.
3.	An employee may decline to participate in the process of equitable distribution of overtime by
23
completing the appropriate form and submitting this form to the Company.
4.	When an employee elects to sign out of the system, the difference in “total hours worked and refused” between himself and the highest total (in his classification) will be recorded. When re-entering the system, this differential will be maintained. Should the employee signing out of the system be the highest in total hours worked/refused, then the difference between himself and the next highest total will be maintained.
5.	An employee who has signed out of the system will not be requested to work until all other qualified employees within his classification have been asked.
8.2.5	In order to facilitate the equitable distribution of overtime and to ensure that personnel are available for overtime assignments, employees will be allowed up to twenty-four (24) hours from the time of posting to advise unavailability for overtime assignments.

8.3.3	When, as a result of a Company initiated change of shift schedule (a) from a five (5) day week to a seven (7) day week or (b) from a seven (7) day week to a five (5) day week or (c) from a five (5) day week or a seven (7) day week to the continuous twelve (12) hour shift, an employee is required to work more than five (5) consecutive days, he shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half for the sixth day and double time for the seventh day.
