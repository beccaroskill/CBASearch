Furthermore, if the efficient operation of the Plant is adversely affected, then this practice will be discontinued and article 10.05 will prevai I.

Re:	Twelve (12) hour shifts:
The Company agrees to maintain a twelve (12) hour seven (7) day continuous operation shift schedule on a trial period basis for those employees in the Engineering Department who work such shifts, providing that maintaining the schedule does not increase the Company's cost of operation.
However, the Company also reserves the right at its sole and complete discretion to cancel this twelve (12) hour shift arrangement at any time upon thirty (30) calendar days' notice, unless business conditions are such that a lesser notice period is required.
The hours of work shall be as scheduled by the Company and a shift premium of sixty cents ($.60) per hour, effective date of ratification, will be paid for all hours worked from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Overtime will be paid at the rate of double time (2X) for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours on any one shift, and for all shifts worked which are in addition to and consecutive with the normal twelve (12) hour shift schedule.
Upon converting to a new schedule, no premium or overtime shall be paid to any employee by reason of transferring from one standard work week to another work week or vice versa.
Holiday pay will be paid at the rate of eight (8) hours' pay at the employee's straight time hourly rate if he does not work on the day on which the holiday falls, However, if as a part of his regular scheduling, an employee works on that day, he will be paid thirty-two (32) hours' pay at his straight time hourly rate.
Bereavement and Jury Duty will be paid based on the twelve (12) hour shift providing he is otherwise eligible for same. Sickness and Accident will be paid as per Article 19, providing he is otherwise eligible.
56
An employee's vacation weekwill commence at the end of his last regularshift immediately precedingthe start of his vacation, and he will return to work at the start of the first full shift immediately following his vacation. Vacations may not be taken in daily increments.
If an employee is to be laid off, he may choose instead to use up any vacation in excess of two (2) weeks up to the maximum of his vacation entitlement.
Forty (40) hours of time off will constitute one (1) week's vacation, paid at the applicable percentage outlined in Article 9.02. For example, an employee eligiblefor a total of six (6) weeks' vacation will be entitled to a total of 240 hours or 20 shifts of time off in that vacation year.
The allocation of vacation dates will be governed by Article 9.06.

Re: Second Shift
Employees shall be known as either a first shift or a second shift employee (excluding Sanitation and Maintenance), and shall not have any right to work any of the hours of the other shift. Employees on either shift will remain on that shift unless they apply for and receive a posting for the other shift, or if they are laid off from either shift and exercise a bump.
However, employees may be selected by seniority to work on the other shift from the reduced hours and daily overtime lists as posted on each shift.
If there still is an insufficient number of employees, then the Company shall have the right to assign employees on a reverse plant seniority basis, providingthe employeeis qualified to perform the work required.
A reduction of all or part of the shift will be as follows:
1)	By department seniority the most junior employees will be removed, providing the remaining employees are qualified to perform the work required.
2)	Those removed may exercise their department seniority to bump the most junior employee within the same department on the first shift, providing they are qualified to perform the work required.
3)	Failing being able to bump into the same department on the first shift, employees may exercise their plant seniority to bump the most junior employee in the plant, providing they are qualified to perform the work required.
58
4)	As per Article 10.07, separate seniority lists will be maintained between the Further Processing and Specialty Departments, and the other departments.
5)	During a period of reduced hours Letter of Understanding#2 will prevail.
The second shift employees will receive additional compensation of sixty cents <600) per hour for each hour so worked.
The hours of the first shift will be scheduled to start approximately between the hours of 5:45 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and the hours of the second shift will be scheduled to start approximately between the hours of 2:45 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. There will be a one-half (Vi) hour lunch period on the second shift.
