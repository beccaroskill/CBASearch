(d)	In the application of (c) above, an employee who fails to fill the requirements of the position within six months from transfer into the bargaining unit, at the option of the company, will be transferred back to the department he/she worked in immediately preceding the

(e)	In the application of(c) above, for the purpose
of layoffs within the period of one year following the employee's transfer into the bargaining unit from outside the bargaining unit, at the option of the Company, will be transferred back to the department he/she worked in immediately preceding the transfer if he/she would have otherwise continued to work in that department except for his/her transfer, or to some other department within his/her original bargaining unit for placement, if any, on the basis of skill, ability and seniority.
9.21	An employee transferred to any position within the Company excluded from the bargaining unit under this contract and subsequently transferred back to the bargaining unit within a period of one year, shall retain his full seniority within the bargaining unit and shall be considered to have been continuously employed therein, Any other employee transferred from a position within the Company outside the bargaining unit shall acquire seniority in the bargaining unit only over employees brought into the bargaining unit after the date of his transfer.

However, if a temporary lay-off occurs due to an emergency, breakdown or a condition beyond the control of the Company, departmental seniority will not apply for a period of within two working days.

The Company shall submit a written reply to each written grievance.

39
time limits provided in Steps 1, 2 and 3 above shall be considered a refusal of the request involved in the grievance and immediate appeal to the next step in the procedure may be taken. When either party desires additional time within which to properly process a grievance, additional time within reasonable limits shall be granted by the other party upon written request.
13.11	The Company will supply the Union with a list of the Department Heads and Assistant Department Heads excluded from the provisions of this Agreement as aforesaid and will notify the Union of any changes thereto.

APPENDIX “A” RATES
The Rules and Regulations of the Job Grading Plan as hereinafter written shall be deemed to be part of this Agreement.
The rates under the Job Grading Plan shall be as follows:
*** NOTE THESE RATES DO NOT REFLECT FUTUREC.O.L.A.FOLD-INS****
50
OPERATION OF JOB GRADING AND JOB GRADING
RATES
1.	As of May 1,1998 all jobs have been correctly described and assigned to job grades, and wage inequities thereby eliminated. Accordingly, no grievance alleging wage rate inequities will be filed or processed except where a job has substantially changed. Subsequent jobs whose job descriptions and grading have been approved by the Union as hereinafter provided, will be considered as correct, and no grievance alleging wage rate inequities will be filed.
2.	(a) A “change” in a job as referred to herein is one
which materially affects its content or requirements. Changes in a job description alone are not adequate to warrant regrading of an existing job;
(b)	When a new job is established or an old job is substantially changed, a job description for such new or changed job will be assigned to the appropriate job grade, based on comparison with the other jobs in the Plant;
(c)	A copy of the job description of the new or changed job will be sent to the Union for approval at the earliest possible date after the job has been created, or the changes to the existing job have been made, together with a notation of the job grade;
(d)	Upon commencing an experimental job, changed job, or a new job a production employee will
51
remain at the job rate which he regularly received prior to this job, until a job grade rate is assigned to the job. The job will be graded within a three (3) month period where possible;
(e)	If the Union believes that an existing job has changed to an extent sufficient to warrant an adjustment in job grade, it shall notify the Company in writing of its contention and of the adjustment in job grade it contends to be appropriate. Such notice, insofar as possible, shall be given to the Company within fifteen (15) working days after the change in the job is alleged to have occurred;
(f)	Any job description and grade proposed by the Company shall be considered accepted by the Union if no written complaint is filed by the Union within fifteen (15) working days after such job description and grade is submitted to the Union;
(g)	Upon receipt of notice that a difference exists concerning the job description or job grading of a new or substantially changed job, the Company representative will meet with the Union Job Grading Committee at the earliest convenient date to discuss the differences and attempt to make a settlement of these differences.
The Company will advise the Union in writing of their decision regarding the said Job Description or Job Grade;
(h)	If the Company and the Union are unable to reach agreement on the job description or job grading of
52
a job within a reasonable period of time, the difference will be submitted to an impartial arbitrator whose decision will be final and binding on both parties.
3.	The description and grading of jobs will be in compliance with the following rules:
(a)	The description and grading shall be of the job, not of the person performing it:
(b)	Duties not assigned or approved by management shall not be considered;
(c)	The grading shall be based upon average requirements to perform the job satisfactorily, rather than upon exceptions to the average. Performance by specific individuals who are above or below average will not be considered except where classified rates, as in the maintenance departments, apply;
(d)	The grading shall be based upon the performance of a fair day's work, and employees will be expected to maintain such standards;
(e)	The job descriptions are to be sufficiently accurate to reveal those features of the job that determine its classification. At the same time they are not intended to provide a complete listing of every individual feature of the job. If new duties which may be assigned at any time, become a permanent feature of the work, the job shall be reconsidered as provided in Section 2.
53
4.	Jobs of lead personnel may be graded in accordance with the following procedure:
(a)	A Lead Person is one who:
1.	Instructs,
2.	sees that directions of the supervisor are executed,
3.	co-ordinates,
4.	checks work,
5.	reports necessary information, and
6.	performs necessary manual duties, in a department or major subdivision thereof. Jobs requiring the incumbent to direct a small crew working with him are not classified as lead jobs, but such direction is included in the regular job description and evaluation.
(b)	Lead personnel will receive the established rate for the classification of Lead in which they fall, as outlined by the job grading programme, with the provision that they will receive a rate at least one grade higher than the highest grade job which they supervise.
5.(a) An employee with less than 130 days of actual work with the Company within one period of employment is eligible for job grading rates;
(b) An employee with less than 130 days of actual work with the Company who maintains seniority privileges after being laid off for lack of work and being reinstated, is eligible for job grading when he has accumulated 130 days of actual work with the Company, provided that the employee has a minimum of 65 working days since his reinstatement;
54
(c)	The Company maintains the prerogative to hire semi skilled and skilled employees at rates above the minimum wage rates as outlined in the collective agreement provided these rates are not inconsistent with the rates paid to employees in the same job classification;
(d)	Any employee on job grading, who has lost his seniority with the Company by reason of a lay-off, shall, on rehiring, be treated as a new employee, and must accumulate the necessary service under Clause 5(a) hereof in order to again become eligible for job grading.
6(a) Each employee, respectively, shall be paid for all hours worked each day, the rate of the highest job grade at which he works if he spends fifty per centum (50%) or more of his daily working hours, including overtime in that job grade;
(b)	In the event an employee performs work in more than one job grade and therefore works less than half of his daily working hours at any single rate, he shall be paid an average rate based on the hours worked and the applicable job grade rates;
(c)	Employees who enter the employ of the Company and become eligible for job grading, after job grading is in effect will be paid the rate established for the job grade to which they are assigned, or when applicable, in accordance with the arrangements set forth in 6(a) and (b) above.
55
7.(a) All employees, except those employees receiving classified rates, shall receive the appropriate job grade for each job which they perform, with the stipulation that a minimum period of time of 15 minutes must be spent on the job before credit is given. Where less than 15 minutes is spent on the job, the job grade rate of the previous job performed shall apply, or where less than 15 minutes is spent on the first job upon commencing the shift the employee shall receive the job grade rate of the job following. This clause is subject to the qualifications of Clause 6(a) and (b);
(b)	(i) Employees regularly engaged on maintenance
work shall be classified and receive that classification rate at all times for all work performed unless permanently promoted, transferred or demoted. Maintenance employees transferred shall receive the appropriate job grade rates for each job they perform, as defined in Clause 6(a) and (b);
(ii)	Notwithstanding the above, high-pressure welders will maintain their “A” rate after 15 years “A” welders service with the H. J. Heinz Company and 40 years of age, irrespective of the results of their high-pressure examination.
(c)	(i) Employees regularly engaged in sterilizing in the
Can Filling Department shall be classified and receive that classification rate at all times for all work performed in the Can Filling Department.
This rule will not apply if the sterilizer is promoted to a job grade higher than the sterilizer rate.
56
(ii) Employees regularly engaged in sterilizing in this Department will have special seniority status similar to the Maintenance Department regarding lay-offs. As long as they are sterilizing, they cannot be bumped off their job by higher seniority employees from other departments who are being laid off due to a plant wide lay-off. This clause will not apply in the event of a permanent layoff in the workforce.
(d)	Employees in the Production Equipment Cleanup Department will have a special seniority status similar to the maintenance department regarding layoffs. As long as they are working in the Production Equipment Cleanup Department, they cannot be bumped off their job by higher seniority employees from other departments who are being laid off due to a plant-wide layoff. This special status will be reviewed in approximately one year by both parties. This clause will not apply in the event of a permanent layoff in the workforce.
7(e) An employee being trained for a skilled production or maintenance job shall receive the job grade rate below the rate of the job for which he is being trained until he is fully qualified to perform the skilled job after which time he shall receive the job grade rate of the job. It is understood that should the employee fail to qualify for the skilled job within 130 working days of being trained he shall be returned to his former job.
Employees being trained for skilled maintenance jobs will be required to complete maintenance controls cards for this period of time. It shall be the
57
exclusive function of Management to determine if an employee is fully qualified to perform the job for which he is trained, subject to the right of appeal by the employee through the grievance procedure.
HEALTH & SAFETY

Dear Mr. Rebelo:
RE: Electrical Apprenticeship
The Company wishes to confirm by letter, the following matters with the Union. It is agreed that electricians, who qualify and undertake a Government Apprenticeship Training Programme, will receive the following rate of pay:
1.	A new employee will receive the hiring rate and 60 day working rate as determined by the Company until he is qualified for the Job Grading Programme. At this time, he will receive the rate of an electrician "C” until he qualifies for the "B" rates as specified below.
2.	An employee, who is transferred from elsewhere in the plant and is on the Job Grading Programme, will receive the job grade below the rate of an electrician "C" for a period of up to 130 working days after which he will receive the rate of an electrician "C" until he qualifies for a "B" rate as specified below. A transferred employee, not on job grading, will receive the hiring and 60 working
69
day rates as determined by the Company, provided he works a minimum of 130 working days before he becomes eligible to be classified as an electrician "C".
3.	A "C" electrician, who has successfully completed his intermediate course and has completed 66 2/3 of his total apprenticeship training hours and is capable of performing "B" electrician’s rate for the remainder of his period of the apprenticeship training programme.

The method of payment of the subsidy will not interfere with any available Government assistance to the employee. If Government assistance is discontinued, the Company will ensure employees receive their full weekly subsidization.
5.	Employees will be eligible for C.O.L.A. payments for the hours spent at the electrical apprenticeship school.
