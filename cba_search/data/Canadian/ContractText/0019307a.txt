7.03	Procedure for Settling Disputes
The parties recognize that it is most desirable that all efforts be made to develop and maintain a good relationship between employees and supervision.
It is recognized that a variety of disputes or complaints may arise, many of which can be resolved by discussion between the employee and his supervisor. To this end, employees are therefore urged to first attempt to resolve their complaints with their immediate supervisor as soon as possible.
If an employee has a complaint which he cannot resolve with his supervisor, a Steward may attempt to resolve the complaint on behalf of the employee. The employee will have the option of having a Union Shop Steward present at any meeting or hearing involving discipline.
Should a dispute or complaint become a grievance between the Company and employee(s) relating to terms and conditions of employment, or regarding an interpretation or alleged violation of this Agreement, an earnest effort will be made by both parties to settle the grievance through the grievance procedure.
All grievances submitted to the Company must clearly outline the nature of the grievance, the remedy sought and the section(s) of the Agreement which are alleged to have been violated. Any statement of fact or other written material presented by the Union will be without prejudice to the position of the employee or the Union. Similarly, any written material presented by the Company will be without prejudice to the position of the Company. The objective of each party
10
during the grievance procedure is to provide as much full disclosure as possible of all known facts regarding a grievance and that every effort should be made by the parties to resolve grievable matters at the lowest level of supervision.
Step 1 Within thirty (30) calendar days after the alleged grievance has arisen or within thirty (30) calendar days from the time the employee(s) should reasonably have known of the occurrence giving rise to the grievance, a Shop Steward may present the grievance in writing to the employee(s)' Foreman. At the option of the Shop Steward, the employee(s) may be in attendance. The Foreman shall record the facts as presented, investigate the grievance and provide a written answer within three (3) days.
Failing a satisfactory resolution, the grievance may proceed to Step 2.
Step 2 Within five (5Jdays from the time a decision was made or should have been made under Step 1, the Shop Steward may present the grievance in writing to the employee(s)' General Foreman. At the option of the Shop Steward the employee(s) may be in attendance. The employee(s)' General Foreman shall investigate the grievance and provide a written answer to the grievance within three (3) days.
Failing a satisfactory resolution, the grievance may proceed to Step 3
Step 3 Within five (5) days from the time a decision was made or should have been made under Step 2, the Chief Shop Steward or his designate may present the grievance to Company Management. At the option of the Chief Shop Steward, the employee(s) may be in attendance. The Management of the Company may also require the employee(s) concerned, and members of the supervisory staff concerned in or having knowledge of the grievance, to appear before them and give evidence regarding the grievance.
The Company Management will provide an answer in writing within five (5Jdays.
Failing a satisfactory resolution, the grievance may proceed to Step 4.
Step 4 Within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the answer at Step 3, the Union may, by written notice to the Company, refer the grievance to arbitration.
Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving such notice, the Company and Union will select the arbitrator or grievance investigator and mutually set a date(s) for an arbitration.
Cooling Off Period:
With the exception of a grievance claiming that an employee has been unjustly discharged or suspended, the thirty (30) calendar day period for referring a grievance to arbitration under Step 4 shall not commence until thirty (30) calendar days following an answer at Step 3.
NOTE: Prior to proceeding to arbitration, if new facts regarding the grievance are revealed and those facts were not previously considered during the grievance procedure, then the General Manager of the Company and the Local Union President may meet to discuss those facts.

A grievance claiming that an employee(s) has been unjustly discharged must be filed within five (5) days of the Union being notified, in writing, by the Company of such discharge, failing which any recourse to the grievance procedure shall be deemed to have been abandoned.

(a)	transfer any person in its employ at the operation who has served in a classification of employee as defined in Article 3, to a job classification within the definition, commensurate with his ability and efficiency, whether or not a vacancy exists provided such a transfer does not result in the displacement or layoff of any current job incumbent, or
(b)	transfer any person in its employ at the operation who has served in a classification of employee as defined in Article 3, to a job classification within the definition commensurate with his Bargaining Unit seniority, ability and efficiency, where such a transfer will result in the displacement or layoff of a current job incumbent.

Any employee may request information relative to his own Company and Bargaining Unit seniority. The President or Secretary of the Union will be supplied monthly with the necessary information relative to Company and Bargaining Unit seniority and base rate of any employee or group of employees. In the case of equal seniority, seniority rank shall be determined by the earliest date of hire at Fording River Operations, or, in the event these are equal, in order of the earliest employee number. The Company must provide for a posting of seniority lists every month and must provide a copy to the Union.

Basic coverage shall be one and one-halftimes (1.5 x) his previous year's annual income from employment with Elk Valley Coal Corporation. In the event the employee retires before the age of sixty-five (65), his insurance coverage shall remain constant from the time he retires until he reaches the age of sixty-five (65). When the employee reaches the age of sixty-five (65) his insurance coverage will be reduced to two thousand and five hundred dollars ($2,500). The coverage will be further reduced by an amount of three hundred dollars ($300) per year to one thousand dollars ($1,000) at age seventy (70), which amount will remain constant. The entire cost of the premiums for the aforementioned insurance shall be paid by the Company. Revisions to the coverage will be made annually following totalling of annual earnings, including monies earned by the employee while on Union business at the equivalent rate of pay the employee would have received had he been at work. The amounts of coverage will remain constant for a twelve (12) month period following such revisions. A basic Job Group 1 income rate will be assumed for new employees.
Optional Coverage
Within thirty (30) days of date of hire, an employee may purchase additional insurance equal in amount to one, two, or three times his previous year's annual income as outlined under Basic Coverage; spousal coverage may be purchased in an amount equal to 50% of the employee's optional coverage; and dependent child coverage may be purchased in an amount of $10,000 per child as specified by the insurance carrier. These Optional Life Insurance Coverages will be effective on the first day of the month following the date of hire and will be based on smoker and non-smoker rates. This additional coverage is optional, with the monthly cost to the employee, per $1,000 coverage, being the average cost of all coverage as determined by claims experience. This option shall not be available after retirement.
Revisions to Optional Coverage
Optional Coverage may be cancelled effective the last day of any calendar month, provided sufficient notice is given. Where an employee chooses not to participate when first eligible, or where, after a period of participation, an employee cancels and at a later date wishes to again participate, evidence of insurability satisfactory to the carrier will be required. To change his coverage, an employee must contact the Personnel Department of the Company and arrange to complete the appropriate application card.

ARTICLE 24. ON LOAN
24.01	In the interest of making the most flexible use of the skills available within the Company it is desirable from time to time to loan employees between various operations of the Company on a temporary basis. The following conditions will apply to employees on loan where the employee is required to live away from his normal place of residence.
(a)	All loan assignments shall be voluntary.
(b)	The rate of pay of an employee on loan will be the greater of his regular rate of pay or the rate provided for the job in the Collective Agreement in effect at the receiving operation. If there is no Collective Agreement in effect at the receiving operation the employee will be paid no less than his regular rate of pay.
(c)	Employees "on loan" will be required to work on one of the schedules in effect at the receiving operation. The duration of a normal work shift and all other provisions of the Collective Agreement in effect at the dispatching operation will prevail.
(d)	Accommodation and board will be selected by and provided at Company expense. Employees will be advised of accommodation and board prior to assignment.
(e)	Transportation will be supplied by the Company. If an employee elects to use his personal car for transportation, he will be reimbursed at the rate per kilometre which prevails in the Company regulations at the time the assignment is carried out. Such reimbursement will be made for the initial trip and the trip home at the conclusion of the loan assignment.
(f)	Travel time paid in any one day will be limited to eight (8) hours. It is agreed that employees who travel on their rest days will be paid at the applicable overtime rate.

(j)	The Company will advise the Union in writing of employees accepting loan assignments.
ARTICLE 25. CONTRACTING OUT
25.01
(a) The Company recognizes the Union's concern over the Company employing contractors to work as part of regular maintenance and regular operating crews normally composed of employees engaged in routine maintenance and routine production work at its operations.
The Company will, therefore, attempt to eliminate the employment of contractors working as part of regular maintenance and regular operating crews, having due regard to the needs of efficiency of operations, the time available to do the work, and to the availability of equipment, skills, manpower and services.
50
(b) Under certain circumstances the Company finds it necessary to employ independent contractors to perform certain work at the operations. On those occasions where the employees of the contractor are required to perform routine maintenance and routine production work, and work directly with EVCC employees as an integral part of the normal maintenance and normal operating crews, the Company agrees that such EVCC employees who work directly with the contractor's employees will be afforded the first opportunity for overtime on that particular job assignment ahead of the contractor's employees. In addition, where overtime is required on a normal maintenance or normal production job which is being performed by contractor's employees only and such work can be performed by EVCC employees without reducing the efficiency of the job, then such overtime will be first offered to EVCC employees who normally do this work.
25.02	The Company agrees that it will not contract out work at the operations which work is normally performed by employees if, as a direct result, an employee will be laid off or demoted, and such employee is qualified to perform the work.
25.03	The Company will review with the Union every month the number of contractors employed at the operations and the nature of their work.
25.04	It is understood that if work that is considered normal bargaining unit work at Fording River Operations is done by contractors or other persons who are not employees of the Company, the Company will ensure that the intent of the Safety and Health and Contracting Out Articles of this Agreement are applied by such contractors or other persons. Construction work performed by contractors or other persons who are not employees of the Company shall not be affected by this Agreement.
The Company shall ensure that such contractors and other persons are made aware and conform to the normal operating and safety procedures of Fording River Operations and the Mines Act and participate as necessary in pertinent portions of the Company's safety induction program.
ARTICLE 26. TRADE DESCRIPTIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR SETTLING DISPUTES
26.01	Intent
The Company and the Union agree to establish a procedure to ensure that disagreements over which trades should perform trades work will be settled in an equitable manner without stoppage of work. This procedure will recognize that some trades work is common to more than one trade.
26.02	Descriptions
To assist in settling disagreements the Company and the Union agree that the following trades descriptions developed by the Trades Committee shall apply to the Company's operation: Carpenter, Heavy Duty Mechanic, Industrial Electrician, Industrial Instrument Mechanic, Lineman, Machinist, Millwright, Painter, Steamfitter-Pipefitter, Steel Fabricator, Welder, Automotive Mechanic, Sheetmetal (Tinsmith), Certified Industrial Warehouseman and Auto Body Repairman.
Where work is recognized by the description as being specific to a trade (or trades) then it shall be performed by members of that trade (or trades).
Any description which is subsequently developed or modified shall be in the following form: purpose of the trade; shop and field skills of the trade; specific tasks of the trade for the purpose of safety and efficiency; tasks in common with other trades.
51
It is agreed that:
(a)	Trades descriptions are intended to outline the major aspects of a trade and are not intended to be a complete listing of duties and responsibilities.
(b)	Skills and tasks will be added and deleted as the trades change, new materials become available and new or revised methods are developed.
(c)	All tradesmen will not be expected to perform all the tasks listed until the opportunity for appropriate training has been provided.
Subsequently developed or modified trades descriptions which are agreed to by the trades committee will be submitted to the Company and the Union respectively for approval. Any such description on which the committee is unable to agree shall be submitted to arbitration under the grievance procedure.
Those involved in settling disagreements will be guided by the descriptions of the trades in question. Specific tasks will have preference over common tasks in resolving differences.
26.03	Trades Committee
A committee will be appointed consisting of two (2) employees representing the U.S.W. Local 7884 Union, and two (2) representatives of the Company. One man from the Union’s appointees and one man from the Company appointees will be designated co-chairmen. The committee will have the following duties:
(a)	To prepare or be responsible for preparing trade descriptions.
(b)	To amend descriptions, to correct omissions and matters related to advancing technology, new materials, and new or revised methods.
(C) To recommend solutions to disagreements referred to in marginal paragraph 26.04 (c) below.
The Company will reimburse employees who may lose time from their normal work as a result of acting as Union representatives on the committee at straight time rates to a maximum of eight (8) hours in a day. This paragraph will also apply to time spent off the property to attend meetings called by the Company and do committee work as authorized by the Company CoChairman. Requests for off property trades work will not be unreasonably withheld.
26.04	Disagreements
Disagreementsarising underthis procedure will be settled in the following manner:
The tradesman(men) involved, with or without a Shop Steward, will attempt to solve the disagreement with his immediate supervisor.
Failing satisfactory settlement within four (4) hours after the disagreement has been brought to the attention of the immediate supervisor, the disagreement will be submitted to the senior trades supervisor(s) at the operation.
Failing satisfactory settlement within twenty-four (24)* hours by the senior trades supervisor(s), the disagreement will be submitted immediately to the trades committee.
Failing satisfactory settlement within forty-eight (48)* hours by the trades committee, the disagreement will be submitted to the arbitration procedure. The parties agree that the decision handed down under this procedure will be binding on both parties.
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
52
(e)	While the disagreement is being resolved the Company will assign the work to
employees, and the work will be performed by those employees to whom it is assigned.
* Time limits exclude weekends and statutory holidays.
26.05	Special Circumstances
Qualified employees and technicians associated with development work may perform trades tasks while building, developing, and/or testing prototypes or other equipment. When the equipment is turned over to operations the maintenance and repair of the equipment will be performed by the appropriate trade(s).
ARTICLE 27. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
27.01	Purpose
The parties acknowledge that the long term interests of both the Company and the employees are best served if the Company maintains and, if possible, improves its competitive position.
In order to do this, the Company may make technological changes. However, both parties also recognize the importance of lessening the effects of technological change as much as reasonably possible on the security and earnings of employees, particularly those more senior in service, who may be displaced as a result of technological change.
27.02	Definition
For the purpose of this Article, "Technological Change" means the automation, modification, or replacement of machinery or equipment, or the mechanization or automation of duties which causes the displacement and/or layoff of an employee(s).
27.03	Prior Notice
The Company shall provide to the Union, in writing, ninety (90) days notice, or more if reasonable to do so, of the implementation of any technological change.
27.04	Company-Union Meetings
On request by either party, the Employee Relations Department and Union President, or his designate, will meet for the purpose of discussing the effects of any technological change. Further meetings will be held, as far in advance as practical of the time the technological change is to take place, for the purpose of implementing the specific application of this Article. At all meetings, meaningful discussions shall be held to resolve issues arising from the effects or implementation of technological change.
27.05	Displacement/Lay Off
(a) If technological change causes displacement, the affected employee(s) shall be covered as outlined by Article 14.18.
If technological change causes lay off, the affected employee(s) shall be covered by Article 14.10, or, at the option of the employee, Article 27.06.
27.06	Severance Benefit
In preference to being laid off as a result of technological change, an employee(s) who has at least one (1) year of continuous service at Fording River Operations, may request in writing to accept the following severance pay and to terminate his employment with the Company. In this case the employee(s) shall have no recall rights under this Agreement. Severance pay will be provided based on the following:
53
(a) two (2) weeks' pay at his normal base rate of pay,
plus one (1) weeks' pay at his normal base rate of pay for each complete year of service at Fording River Operations, to a maximum of eight (8) weeks' pay at his normal base rate of pay.
For the purpose of severance pay, one (1) week shall be defined as forty (40) working hours.
ARTICLE 28. HUMANITY FUND
28.01	Effective September 1, 1989, the Company agrees to deduct on a bi-weekly basis the amount of one (1) cent per hour from the wages of all employees in the bargaining unit for all hours worked during the month and, prior to the 15th day of the month following, to pay the amount so deducted to the "Humanity Fund" and to forward such payment to United Steelworkers National Office, and to advise in writing both the Humanity Fund at the aforementioned address and the local union that such payment has been made, and the amount of such payment.
28.02	It is understood and agreed that participation by any employee in the bargaining unit in the program of deductions set forth above may be discontinued by any employee in the bargaining unit after the receipt by the Company and the local union of that employee's written statement of his desire to discontinue such deductions from his pay.

Effective June 21,1996, the Company and the Union agree to the following provision to replace section B.3 for the term of the Collective Agreement:
"The twelve (12) hour shift schedule has an average of forty-two (42) hours per week over the eight (8) week work cycle.

SUBJECT: Counselling Interviews
The Company uses a counselling procedure regarding improvements or lapses in employee work performance and recognition of meritorious work performance. Generally, the supervisor involved prepares a Counselling Interview Report (C.I.R.) after such counselling sessions. A counselling session is a matter between the supervisor and the individual employee.
One purpose of counselling is to identify and correct lapses in work performance so that formal disciplinary action will not be necessary. Without such a procedure, it is likely that there would be far more discipline given out for what could be easily correctable work performance situations.
In all cases where a C.I.R. is prepared for filing, the employee will be advised and given the opportunity to read, discuss, and sign (as acknowledgement of having read) the C.I.R. with his supervisor. Each employee will be given a copy of the Counselling Interview Report if requested. The counselling procedure is a positive step in establishing and maintaining good relationships between employees and supervision.
The parties agree to meet to discuss any concerns re: the application of this procedure.

Memorandum of Agreement 4 Days On, 4 Days Off, 12 Hour Shift Schedule
All provisions of the Collective Agreement shall apply to the employees covered by this Agreement except as modified or restricted by a clause of this Agreement.
The parties shall mutually agree before any employee or group of employees are included in the four days on and four days off, twelve hour shift schedule, provided these inclusions are approved by the Minister of Mines and the Minister of Labour. Such employees will be covered by this Agreement with such modifications as may be required and which are agreed to by the parties.
A.	Employees Covered by Agreement
The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all employees engaged in the four (4) days on
and four (4) days off, twelve (12) hour shift schedule.
B.	General Conditions
1.	The normal work day shall be twelve (12) consecutive hours of work at the employee's designated working place in a twenty-four (24) hour period.
2.	The work period shall be an employee's complete period of days starting with his first scheduled work day and concluding at the end of the first occurring rest days.
3.	The work cycle shall be forty-two (42) consecutive days. Schedules of work shall average forty (40) hours per week over the complete work cycle. The average forty (40) hour week shall be accomplished by banking the last twelve (12) hour shift worked as a rest day once during every work cycle of forty-two (42) days, or another twelve (12) hour shift designated by the Company during the forty-two (42) day cycle instead of the last twelve (12) hour shift during the work cycle. Such twelve (12) hour shifts during the work cycle shall apply to all employees on the shift in the department including employees assigned or transferred to the shift during the work cycle.
A twelve (12) hour shift designated by the Company for each work cycle will, provided the needs of the operation are met, precede or follow the employees' four (4) consecutive days of rest; and/or precede or follow statutory holidays not worked by the employees.
An employee assigned to work the last twelve (12) hour shift during the work cycle or another twelve (12) hour shift as designated by the Company during the work cycle instead of the last shift shall have the option of working that shift at overtime rates in lieu of banking a rest day.
The accumulated banked rest days will be scheduled as time off by the Company in periods of four (4) successive working days. However, if some other arrangements for taking accumulated rest days off can be arrived at by an employee and the Company which is mutually agreeable, this may be done. Accumulated rest days may not exceed six (6)i n number.
4.	The work schedule of each employee shall be four (4) consecutive days of work followed by four (4) consecutive days of rest. The four (4) consecutive days of work shall consist of two (2) consecutive day shifts of twelve (12) hours each, followed by two (2) consecutive night shifts of twelve (12) hours each or such other shift arrangement as may be agreed upon by the parties.
73
5.	The normal shift will be day shift, commencing at 7:00 A.M., and night shift commencing at 7:00 P.M. or such other arrangements as may be agreed upon by the parties.
6.	Two (2) paid lunch periods of twenty (20) minutes duration each will be provided during the twelve (12) hour shift. The first twenty (20) minute lunch period must be scheduled, for twelve hour shifts, to be taken during the fourth - fifth hour, from shift start, and the second break must be taken during the eighth - ninth hour from shift start. This time frame may be varied by mutual agreement. During such lunch period, the employee shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of service. Employees are responsible for providing their own lunches.
7.	Notwithstanding 6 above, for those employees working in the Mine Production Department except those in the classification of dispatcher:
a)	one (1) paid lunch period of fifteen (15) minutes duration and one (1) paid lunch period of twenty (20) minutes duration will be provided during the twelve (12) hour shift. The fifteen (15) minute lunch period must be scheduled for twelve hour shifts, to betaken between 9:00 and 11:00 (A.M. and P.M.) and the twenty (20) minute lunch period must betaken between 12:30 and 2:30 (A.M. and P.M.). This time frame may be varied by mutual agreement. During such lunch periods, the employee shall continue all necessary supervision of machinery and maintenance of service. Employees are responsible for providing their own lunches.
b)	In addition, the above employees shall be provided one (1) ergonomic health break of twenty (20) minutes duration during the twelve (12) hour shift. This break must be scheduled, for twelve hour shifts, to be taken between 4:00 and 6:00 (A.M. and P.M.).
C.	Overtime Work
Overtime occurs when an employee is required to work more than his scheduled hours of work
in a work day or on a scheduled rest day. Overtime shall be paid as follows:
1.	For the first six (6) hours of overtime worked during an employee's work period, the rate of pay shall be one and one-half (1-112) times the base rate of the employee.
2.	For all overtime worked by an employee during his work period which is in excess of six (6)h ours overtime during that period, the rate of pay shall be two (2) times the base rate of the employee.
3.	Overtime which is in excess of six (6)h ours overtime during an employee's work period shall be voluntary.
All overtime in a work period is subject to the following conditions:
(a)	where urgent or necessary relief work is essential to the continuance of the ordinary working of the mine, but only on an occasional basis and not, in any case, for a longer period than sixteen (16) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period;
OR
(b)	where an emergency exists where life or property is in danger;
OR
(c)

Employees working overtime may elect, at the time the overtime is worked, to take time off with pay in lieu of overtime premium. When an employee elects to
74
take time off with pay in lieu of overtime premium, he shall be paid for the overtime worked at his regular straight time hourly rate exclusive of any premium and shall bank an amount of time off at his regular straight time hourly rate, which will be paid for by the overtime premium he would have been paid had he not elected to take time off. Banked time off is to be taken as arranged by mutual agreement between the Company and the employee. For any banked time not taken the Company will pay the employee the amount of the deferred premium at termination or year end. With mutual agreement, an employee may arrange to take banked time off in the next calendar year provided such arrangements are made and approved prior to year end.
4.	Where the Company changes an employee's work schedule during a work period and the employee is required to work in excess of his normal work day of his previous schedule or on the rest days of his previous schedule, he shall be paid overtime rates for that time worked. The new schedule will become the employee's regular schedule at the conclusion of the rest days of his previous schedule.
5.	(a) When an employee reports on any assigned shift and is sent home because no
work of any kind is available or so that he may come to work at a later time, he shall be paid six (6) hours at his base rate plus shift premium or weekend premium if applicable for reporting on his regular shift.

Schedule "A", Cost of Living Allowance
Each employee covered by this Agreement shall receive a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) during the term of this Agreement as hereinafter provided.
The Cost of Living Allowance shall be based on the Consumer Price Index- Canada (all items - base 1986 equals 100) published by Statistics Canada (hereinafter referred to as CPI).
The Cost of Living Allowance shall be equal to one cent(10) for each 0.11 point rise in the CPI as hereinafter determined counting as a full cent any fraction of one-half cent ($0,005) or more.
The Cost of Living Allowance shall only be paid for hours actually worked and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be included in the calculation of overtime rates, vacation and statutory holiday pay, incentive plans or any other premiums or benefits.
In the event that Statistics Canada does not issue the CPI on or before the beginning of the periods referred to, any pay adjustments required shall be made at the beginning of the first pay period after publication of the CPI and shall be retroactive to the commencement of the appropriate period. In the event that a retroactive adjustment is made by Statistics Canada to the CPI, it is agreed that the paid allowance to the employees will not be adjusted retroactively.
6. The parties to this Agreement agree that the continuance of the Cost of Living Allowance will depend on availability of the monthly Statistics Canada CPI in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the index for 1986. If Statistics Canada changes the form or basis of calculating the CPI, the parties shall attempt to determine an appropriate index figure by agreement. If agreement is not reached the parties agree to request Statistics Canada to make available for the rest of this Agreement a monthly CPI in its present form calculated on the same basis as the index for 1986.
Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) will be in effect from May I , 1993 to April 30, 1996.
8. COLA payments shall be calculated annually on the basis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase in the previous 12 month period from March to March. COLA payments will apply based only on an increase in the CPI in excess of 5% in the previous year. COLA payments for the amount the CPI exceeds 5% will be made on the basis of Schedule "A". COLA adjustments are not to be rolled into wages.
