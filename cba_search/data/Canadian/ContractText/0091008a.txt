6.01	The Company agrees to pay and the Union agrees to accept, for the term of this Agreement, the schedule of wage rates in effect at the date hereof as set forth in Schedule “A” of the Wage Rates and Job Classification attached hereto and forming part of this Agreement.
A)	Schedule “A” wage rates and job classifications are guaranteed only until piece rates are established.
6.02	The Company may, at its discretion and in lieu of sending an employee home at any time, assign such employee who is waiting for work to another operation. The compensation for such work done in the case of an hourly worker shall be his standard hourly rate as long as due diligence is maintained. The Compensation for such work, in the case of a piece-rated worker shall be his current average hourly rate or piece-rate earnings as long as due diligence is maintained, whichever is greater.
A)	In the event that the employee requests an operation in lieu of going home, he shall be compensated by 80 percent of his

quarterly average or piece-rate earnings on the operation, whichever is greater.
B)	An employee’s quarterly average is computed four times a year. The computation is based on the employee’s earnings during the period of:
January, February, March April, May, June July, August, September October, November, December
The quarterly average is computed by the payroll department and is arrived at by dividing an employee’s regular pay by the number of hours worked.
For example:
160 hours at $6.50 per hour =$1040.00 160 hours at $6.25 per hour =$1000.00 80 hours at $6.35 per hour = $ 508.00 40 hours at $6.55 per hour = $ 262,00 40 hours at $6.00 per hour = $ 240.00
480	$3050.00
Therefore, $3050.00 divided by 480 hours equals $6.35 per hour. The operator’s quarterly average of $6.35 per hour will be used during the next quarter as a base for computation of Excess and Waiting time and Holiday pay. Make-up pay will not be used as part of the gross earnings for the computation of quarterly averages.
6.03	Since employment is dependent upon the demand for the Company’s products, the parties hereto recognize the importance of attaining and maintaining maximum employee efficiency, and productivity and of continual progress in the development of improved manufacturing methods to meet customer requirements on a competitive basis.

E)	It is agreed that the Union Engineer shall have access to the plant for the purpose of time studying any operation in question. Complete background data for thorough knowledge of the job will be supplied by the Company. It is further agreed that completed time studies of both parties will be exchanged concurrently.
F)	The company agrees that, if piece-work rates are adjusted, then incumbent employees in the job so effected will not lose earnings as a result, unless the change in job content of the operation amounts to five (5) percent or more. The Union agrees that, if a piece-work rate is adjusted due to a change in methods, process, materials, conditions or mathematical error, and such change amounts to five percent (5) change or more, then incumbent employees shall be paid at the new piece-work rate established as a result of such change.
