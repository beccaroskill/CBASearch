OF THE SECOND PART
WITNESSETH that the parties hereto agree as follows:
The Union and the Company negotiated and reached this agreement based on the following principles and using the principled negotiation process.
The parties are committed to the strategic pillars of Grow People, Grow Safety, Grow Partnerships, Grow Safe Production, Grow Reserves and Grow Margins, and a collective agreement that is competitive and clearly expresses the intent of the parties.
The Union and the Company are committed to establishing and using a joint problem solving process to deal with differences and grievances. The process is outlined in Article 5.01 of this agreement.
6
The Union and the Company have agreed to deal with each other and all employees based on the belief that Company representatives, Union representatives and employees are trustworthy, responsible and accountable.
It has been jointly recognized that the principles of honesty, integrity, fairness, trust, openness, respect for the individual and teamwork must be used to improve our ongoing relationship.
The Union and the Company are desirous to grow the relationship developed during negotiations to effectively deal with and advance issues that arise during the term of this collective agreement. They recognize that ongoing consultations and open communications will forward this objective.
The parties agree to meet monthly wherein matters of mutual concern and interest can be freely and candidly discussed, with a view to exploring possible solutions which are acceptable and beneficial to employees, the Company and the Union.
Topics to be reviewed may include, but not be limited to, contracting out, temporary employees, job postings, overtime work, training, and hours of work.
The parties recognize that a fair and honest process for performance reviews as outlined in the Employee Performance Appraisal Policy is a necessary complement to the priority put on seniority and qualifications. This process must be supported by management, union, supervision, and employees for it to be successful.

ARTICLE 1 DEFINITION
1.01 (a)
1.01	(b)
1.02
1.03
1.04
The words "employee" or "employees" wherever used in this Agreement shall mean respectively an employee or employees included in the bargaining unit defined in the Certificate of the Ontario Labour Relations Board dated the 27th day of May, 1969, unless it appears otherwise from the context, as follows: All employees at its operations in the Townships of Tisdale, Whitney, Shaw and Deloro including Porcupine Peninsular, Goldhawk Open Pit, Goldhawk and Night Hawk Lake Mine in the District of Cochrane, except Front Line Supervisors and persons above this rank, Training Supervisors, Office and Technical Staff, Refiners, Security Officers and persons regularly employed for not more than twenty-four hours per week and students employed during the school vacation period.
The school vacation periods are defined as April 1st to September 15th and December 15th to January 7th.
For convenience and dealing with this Collective Agreement, the departments shall be Mine, Mill, Asset Management and Open Pit.
An emergency is defined as any potential life threatening situation, major production interruption or threat to the environment. This definition will apply to all articles where “emergency” is referenced.
In Articles 9.03 and 9.05 the word orientation will mean familiarization (not training) on a job for which
8
the employee is qualified. Orientation on any job will not exceed 60 hours.
1.05 In Article 9.07 a temporary employee is defined as an individual that is hired directly by the Company to perform a temporary job. A contract employee is defined as an individual that is employed by a third party performing temporary work under the Supervision of the Company.
ARTICLE 2 RECOGNITION
2.01	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all its employees included in the bargaining unit defined in Article 1 with respect to rates of pay, hours of work and other working conditions as set out in this Agreement.
2.02	(a) Supervisors shall not perform work which deprives a
bargaining unit employee of his / her regular work or overtime opportunity. A supervisor may perform such work for the purpose of instructing employees, or for familiarization, training, demonstration or where there is an emergency.
If a Supervisor is found to perform bargaining unit work contrary to this Article, the Company will pay $100 to the USW Humanity Fund.
2.02	(b) The Company shall have the right to select and train
bargaining unit employees to become Spare Supervisors or Spare Dispatchers. Both parties agree that this is a designated position and shall not be subject to the posting procedure.
9
Spare Supervisors shall only be used to replace the regular supervisor whenever the supervisor is away due to vacation, sickness, meetings, training, bereavement, special projects, shutdowns and other leave of absence.
Each Spare Supervisor or Spare Dispatcher may only act in this capacity to a maximum of 925 hours per calendar year with no option of extension. Any employee who surpasses 925 hours in a calendar year while in the role of Spare Supervisor or Spare Dispatcher will lose all seniority.
2.02	(c) The Company will fully support the Spare Supervisor in dealing with charges alleging breaches of any Legislation pertaining to Health, Safety and the Environment, unless disregard for workplace legislation and / or Company policies are involved. Save for exceptional circumstances, to be determined by the Company at its sole discretion, this support is confined to the disposal of the initial charges.
A Spare Supervisor who is charged with a work related offence shall report the matter immediately to his / her Manager / Superintendent, who will direct the matter to the Mine General Manager. The Spare Supervisor will participate in any related investigation providing full details of dates, times, who was involved, the outcome, witnesses, environmental factors and any other information that may be helpful in responding to these charges. Any reports submitted in the course of the incident investigation shall be addressed to Legal Counsel marked “privileged and confidential.”
Subject to approval by the Company, the Spare Supervisor may retain legal counsel of his / her choice.
10
The Company will reimburse the Spare Supervisor for reasonable legal expense.
The Company will decide in its sole discretion, the extent to which it will pay any fines and whether any disciplinary action will be taken.
2.02	(d) Any bargaining unit employee acting as a Spare
Supervisor will not give out discipline or conduct a performance review to another bargaining unit employee.
2.03	The Company and the Union both agree that contracting out is a concern. To that, both parties, through the Contracting-Out Committee will attempt to minimize the amount of contracting out. In view of this, the Company will contract out, if necessary work that cannot be done in a timely way due to pressure of other work, lack of expertise, or where there is a consistent cost advantage. Such contracting out shall not directly result in the lay-off of an employee.
Conversely, where the Company can match or beat outside costs and has the time and resources to do the work with available manpower, the Company will not contract out.
A Joint Committee consisting of four (4) Union representatives and four (4) Management representatives representing the UG Mine, Open Pit, Mill and Maintenance Departments will meet monthly before the Union/Management Committee meeting to discuss planned and future contracting out of work. Each party shall select a co-chair from members of the Committee. If a Committee member is unable to attend a meeting a designate from that Department will attend the meeting.
11
Whenever required, other union or management personnel may attend the meetings as additional resources. The Company will provide the Committee the statistics of past contracting out work and future planned work. The Company will provide an on-site office with a computer system linked to the Company's electronic mail system.
The Company agrees that it will meet, as required with the President of the Local Union or his / her designate to discuss information concerning its contracting out. The Company will provide information describing the work to be contracted out, the estimated start and the completion date of the contract, the estimated number of contractor employees and the reasons for contracting the work out, prior to the start of any such work. Contractors will not perform work outside the scope of their contract.
Responsibilities of the Committee:
1.	Review all past and future contracting out to determine whether the decision to contract out was a viable one, and to determine the associated learnings.
2.	Make recommendations to management for improvements that would reduce the level of contracting out.
3.	All wages and benefits for committee work will be paid by the Company.
4.	Minutes of the meeting will be taken by a clerk and posted on bulletin boards with action items inputted into a Contracting Out Database.
12
Contracting Out Information and Review System:
(a)	Major Projects
(Projects which are in excess of one million dollars)
As soon as reasonably possible after receiving final approval for funding a major Project, the Company will notify the Local Union in writing of the Major Project using the Notification Format. The Local Union Executive and the Management Committee will review the work content of the Major Project during the monthly Union / Management meetings and the Company shall give consideration to any comments or suggestions proposed at such meeting for the performance of any contract segment of the work by bargaining unit members.
(b)	Mid-Size Projects
(Projects which are in excess of seventy-five thousand but not more than one million dollars)
The Company will provide the Committee every month with a list of Mid-Size Projects for which either final funding approval has been received or which have been contracted out in the last month reporting period. The list shall show for each project the nature of the work, its expected duration and the approximate number of contractor workers involved. In the case of Mid-Size Projects for which funding approval has been received, the Company will endeavor to provide the Committee with notice of such Mid-Size Project as soon as reasonably possible after receiving the final approval. At the next Contract Out Committee meeting, the Committee will review the work content of the Mid-Size Projects and the Company shall give consideration to 13
any comments or suggestions proposed at such meeting for the performance of any contract segment of the work by bargaining unit employees. In cases where the work has already been contracted, such consideration shall relate, to the extent it is reasonable and possible, to future contracting out of similar work. The parties shall also use this information to develop trend analyses of the contracting of specific types of work.
(c)	Small Contracts
(Work contracts which are a minimum of ten thousand dollars up to seventy-five thousand dollars)
The Company will, to the extent the information is reasonably available, provide the Committee every month with a list of the Small Contracts which have been contracted out in the last one month reporting period in order that the Committee can review the work content of the Small Contracts and develop trend analyses of the contracting of specific types of work.
(d)	The Notification Format for Major Projects will contain the following information:
i)	The location of work.
ii)	The type of work.
iii)	A description of the work.
iv)	An outline of the skills and equipment involved.
v)	An estimate of the duration of the work.
vi)	An outline of any anticipated use of bargaining unit employees.
14
vii)	A description of the factors affecting the work schedule.
(e)	The Contracting Out Committee will produce a list of Contracted work and Contractors that will be exempt from this process.
ARTICLE 3 MANAGEMENT

right, power and responsibility:

(b)	to hire, discharge, classify, direct, transfer, promote, demote, lay-off, suspend or discipline employees, provided, however, that any exercise of these rights in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or a claim that an employee has been discharged or disciplined without just cause shall be subject to the provisions of the Grievance Procedure; and

23
ARTICLE 7 DISCHARGE CASES
7.01	If an employee who has completed his / her probationary period is discharged from his / her employment after the date hereof and believes that his / her discharge results from an unjust application of the provisions of this Agreement, he / she may have the matter dealt with under the Grievance Procedure.

25
employment deemed terminated if he / she:
(a)	quits, or
(b)	is discharged, or

An employee laid off can also apply his/her seniority to displace upward another employee with less seniority provided that he/she previously held that job, is qualified to meet the job description outlined in this collective agreement and is able to immediately perform the job with orientation and/or demonstration.
(c)	Employees must exercise their seniority within ten (10) calendar days of being informed of such displacement or they will be deemed to have made an election under (d).
(d)	If a lay-off occurs, an employee may elect to accept lay off status rather than exercise his / her seniority to replace a less senior employee. Once having made this decision, he / she shall be eligible for recall. Recalled employees will be entitled up to 60 hours of orientation and / or demonstration and familiarization to safely perform the job that he / she was recalled to.
(e)	In the event of lay-off due to the downsizing of any department, and provided the employee works his / her last scheduled shift, all employees laid off will receive eighty (80) hours pay at their basic hourly rate for each completed year of service to a maximum of two thousand eighty (2,080) hours. This severance will be paid at expiration of recall rights or when the employee gives up his / her right to recall.
