THIS AGREEMENT made as of the 16th day of September 2011;
BETWEEN:
VALE
MANITOBA OPERATIONS, (hereinafter called “the Company”) OF THE FIRST PART
and -
UNITED STEELWORKERS,
LOCAL 6166, (hereinafter called “the Union”)
OF THE SECOND PART
WHEREAS by certificate of The Manitoba Labour Board dated the 31st of May, 1962, it was certified that the Union is the properly chosen bargaining agent for all employees of the Company in the Thompson, Manitoba operations except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, foremen, shift bosses and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
AND WHEREAS it is the intent and purpose of the Union and the Company to further harmonious industrial relationships between the Company and those employees:
NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS
1.01	The expression “basic rate” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean at any time with respect to any employee that straight time rate per hour, (exclusive of all premium pay such as holiday pay, shift premium, Sunday premium and overtime) to which such employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement in respect of the work which he is performing at such time.
1.02	The word “department” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean the departments as set forth in Schedule “A” hereto.
9
1.03	The word “employee” or "employees” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean all employees of the Company in its Thompson and other operations north of the 53rd parallel of latitude in Manitoba except office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foremen and those excluded by The Manitoba Labour Relations Act.
1.04	Until an employee has worked at least five hundred and twenty (520) hours since the date of his most recent hiring he shall be a “probationary employee” and the words “probationary employee” wherever used in this Agreement shall have that meaning.
1.05(a) The word “seniority” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean an employee's length of continuous employment with the Company since the date of his most recent hiring, less the periods to be subtracted under Clause 15.20.
1.05(b) The word “seniority ranking” wherever used in this Agreement shall mean the relative seniority of an employee to others in the department in which he is then employed.
1.06 Whenever the masculine gender appears in this Agreement it shall also mean the feminine gender, unless the context requires otherwise.
ARTICLE 2 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
2.01	The Union recognizes that it is exclusively the function and right of the Company to direct the working forces and to hire, promote, demote, transfer, suspend or lay off employees, and also the right of the Company to discipline or discharge any employee for just cause.
2.02	The Union further recognizes the right of the Company to operate and manage its business in accordance with its commitments and responsibilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole and exclusive prerogative of the Company to decide on the location of its plants and mines, the products to be mined and/or processed, the schedules of production, the methods of mining and processing used, the number of employees needed by the Company at any time, operating techniques, methods, machinery and equipment, and to exercise jurisdiction over all operations, buildings, machinery and tools.
2.03	The Company agrees that any exercise of rights and powers under this Article in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the grievance procedure.
10
ARTICLE 3 - UNION RECOGNITION
3.01	The Company recognizes that the Union is the bargaining agent of the employees and has the exclusive authority to bargain collectively on their behalf with respect to rates of pay, hours of work, and terms and conditions of employment of employees as set out in The Labour Relations Act.
3.02	Subject to the requirements of operations, (including necessary instruction of employees and any cases of an emergency nature) foremen, supervisors, and other persons employed by the Company but not employees as defined in this Agreement shall not perform work, which is normally done by employees, where employees are reasonably available to do such work.
3.03	The Company understands that the Union has a legitimate concern about contracting out because of its effect upon such matters as job security and job opportunity and will therefore use its best efforts to minimize the amount of production or maintenance work to be contracted out.
The Union understands that the Company has a legitimate concern about the efficiency of the operation and that sometimes it is necessary to contract work out.
Accordingly, work may be contracted out if:
a)	it has been consistently performed by contractors in the past; or
b)	qualified Company employees are not available in sufficient numbers to perform the work or when special skills, equipment or tools are required to perform the work; or
c)	it is work of an emergency nature provided, however, that in the case of work of an emergency nature, the Company will, where practicable, give reasonable consideration to the use of employees who have the necessary skills to perform such work.
Some examples of work which will be contracted out are major capital projects, major construction, shaft sinking and related development, and specialized work such as stack inspection and repair.
A joint "Contracting Out Committee” will be established for the purpose of reviewing work currently contracted out and any planned contracting out of work. The Union representatives on the Committee may make recommendations which must be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in its decision making process.
11
The Contracting Out Committee will consist of the Contracting Out Coordinator from the Local Union who will Co-Chair the committee, a designated Company Contracting Out Co-Chair, and one (1) Company representative and one (1) Union representative from each of the areas as set out in Schedule "H”.
The Contracting Out Committee will meet as often as it deems necessary but not less than once each calendar month. In addition, the Company and Union CoChairs of the Contracting Out Committee will provide a quarterly update to the Manitoba Operations Executive Steering Committee.
The Company will inform the Union Contracting Out Coordinator as soon as possible that work of an emergency nature is being contracted out. The Company will use its best efforts to keep such work to a minimum.
The Company agrees to provide the Contracting Out Committee with the following information regarding work that is contracted out or work planned to be contracted out: location of the work; type of work to be done; crafts or occupations involved; expected duration; numbers of both contract employees and bargaining unit employees to be used.
The Company will use its best efforts to:
a)	give the Union thirty (30) days notice of work to be contracted out; and
b)	hold a meeting in the first quarter of each year to review contracting out activities from the previous twelve (12) month period and major contracts to be awarded or renewed in the current year; and
c)	review with the Contracting Out Committee vacation and shutdown work to be contracted out prior to a vacation or production shutdown.
If ongoing, sustained need for new skills, not currently available in the Company, is identified, the Company will use its best efforts to train sufficient employees in such skills.
The Union and the Company agree that they will jointly examine means, including but not limited to training, to increase mine development efficiencies by Inco employees, with the intent of increasing the potential for reducing the amount of mine development work to be contracted out.
No employee will be demoted or laid off as a direct result of work being contracted out by the Company.
The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to members of the joint Contracting Out Committee.
12
3.04	Except with the consent of the Union, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, during the last thirty (30) days of the term of this Agreement the Company will not transfer any member of the bargaining unit to office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, Foreman or any position in which the individual is not an "employee” within the meaning of The Labour Relations Act.
ARTICLE 4 - UNION SECURITY
4.01	The Company shall, during the life of this Agreement, deduct as a condition of each employee's continued employment, Union dues in the amount certified by the Union to the Company to be currently in effect according to the Union Constitution, and remit the same in the week following the pay period in which such deduction is made to the International Treasurer, United Steelworkers accompanied by a completed form R-115 except that the line "3. Earnings $” shall not be completed. The Company will, at the time of remittance, name the employees from whose pay such payment has been deducted and name the employees whose employment has terminated in the period for which payment is being made.
4.02	The said deductions shall commence, in the case of each employee who is in the employment of the Company at the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of September, 2011 and, in the case of each employee entering the employment of the Company subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, with the month of hire if five (5) or more days are worked. In the event five (5) or more days are not worked in the month of hire, the said deductions will commence with the month following the month of hire.
4.03 Commencing March 1, 2012, the Company will on or before March 1st in each year furnish to each employee a statement of the total Union dues which have been deducted from such employee's pay cheques and remitted to the Union during the preceding calendar year.
4.04	In Clause 4.05 "Temporary Staff Employee” means an employee who is temporarily transferred to office staff, engineering staff, geological staff, or Foreman.
4.05	In the week following each pay period that would have been a pay period for a Temporary Staff Employee if he had not been a Temporary Staff Employee, the Company shall remit to the Financial Secretary of the Union an amount equal to the Union dues that would have been remitted to the Financial Secretary of the Union under Clause 4.01 with respect to that Temporary Staff Employee if he had not been a Temporary Staff Employee in that pay period.
13
ARTICLE 5 - NO DISCRIMINATION
5.01	The parties mutually agree that any employee of the Company may become a member of the Union if he wishes to do so, and may refrain from becoming or remaining a member of the Union if he so desires.
5.02	The parties mutually agree that there shall be no discrimination or harassment by either of them or by any members of the Union against any employee by reason of membership or non-membership in the Union or by reason of the employee's sex, race, national origin, colour, religion, political belief, age, sexual orientation, family status, marital status, mental disability, physical handicap, or because an employee has or has not engaged in lawful union activity specifically provided for under this Agreement. The parties also agree that no employee should be subjected to sexual harassment.
5.03	The parties mutually agree that employees have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. The Company will take whatever action it deems necessary to maintain such a working environment. The action taken by the Company may include discipline and/or the termination of the employment of any person engaging in the sexual harassment of another person.
An employee may initiate a grievance alleging sexual harassment under the grievance procedure.
Where the alleged harasser is the person who would normally deal with the grievance, the complaint will automatically be advanced to the next stage of the grievance procedure.
Complaints of alleged sexual harassment will be handled with all possible confidentiality.
ARTICLE 6 - HOURS OF WORK
6.01	Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a guarantee of work or of hours of work per day or per week.
6.02	Time worked will be calculated in units of one-half (%) hour.
6.03	For shift work -
(a)	a day will consist of a series of shifts as scheduled.
(b)	a work week will commence with the day shift on Monday and end with the night shift on the following Sunday;
14
(c)	on continuous shift operations each employee not be required to work longer than five (5) consecutive hours without a thirty (30) minute period to eat any meal which period shall be considered as time worked. Such meal may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.04	For work other than shift work, a work week will commence with the beginning of a day worker's hours on Monday and terminate at the same time on the following Monday.
6.05	Employees who are not regularly employed as shift workers and are working as day workers shall normally begin work at 8 a.m. However, it is recognized that in order to maintain efficient operations, certain day workers must begin work earlier or later than that hour. Day workers will be given a lunch period of one-half (%) hour per day, but such lunch period shall not be considered as time worked. The lunch may be eaten in a lunchroom.
6.06	Hoisting and lowering schedules at the Company's mines will be arranged to provide approximately the number of hours he was scheduled to work on that day, from collar to collar for each shift, but variations which do not occur consistently from such schedules, not exceeding ten (10) minutes, shall be disregarded. Delay time in such schedules in excess of the first ten (10) minutes shall be considered time worked, but not for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Agreement.
6.07	When an hourly paid employee, because of failure of the Company to inform him by notice or otherwise that no work will be available, reports for work on schedule, in good faith, and is advised that there is no work available, he shall receive four (4) hours pay at what would have been his basic rate without being required to work the said four (4) hours, but such four (4) hours shall not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of Article 7. The provisions of this Clause shall not apply when an employee has been absent from his regular work period and has failed before reporting for work to inform his Foreman or such other supervisor designated by the Company for this purpose of his intention to return.
6.08	A "call-out” shall mean a request by the Company to an employee to work any time outside such employee's regularly scheduled working hours other than time immediately following or time (not to exceed one (1) hour) immediately preceding a shift worked by such employee unless he shall have received such request at least sixteen (16) hours before such work is to commence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement an employee reporting for work on a "call-out” shall be entitled to be paid for work so performed as follows:
15
(a)	if the “call-out” occurs on a day other than a general holiday, or occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is within the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at one and one-half (1 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater;
(b)	if the “call-out” occurs on a general holiday and the work performed is outside the hours that would have been his regularly scheduled working hours if he had been scheduled to work on that general holiday, at two and one-half (2 %) times his basic rate or for at least four (4) hours at his basic rate, whichever is greater.
6.09	Transportation to and/or from call-out work will be provided by the Company when in the opinion of the Company the urgency of the call-out work so requires it.
6.10	Call-out hours worked will be counted as overtime hours worked and will be recorded by the employee’s Supervisor in the working group’s record of overtime opportunity hours.
6.11	An employee who reports for work on an emergency (as defined in article 28C.01) “call-out” more than two (2) hours prior to the start of his regular scheduled shift and then continues to work into his regular scheduled shift and an employee who continues working after completing his regular scheduled shift and then works more than two (2) hours overtime shall be provided by the Company with a lunch. Should such employee work more than five (5) hours overtime after completing his regular scheduled shift, he shall be provided by the Company with an additional lunch, which lunch or lunches may be eaten in a lunchroom.
The Company will use its best efforts to supply a hot lunch for the first lunch. The additional lunch will consist of a sandwich/beverage combination.
Extended Shift Schedules
6.12	Subject to Clause 6.13, the Company and the Union mutually agree that the Company may give effect to shift schedules which alter or exceed the daily and/or weekly hours of work described elsewhere in this agreement. These schedules shall be termed Extended Shift Schedules and are defined as:
A schedule of shifts in excess of eight (8) hours each, but not to exceed twelve (12) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period, without the payment of wages at overtime rates provided, however, that the average weekly hours worked over the cycle of the schedule of shifts will not exceed forty (40) and if it does the hours in excess of forty (40) will be paid at overtime rate. The “cycle of the schedule of shifts” means the number of weeks that pass before the schedule repeats itself, which number of weeks shall not exceed eight (8) without prior consultation with the Union.
16
An hourly-paid employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule pursuant to this Clause 6.11 shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of his Extended Shift Schedule hours at his basic rate in his work day, except where such excess time is worked by him due to his regularly scheduled change of shift and, where applicable shall be entitled to off-shift premium in accordance with Clause 8.04.
6.13	When an Extended Shift Schedule is planned for any group of employees of a Department (as set out in Schedule "A” hereto) the Joint Problem Solving Committee shall establish, for each Department affected, a Shift Schedule Committee that shall consist of a representative of the Joint Problem Solving Committee and two (2) representatives, appointed by the Union, from among the employees affected.

Within one (1) calendar week of such presentation, the Shift Schedule Committee shall advise the Superintendent or designate of specific concerns relating to the implementation plan. The Company shall give substantial weight and careful consideration to the concerns in its decision making process.
Provisions of Clause 19.04 shall apply to the Union representatives of the Shift Schedule Committee.
6.14	Subject to Clause 6.01, the Company will schedule a minimum weekly average of forty (40) hours for employees working on an Extended Shift Schedule.
ARTICLE 7 - OVERTIME
7.01	An hourly-paid employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the number of hours he was scheduled to work at his basic rate on that day.
7.02	Where the average weekly hours worked by an employee working on an Extended Shift Schedule exceeds forty (40) hours over the cycle of the schedule of shifts as defined in Clause 6.12, he shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for the hours in excess of forty (40), except that:
(a)	when a general holiday occurs in his regularly scheduled work week but does not occur on his regular day off he shall be paid at one and one-half
17
(1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the difference between forty (40) and the number of hours he was scheduled to work on that general holiday, and
(b)	when two general holidays occur in his regularly scheduled work week but neither occurs on what is a regular day off for him, he shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked by him in excess of the difference between forty (40) and the number of hours he was scheduled to work on both of those general holidays
Amounts paid to an employee pursuant to Clause 6.08 and/or Clause 7.01 shall be deducted in computing amounts payable pursuant to this Clause 7.02.
7.02A Subject to Clause 7.02 and Clause 7.06, an employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for time worked outside his regularly scheduled work hours in any week provided that any time not worked during his regularly scheduled work hours;
i)	is due to a death in his immediate family as defined in Clause 8.09; or
ii)	is due to his service on a legally constituted jury engaged in the administration of justice; or
iii)	is pursuant to leave of absence granted by the Company; or
iv)	is due to vacation granted pursuant to Article 12 ; or
v)	is due to Special vacation granted pursuant to Article 13; or
vi)	is due to a holiday with pay granted pursuant to Clause 14.03.
7.03	When the Company requires overtime work to be performed, other than work pursuant to a "call-out”, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the requirements and efficiency of operations, distribute such work as evenly as practicable among the employees in the working group which normally performs the work, who are qualified to perform the work, considering the availability and wishes of employees who have the necessary qualifications.
Prior to the offering of overtime the Company will make temporary promotions in accordance with Clause 15.09.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 an overtime opportunity shall be any time, except a "call-out”, outside an employee’s regularly scheduled working hours regardless of the rate of pay the employee receives for working or would have received had he worked such time.
18
Preference in the offering of overtime will be given first to the qualified employee in the working group with the least recorded overtime opportunity hours, if he is readily available. If no attempt is made to contact the qualified employee with the least recorded overtime opportunity hours in the working group, preference will be given to him at the next available overtime opportunity within the working group, as is mutually agreeable between the employee and his Supervisor.
The mutually agreeable next available overtime opportunity within the employee’s working group must be an overtime opportunity as determined by the Company and must occur within the two week period following the original overtime opportunity. If a next available overtime opportunity does not exist within the two week period following the original overtime opportunity, the employee’s claim to said next available opportunity will cease.
In the case where the employee is offered an overtime opportunity within the working group, and the employee and his Supervisor are unable to mutually agree on the scheduling of the overtime opportunity within the two week period following the original overtime opportunity, the employee will be credited with a refusal for the appropriate number of overtime opportunity hours.
If any employee refuses to work overtime offered to him, he shall not receive any pay for those overtime hours but they shall be added to his record of accumulated overtime hours for the purpose of overtime distribution.
In the event of overtime work being required in a trade the work will first be offered to employees in that trade in the working group (which is the trade that normally performs the work) and then to employees in the required trade in the Departmental Working Area listed in Schedule "E” before being offered to other qualified employees.
For the purposes of this Clause 7.03 "working group” is generally defined as that group of employees reporting to a first line supervisor. However, where shift sequences or supervisory coverage requires otherwise, the employees reporting to a first line supervisor may constitute two (2) or more working groups. The Company and the Union will agree on any working groups which do not conform to this definition.
Upon request to his immediate supervisor, an employee, accompanied if he so desires by a Union Steward, may examine the record of his immediate supervisor pertaining to overtime distribution within the employee's working group.
The record pertaining to overtime distribution for each working group will be posted each month in a suitable location. At a frequency of once per quarter, the Human Resources Department shall forward to the Union a copy of the overtime records for all working groups within Manitoba Operations.
19
At the request of the Union, but at a frequency no greater than once per quarter, the Manager of Human Resources’ designate and the Manager of the relevant department shall meet with the Conflict Resolution Coordinator and/or the Joint Problem Solving Coordinator to review the records of overtime distribution within that department. The Union shall notify the Company at least five (5) working days prior to any such meeting of the particular records to be considered thereat.
If an employee has a complaint with respect to the record of overtime distribution which he has been unable to resolve with his supervisor and where there is mutual agreement, the parties will discuss the matter at the aforementioned meeting prior to such complaint being advanced through the grievance procedure.
7.04	Except as provided in Clause 6.08 or Clause 14.02 under the provisions of which an employee may be entitled to be paid at two and one-half (2%) times his basic rate, no employee paid on an hourly basis shall be entitled, apart from off-shift premium and Sunday premium, to more than one and one-half (1%) times his applicable basic rate for any hours worked by him.
7.05	Any change in an employee's regular day off schedule or shift schedule shall be posted, or an employee instructed to that effect, not later than the end of his shift on the Friday prior to the work week in which the change is to take effect.
7.06	Should an employee be instructed by the Company, during his work week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week, to change his day off or days off in that work week to another day or days in that work week, he shall be considered as having worked his normal working hours on the previously scheduled day or days at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
Any change or changes to an employee's normal shift schedule at the Company's instruction given during his work week or on the Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the commencement of such work week will entitle the employee to be considered as having worked the originally scheduled hours that were changed in that work week at what would have been his basic rate, but for the purpose only of ascertaining whether such employee shall be paid at one and one-half (1%) times his basic rate for any other time actually worked by him.
This Clause 7.06 does not apply to changes of shift schedules made to accommodate employee training.
Banking of Overtime
20
7.07	Each employee who works overtime has the option of receiving pay for such work at the applicable overtime rate, or banking the time worked at the applicable basic rate and receiving pay for one-half (%) of the time worked at the applicable basic rate, provided that he does not have sufficient vacation entitlement to cover the vacation shutdown period.
Such time will be taken in conjunction with the next vacation shutdown and, if applicable, the Company will deduct from the pay for such time an amount equal to the employee’s contribution to the Security Fund Plan and the Company shall contribute to the Security Fund Plan an amount in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in such Plan.
If for any reason the employee is not required to use the banked time to cover the vacation shutdown period he will receive payment for such banked time at the applicable basic rate.
Subject to Clause 7.02A, such time off will not be considered as hours worked for the purpose of applying the overtime provisions of this Article 7.
ARTICLE 8 - WAGES
8.01	The wage rates per hour set forth in the applicable table in Schedule “B” hereto, shall be paid commencing on September 16, 2011.
8.02	In the event that any new occupational classification shall be established by the Company during the currency of this Agreement, the Company will fix the rate of pay therefor and shall give prompt notice thereof to the Union. The Union shall have the right, within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice, to request a meeting with the Company to discuss the wage rate applicable to the new classification established by the Company. If, as a result of any such discussions, the wage rate applicable to the new classification is changed, then payment of the wage rate as changed shall be made retroactive to the date notice of the new classification was given to the Union.
8.03	Upon receipt of a claim by the Union that a wage rate for a job constitutes an inequality under the existing wage structure, the Company will investigate and review the job and/or the rate therefor. If the Company decides that there should be an increase in such wage rate it will notify the Union and any such increase will be effective from the date of such notification. The Union representatives on the CWS Committee shall be entitled to meet with the Company representatives on the CWS Committee to discuss the wage rates under review. The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to the Union representatives on the CWS Committee in carrying out their duties under this Clause 8.03.

For all work performed during night shift hours, (and not within the regular day or afternoon working hours of such employee) he shall be paid an off-shift premium of sixty cents (600) per hour in addition to his basic rate.

8.07	Where an employee who is permanently assigned (for any reason other than willful failure to fill the normal requirements of the job) to work in an occupational classification carrying a lower rate of pay than his regular occupational classification, he shall for three (3) months be paid for the work he performs at the rate applicable to his regular occupational classification. During the above three (3) month period:
(a)	he may be required by the Company to accept any training in any occupational classification which is offered to him,
(b)	he shall be reassigned, subject to Clause 15.27 and subject to the wishes of employee, to his regular occupational classification in the event of a vacancy, and
(c)	he shall be deemed to be an applicant for any job vacancy which is posted in his department.
If he refuses to accept such training, or to accept any reassignment or to accept any job offered to him by the Company, he shall forthwith cease to be entitled to the benefits of this Clause 8.07.
22
Where an employee is reassigned under subclause (b) of this Clause 8.07 the provisions of Article 15 with respect to job posting shall not apply to the vacancy to which he is reassigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing an employee will not be paid for work performed during a shift or day at a rate less than that applicable to the occupational category in which he commences work on such shift or day.
8.08	An employee who serves as a juror will be paid his basic rate for the number of hours he was scheduled to work during the period he serves as a juror, less any fees paid to the employee under The Jury Act or The Queen's Bench Act. In order to receive pay pursuant to this Clause, the employee must notify the Company within three (3) working days after receipt of his jury summons, present to the Company satisfactory proof of service and attendance, notify the Company of the date on which he will be released from jury duty immediately after such information is provided to the employee and report for work on his first scheduled shift immediately following his release.
8.09	Subject to Clause 8.10, a bereavement leave of absence will be granted to an employee upon a death in his immediate family. For each day of such leave of absence which is a regularly scheduled working day for the employee, he shall be paid his basic rate for the number of hours he was scheduled to work on that day.

Time of Vacation

12.11
shall never exceed eighty (80).

In lieu of granting the Payout Hour(s) of Special Vacation, the Company will pay to such employee the Special Vacation pay to which he would have been entitled if he had taken the Payout Hour(s) of Special Vacation immediately prior to most recently becoming entitled to Special Vacation with pay. The total number of work hours of Special Vacation with pay to which he is entitled shall then be two hundred and forty (240).

(a)	if the employee was absent from work for more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days in that calendar year on account of illness or accident, the Special Vacation pay for each work hour shall, if preferable to the employee, be equal to zero point zero five per cent (0.05%) of the employee's earnings from the Company in the most recent twelve (12) calendar months, not necessarily consecutive, in which he worked at least some time in the month, and
(b)	if preferable to the employee, the pay for each work hour of Special Vacation shall be equal to his basic rate.

41
When employees are to be transferred out of a department other than pursuant to Clause 15.06 and other than in reverse order of their seniority ranking, the senior employee who is to be transferred will, where practicable, be given the opportunity to acquire through training the qualification necessary to fill the vacancy that would have been created had the employees been transferred in reverse order of their seniority ranking.
Where it is practicable to give a senior employee such training, the length of the training period shall be in proportion to his seniority and each such employee will be given a maximum of one week of training for each complete year of continuous service.

Subject to Clause 15.02, the Company shall transfer the employees on the revised transfer list in the order of their seniority. Where such transfer results in a vacancy in a department the Company shall fill the vacancy from among the employees on the Forced Transfer List having consideration for the wishes of the employees and their respective seniority ranking.

(a)	to have seniority ranking in the department from which he has been temporarily transferred, and
(b)	not to have seniority ranking in the department to which he has been temporarily transferred,
provided, however, that in the case of a temporary promotion to fill a temporary vacancy, other than a Temporary Vacancy as defined in Clause 15.08, he will be
42
considered for that temporary promotion as though he had seniority ranking in the department to which he has been temporarily transferred, subject to Clause 15.02.
15.06	An employee wishing to transfer from one department to another may file with the Company a written request to do so, providing he has not been granted a transfer at his own request for a period of six (6) months. The employee making such application shall be given a duplicate of such request for transfer. The Company shall maintain a file of such applications for transfer and shall consult such file when considering hiring new employees.
In the event of a vacancy occurring in the department into which the employee wishes to transfer, preference shall be given to such employee's application before a new employee is hired to fill the vacancy. For the purposes of this Clause "preference” shall mean the consideration of the following factors namely, the wishes of the employee and his expressed reasons therefore, his seniority, the efficiency and requirements of operations and the ability, knowledge, training and skill of the employee to progress in the department for which he has made application.
In the event there are applications for transfer between departments where no vacancy exists, the Company will consider such applications in order to exchange suitable applicants.
The Company will provide the Conflict Resolution Coordinator with a list of all outstanding transfer applications once per month. At the request of the Conflict Resolution Coordinator but at a frequency no greater than once per month, the Supervisor of Employee Relations and/or other designated officials of the Company shall meet with the Conflict Resolution Coordinator and up to one other representative of the Union to review any outstanding applications for transfer. At a frequency of twice per year, such meetings will also be used to remove from the list of outstanding applications for transfer the names of those employees who have recently been transferred or whose names should otherwise be removed from the list.

15.10	Except in the case of
(a)	a Temporary Vacancy as defined in Clause 15.08A; or
(b)	a vacancy in any job in the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department; or
(c)	a vacancy in a reserved job as defined in Clause 15.27,
when a vacancy occurs in any job (other than a job considered by the Company to be temporary only, not to exceed thirty (30) days) for which the basic wage is Step 8 or higher in the case of underground jobs, or Step 3 or higher in the case of surface jobs, (except for the occupational classification of Janitor), notice of such vacancy shall be posted for seven (7) calendar days on the bulletin board provided in the department in which such vacancy has occurred. All notices of vacancy shall designate the shift (day, afternoon or night) in which the vacancy exists on the date on which the notice is posted.
Notices of vacancy in underground jobs in the Mine Departments shall indicate the level and the number of the mining complex to which the successful applicant shall be assigned, provided, however, that he may be reassigned when warranted by the requirements or efficiency of operations or the ability, knowledge, training and skill of the employee. Prior to any reassignment of an employee, the company will review the reassignment with the Conflict Resolution Coordinator. Where an employee in an underground job in a Mine Department is reassigned the Company shall post a notice in the Department indicating the name of the employee and the number of the mining complex to which he was reassigned and the Company shall promptly send to the Union a copy of such notice.
Any employee in the department in which the job is posted or who applies in accordance with Clause 15.10A:
(i)	who is in an occupational classification different from that of the posted job, or
(ii)	who is in the same occupational classification but is assigned to shift work while the posted job is for day-time work or vice-versa, or
47
(iii)	who is in the same occupational classification as that of posted job but is assigned to a different level, mining complex, or
(iv)	who is in the same occupational classification that of the posted job but is assigned to a different shift,
may apply in writing for such job within the said seven (7) days. In considering which applicant is to fill such vacancy, the Company shall give preference according to the seniority ranking of the employees affected, subject to Clause 15.02. Where the factors described in Clause 15.02 are to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more employees, their relative seniority ranking shall govern.
An employee who is the successful applicant for a job in accordance with (iii) or (iv) above will not be eligible to make application under the terms of (iii) or (iv) for a period of six (6) months from the posting of his name as the successful applicant.
Nothing in the foregoing provisions shall limit the right of the Company to assign any employee in any occupational classification from day-time work to shift work or vice-versa in the same occupational classification.
15.10A An employee in a Mine Department may apply in writing to fill a vacancy posted pursuant to Clause 15.10 in another Mine Department providing he has not been employed in an occupational classification in such other Mine Department in the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date of the posting.
Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, an employee who has been transferred, pursuant to Clause 15.04 from the Mine Department in which the vacancy exists shall be permitted to make application for such vacancy.
15.11	The Company shall, without delay after a notice of a vacancy has been posted for seven (7) calendar days, post for at least seven (7) calendar days the name, employment number, and seniority of the successful applicant. If there shall have been no applicant, or no successful applicant for such job, such fact shall be posted. Except in the case of the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department, the Company, if it fills such job from within the department, shall within four (4) weeks from date of posting and subject to Clause 15.02, select from among the employees therein, that employee having the lowest seniority ranking.
The Company shall, without delay after a notice of a vacancy has been posted for seven (7) calendar days, post for at least seven (7) calendar days the name, employment number, and seniority of the successful applicant. An employee who is a successful applicant in Clause 15.10 (i), (ii) or (iii) above will, except in unusual circumstances, be transferred by the Company to his new position within sixty (60) calendar days of the posting of his name as the successful applicant.
48
The Company will promptly send to the Union, a copy of the notice of vacancy showing the disposition thereof. When a vacancy has been filled, the name, employment number and seniority of the successful applicant or the employee who has been appointed, as the case may be, shall be shown on the notice.
Layoff
15.12The Company and the Union agree that employment security, though not a guarantee, should increase according to seniority.
When employees are laid off for more than thirty (30) days, either for lack of work or in order to create vacancies for employees with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, the Company shall, subject to Clause 15.02, lay off employees in the reverse order of their seniority.
When employees are to be laid off other than in reverse order of seniority, the senior employee who is to be laid off will, where practicable, be given the opportunity to acquire through training the qualification necessary to fill the vacancy that would have been created had the employees been laid off in reverse order of their seniority.
Where it is practicable to give a senior employee such training the length of the training period shall be in proportion to his seniority and each such employee will be given a maximum of one week of training for each complete year of continuous service.
15.13	Subject to Clause 15.19, an employee who
(a)	has at least one (1) year of seniority,
(b)	is laid off either for lack of work or in order to create a vacancy for an employee with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, and the Company considers such lay off to be permanent, and
(c)	notifies the Company in writing, within one hundred and twenty (120) days of being so laid off, that he relinquishes his right of recall under Clause 15.15 and wishes to terminate his employment,
shall be paid as severance pay an amount equal to
(i) one hundred and sixty (160) times his basic rate, plus
49
(ii)	forty (40) times his basic rate multiplied by a number which is the number of his "Years of Service” as defined in Clause 10.01(b) but disregarding any fraction of a year, minus
(iii)	any amount paid to him under Clause 10.05(a).
15.14	When employees are temporarily laid off for thirty (30) days or less, either for lack of work or in order to create vacancies for employees with more seniority who would otherwise be laid off for lack of work, the Company shall, subject to Clause 15.02, lay off employees in the reverse order of their seniority ranking, except in cases of breakdown or other emergency or other circumstances beyond the immediate control of the Company.
Recall
15.15	During a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of a lay off of any employees having seniority rights, if the Company shall require workers the Company shall determine which individuals who were so laid off are qualified to fill the normal requirements of the jobs then available. From among such qualified individuals and to the extent of the number of workers required, the Company shall select those most recently laid off and a notice stating the title of the job for which such individual is considered qualified and the proposed time and place of hiring shall be sent to each such selected individual by registered mail addressed to the last address recorded by the individual with the Manager, Human Resources of the Company at Thompson, Manitoba. The time of hiring specified in the notice shall be not less than ten (10) days later than the date on which the notice would, in the ordinary course of mail, be received at that address.
15.16	Individuals reporting for work pursuant to such notices shall, if they are then qualified to fill the normal requirements of the jobs available, be rehired in the inverse order to that in which they were laid off, and on such rehiring the seniority of such individual shall be computed as though he had continued in the employment of the Company instead of being so laid off and rehired.
15.17	The Company shall not be required to rehire at any time any individuals who shall fail to report for rehiring pursuant to such notice. The Company may fill any jobs available on a temporary basis pending rehiring of those having recall rights as hereinbefore set forth.
15.18	When the individual to whom such a notice has been sent is unable to report for work on the day specified in such notice by reason of sickness, then such individual shall not lose his recall rights by reason only of his failure to report for hiring pursuant to such notice if he shall have notified the Manager, Human Resources, Health, Safety & Environment of the Company at Thompson, Manitoba, in writing on or before the day specified in such notice of his sickness
50
together with a satisfactory medical certificate. In such event, the name of the individual in question will be placed at the top of the recall list, provided that there shall be no right of recall after twenty-four (24) months from the date of layoff.
15.19	An employee who is employed by the Company in the Mechanical Department or the Electrical Department may, within five (5) working days of transfer or demotion to another classification due to lack of work, elect to be laid off and governed by the recall provisions set out in this Article 15. In addition, any such employee laid off either by his own election or for lack of work shall not lose his recall rights by reason only of his failure to report for rehiring in a job other than one in his former classification. An employee who elects to be laid off under this Clause 15.19 shall not be entitled to any severance pay under Clause 15.13.
Loss of Seniority
15.20	When an employee is granted leave in excess of two (2) weeks for reason other than disabling accident or illness or other compassionate grounds, no such period of leave shall be counted in determining the seniority of any such employee. Provided, however, that when an employee is granted leave of absence pursuant to Article 17 or Article 24 or Article 25 or Article 26, the period of such leave of absence shall be counted in determining the seniority of such employee.
15.21	An employee shall lose his seniority whenever any of the following shall occur:
(a)	when he voluntarily terminates his employment;
(b)	when he is discharged for cause;
(c)	when he is absent without leave for ten (10) or more consecutive working days, unless excused by his Foreman or the Human Resources Department;
(d)	when he fails to report to the Manager of Human Resources within the time specified by any notice of recall, subject to Clause 15.18 hereof;
(e)	when he fails to report to the Manager, Human Resources on the expiring of an authorized leave of absence;
(f)	subject to Clause 15.16, when he is laid off.
51
General
15.22	The Company shall post seniority lists for each department showing the seniority ranking of each employee in such department. No complaints concerning the seniority lists shall be dealt with under the provisions of this Agreement concerning the adjustment of grievances. The seniority lists for each department shall be revised by the Company and brought up to date at least once during each three (3) month period. The Company will provide the Union with a copy of such lists.
15.23	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from transferring to the category of an employee any individual employed by the Company in another category, and (except where such transfer is temporary only), the length of such individual's continuous service with the Company shall be deemed to be accumulated seniority and shall be transferred and placed to his credit.
15.24	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from assigning individuals (including students in any part-time employment) to any job to try out their capabilities and/or to provide them with special training or experience in preparation for broader assignments with the Company or with associated companies, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to preclude the Company from promoting, demoting, engaging or dispensing with the services of any such individuals or from directing their efforts from time to time, provided, however, that no such individual shall be assigned to take over the job occupied by an employee if such an assignment would result in the demotion of such employee.
Training obtained under this Clause 15.24 subsequent to September 16, 1999 will not be considered in the application of Clause 15.02.
Individuals training under this Clause 15.24;
(i)	will not be considered to be performing work which is normally performed by employees, and
(ii)	will not be considered for temporary promotions or overtime during the day (as defined in Clause 6.03(a)) on which he has been receiving such training.
The provisions of Clause 15.08A(i) shall not apply to individuals training under this Clause 15.24.
52
The Company shall, from time to time, provide the Union with a list of such individuals, not exceeding at any one time fifty (50) or five per cent (5%) of the employees, whichever shall be greater.
15.25	The Company will endeavour, subject to the requirements of operations, to find employment in his department (or failing his department, another department) which is suitable (in the opinion of a duly qualified medical practitioner) to any employee who has been temporarily or permanently incapacitated by age, disease or occupational accident and is therefore unable to perform his regular work. In the event such employment is not available, the Company may provide training opportunity for a permanently incapacitated employee where he can be qualified for a vacancy in a reasonable period of time. In assigning any such employee to any such employment the Company may disregard the seniority provisions of this Agreement except that such incapacitated employee shall not be assigned to take over a job occupied at the time by another employee unless such other employee is occupying a reserved job on a temporary basis pursuant to Clause 15.27.
15.26	The Company will grant sick leave of up to one (1) year's leave of absence without pay to any employee having seniority rights and seniority of less than nine (9) years and up to two (2) years' leave of absence, without pay, to any employee with seniority:
(a)	of nine (9) years or more, or
(b)	of two (2) years or more if he is entitled to compensation under The Workers Compensation Act.
The Company may extend such leaves for such further period as it may decide. The Company when granting any such leave will require the production of satisfactory medical evidence of sickness.
15.27	A "reserved job” shall mean any occupational classification identified by the Joint Rehabilitation Committee and mutually agreed by the Company and the Union as being suitable for an employee who, in the opinion of a duly qualified medical practitioner is permanently incapacitated and unable to perform his regular work. In the event of a vacancy in a reserved job, the Company will fill the vacancy in accordance with Clause 15.25. If there are no incapacitated employees capable of fulfilling the requirements of the vacancy, the Company will fill the vacancy on a temporary basis from among the employees regularly working in the department where the vacancy exists, subject to Clause 15.02. Where the factors described in Clause 15.02 are to all intents and purposes equal as between two or more employees, their relative seniority ranking shall govern. Where a reserved job occupied on a temporary basis by another employee is to be filled by an incapacitated employee pursuant to Clause 15.25, the employee occupying the job on a temporary basis shall be reassigned to his regular occupational classification.
53
ARTICLE 16 - TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

ARTICLE 18 - DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINE
18.01	The discharge or disciplining without just cause of employees, other than probationary employees, may be dealt with as a grievance under this Agreement, if the employee concerned believes that his discharge or disciplinary action is in violation of this Agreement; provided that any such discharge complaint is presented at the Second Stage of the grievance procedure contained herein not later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of such discharge. Every effort shall be made to hold such Second Stage meeting within forty-eight (48) hours from the receipt by the Company of such Second Stage grievance.
18.02	If it should be determined under the grievance procedure that the discharge or disciplining of any employee is in violation of this Agreement, then such employee shall be reinstated by the Company and paid full compensation (less money earned by the employee during the time lost) at the employee's basic rate plus any applicable C.O.L.A. for the time lost while such discharge or disciplining was in
55
effect, but limited to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week, all in respect of time so lost after such date. Upon such reinstatement, the employee's seniority shall continue as if no discharge or disciplining had occurred.
18.03	Any Warning, Written Reprimand, Suspension or Notice of Discharge given to any employee shall be given in writing, in duplicate. Where practicable it shall be given within two (2) workdays of the time when the incident giving rise to the discipline comes to the attention of the Company.
18.04	In any case where a period of ninety (90) calendar days has elapsed since an employee last received a Warning (as distinct from a Written Reprimand or a Suspension) for being absent without leave from his regular work, all previous Warnings (as distinct from Written Reprimands or Suspensions) for absence without leave shall be removed from the employee's record and shall not be taken into consideration by the Company when it decides upon the disciplinary action which is applicable with respect to subsequent absences without leave by such employee.
Similarly, in any case where a period of one (1) year has elapsed since an employee last received a Written Reprimand (as distinct from a Suspension) for being absent without leave, all previous Written Reprimands (as distinct from Suspensions) for absence without leave shall be removed from the employee's record and shall not be taken into consideration by the Company when it decides upon the disciplinary action which is applicable with respect to subsequent absences without leave by such employee.
18.05	Any Written Reprimand given as a Step II, Step III or Step IV or any Notice of Discharge will, where practicable, be given to an employee in the presence of a Union Steward if the employee so requests.
ARTICLE 19 - GRIEVANCE COMMITTEEMEN, UNION STEWARDS AND FULL TIME
UNION POSITIONS
19.01	The Grievance Committeemen and Union Stewards shall consist of not more than an aggregate total of one (1) for each thirty-five (35) employees, plus an additional ten (10) Stewards, or sixty (60), whichever is the greater. All Committeemen and Stewards shall be employees.
19.02	There shall be a Grievance Committee selected by the Union consisting of not more than nine (9) employees, from amongst the Union Stewards. The Union will indicate to the Company from time to time, the individuals acting as Chairman and members of the Grievance Committee.
19.03	If it shall be necessary for a Grievance Committeeman or Union Steward to take time off during working hours to attend any meeting with supervisory personnel as set forth in the grievance procedure, he shall first obtain permission from his
56
Foreman. The Company agrees that such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
19.04	Time lost by members of the Grievance Committee or Union Stewards during regular shifts in respect of meetings with Management Representatives held pursuant to the grievance procedure as hereinafter referred to, shall be paid for by the Company at the respective basic rates of such members, plus any applicable shift premium and C.O.L.A., if any, and for those Mine Department employees who are eligible for mines incentive bonus and who are denied the opportunity to earn mines incentive bonus during a regularly scheduled shift as a result of attending such meeting, an allowance in lieu of mines incentive bonus shall be paid in accordance with Clause 28.04B, but the Company may at any time discontinue such payments if, in the opinion of the Company, there is abuse of the privilege of attending such meetings.
19.05	Where an employee so requests, Union Stewards will, subject to the requirements and efficiency of operations, be allowed such time off as is reasonably required at a time to be arranged by supervision in order to assist the employee in connection with grievance or disciplinary matters which involve the employee.
In the case of underground operations arrangements will be made at each mine to permit Union Stewards to come up early or delay their descent on a pre-arranged schedule so that they may assist employees in connection with grievance or disciplinary matters which involve the employee. Where it is practicable other arrangements may be made by the Company.
19.06	The Parties recognize that it is most desirable that an earnest effort be made to develop and maintain a good relationship between employees and supervision.
If an employee has a complaint which he has been unable to resolve with his supervisor, a steward may attempt to resolve the complaint on behalf of the employee.
It is the further intent of the parties that issues and concerns be resolved prior to using the discipline or grievance procedures.
To accomplish this, the employee, accompanied by a Union Steward if requested by the employee or supervisor, should first attempt to resolve the above matters expediently.
Should any difference remain between the Company and any of the employees as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, an earnest effort shall be made to settle such difference without undue delay in the manner as outlined in Article 20.

ARTICLE 20 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Stage One
20.01	An aggrieved employee may, provided it is done within the first ten (10) working days immediately following the occurrence of the circumstances giving rise to the grievance, make his representations orally or in writing to his supervisor or the Management Representative designated by the Company from time to time to handle such matter at this stage. In making such representations, he may, if he desires, be accompanied and represented by a Union Steward who is reasonably familiar with the work on which the employee is engaged. Such meeting will, except in unusual circumstances, occur during the grievor's working hours. Any settlement of the grievance reached between the aggrieved employee and the Company at this stage will be considered applicable to the case in question and not as establishing a precedent for future cases. If within three (3) work days (excluding the regular days off of the grievor and Management Representative) from the time when such representations were presented to such Management Representative a decision satisfactory to the employee is not given, then:
Stage Two
20.02	Notice in writing requesting further consideration of the matter shall, within seven (7) days from the giving of the decision of the Management Representative at Stage One, be given by the aggrieved employee or a member of the Steward Committee to the Management Representative for Stage Two, who shall be from the department in which the matter arose. The official to whom such notice is given or his designated representative shall notify the aggrieved employee and the Union of the time and place at which he will meet such aggrieved employee accompanied and represented by not more than three (3) members of the Steward Committee and if so desired, by an officer of the union and/or a representative of the United Steelworkers. Prior to setting a date for such meeting, the Company will discuss the matter with a member of the Steward Committee or the Conflict Resolution Coordinator to determine whether the matter should be first returned with guidance to the parties involved at Stage One for further attempt at resolution. A Human Resources Representative and such other Company
59
personnel as the Company may consider necessary to resolve the grievance may accompany the Management Representative for Stage Two. Such meeting will be held within fourteen (14) days of the date upon which it was requested and should be scheduled during the working hours of the aggrieved employee. At such meeting, representations in writing shall be presented and the decision of the Management Representative for Stage One shall be considered. Any settlement of the grievance reached between the aggrieved employee and the Company at this stage will be considered applicable to the case in question and not as establishing a precedent for future cases.
20.03	Every effort will be made to give the decision in writing on behalf of the Company within seven (7) days from the date upon which the Stage Two meeting is held.
20.04	Saturdays, Sundays and general holidays shall not be counted in determining the time within which any action is to be taken in each of the foregoing Stage One or Stage Two.
20.05	Any difference arising between the Union and the Company with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of this Agreement, instead of following the procedure hereinbefore set out, may be submitted in writing by either of such parties to the other, with opportunity for oral discussion between the officers of the Union and the General Managers or their designated representatives. Failing settlement, a date will be agreed upon at this meeting for a further meeting between such senior officials of the Company as the Company may designate for this purpose, and the officers of the Union, who may be accompanied by a representative of the United Steelworkers.
In any event, the parties shall within twenty-one (21) days from the giving of notice as aforesaid, sign a memorandum of settlement, or, if the matter has not been satisfactorily adjusted, the party to whom the matter was submitted shall deliver to the other party a reply in writing to such submission.
20.06	Should any difference arise between the Company and the Union or any employee as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the provisions of the Agreement, or should any employee believe that his discharge is a violation of the provisions of this Agreement, and should any party desire to take advantage of the procedure provided for in this Agreement, each step in such procedure (up to and including the appointment of an arbitrator) required to effect a satisfactory disposition of the matter shall be taken by such party within the time limits set forth, or the matter shall be deemed to have been abandoned, unless the time limit applicable has been extended by written agreement between the Company and the Union.
ARTICLE 21 - ARBITRATION
21.01	Where a violation of this Agreement is alleged, or a difference between the parties to this Agreement relating to the meaning or application of the Agreement (including a difference
60
relating to whether or not a matter upon which arbitration has been sought comes within the scope of the Agreement) arises, either party thereto, within thirty (30) days from the giving of the decision of the Management Representative at Stage Two (or in the event of a difference between the Union and the Company, within thirty (30) days from the date when the written reply to the submission was or should have been delivered) may notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the alleged violation or difference to arbitration, whereupon the Company and the Union will make a joint application to the Minister of Labour for Manitoba to have a grievance mediator appointed to assist them in resolving the alleged violation or difference.
At the end of each month all the cases which have been referred to arbitration during that month will be listed chronologically according to the time when, in the case of a grievance, the Stage Two meeting was held, or in the case of a Company-Union difference, the first meeting was held to discuss it, that case being listed first in which such meeting was held earliest, and then a single arbitrator shall be allocated to each case in sequence from the following panel of individuals:
William D Hamilton Gavin M Wood Arne Peltz Michael Werier Diane Jones
Commencing with the name following the name of the last arbitrator allocated and commencing again at the beginning of the panel after coming to the end of the panel and for the purpose of such allocation a case which has been withdrawn from arbitration shall be deemed not to have been withdrawn from arbitration. If no Stage Two meeting is held on a grievance, the time to be used for the chronological listing will be the time when notice requesting further consideration was given under this clause. If no meeting is held on a Company-Union difference, the time to be used for the chronological listing will be the time when it was submitted in writing under this clause. If in any case the arbitrator allocated is unable or unwilling to act within 180 days, the next arbitrator on the list will be contacted for the purpose of scheduling the hearing date within 180 days.

ARTICLE 23 - GENERAL TRAINING
Training During Working Hours
23.01 The Company desires to provide an opportunity for employees to qualify for certain higher rated occupational classifications by providing training during working hours. The jobs in which employees may be employed for these purposes are hereinafter called "trainee jobs”.
23.02	There shall be a committee known as the joint "Training Committee” consisting of the Joint Problem Solving Coordinator and up to two (2) additional representatives appointed by the Union, and either the Superintendent of Human Resources or the Superintendent of Training and up to two (2) additional representatives appointed by the Company.
The committee will meet at least once per quarter, and at such other times as may be mutually agreed upon, for the purpose of exchanging and discussing information pertaining to Company training programs and considering specific problems relating to training.
These meetings may be attended by the President of the Union and the Manager of Human Resources. The Committee may request the attendance at the meeting of other individuals who have special knowledge of subjects under discussion.
The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment for time lost shall apply to members of the joint Training Committee.
23.03	Whenever the Company decides that additional employees are required to be trained in such occupational classifications it shall post vacancies for "trainee jobs”, except where the Company is assigning an employee to a trainee job as permitted by this Clause 23.03.
The employees required to fill the vacancies for trainee jobs will be determined in accordance with their respective seniority ranking. In the event that there is no successful applicant for a trainee job, or in the event that a successful applicant for a trainee job is not from among the employees regularly working for the immediate supervisor where the additional training may be required, the Company may, in addition to any successful applicant, assign an employee to such trainee job from among the employees who are working for that supervisor. In making such assignment, the Company will, to the extent permitted by the requirements of operations, give preference according to their respective seniority ranking.
In this Clause 23.03 "deemed qualified” shall mean the employee is considered as having the ability, knowledge and skill to fill the normal requirements of the
66
job, subject to him successfully completing the training required to obtain such ability, knowledge and skill.
Where practicable, the Company shall train the successful applicant either prior to or at least concurrently with the additional employee so assigned. Where it is preferable to the successful applicant, rather than train him concurrently with such additional employee, he shall be deemed qualified to fill a vacancy posted pursuant to Clause 15.10. Where he is the successful applicant for such vacancy, or at such earlier time as is mutually agreed to by the employee and his supervisor, the Company will provide him with the training and provided he successfully completes such training, assign him to the vacancy. Where he does not successfully complete such training, he shall be reassigned to his regular occupational classification which shall have been considered a Temporary Vacancy for the period of his training. In the event that the successful applicant for a trainee job, prior to being trained, is to be laid off pursuant to Clause 15.12, or transferred out of a Department pursuant to Clause 15.04, or demoted pursuant to Clause 15.08, then, provided being successfully trained will result in him not being so laid off or so transferred, or will result in him being demoted to an occupational classification more favourable to him, the Company shall provide him with the training as soon as practicable. Where he does not successfully complete such training, he shall be laid off pursuant to Clause 15.12, or transferred out of a Department pursuant to Clause 15.04, or demoted pursuant to Clause 15.08.
If the employee refuses to accept training or otherwise fails to successfully complete the training in an occupational classification for which he is deemed qualified, he shall forfeit his right to be trained in that occupational classification until he shall again have been the successful applicant for a training job in that occupational classification posted pursuant to this Clause 23.03.
No employee shall be eligible to be assigned such "trainee jobs”,
(a)	who in the judgment of the Company is qualified in such occupational classification;
(b)	who has been successfully trained as a result of a previous training posting within the previous six (6) month period unless waived by the Company in which case the senior applicant will be given preference;
(c)	who within the six (6) month period prior to his application has failed to qualify in the same trainee job for which he is currently applying unless waived by the Company; or
(d)	who does not possess sufficient knowledge ability and skill to justify his being accepted for training.
67
Upon completion of the training period the trainee will be returned to his former classification.
23.04	A successful applicant for a training job shall be paid during the training period at the rate of his regular classification.
Home Study
23.05	Any employee who desires to take a home study course may prior to commencing such course make application to register the course with the Company's Training Supervisor who will advise the applicant whether or not the proposed course is a work related course and is acceptable to the Company for that individual under the provisions of this Article. A training course in computer skills taken through an approved training or educational organization will be considered a work related course.
23.06	The Company will upon the successful completion of a work related study course, accepted under the provision of Clause 23.05 by an employee, reimburse such employee for the cost of such course taken by the employee provided that at the time of completion of the course the employee shall be in the employ of the Company, unless he shall at such time have been laid off by the Company for lack of work.

(i) commencing October 1, 2008, a weekly indemnity of six hundred and seventy-five dollars ($675). Such increased weekly benefit will apply for periods of illness after October 1,2008
With respect to the limitation on weekly indemnity benefit under the Group Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan which provides that no payment will be made for disability directly or indirectly due to or resulting from any cause which entitles the employee to indemnity or compensation under The Workers Compensation Act, it is agreed that where an employee is otherwise entitled to weekly indemnity benefit and a determination has been made under The Workers Compensation Act he is not entitled to indemnity or compensation under that Act, that he will not be denied weekly indemnity benefit on account of the above mentioned limitation.
All of the foregoing shall be conditional upon the employee concerned complying with all reasonable requirements of the insurer and the Company including without limitation all requirements as to the furnishing of any necessary proofs and information whether as to
95
age, change of status or otherwise, and the filing of any necessary applications and claims.
Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, it is understood and agreed:
(a)	that the obligation of the Company hereunder shall be limited to taking all reasonable steps to continue in effect the above mentioned Plans as aforesaid and to pay the premiums therefor, and without limitation, the obligation of the Company shall in no manner whatsoever extend to the performance of the obligations under the Plan of the insurer or any employee or any person other than the Company; and
(b)	that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder with respect to an employee on leave of absence for a period longer than four (4) calendar weeks, unless such leave of absence is sick leave granted under Clause 15.26 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Should any difference arise between the Company and any of the employees or between the Company and the Union as to the meaning, application or alleged violation of any of the provisions of this Letter of Agreement such difference shall be settled in accordance with the grievance procedure and the arbitration provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the Union.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

APPENDIX G
HOURLY EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
This will confirm our agreement with respect to the Hourly Employee Annual Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan”).
The Incentive Plan consists of three components (the "Components”).
Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below, regular fulltime employees will be eligible to receive, in respect of each twelve month period of January 1 to December 31 (the "Incentive Period”) commencing January 1,2012, an annual payment under the Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Payment”), based on Components 1, 2 and 3 described below to a maximum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the employee’s Eligible Earnings (as defined below).
Component 1: Vale S.A. Results
Component 1 determines up to twenty five percent (25%) of any Incentive Payment in each Incentive Period and is based on the rating announced by Vale S.A. that represents how Vale S.A. has performed during the Incentive Period.
Vale S.A. or the Company may from time to time change the metric used to measure such performance for a given Incentive Period.
Component 2: Business Unit (North Atlantic Nickel Business) Results
The Business Unit component represents up to twenty five percent (25%) of the Incentive in each year and is part of the Vale Canada Annual Incentive Plan (AIP).
The Business Unit component is the measure used by Vale Canada to represent how the North Atlantic Nickel Business Unit has performed during the Incentive period. The Company may from time to time change the metric used to measure Business Unit performance for a given Incentive Period.
The metric used to measure Business Unit results is Cash Flow Return on Gross Investment (CFROGI) for the North Atlantic region. This metric is an indicator of the efficiency of the region to use assets to create value.
Component 3: Manitoba Operations Team Results
The Manitoba Operations Team component determines up to fifty percent (50%) of any Incentive Payment in each Incentive Period and is based on four (4) metrics to which the efforts of each hourly employee in the Manitoba Operations make a direct contribution. The four (4) metrics used to measure Manitoba Operations Team results are as follows:
109
1.	Quality: Thompson Nickel Refinery Overall Plate Grade vs. Plan
Refinery plate grade represents the quality of the product being produced by Manitoba Operations. Each step in the mining, milling, smelting and refining process contributes to the achievement of this metric. The measure is based on performance versus the annual Manitoba Operations plan value, which is typically ninety percent (90%) overall plate grade.
2.	Production: Total Contained Equivalent Nickel Unit Production from Manitoba Operations vs. Plan
Contained Equivalent Nickel Unit (CENU) measures the total output of finished products, by-products and intermediates from Manitoba Operations. The measure is based on performance versus the annual Manitoba Operations metallurgical production plan. The CENU calculation assigns a plan value for production and price which will be realized for each finished product and intermediate, and converts this value to a number of "Equivalent Nickel Units”. CENU is defined as follows:
CENU = (Ni and contained Cu, Ni, Co x plan price) / Plan Ni Price
3.	Cost: Manitoba Operations Cash Product Cost per Contained Equivalent Nickel Unit ($/CENU) vs. Plan
Manitoba Operations Cash Expenditures represent the annual cash product costs incurred by Manitoba Operations. Cash product costs are those expenditures associated with current operational activities, and do not include amortization and depreciation charges associated with capital expenditures. The measure is based on actual cash expenditures to produce the total Contained Equivalent Nickel Units (CENU) versus the annual Manitoba Operations plan. All plan and actual dollar amounts will be expressed in Canadian dollars. Cash Product Cost per CENU is defined as follows:
(Total Cash Spent) / (CENU Production) = Cash Cost per CENU
4.	Productivity: Pounds Cu/Ni Produced per Person Shift vs. Plan
Productivity measures the number of pounds of copper and nickel produced during an average working shift. The productivity calculation divides production by the number of hours worked and is normalized for an eight (8) hour person shift. The metallurgical plan for each year identifies the production and labour plan values for Manitoba Operations.
The plan values referred to in relation to each of the above four (4) metrics are determined by the Company in its annual business planning routines. Each of the metrics in Component 3 are weighted equally at 12.5% of the total Incentive Payment calculation.
110
Payment Calculation
Points for each metric shall be calculated by multiplying the rating achieved for the metric (based on a six [6] level rating scale of zero [0] to five [5]) by the weight (%) of the respective metric as noted above. The Total Points Earned is determined by adding the scores for each of the three Components. Notwithstanding the amount of Total Points Earned, no Incentive Payment will be made if the score for Component 3 (Manitoba Operations Team Results) is less than 100.
The amount of any Incentive Payment varies according to such scores and the Total Points Earned.
The Incentive Payment calculation is as follows:
Maximum Participation Level (25%)
X
Total Points Earned / 500 (Component 1 + Component 2 + Component 3)
X
Eligible Earnings
General
In order to participate in the Incentive Plan, an employee must be a regular full-time employee who has completed at least one (1) full calendar month of active employment in the Incentive Period and be employed with the Company on the last day of the Incentive Period (December 31st), except that regular full-time employees who have completed at least one (1) full calendar month of active employment in the Incentive Period and are laid off or retire from their employment with the Company during the Incentive Period are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan for that portion of the Incentive Period worked by them.
Employees who are dismissed for cause or who resign from their employment with the Company on or before December 31st during an Incentive Period are not eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan for any portion of that or any subsequent Incentive Period.
Eligible Earnings for the purpose of the Incentive Plan are the employee’s Straight Time Earnings for the Regular Hours Worked by the employee during the Incentive Period. Straight Time Earnings for the purpose of the Incentive Plan shall mean the employee’s straight time earnings during the Incentive Period inclusive of vacation pay for vacation taken during the Incentive Period but exclusive of all premium pay such as holiday pay, shift premium, vacation not taken or paid, Sunday premium, overtime and all bonus or
111
incentive payments and compensation. Regular Hours Worked for the purpose of the Incentive Plan shall mean the regular scheduled hours of work that are actually worked by the employee during the Incentive Period, exclusive of all scheduled and unscheduled overtime hours, which in no event shall exceed 2080 hours in the Incentive Period.
The Incentive Payment will be paid annually, in the first quarter of the year following the Incentive Period to which the Incentive Payment relates.
Verification Process
The Company will meet with two (2) representatives of the Union within sixty (60) days of the completion of each Incentive Period and make a report on the financial results that are relevant to the calculation of the Incentive Payment for that period. For this purpose, the Union will sign a confidentiality agreement that is satisfactory to the Company.

This Charter affords the parties an opportunity to declare what they stand for and to set forward a process that will ‘raise the bar’ even higher, led by the respective President of each organization.
Our Values Continua:

We value a caring workplace and community where everyone has the courage to do what is right, even in the face of adversity.
Principles and Guiding Objectives:
•	Led and owned by the senior representatives of both the Company and Local Union;
•	We endeavor to create a "living” relationship that solves problems, attempts to resolve conflict and allocates funds and resources as required through the term of our Collective Bargaining Agreement;

Appendix ‘O’ PENSION CHANGES
The Company will amend the existing Pension Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees in the Manitoba Division of Vale Canada Limited Represented by United Steelworkers referred to in Article 30 and Appendix F of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "Pension Plan”) to provide for a new defined contribution ("DC”) component to the Pension Plan, as described below.
The defined benefit ("DB”) component of the Pension Plan will be closed to new hires effective December 31, 2011. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2012 will participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan.
The DC component of the Pension Plan will provide for Company contributions equal to eight percent (8%) of an employee’s annual regular basic earnings (straight time rate per hour X regular hours worked, plus regular vacation pay) ("Annual Regular Basic Earnings”).
Employees who participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan may choose to make voluntary employee contributions to the DC component of the Pension Plan ("Voluntary Employee Contributions”) ranging, in one percent (1%) increments, from two percent (2%) to six percent (6%) of the employee’s Annual Regular Basic Earnings. Employees who make Voluntary Employee Contributions to the DC component of the Pension Plan will receive a form of matching Company contributions ranging from fifty percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) of the employee’s Voluntary Employee Contributions to the DC component of the Pension Plan, based on the better of the employee’s age and years of service, as set out in the following table:
Employee Voluntary	Company Matching Contributions (% of
Contributions	Employee Voluntary Contributions)
Voluntary Contributions 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% or 6%	Under age 40 with less than 15 yrs service = 50%
Age 40 to 44 or 15 to 19 yrs service = 66.7%
Age 45 to 49 or 20 to 24 yrs service = 70%
Age 50 to 54 or 25 to 29 yrs service = 75%
Age 55 to 59 or 30 to 34 yrs service = 80%
Age 60 to 61 or 35 to 36 yrs service = 90%
Age 62+ or 37 or more yrs service = 100%
An employee whose most recent date of hire is before January 1, 2012 will be offered the one-time only opportunity to participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan, which opportunity will be provided to such employees on or before December 1,2014. It is understood that employees whose most recent date of hire is before January 1, 2012 may choose to remain in the DB component of the Pension Plan. The following options will be made available on or before December 1,2014 to employees whose most recent date of hire is before January 1,2012:
147
•	participate in the DC component for all service with the Company from the date that the employee’s participation in the DC component begins and retain pension benefits accrued up to that date calculated in accordance with the terms of the DB component;
•	participate in the DC component for all service with the Company from the date that the employee’s participation in the DC component begins and transfer to the DC component the lump-sum value of pension benefits accrued up to that date under the DB component; or
•	continue to participate in the DB component for all past and future service with the Company.
Employees who participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan will have Company pension contributions continue while away from work and in receipt of benefits from the Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba or the Group Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan.
Employees who participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan will have Company pension contributions continue while on an approved leave of absence for up to a maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks.
Retirees who participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan will be eligible for post-retirement health care benefits on the same basis as retirees who participate in the DB component of the Pension Plan.
Employees whose most recent date of hire is before January 1, 2012 and who participate in the DB component of the Pension Plan will be able to voluntarily participate in the Security Fund Plan referred to in a separate agreement between the Company and the Union (the "SFP”) but will not be able to make the Voluntary Employee Contributions referred to above. Employees who participate in the DC component of the Pension Plan will not be able to participate in the SFP but will be able to make the Voluntary Employee Contributions referred to above.
Long Term Disability Plan
The Company will introduce a new Long Term Disability Plan for employees covered by the DC component of the Pension Plan. This Long Term Disability Plan will provide benefits in the same amounts as the Disability Pension benefits for employees under the DB component of the Pension Plan.

Dear Sirs:
We confirm the agreement reached during negotiations respecting Article 18 of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.
It is agreed that a Written Reprimand is distinct and different from a Warning and that a Written Reprimand is a more serious disciplinary action than a Warning.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm the agreement between us respecting summer employment of students.
Every effort will be made to give preference to students having a parent who is an employee.
There are instances where the Company is obliged to give special opportunity to some students for other reasons. One example of this might be a student holding a scholarship under the Inco Scholarship Program for Children of Employees. Another example would be compassionate grounds. There may be other special instances.
However, subject to the special cases that arise, Company policy will continue to be the giving of preference to students whose parent is an employee.
Notwithstanding the definition "probationary employee” in the Collective Agreement, every student shall be deemed to be a "probationary employee” subject to termination at any time prior to the month of October, without such termination being subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
No summer student will be assigned to a job for which the basic wage is Job Step 3 or higher in the case of surface jobs or Job Step 8 or higher in the case of mines jobs.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sirs:
While the Company and the Union may give different emphasis to the interests of their various constituents, they share the common objective of a successful, continuing operation, functioning in an atmosphere of respect between a strong union and a strong company.
As both parties acknowledge that the ultimate determinant of employment security in the Manitoba Operations is the cost of production, and as recent fundamental changes in the Manitoba Operations have resulted in an increased cost base, the Company and the Union commit that they will actively pursue mutually agreed upon initiatives to address this imperative.
This is an enabling document, intended to formalize the mechanism by which the Union and the employees may contribute to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Operation and thus provide greater employment security, opportunity and enhanced workplace safety and health.
A joint Union/Management committee shall be established with the responsibility to achieve these objectives.
It is agreed that the broad mandate of the committee is to focus upon:
-	improved effectiveness of labour relations.
-	the on-going management of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
-	initiatives to reduce the costs of production, better utilize the plant and equipment and increase product quality without negatively impacting employment security.
The committee shall be governed by the following terms of reference:
1 62
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.	The committee will be known as the Joint Problem Solving Committee (JPS Committee).
2.	The JPS Committee will consist of up to seven (7) members of the bargaining unit selected by the Local Union President, including the Local Union President, and up to seven (7) representatives of the Company selected by the Company, including the Manager of Human Resources. A representative of the United Steelworkers may also attend JPS Committee meetings and otherwise be involved in matters dealt with by the JPS Committee. It is recognized that it is most desirable that the JPS Committee initially be comprised of the Negotiating Committees for the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	The JPS Committee will meet at least once in each month or more frequently if mutually agreed. The JPS Committee meetings will be co-chaired by the Local Union President and the Manager of Human Resources.
4.	It is recognized that replacement of JPS Committee members will from time to time be necessary. In order to minimize the impact on the functioning of the JPS Committee, the parties will endeavour to keep to a minimum the number of individuals replaced on the JPS Committee at any given time.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sirs:
We confirm the agreement reached during negotiations respecting the application of Clause 7.03 in day-to-day operations. The attached guidelines and flowchart are intended to provide clarity and guidance to Stewards and members of Management in the distribution of overtime opportunities.
This document does not alter the intent of Clause 7.03 in any manner whatsoever. Any difference arising concerning the assignment of overtime opportunities will be handled under the provisions of Article 20 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Where an overtime opportunity has been improperly assigned to an employee outside of the working group, the qualified employee with the lowest opportunity hours in the working group, who was readily available shall be paid as if he had worked such opportunity and the overtime hours shall be added to his record of accumulated overtime hours.
The purpose of Clause 7.03 is to ensure that overtime is distributed in a fair and equitable manner. "As evenly as practicable” does not mean that at a particular point in time the record will be even. Over a period of time there will be a levelling off. There should not normally be large discrepancies in opportunity hours. Any discrepancy should be explainable. In the trades, continuity of a job may cause some discrepancy in the record but should not result in large variation in the record.
Yours truly,

Overtime Guidelines
1.	Whenever an employee has the opportunity to work overtime in any job in which he is qualified, these opportunity hours will be recorded whether worked or refused.
2.	Employees temporarily assigned to a different working group on a day-to-day basis will be considered part of their regular working group for purposes of overtime distribution. For the Mechanical and Electrical Departments “day-to-day” means 5 working days or less. In other departments “day-to-day” means that the length of the temporary assignment to a different working group is unknown or uncertain.
3.	An employee on temporary assignment to a different working group on a day-to-day basis will be the first employee(s) to be considered for overtime opportunities after the regular employees in the work group refuse.
4.	When it becomes necessary to go to another working group for additional overtime coverage the method of distribution shall be the same as for the original working group.
5.	Overtime worked or offered to an employee outside of the regular working group will be recorded in his regular working group’s records.
6.	When an employee joins a new working group, he will be credited with the average number of overtime opportunity hours of the employees in the group.
7.	Distribution of overtime opportunities for trades will be to the employees in the required trade line and work group.
8.	When an employee returns following vacation, no adjustment will be made to his overtime opportunity hours for the vacation period.
9.	Callout hours actually worked are included in overtime records. The canvassing of employees for call-outs does not follow the overtime scheduling process or guidelines.
10.	Hours worked on a General Holiday which falls on a regularly scheduled working day are not recorded in the record of overtime opportunity hours. Overtime hours worked on a General Holiday are recorded in the record of overtime opportunity hours.
173
11.	“Availability” depends on the circumstances of when the requirement for overtime is known. If the requirement is known several days in advance the crew that would be on regular days off should be first offered the work. If the requirement is know on the day it is to be worked, the opportunity should be offered to the crew that has just completed their regular shift (otherwise the situation is a call-out).
12.	All temporary promotions should be made to the employees working their regular shift before offering overtime opportunity to any employee.
13.	Long Term and Selective Refusals - If an employee indicates that he does not wish to be offered overtime work for a period of time or in specific occupations or jobs, he should be advised that a refusal shall be marked on his record and he will be credited with the appropriate opportunity hours as if he had been asked based on the overtime record for the working group. There would then be no need for an adjustment to his record when the employee indicates he is again ready to work overtime.
14.	Employees on selective duty will be offered overtime opportunity if it is in keeping with the individual’s work restrictions.
If the opportunity occurs in the employee’s regular working group, a judgment must be made when the employee returns to full duty whether any adjustment is needed to keep the individual at the same relative position in overtime distribution.
If the opportunity occurs outside of the employee’s regular working group the hours of opportunity will be brought back to the regular working group when the employee returns to regular duty.
15.	An employee returning to their overtime working group after an absence from work of ten (10) or more working days caused by any reason other than vacation, special vacation or statutory holidays shall be returned to the same relative position they were in when they left the group.
For example, if an employee was in tenth (10th) position in a twenty (20) person working group when the employee left the group for ten (10) or more working days, the employee will be returned to that tenth (10th) position when he returns to the group. The employee will be assigned a split of the overtime hours of the person in the eleventh (11th) position and the ninth (9th) position.
174
If an employee is in first (1st) position (most credited overtime hours) when the employee leaves a given working group for a period of ten (10) or more working days, he will be returned to that first (1st) position upon returning to the original working group. The employee returning to the first position will be credited with the number of hours credited to the employee in the second (2nd) position on the list and with half of the difference between the number of hours credited to the employee in the second (2nd) position on the list and those credited to the employee in the third (3rd) position on the list.
If an employee is in last position on the list (least credited overtime hours) when the employee leaves a given working group for a period of ten (10) or more working days, he will be returned to that last position upon returning to the original working group. The employee returning to the last position will be credited with the number of hours credited to the employee in the second-to-last position on the list minus half of the difference between the number of hours credited to the employee in the second-to-last position on the list and those credited to the employee in the third-to-last position on the list.
16.	The record of overtime opportunity hours will reflect the following:
■	Worked Overtime Hours
■	Refused Overtime Opportunity
Employees on vacation or otherwise not readily available for overtime opportunity canvas are not credited with overtime opportunity hours. When an unsuccessful attempt is made to contact an employee for an overtime opportunity canvas (e.g. phone call not answered), "no contact” will be recorded for that employee.
17.	Nothing in the foregoing overtime guidelines will preclude individual departments or departmental working areas from enacting specific guidelines with respect to the method or sequence with which particular working groups are canvassed for overtime opportunities. Any such arrangements will, however, require the agreement of the area Human Resource Business Partner and the Conflict Resolution Coordinator or Problem Solving Coordinator. Any such arrangements in place as of the date of this agreement will remain unaffected by the implementation of the foregoing overtime guidelines.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached during negotiations respecting Training Instructors.
During the term of the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company will develop the role of Training Instructor.
It is understood and agreed that the development of each role will include;
a)	a role description outlined as per the Company’s Role Description System, and
b)	task assignments (CPQQRT’s) that define specific tasks and expectations, and the measurement of same, and
c)	a selection process based on the Role Description and CPQQRT’s, and
d)	performance reviews as per the Company’s Performance Review System, and
e)	provision for removal from the role where circumstances show that the incumbent cannot meet the accountabilities of the role description and CPQQRT’s.
It is further understood and agreed that the authorities of the roles will not include the authority to issue discipline under the Company’s discipline programs, and reporting relationships and rates of pay will be defined based on expectations of the role. The selection process will involve posting a notice to fill the role(s), and formal assessment of the candidates’ skill, abilities and competencies. The assessment will include an interview and demonstration of skills through appropriate presentations and exercises. The senior candidate meeting the minimum standard established for each of the selection criteria will be assigned to take training to fill the role, and upon successful completion of the training will be assigned to the role.
186
The decision of the Company to remove an employee from the role, other than where the employee requests such removal, will be subject to review under the grievance procedure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 15.08A the employee will be permitted to return to his former occupational classification provided that the removal occurs within the six (6) calendar month period immediately following his assignment to the Training Instructor role.
The Company agrees that the Union will have input into the development of the role description and selection criteria and such input will be given careful consideration and substantial weight by the Company in its decision making process. A Selection Committee comprised of two (2) representatives of the Company and two (2) employees appointed by the Union will be established for the purpose of assessing the candidates for the role of Training Instructor.
The Union agrees that the establishment of the role of Training Instructor will not preclude salaried staff or other individuals from performing similar functions where such similar functions have traditionally been performed in the past by salaried staff or other individuals.

Dear Sir;
This letter of agreement and the attached flowchart will serve to confirm the agreement reached between us with respect to the functioning of the Contracting Out Committee and the Overflow Work Process.
During the first six (6) months of the term of this agreement, the Contracting Out Committee Co-Chairs will cooperate to enhance the effectiveness of the Overflow Work Process. The Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee will report on the progress achieved in enhancing the effectiveness of the Overflow Work Process at a date no later than March 15, 2009. Such report will be submitted to the members of the Executive Steering Committee.
Several opportunities for the enhancement of the Overflow Work Process were discussed during negotiations. These opportunities may include but will not necessarily be limited to "contract creep” and the development of business cases for the performance of non-traditional work. Such business cases may be used in the future as outlined in point (f) below.
To support this commitment, the parties have agreed to the following:
A.	Access To Information: Members of the Contracting Out Committee require data and relevant information to facilitate their work. This includes a general knowledge of systems and key process elements related to contracting out. As such, they will be provided access to the following:
I.	Contract, tendering, purchasing and accounting processes; and,
II.	relevant information broken down by class of expense, general ledger, project number, standing work order, repair and returns, standing contracts, and monthly Departmental status reports.
B.	Facilities and Equipment: The Company shall endeavor to ensure that the appointed Contracting Out Committee Area Representatives are provided access to a working area and computer terminal. In the event that such arrangement cannot be readily provided, it is understood that the office of the Worker Safety Representative shall be made available.
C.	Training: Members of the Contracting Out Committee shall be provided training as may be required on related systems (CORVU, EXCEL, Ellipse) as well as an overview on our Manitoba Operations Accounting structure and contract administration process.
190
D.	Resourcing for Success: Contracting Out Committee Area Representatives shall be granted up to two (2) shifts per month to support our joint commitment to reduce contracting out. These two (2) shifts per month maximum will include time off to attend monthly Contracting Out Committee meetings. In the event of a dispute with respect to the use of these shifts, the matter shall be referred to the Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee for resolution. On a trial basis for the term of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, a full-time Union Co-Chair position will be created, with duties and accountabilities as outlined in Role Profile - Appendix K. This paragraph d) will be subject to quarterly review by the Executive Steering Committee.
E.	The Union and Company Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee will report out on a quarterly basis to the Executive Steering Committee. Such reports will inform the Executive Steering Committee of the significant achievements of and challenges faced by the Contracting Out Committee.
F.	Scope and Accountabilities: It is agreed that in order to achieve the common objectives of reducing contracting out and costs an examination of contracting out beyond the limitations of Clause 3.03 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement may be appropriate. The Contracting Out Committee will examine such contracting out opportunities and make recommendations to the Executive Steering Committee as appropriate, based on these common objectives. The Company will apply careful consideration and substantial weight to any such recommendations.
G.	Contracting out review: Pursuant to Clause 3.03 of the Current Collective Bargaining Agreement, the union may request a meeting in the first quarter of each year to review Annual Capital Development (ACD) project activities awarded or renewed for the current year in each specific Mine department.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sir:
This letter will serve to confirm the agreement reached at negotiations with respect to the establishment of a Construction Crew within the Manitoba Operations. The Company and Union agree that the Construction Crew will be established with the following objectives:
■	To capture some elements of miscellaneous "construction” work presently being performed by contractors; and,
■	To do so in a manner that reduces the cost associated with performing this work.
The Company and Union agree to the following commitments with respect to the establishment of the Construction Crew:
■	The Construction Crew will be established within six (6) months of the ratification of the 2008 collective bargaining agreement;
■	The Construction Crew will initially take the form of a stand alone working group within the Central Shops working area of the Surface and Miscellaneous Department;
■	Positions on the Construction Crew within the Central Shops working area of the Surface and Miscellaneous Department will be posted according to Article 15 of the Collective Agreement;
■	The Request Transfer system will continue to govern operations employee movement into the Central Shops working area, as has been the past practice;
■	The Construction Crew will consist of up to eight (8) employees possessing a range of skills including labour and trades. This skill mix will be determined by the work taken on by the Construction Crew. Trades support required for work initially taken on by the Construction Crew will be drawn from within the Central Shops working area. Further resourcing
194
of the Construction Crew will be guided by the two evaluation processes identified below;
■	During the first six (6) months following ratification of the 2008 Collective Bargaining Agreement, a subcommittee of the Joint Contracting Out Committee will be struck to evaluate the type, scope and volume of work which may be taken on by the Construction Crew upon its implementation. By way of example, this body of work may include but will not necessarily be limited to portions of the asbestos abatement, concrete or miscellaneous demolition work being performed throughout the Manitoba Operations;
■	In January of each year during the term of the 2008 Collective Agreement, a subcommittee of the Joint Contracting Out Committee will perform a review of the work performed by the Construction Crew over the past year and work planned within the Manitoba Operations for the coming year which might otherwise be outsourced. This review will be executed for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of increasing or decreasing the size of the Construction Crew workforce. Business cases for the performance of said work, required completion schedules, the availability of skilled labour and the requirements and efficiency of operations will guide this annual evaluation;
■	Subject to the ongoing evaluation of work to be taken on by the Construction Crew, the following diagram illustrates the manner in which the Company intends to initially resource the Supervision, Planning and Trades needs of the Construction Crew:
195
■ Nothing in the foregoing commitments will be construed as limiting the Company’s rights under Article 2 of the Collective Agreement.

Dear Sir:
We confirm the agreement reached between the Company and the Union with respect to the Term Labour Pool (the “TLP”).
The Company and the Union share the common objective of a successful, continuing operation and are committed to contributing to the on-going viability of the Manitoba Operation by improving efficiencies, creating greater flexibility and reducing costs in order to enhance capital investment opportunities and provide greater employment security.
In order to fulfill this commitment, a TLP will be created and utilized to meet short-term workforce requirements as set forth below. The TLP will not be used to fill permanent full-time vacancies in the bargaining unit.
1.	The TLP shall be managed and administered by the Company and the individuals in the TLP shall be selected by the Company.
2.	Issues in dispute that cannot be resolved by the Contracting Out committee, will be referred to the Executive Steering committee.
3.	The TLP shall be comprised of not more than fifty (50) individuals at any one time, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and the Union, including bargaining unit retirees and other individuals as agreed to by the Company and the Union.
4.	In order to be considered by the Company for the TLP, individuals shall be required to satisfy all Company hiring requirements, including medical requirements.
5.

Dear Sir:
Vale Canada Limited (the Company) and USW Local 6166 (the Union) share a commitment to expand upon the Company’s existing apprenticeship program.
This letter summarizes the understanding that our two parties have reached regarding the Company’s participation in the Senior Years Apprenticeship Option (SYAO) program.
The Company and the Union will jointly investigate opportunities to partner with the School District of Mystery Lake and/or other such interested parties, on terms and conditions to be discussed and mutually agreed upon between the Company, the Union and the partner(s). These opportunities will provide work experience for individuals through programs such as the Senior Years Apprenticeship Programs and the Community Partners Programs (Example: Nelson House Training Authorities).
The creation of a Senior Years Apprenticeship Program will not affect the ability of Vale employees to participate in an internal apprenticeship program.
To be certain this letter accurately reflects our understanding, please review the items one (1) through seven (8) listed and indicate your understanding and agreement by signing on the signature line below.
1.	SYAO will attempt to generate interest in the trades at an earlier age;
2.	The program will create an opportunity for local young people to start a trades apprenticeship while still in high school;
3.	The program will allow students to acquire elective credits toward their graduation and cumulative hours towards their apprenticeship through part-time, on-the-job training.
4.	To participate, the student must have completed high school Senior 2 and be enrolled in an approved Manitoba Senior 3 or Senior 4 program. The student apprentice will be limited to a maximum of twenty (20) hours of work per week and must maintain acceptable grades as defined by the high school in all courses in which they are enrolled. The duration of employment will be 110 hours for each school credit with multiple credit
205
hours available up to a maximum of eight (8) credit hours over a two-year period.
5.	Through the already established Joint Trades Committee, the Company and Union will evaluate the appropriateness of each SYAO placement prior to being advertised with the local high school.
6.	Student Apprentices will not be deemed as an "employee” under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). As such, the terms and conditions of the C.B.A. will not be applicable.
7.	The exception being that Student Apprentices will follow Schedule "C” of the C.B.A. for their hourly rate of pay.
8.	While the Company may give preference in hiring to those individuals who successfully complete a Senior Years Apprenticeship Program as part of their course of study, it is understood that the Company is in no way obliged to employ any individual who participates in the Senior Years Apprenticeship Program.
Either party may terminate the program described in the paragraphs above by providing to the other party thirty (30) days’ written notice.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sir:
This letter will serve to confirm the agreement reached through Collective Bargaining with respect to the Employee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP; formerly EAP).
It is the intent of Vale Inco and United Steelworkers 6166 to explore available EFAP delivery models in the interest of identifying and implementing a "World Class” EFAP system for the benefit of the Manitoba Operations workforce and their families.
The Employee and Family Assistance Program is intended to provide services and assistance required by employees and their families such that these issues do not impact employee work performance.
An individual’s employment status will not be jeopardized by his or her use of the services available under the EFAP.
All employees and their families should have access to professional services for a range of issues, which may include but not necessarily be limited to:
■	Personal and psychological counselling;
■	Family and marriage counselling;
■	Grief and post-traumatic stress counselling;
■	Suicide prevention counselling;
■	Alcohol addiction counselling and treatment;
■	Substance addiction counselling and treatment;
■	Nutritional counselling;
■	Care of elderly persons counselling;
■	Financial and debt counselling;
■	Management of the Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) team and services.
All EFAP services are provided on a confidential basis except in the case of a mandatory referral (affected employee fails to comply with recommended treatment program, which may result in termination of the employment relationship). It is the role of the EFAP Coordinator to inform the Company of any such non-compliance.
213
It is further agreed that the following protocol will be utilized to assist the parties in creating a new and improved EFAP:
■	EFAP policies and procedures must be consistent with other Vale Inco policies, procedures and collective agreements;
■	Contractual arrangements with service providers are made with Vale Inco Limited and will comply with all legal and financial obligations (e.g. Competitive tender, regular invoicing, fee for service, metrics reporting, auditable results, etc.);
■	Service providers will be contractually obligated to cooperate with other members of the "Community of Care” established under the EFAP. All service providers will share with one another the information required to provide the best possible care for our employees and their families while respecting the employee’s right to confidential service;
Service providers will be expected to report the following metrics on a quarterly basis and in such a manner as to protect the confidentiality and anonymity of clients:
■	Number, type and source of referrals;
■	Service utilization (in person, phone, internet, etc.);
■	Issue "themes” being treated;
■	Workplace issues, if any, giving rise to need for counselling services;
■	Time from referral to initiation of counselling (and reasons for any delay);
■	Average time in counselling per client (number of sessions, total time);
■	Promotional effectiveness;
■	Others as appropriate and required.
In addition to the foregoing commitments, this Letter of Agreement will confirm our understanding with respect to the provision of local social and psychological counseling services:
■	For the term of the 2008 Collective Agreement the Company will retain 2 full time local counsellors to provide assistance. This service is provided for the benefit of employees and their families who reside at Thompson and surrounding area.
214
Finally, all EFAP service providers will be accountable to a Joint EFAP Committee which will be responsible for setting relevant policy, promoting the program, directing and monitoring all aspects of the service. The Joint EFAP Committee will be made up of two representatives from USW 6166 and two representatives from the Company. The Joint EFAP Committee shall meet as required and mutually agreed, but at a frequency no less than once per quarter.
The committee will determine criteria that will guide the selection of the EFAP coordinator role.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Dear Sirs:
This letter of agreement will serve to confirm the agreement reached between us with respect to the reduction of contracting out within the Manitoba Operations.
The Company and Union are committed to significantly reducing the amount of work being contracted out and to improving the business competitiveness of the Manitoba Operations. The objective of this initiative is to eliminate the contracting out of work which falls under the following definition:
1.	Work which falls within the bargaining unit as described in Article 3.03 of the current collective agreement; and,
2.	Work for which the required skills, resources, materials, tools and equipment are readily available within the Manitoba Operations; and,
3.	Work which would, if performed by Vale Inco personnel, result in an operating cost savings for the Manitoba Operations.
Work that forms part of Major Capital Projects (one (1) million dollars or more) is not covered by this agreement. Work performed in a more cost effective manner by a contractor will remain with the contractor.
It is the mandate of the Contracting Out Committee to work toward the commitment made in this letter. The Co-Chairs of the Contracting Out Committee will report out on a quarterly basis to the Executive Steering Committee.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

The parties agree that rock quarrying activities in the 1A/1B pit will be undertaken by a third party. The parties further recognize that the rock quarrying activities in the 1A/1B pit will expose a mineralization zone which may generate ore for processing in the Manitoba Operations’ Mill, Smelter and Refinery.
The Company and Union agree that should the latter stages of the 1A/1B project result in the mining primarily of ore (presently referred to as "the plum”) meant for processing within the Manitoba Operations Mill, Smelter and Refinery, Vale Inco personnel will be employed in the drilling and blasting of that material. The project schedule will dictate the date upon which these activities are undertaken.

United Steelworkers Local 6166 19 Elizabeth Drive Thompson, Manitoba R8N 1S7
Dear Sirs:
The Company and the Union share an ongoing commitment to our Trades Apprenticeship Program. It is our mutual desire to establish a trades workforce at the Company’s Manitoba Operation that is "world class” in terms of skill, ability, performance and sustainability. The Company’s Trades Apprenticeship Program is a critical component in attaining this goal.
We recognize the benefits to both the Company and our existing workforce in providing such trades apprenticeship opportunities. These include meeting our trades workforce requirements in a competitive labour market and providing exciting career advancement opportunities for our existing employees.
The parties further recognize that current employees are concerned that such opportunities could be limited in the future as a result of partnerships with educational institutions, the availability of skilled trades, etc. With respect to this concern, the Company commits to convene the Joint Trades Committee on an annual basis, or more often as required, to review the intake of trades apprentices for each upcoming year.
The Company retains the right to hire journeyman tradespersons and apprentices in the 3rd year and beyond as required to satisfy the requirements of operations. Yet, the Company supports the principle that candidates from within the existing bargaining unit be given consideration for trades apprenticeship opportunities as well. To this latter end, the Company commits to the selection of two (2) apprentice candidates from within the existing workforce for each one (1) 2nd year trades apprentice hired from outside of the bargaining unit. This commitment is subject to the availability, skill and ability of employees to meet the trades selection criteria.
From this date forward, the parties agree to the following:
1.	An employee who is selected by the Company to participate in a Trades Apprenticeship Program shall be paid forty (40) hours at his applicable
21 9
straight time rate and applicable Hourly Employee Annual Incentive Plan for each full week he attends a recognized Community College on a fulltime basis, as approved by the Company, as part of the Trades Apprenticeship Program. The employee shall not be entitled to any overtime or other premiums during each week that are result of their efforts to complete educational requirements. In the event an employee is offered an opportunity to work for the Company outside of their regular school commitment, they shall be paid their applicable overtime rate and shift premiums.
2.	The Company shall be responsible for the payment of associated tuition fees;
3.	An employee who is required by the Company to attend a college or trades school located outside of the Mystery Lake Government District as part of the Trades Apprenticeship Program shall be provided a weekly allowance of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each full calendar week that the employee is required to be outside of the Mystery Lake Government District to attend the college or trade school, which allowance shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis for any such period less than a full calendar week.
4.	Attendance at such training will be considered as ‘time worked’ for the calculation of "Years of Employment With Pay” as prescribed under the terms of the Manitoba Pension Plan;
5. In recognition of the commitment outlined in 1, 2 and 3 above, an employee, with less than eleven (11) years of service, electing to participate in the Trades Apprenticeship Program shall be obliged to sign a Return Service Agreement. That agreement signed between the employee and the Company will include the following understandings:
A.	Upon completion of the course of study for the educational leave which was granted, and the associated journeyperson trade ticket level being achieved, the employee would commit to work for the Company for a period of four (4) years.
B.	If the employee fails to meet the above commitment, for all or a portion of that term, then he\she would be obliged to pay the Company all or a portion of the costs associated with such Apprenticeship Training.
C.	Those associated costs shall include the base wages, allowances and other educational monies paid by the Company.
220
D.	The funds to be repaid to the Employer shall be equal to the percentage of the term of employment. For example if seventy five percent (75%) of the four (4) year term of employment is not completed, then the employee would repay seventy five percent (75%) of that sum outlined in clause (c) above.
E.	If the employee fails, for reasons unacceptable to the Company, to complete the course of study for the Trades Apprenticeship Program, then the Company may require the employee to pay all, or a portion, of the associated costs paid up to the date of such failure. By way of clarification, this is intended to deter those individuals who otherwise might elect to quit to secure other employment. It is not meant to be applied under such circumstances as an employee’s inability to succeed at the training, or an apprentice confronted with a critical personal matter.
If the forgoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

Each calendar year the Company will allocate a maximum of $150,000 for reimbursement of eligible and accepted claims. Such monies shall not carry over from one year to the next.
The Plan will be administered by the "Support Plan Committee”. The Committee shall be comprised of two representatives of the Company, one of whom shall be the Manager of Human Resources, and two representatives of the Local Union, one of whom shall be the Union President. The Committee will meet as necessary.

Dear Sirs:
It is understood that if the Pipe Kipper ultramafic project delivers an acceptable business case and proceeds through all associated environmental, regulatory, First Nations and other processes, that:
•	All development, clearing, stripping, construction and site preparation work will be tendered to outside contractors.
•	At that point in time when Pipe Kipper and Concentrator (if indeed the latter is built) commence operations to mine and mill nickel ore, any such production work shall be undertaken by employees represented by the United Steelworkers, Local 6166.
There is no guarantee or commitment that a business case will be reached for this project. Even in the event that one is established, the associated consultation, approval and construction phase would likely take several years beyond the terms of the current Collective Agreement just negotiated between the parties.

Dear Sir:
We confirm that we are prepared to agree to the following respecting assistance to employees in the event of layoffs resulting from a closure of a major mine or plant or the permanent closure of the Manitoba Operations.
A. Preferential hiring of hourly rated employees permanently laid off at the Manitoba Operations - The following is subject to Vale Canada Limited being able to make, in a manner and at a cost that is satisfactory to Vale Canada Limited, all necessary amendments to Collective Agreements and pension and other benefits plans that may exist at its Sudbury Operation, Port Colborne Operation, Voisey’s Bay Operation and Long Harbour Operation.
Where there is a requirement to hire hourly rated employees at the Sudbury Operation, Port Colborne Operation, Voisey’s Bay Operation or Long Harbour Operation and all the hiring criteria, including, but not limited to, any requirements of any applicable Impacts and Benefits Agreements, governmental agreements and adjacency related policies, of the hiring location have been complied with, preference in hiring will be given to hourly rated employees who were laid off within the previous 24 month period due to a closure of a major mine or plant or the permanent closure of the Manitoba Operations, subject to the following conditions:
To be eligible for preferential hiring, a laid off employee must have been laid off within the previous 24 month period due to a closure of a major mine or plant or the permanent closure of the Manitoba Operations and must make application and satisfy all pre-employment requirements of the hiring location, which may include but will not necessarily be limited to education, skill and experience and medical requirements. Where, in the opinion of the Company, the factors described above are for all intents and purposes equal between two (2) or more laid off employees, preference in hiring shall be given to the laid off employee with the greatest seniority.
The Company’s decision regarding employment of a laid off employee shall not be subject to review under the grievance or arbitration procedures at the hiring location.
Where a laid off employee is hired pursuant to this Letter of Agreement, service at the Manitoba Operations at the date of lay off will be credited at the hiring location for the purpose of determining the duration of annual vacation to which the employee is entitled. For greater clarity, no laid off employee shall have his or her service at the Manitoba Operations credited at the hiring location for any other purpose, including but not limited to the right to bid on timing of annual vacation or any other matters in which rights or benefits are conferred on the
235
basis of seniority. The seniority of the employee so hired will be calculated based on that employee’s most recent date of hire at the hiring location. Group benefits, including without limitation, health, medical and life insurance, will be in accordance with such benefits offered at the hiring location. For pension purposes, the following will apply:
Employees who participated in the defined benefit component of the Pension Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees in the Manitoba Division of Vale Canada Limited Represented by United Steelworkers (“MPP”) on the date of lay off:	Choice, where applicable, of either having (i) the employee’s number of Years of Employment with Pay (YEWP) under the terms of the MPP as at the date of lay off recognized under the terms of the applicable defined benefit plan, if any, available at the hiring location, or (ii) service at the Manitoba Operations at the date of lay off credited at the hiring location for the purpose of determining the eligible level of Company contribution to correspond to the employee’s voluntary contribution under the terms of the applicable defined contribution plan, if any, available at the hiring location.
Employees who participated in the defined contribution component of the MPP on the date of lay off:	Service at the Manitoba Operations at the date of lay off credited at the hiring location for the purpose of determining the eligible level of Company contribution to correspond to the employee’s voluntary contribution under the terms of the applicable defined contribution plan, if any, available at the hiring location.
B. Support for Laid Off Employees - An “Employment Transition Committee” consisting of one (1) employee appointed by the Union and one (1) individual appointed by the Company will be established to expedite a process to provide employment counseling for affected employees. The committee will coordinate the delivery of all applicable government services and programs designed to assist affected employees, government services and programs designed to assist affected employees, in such areas as resume writing, counseling and financial management.
The Employment Transition Committee will make recommendations to the Joint Problem Solving Committee. Such recommendations may include, but would not be limited to matters of:
•	Consultation with employees and their spouses
•	Consultation with USW District 3 Representatives
•	Consultation with USW International Representatives
•	Consultation with municipal, provincial and federal governments
•	Relocation Assistance
•	Recall Rights
•	Pension Transfer
236
Meetings of the Employment Transition Committee will be held as often as required at mutually agreeable times. The provisions of Clause 19.04 with respect to payment of time lost shall apply to the Union representative on the Committee.
If the foregoing is satisfactory to you, we will be obliged if you will so indicate by executing the form of acceptance appearing at the end of the enclosed copy of this letter and returning that copy to us.

STATEMENT ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
VALE Inco Limited, Manitoba Operation and the United Steelworkers, Local 6166, are jointly committed to maintain a work environment that is free of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated and any person who is in breach of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action or discharge.
VALE Inco Limited, Manitoba Operation will not knowingly permit the sexual harassment of any person and will take all reasonable steps to terminate such harassment, as required under the Human Rights Code of Manitoba.
Sexual harassment is any unsolicited and unwelcome sexually oriented behaviour. It may include but is not limited to the following:
-	unwanted sexual attention of a persistent or abusive nature, made by a person who knows or ought reasonably to know that such attention is unwanted; or
-	implied or expressed promise of reward for complying with a sexually oriented request; or
-	implied or expressed threat of reprisal, in the form either of actual reprisal or the denial of opportunity, for refusal to comply with a sexually oriented request; or
-	unwelcome remarks, jokes, innuendos, propositions, or taunting about a person's body, attire, sex or sexual orientation; or
-	displaying of pornographic or sexist pictures or materials.
An individual who is being subjected to any form of sexual harassment may tell the offender that what is being said or done is offensive and ask that such behaviour stop or report the incident, at the earliest opportunity, to a union steward or committeeman, or a supervisor or other management personnel.
