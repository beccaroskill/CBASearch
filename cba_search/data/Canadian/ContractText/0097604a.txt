The Company will not hire loaders with operators if there are regular -classified loader operators available to do the work.
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
3:01	It is agreed that it is the exclusive function and
right of the Company to operate and manage all aipetts- of its business, including the limitation, curtailment and cessation of any or all operations, except where any right to do so has been specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement.
3:02	The Company reserves the right to adjust all or any of
its crews arising out of any change in manufacturing process or in a change of equipment.
3:03	The Company agrees to review with the Union pertinent
details and reasons for any major cutbacks or mill shutdown, including the shut down of a shift at the Dressing Mill. The Company will have such review with the Union in advance of such contemplated change.
3:04	Technological Change
a)	Technological change for the purposes of this agreement is defined as changes in the operation resulting from the introduction of new and different equipment which will reduce labour requirements.
b)	The Company agrees to give the Union as much advance notice as possible from the decision to make a technological change and the start-up of the new eguipment. If there will be a reduction of three or more regular jobs, the advance notice will be at least six weeks in advance of start-up.
c)	The notice to the Union will advise of the new equipment and the earliest anticipated start-up date together with information as to the number of jobs to be eliminated and an offer to sit down with the Union executives to discuss the coming changes and other jobs which may be affected or training to be undertaken.

4:03 a) In cases of promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off and recall, length of service will prevail when skill and experience are relatively equal.
b) i) When a permanent vacancy on a classification occurs, the job will be posted for bid unless there is

The Company has the right to establish one or more spares for all regular classifications which require advance training and will post job bids for all classifications for which it determines a need for regular spares. Temporary spare assignments on a classification may be made as necessary but individuals so appointed without a job bid award will gain no seniority or rights in that classification and their experience as the result of a temporary spare assignment will not be used to give them precedence in a later job bid award.

For employees displaced as a result of technological change as described in Article 3:04 above, the training and/or break-in period may be extended to thirty (30) days as required.

PLASTER ROCK SAWMILL
Bonus Incentive Plan Effective February I, 1982
Bonus to be based on production per shift at sawmill as per packages completed - a control will be necessary on package content to assure that quality is maintained and that grades and dimensions are not mixed to complete	packages
prematurely. Package volumes to be determined on basis of saleable lumber per package coming out of planer mill i.e. if a package of rough lumber contains 1800 fbm before drying and dressing but only 1500 fbm are saleable after package goes through planer mill, 1500 fbm will be volume used for calculating sawmill production. These figures will have to be monitored closely and adjustments made monthly at first in order to reflect as closely as possible the true production situation.
Bonus to be calculated on a per shift basis and paid weekly to all employees working at the sawmill. Shift production will be calculated as the average of the two shifts when the mill is operating on a two shift per day basis.
The Company agrees to meet with a committee from Ihe
Local Union each month for the purpose of reviewing the lumber inventory, production and shipment statements and LO discuss any adjustments which are to be made in the lumber package conversion factors. At such meeting the Union representatives will be free to review any questions they believe to be adversely affecting production including problems of maintenance, manning and availability of spare parts.
In the event that the sawmill schedule is changed from a two shift per day basis to a one shift per day basis, the bonus schedule for two shift basis will continue to apply during the first two weeks following the change. The one shift schedule will be applied to any subsequent weeks worked on a one shift per day basis.
The bonus schedule for a two shift basis will apply to all shifts worked on a two shift per day basis.
In the event changes in process, manning or equipment are made which affect productivity, the standard production of the mill on which incentive awards are made may be adjusted upward or downward in order to maintain as nearly as possible the same relative opportunity for incentive earnings by individual employees as existed prior to the change.
41
Effective the first Monday following ratification the Bonus plan will be applicable to Sawmill and Planer mill on independent basis as follows:
Sawmill -	Bonus to be calculated on production per shift
basis (average of two shifts when mill is operating on two shift basis) same as at present. hourly bonus table has been modified to reflect 1,000 Cbm increments. This new table will be in effect starting the first day of the week following ratification.
Planer Mill - Applicable to all employees working at planer
mill or associated with planer mill operations e.g. machine operators handling dressed lumber and/or for shipment ; local salesman.
Bonus to be based on production per shift at planer mill on basis of saleable output from the planer mill.
Bonus will be calculated daily and paid weekly. The hourly bonus to be paid for each day will be calculated by finding the applicable hourly bonus from the attached tables for each of the planers in operation on that day and averaging the two (e.g. Stetson Ross operates on 1" lumber and produces AO,000 fbm results in hourly bonus of $0.66; Coastal operates on 2" lumber and produces 160,000 fbm, results in hourly bonus of 1.01. Hourly bonus to be paid to all employees working in Planer mill for this day is (0.66 / 1.01) + 2 - 0,835.) If the Planer Mill operates on two (2) shifts per day basis, the hourly bonus to be paid for that day will be the average of the two shifts.
In the event that either line operates for less than nine (9) hours in a shift for reasons other than equipment breakdowns (e.g. lack of stock, etc.), the production for the line(s) in question will be adjusted to reflect a full nine (9) hours of production.
Export Lumber
Export lumber not dressed in the Planer mill will not be counted as planer production for bonus purposes.
Effective on the first day of the week following ratification, bonus will be paid on export lumber handled at the planer mill on the basis of $0,005 per hour per package handled - bonus to be paid to all employees on the
A2
day shift, (ie. no bonus to be paid if an extra crew is brought in to do export packaging on night shift or On overtime.)
Boiler Room Employees
Bonus for boiler Room employees will lie based on sawmill production bonus.
Bonus will be paid to Roller Room employees for all hours worked at straight time each week. Hourly bonus payment for days on which the sawmill does not operate will he the average hourly bonus payment paid during the week in which the non-operating day occurs, i.e., Saturday bonus to be based on previous week and Sunday bonus to be based on following week.
When the mill is operating to produce chips only, the bonus will be paid on the combined daily chip production of both shifts as per the table below. Bonus will he paid actively at work for all hours worked on each day for which the bonus is applicable.
