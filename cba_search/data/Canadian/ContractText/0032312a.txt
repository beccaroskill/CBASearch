employees’ seniority shall also be immediately transferred.	’

5.08.3	In the case of temporary non-compulsory transfers, the employee shall retain his or her seniority in the original group, department or plant. After qualifying the employee will also be listed on the seniority list of the group, department or plant transferred to with “temporary’ being placed after the employee’s name.

5.08.4	No employees shall be transferred from one plant to another without the employee’s consent, except in the event that a specific classification is required and an employee in that classification can be spared from another operation within the Company, then the employee may be transferred without consent, provided the employee’s seniority is retained in the original plant. In the case of such temporary compulsory transfers from one plant to seniority will be immediately transferred.
5.00.	5 The individual involved in such compulsory transfer may be returned to the employee’s “Home Plant" as
soon as the circumstances requiring the transfer have been overcome, and/or within a maximum period of six months from the time of transfer and/or at the end of the season. Compulsory transfers shall not subject the individual transferee to a lesser period of employment during the year than the employee would have received if not transferred.
5
5.09	Leave of Absence
5.09.1	Unless otherwise noted, provisions for leave of absence apply to regular employees only.
5.09.2	Seniority rights of employees shall not be affected if inability to report to work arises from sickness or from reasons acceptable to the Company. Absence for reasons other than sickness, if for a period in excess of one week, must be covered under the following leave of absence conditions.
5.09.3	Employees who for good and sufficient cause require a leave of absence shall be granted same. Such leave of absence if granted shall be for a maximum period of one year except under unusual circumstances. There shall be no forfeiture of total seniority unless the employee concerned has not reported back for work by the final date of the leave of absence.
5.09.4	All leave of absence, when granted or extended, shall be placed in writing with one copy to be provided to the Chief Shop Steward and one to be retained by the Company. Approved leaves shall list the starting date and expected return date and state the general reasons for the leave.

5.09.6	The Company may grant leave of absence to those employees who for reasons beyond their control cannot commence work on the date set, but who, nevertheless, wish to return to their jobs as soon as possible. Employees granted such leave of absence shall be placed first on the list for rehiring. Once they have recommenced their employment they shall return to their place on the seniority list as determined by their full service with the Company in the occupational group or department concerned.
5.09.7	The upgrading of skills and technical courses, whether related to an employee’s classification or not, shall be deemed just and sufficient cause for the granting of a leave of absence without pay to regular employees. Such leave of absence will not exceed one (1) year in length. An employee granted leave of absence under this article shall suffer no loss of seniority for such leave.
5.09.8	Appointment or election to a Union position or election to a Municipal, First Nations, Provincial or Federal position, shall be considered good and sufficient cause for granting leave of absence. Employees appointed or elected to such a position shall suffer no loss of seniority and time spent on leave of absence shall be included in the calculation of total seniority. After one year's leave of absence the employee must apply for renewal of such leave of absence or seniority rights are cancelled.
5.09.9	A leave of absence will not be granted to probationary employees for reasons other than sickness or pregnancy. Seniority will not accumulate for time spent on sick or maternity leave by probationary employees. Maternity leaves of absence are not to exceed one year, except under special circumstances acceptable to the Company.
5.09.10	Upon the Union's request, the Company will keep employees on the Company payroll while on short term Union business and the Union will reimburse the Company for such costs.

6.23	A staggered system of allowing weekly rest days, or alternatively a system of allowing other days in lieu of Saturday and Sunday as the weekly days of rest may be instituted, such system to be discussed and arranged in consultation between management and employees concerned. The principle of giving consecutive days of rest shall be followed. Where a refrigeration or steam engineer is required to work on a regular weekly day of rest, same shall be paid for as overtime on the basis set forth in “Hours of Work and Overtime" for a Saturday and/or Sunday whichever is applicable.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE____________________________________________________________________________________

21.02	In the event that a grievance or dispute arises, the Shop Steward Committee shall function as the Grievance Committee and the members thereof shall be afforded such time off without pay deduction as may be required to attend the necessary meetings with the Management. At major plants, where there is a large number of Shop Stewards, the Shop Steward Committee shall elect a sub-committee who shall with the ChiBf Shop Steward and the Shop Steward representing the section in which the grievance has occurred, constitute the Grievance Committee. Nothing herein shall prevent the holding of meetings between the Management and the full Shop Steward Committee if the need arises.
21.03	It is the general interest of both parties to prevent the elevation of minor questions into formal grievances and, as a possible means to this end, employees are urged to raise grievances imagined or otherwise with their foreman as quickly as possible. Employees have the right to go directly to their departmental Shop Steward if they wish to do so.
21.04	The successive steps to be taken in the handling of any grievance until it is settled shall be set forth as follows:
Step One:
The employee shall notify the departmental Shop Steward of any incident which gave rise to the grievance as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the incident which gave rise to the grievance. The Shop Steward shall immediately approach the Departmental Supervisor, Plant Manager or Human Resources Manager (which ever is appropriate) to resolve the grievance with or without the employee in attendance.
At this time, the shop steward may request additional time to investigate the grievance. The company will not unreasonably refuse to grant this request.
Step Two:
If the grievance remains unresolved at Step One, the departmental Shop Steward shall apprise the plant's Chief Shop Steward of the details of the grievance. The grievance shall be placed in writing and include details of the alleged violation and reference to the pertinent section(s) of the Agreement. Upon receipt of the written grievance, a meeting shall be arranged between the Grievance Committee and Plant Management in a further attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is one that is complex in nature or involves the operation of a seniority plan, either party may request the assistance of, and where necessary, the attendance of, a representative from their respective Headquarters.
21
Step Three:
If the grievance remains unresolved, the Union may provide any additional information deemed necessary in writing to the Company, The Company shall place in writing its reasons for rejecting the grievance. When the exchange of written positions is complete, a meeting shall be arranged between representatives from Headquarters of the Union and Headquarters of the Company for a final attempt to settle the grievance. Should this meeting fail to settle the matter in dispute, step four may be invoked.
Step Four:
If the grievance remains unresolved each party shall appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to nominate a third impartial arbitrator who shall act as Chairperson of the Arbitration Committee. Failing to agree upon such an impartial arbitrator within three (3) days of their appointment, either party may request the Honourable Minister of Labour to appoint such an impartial arbitrator. In the case of a grievance or dispute involving, interpretation of this Agreement, the majority decision of arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties, it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, no decision of such Arbitration Board shall change this agreement in wording or format. Where the parties mutually agree, a single arbitrator may be used.
21.05	Where, after exhausting the first three steps of the grievance procedure of this agreement, a difference remains between the parties relating to callouts, seniority issues, pay issues (individual cases), leaves of absence, vacation issues, bereavement issues, the discipline of an employee (other than discharge), or any other matters the parties may mutually agree to, including any question as to whether the matter is arbitrable, Mr. D. McPhillips or Mr. B. Greyell, in rotation, or a substitute agreed to by both parties, shall at the mutual request of both parties:
a)	Investigate the difference,
b)	Define the issue in the difference, and
c)	Make an order in writing, with reasons, for final and binding settlement of the dispute within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of the request, or such extension of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
d)	Notwithstanding (c), where the parties have mutually agreed before the request is submitted, the arbitrator shall make written recommendations to resolve the difference within twenty (20) days of the date of his/her receipt of request, and for those twenty (20) days time does not run in respect of the grievance and arbitration procedures.
As the process is intended to be non-legal, the parties will present their own arguments.
All presentations are to be short and concise and are to include a comprehensive opening “statement”.
The parties agree to make limited use of authorities and such witnesses as are necessary during the presentation of their cases.
Prior to rendering a decision, the arbitrator may assist the parties in mediating a resolution to the grievance.
All decisions of the arbitrator are to be limited in application to that particular dispute and are without prejudice. These decisions shall have no precedential value and shall not be referred to by either party in any subsequent proceeding.
The parties shall jointly apply to the Minister of Labour for payment of remuneration and expenses of the arbitrator to be made in accordance with S. 104 of the BC Labour Relations Code. Any remuneration and expenses not paid under that section shall be bome equally by the parties to this agreement.
If both parties agree, other matters may be referred to the troubleshooter for either recommendations on how to resolve the dispute or for resolution, depending on the particular dispute.
22
If ninety (90) calendar days of its instigation, the grievance has not been settled, either party may refer the matter to arbitration or the grievance shall be deemed abandoned. If either party decides to go to arbitration, they must advise the other party of their nominee within ten (10) calendar days of the decision to go to arbitration or the grievance will be deemed abandoned. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent of both parties, it being agreed both parties are interested in and will strive to achieve settlement of all grievances or disputes in the shortest possible time.

SECTION 6 NETWORK
6.01	Contract Net Work
No work on nets shall be done on a contract or piece work basis, other than by mutual consent of both parties. Should any group of fishers preparing their seine desire to work on a contract basis there shall be no objection on the part of the Union.
6.02	Net workers employed at a camp facility may be given alternate days off to Saturday and Sunday as the weekly days of rest. The principle of giving consecutive days shall be followed. This article shall apply only to the following categories when employed at a camp facility: Net Boss and Qualified Networker.
6.03	Monthly Rated Net workers
Employees commencing net work for the first time shall be classified as "First year Networkers.” They shall serve a three year (one season shall be equivalent to one year) apprenticeship being classified successively as “First”, “Second” and ‘Third” year Networkers. At the commencement of their fourth year (or season) they shall be classified as "Qualified Networkers” and paid accordingly.
6.04	Should instances occur where, in the opinion of the management, sufficient skill and ability has not been demonstrated by an individual employee during the qualifying period to justify upgrading, such cases shall be referred to the Qualified Networkers in the net loft concerned.
If, in the opinion of the qualified workers, the employee is entitled to the upgrading, they shall meet as a committee with management for the purpose of working out a satisfactory solution. If it is found impossible to work out a mutually acceptable solution by this procedure, the case shall be dealt with in the regular grievance procedure.
6.05	In no case shall there be more inexperienced workers (First, Second, Third year) employed than qualified networkers in any net operation. This principle shall apply to gillnet networkers: it being understood that circumstances may occur which make it impossible to rigidly apply the condition in all gillnet operations. At no time shall qualified workers be laid off in favour of apprentices.
The companies shall recognize and cooperate in the establishment of an individual record book system showing the service and experience of a networker engaged in net work.

In cases where employees show special adaptability, they may be advanced directly from “Inexperienced" to “Qualified”, these classifications being based entirely on quality and productivity.
Nothing in the foregoing paragraph shall prevent the Company from placing “Inexperienced or SemiQualified" fish workers on the cutting tables for short periods to try out at knife work, provided however, “Semi-qualified" and “Qualified” filleters shall not be displaced by such inexperienced employees.
In instances where a semi-qualified filleter has met the Production Standards in all but one species because of the unavailability of such specie, they may be temporarily upgraded to a qualified filleter until such specie is available. If the standards are not met when such specie becomes available, they will revert back to the semi-qualified rate until such time as the standards are met for all species.

OF UNDERSTANDING
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT
PREAMBLE_______________________________________________________________________________________________
The Parties endorse the principle of equal opportunity for employment and that in so far as is practicable, the order of call out to work should be made without regard to gender. The Parties shall therefore undertake the following measures to achieve the principles.
The Parties signatory to the 2009 - 2013 Shoreworker Master Agreement agree:
1.	The Parties will endeavour to ensure that there shall be no discrimination between employees with respect to seniority or job opportunity, either in fact or by description.
2.	That each plant shall set up a small working committee to review plant procedures with respect to callouts, job postings, training and related matters. Each plant committee will include representation of the Shop Steward Committee and local plant management and the committee's task shall be to:
a)	Assess the application of seniority and call-out arrangements to ensure opportunity for employment is equal without regard to gender.
b)	Review problems and complaints as they may arise to discourage the elevation of such complaints to the level of grievances.
c)	Ensure as much as possible that all procedures shall be designed to provide equal opportunity for all employees to all jobs based on seniority, skill, ability, and requirements of the job.
d)	Shall assist in undertaking a review of classifications and rate structure including the base rate plus premium proposal as well as possible implementation of the 1000 hour rate (by increments if necessary) and forward any recommendations to the 1995 negotiations).
e)	Where the seniority lists for a plant department or working group are impediments to the objectives of this memorandum, Headquarters of the Union and the Company shall attempt to agree to revise seniority lists and/or plant seniority plans in consultation and with the approval of the Company and of the Union’s membership directly affected.
The Parties will make every effort to ensure the small working committees shall be set up at each plant. The committees shall meet as often as is required, but at least quarterly. Minutes of all meetings shall be forwarded to the headquarters of the Company and the Union as soon as possible following such meetings.
3.	If there is a conflict between this memorandum and the collective agreement, the collective agreement shall apply.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY STATEMENT
The Company and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers’ Union/CAW recognize and support the right of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment, and to that end, are committed to providing a workplace free of sexual harassment and making every reasonable effort to ensure that no employee is subjected to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment shall be defined as “any unwanted sexual comments, looks, suggestions, or physical contact, directed at an employee, which creates an uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, or defensive working environment."
The offence need not necessarily infer “compliance’’ as a condition of employment, or the offer and/or maintenance of some benefit in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual advances outside of normal working hours and away from the working environment may be construed as harassment where there is a critical link to employment.
This policy applies to all employees, both in and outside of the bargaining unit, recognizing that the alleged perpetrator or harasser, and the harassed, may represent any level of the organization. Harassment as defined is not limited to male-female, but also includes female-male, male-male and female-female incidents. Harassment need not be accompanied by threats or rewards to be termed such.
Any employee who feels his or her rights under this policy have been violated is encouraged to report the incident to his or her supervisor either verbally or in writing. The employee may be accompanied by another person of their choice during this process if they deem this necessary. The supervisor will advise the Personnel/Human Resources Department of the complaint and all pertinent information.
The Company and the Union shall each appoint a designate to conduct a joint Investigation and each designate must have experience and/or training concerning sexual harassment. The joint investigation shall be a fact-finding investigation and the designates shall submit a report, detailing their findings and recommendations, to the Human Resources Department and Union headquarters as soon as possible after receipt of the complaint. Management will take immediate action if necessary. Nevertheless management shall within thirty (30) days of receiving the report, give such orders as may be necessary.
Nothing shall preclude an employee from involving a Shop Steward outside official or a union official at any stage of the investigation.
No complainant shall be transferred to positions against his or her will.
Anyone who is found to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. The amount and form of the discipline will depend upon the circumstances of the harassment, whether the person recognizes the seriousness of his or her conduct and whether the person has previously been disciplined for such conduct.
The Company and the Union agree that extreme care will be taken to ensure that confidentiality will be respected throughout.
Employees should be aware that provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act provide for redress in respect to sexual harassment.

WORK CREATION AND NEW WORK OPPORTUNITIES
BETWEEN:
CANADIAN FISHING COMPANY
AND:
UNITED FISHERMEN AND ALLIED WORKERS’ UNION-UNIFOR
(hereinafter referred to as the “Union”)
PREAMBLE________________________________________________________________________________________
Whereas both the union and the company have agreed that a mutual goal is to develop more work in unionized fish plants under the jurisdiction of the UFAWU-Unifor.
Whereas both parties agree that the emphasis for this work should be on parts of the year described as “non-peak seasons” so that the work will benefit directly regular employees of these plants and pay plant overheads in non peak periods.
Whereas both parties agree that the objective this memorandum is to develop this work on new products and/or species.
Whereas both the union and the company agree that to create this new work a new relationship between the union and the company is necessary.
Whereas the UFAWU-Unifor and the company agree that the objective is to bring in this new work at regular union rates and conditions, but that in the initial stages this work may require lower rates or different conditions.
Therefore the parties agree:
1.	This memorandum shall become part of the “Master Agreement” negotiated between the UFAWU-Unifor and the Canadian Fishing Company and its length shall reflect the master agreement.
2.	Employees who chose to work on products, which are being processed under this memorandum, shall do so on a voluntary basis.
3.	Both parties agree that work developed under this agreement shall be done on the basis of overall plant seniority unless mutually agreed to by the company and the union at the plant level. Employees involved shall indicate their interest and be capable of performing the new work.
4.	Both parties agree that employees who volunteer to work under this agreement shall not be placed on this work when other work at a higher rate is available to them. Should the company assign an employee to work under this agreement when other work at a higher rate is available, the employee shall be paid the higher rate unless otherwise agreed to at the plant level.
5.	Employees considered to be working under the trades classification shall not have their wages and conditions affected by this agreement.
6.	The company agrees that where an employee is not on the call out list for work under this memorandum, it shall be considered that there is no work available for them at the plant in the same way a worker from one department is “not available” for work in another department under normal seniority rules.
7.	Proposals to develop new work through new products and specie processing may be advanced by either the union or the company. The parties agree that it is in the mutual interest of both parties to include the other at the earliest stages of research and development.
8.	The parties agree that the following guidelines will apply for inclusion of work under this memorandum.
52
a)	The work is presently not being done in a plant under the terms and conditions of this “Master Agreement”
b)	The impact on other unionized operations will be considered by parties.
c)	The new work will create more employment in the plant and contribute positively to the earnings of employees at the plant and make a positive contribution to the company overhead.
9.	All work negotiated under this agreement shall have fixed time for the application of this agreement. At the conclusion of this time frame (i.e. a year), the parties may discontinue, continue or amend the agreement.
10.	Plans to bring new work to the plants may require developing seniority plans, rates of pay, flexible hours of work and productivity standards. If one or more of these changes are required, the specifics shall be negotiated between the UFAWU-Unifor and the company according to the terms of this agreement. All changes must be approved by headquarters of the Union. Where the two parties cannot agree to changes to wages and/or working conditions, the issue may be referred, by mutual consent, to an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall make a recommendation after submissions from both parties. This recommendation shall not be binding on either party. The company, following this process, will not be obligated to proceed and the union will not be obligated to accept the recommendation.
11.	The company agrees that financial records shall be kept for work under this agreement. At the request of the union, the company shall allow the union to review the records. The union may seek outside advice from a qualified professional to do this. The professional shall not be associated with any fishing company. The union agrees the information shall remain confidential and available only to the crew directly involved in work under this agreement.
12.	Any decision to suspend an operation set up under this agreement shall not be done without prior consultation with the union.
13.	A Work Creation and New Work Opportunities Committee shall be established at each plant. The guidelines for operation of the committee shall be:
a)	Each plant to set up a committee made up at least three (3) Union representatives chosen by the union and an equal number of management representatives. Head-quarters of the union is welcome to attend any or all meetings.
b)	Each Committee shall oversee the funds and shall meet no less than once per month (12 times per year). Union committee members shall be paid wages from the fund for all committee work.

No money from the fund will be disbursed without the agreement of both parties. Should the parties disagree; the matter will be referred to the headquarters of the union and the company for further discussion. '
d)	The company will provide an annual statement to the union committee members and headquarters of the union outlining the expenditures and balance of the fund. The union may request this at other times of the year.
15.The company shall contribute 50 per straight time hour to a New Product and Work Creation Fund which will be used to develop work under this memorandum for the duration of this agreement.

PENSION WORKING GROUP
The parties agree to establish a joint working group comprising appropriate company, union and pension trustee representatives to investigate possible changes to the structure of Parts 1 and 2 of the Shoreworkers Pension Plan with Canadian Fishing Company.
The intent of the analysis is to determine rf there are options to rearrange the company contributions and/or structure of the Plan so as to continue a good pension for employees of the company while providing an incentive (or at least no disincentive) for older workers to retire, should they so wish.
The working group will undertake the study as soon as practicable and will provide its results and recommendations to the parties.
If mutually agreed, the parties may implement the recommendations during the term of the collective agreement, or the parties may use the report and recommendations to inform the next round of bargaining.
