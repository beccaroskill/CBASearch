The purpose of this Agreement is to maintain a harmonious relationship between the Company and its employees; to provide an amicable method of settling any grievances or differences which might possibly arise: to promote the mutual interests of the employer and the employees. The Company and the employees jointly recognize the continuing need for maintaining efficient production in the packinghouse industry at all times and the necessity of rendering efficient service to the producers and consumers and realizing their mutual responsibility pledge full cooperation to that end.

agent other than the Union.
Page 3
2.2	It	is generally the practice of the Company to have work within-the plant
performed by employees of the Company. However, because of reasons such as the availability of skilled employees, complexity of the work, the cost of equipment required to do the work in relation to its use, the scope of the work, the duration and frequency of the work, the cost to have the work performed by employees as compared to other alternatives, it may become necessary to have the work within the plant performed by outside contractors.
Where outside contractors perform work within the plant and such work represents a material change .in practice creating an adverse effect on present employees of a group affected by such material change in practice, the matter may be processed as a grievance under Article 4 of this Agreement. Should the grievance be referred to an arbitration board as provided under Article 18, the arbitration board will consider the reasons mentioned in the first paragraph of this section in its determination of the use by the Company of such outside contractors and where the arbitration board determines that the use of such outside contractors does create such an adverse effect, the Company will, within a reasonable period, either discontinue the work or have it performed by employees.
The foregoing shall not apply to the cafeteria, country deliveries, construction and installation work.
The Company may introduce work utilizing Company employees on a trial or test basis. If the result of such an experiment indicates that, for reasons set out in the first paragraph of this section, the work should be transferred to an outside contractor this shall not be construed as being a change in general practice.

(a)	is of confidential clerical nature
(b)	is for the purpose of instruction, experimentation, demonstration,
investigation, replacement of an employee absent from his job during the day, sharpening knives, coping with an emergency. An emergency as herein contained shall not be construed as including work resulting from additional volume.
(c)	is to overcome production difficulties caused by the absence of an
employee. in such cases the Company will advise the Union as to the absence of the employee and will obtain a suitable replacement within one-half (1/2) day.
ARTICLE 3 - Management

It is understood by the parties that the matter of habitual and excessive absenteeism will continue to be treated as a disciplinary matter, and that if an employee is challenged by the Company because of habitual or excessive absenteeism, he may in his defence present a medical certificate which will be taken into consideration by the Company in assessing disciplinary measures it may take.

Dear Mr. Leclaire:
Any employee of Canadian Dressed Meats (Lethbridge) Limited who, as of 15 June 1982, was receiving a pay rate higher than to what he was entitled under the present Schedule of Grades was considered to carry a "Red Circle Rate". As such he was entitled to any General Increases, but not increases in labour grades on job rates, until such time his rate is equal to or less than the present Schedule of Grades rate at which time the "Red Circle Rate" will disappear. To continue on a "Red Circle Rate" he must accept all opportunity for transfer to work where the job rate is higher. If an employee requests a transfer to a lower rated job, he will not carry the "Red Circle Rate" to such lower paid job.
Yours truly BURNS MEATS LTD.

Dear Mr. Leclaire:
As agreed in the 1986 Negotiations, reference to leather safety boots is to be incorporated in Section 16.4 of the Collective Agreement, replacing the previous reference to a leather boot allowance and a safety boot allowance.
In recognition of the previous safety boot allowance, it will remain at nineteen (19) dollars reducing to fourteen (14) dollars on April 1,
1987. In the event that the allowance specified in Section 16.4 is increased in subsequent negotiations, the allowance specified in this letter will be equally reduced.
This additional allowance will be paid along with and will have the same qualifying criteria as that stipulated for leather safety boots under Section 16.4.
Yours truly
