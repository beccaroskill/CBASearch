a.m.) separates the notification from the beginning of the day that the shift change/layoff takes effect.
If notice is not given, the employee will be paid at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate for the first shift worked on the new schedule or paid eight (8) hours pay in lieu of notice of layoff.

13.17	4 ON - 4 OFF SCHEDULE
a.	Schedule Conditions
The Company may implement a rotating 4 On - 4 Off, 12-hour shift schedule on the basis of day shift and night shift.

Employees affected shall be regularly scheduled to work on the basis of the following normal shift rotation of the cycle:
4 day shift 4 off shift 4 night shift 4 off shift
28 Calendar Days
The above Schedule may also be applied on the basis of one (1) shift per day to provide twelve (12) hour shift coverage for a day shift only rather than twenty-four (24) hour shift coverage on a working day.
The following specific provisions shall apply to the operation of the 4 On- 4 Off schedule and these conditions supercede other provisions of this Agreement.

The normal work cycle for operations on the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule shall be 28 calendar days and shall commence on the first Monday in each cycle. The normal work day shall be 12 hours. The normal work week shall alternate between 48 hours per week for four weeks, comprised of four 12-hour shifts in a seven-day period, and 36 hours per week for four weeks, comprised of three 12-hour shifts in a seven-day period.

g.	General Holidays
i)	The Company agrees to recognize the General Holidays set forth in Article 13.9(a) of the collective bargaining agreement. General Holidays are observed on a shift day basis rather than a calendar day basis. Employees working the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule and who qualify for these General Holidays shall be paid for eight (8) hours at their regular rate of pay. However, if the Company decides not to operate on a General Holiday, employees who were scheduled to work their regular shift on that General Holiday shall be paid for twelve (12) hours at their regular rate. An employee is entitled to General Holiday pay if they have worked during
20
the work week immediately proceeding that in which the General Holiday occurs, or during the work week in which the General Holiday occurs, or during the work week immediately following'that in which the General Holiday occurs.
ii)	For employees working the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule, where a General Holiday falls within an employee’s vacation period, such employee will be entitled to an additional eight (8) hours of vacation with pay for each General Holiday.
iii)	For employees working the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule, if an employee is required to work on any of the designated General Holidays, they shall be compensated for such work at the rate of one and one-half times their regular rate of pay in addition to the holiday pay referred to in Section 8 above. If an employee is required to work more than their normal 12 hours on the General Holiday, they will be reimbursed at a rate of two times the normal rate of pay for those hours worked in excess of 12 hours.
h.	Vacation Scheduling
Vacation entitlement will accumulate on the basis of total hours of entitlement, per Article 14 of the Agreement. That is, one week of vacation entitlement will be equal to 40 hours. Vacations shall, whenever possible, be granted during the period preferred by each employee, considering the requirements of the plant operation. Plant seniority shall govern the selection of vacation period.
i.	Severance Allowance
Severance allowance according to Article 17 will be calculated based on 80 hours pay for each year of service at the employee’s current regular rate of pay.
j.	Notice Reauirements
The Company shall provide the Union with a schedule of working hours, for those employees working the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule. Should the requirements of the business necessitate a change in such schedule, the matter will be discussed with the Union including number of employees affected and the expected duration of the schedule. The Company agrees to give the Union at least two (2) weeks advance notice of the implementation, alteration, or cessation of the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule. If such notice is not provided, the affected employee will be paid time and one-half their straight time rate for those hours worked on the day of the first change. However no employee shall be required to start a new shift without twenty-four (24) hours notice. An employee will be compensated for any loss of regular pay if the employee is scheduled less
21
than forty (40) regular hours in a week due to the implementation, alteration, or cessation of the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule.
k.	Assignment of Employees to 4 On - 4 Off Schedules
4 On - 4 Off Schedule shall be worked for a minimum of one (1) complete rotation of twenty-eight (28) days. In the event the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule is not required as a basis for operations for all employees within a Department, senior qualified employees within a Department will be offered the first opportunity to work the 4 On - 4 Off Schedule. If the positions are not filled by senior qualified employees, the remaining positions will be filled through assigning the junior qualified employees within the Department. In the event an employee wishes to exercise their seniority to change their shift, the Company will move the employee at a time that will have the minimum effect on employees and operations.
