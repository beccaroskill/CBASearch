L.T.D. BENEFITS
This will serve to confirm the understanding between the Company and the Union that
employees receiving benefits under the Long Term Disability Plan, introduced in July of
1977, will have their benefit level maintain^ at 65% of the current wage schedule.
“7 ^ 06
The attached document is an explanation of how the "final average remuneration” would be established for an employee who is a member of the Imasco Pension Plan and who has received benefits from the Long Term Disability Plan during the five years immediately prior to attaining age 65.
71
F.A.R. AT TERMINATION OF L.T.D
Traditionally an employee has been assumed to earn normal base wage or salary while on Long Term Disability. Therefore after five full years on Long Term Disability F.A.R. would be equal to the base wage or salary the employee was earning at the date of becoming disabled.
Under the new arrangement each time an augmentation is granted to pensioners the earnings of an individual on Long Term Disability will be deemed to have been augmented at the same time and by the same percentage as the pension augmentation. Earnings of an individual on L.T.D. will therefore be deemed to increase on the same date.
