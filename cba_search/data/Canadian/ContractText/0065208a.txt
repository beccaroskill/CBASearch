Step 2: The employee or Steward shall submit the grievance in writing to the Department Manager within three (3) working days following notification of the Company's first step decision. The Department Manager, or his designee, shall attempt to resolve the grievance within three (3) working days. If not settled at Step 2 the written grievance may be submitted to Step 3.

(3)	the relief requested; and the grievance shall be signed by the employee and countersigned by the Steward.
Step 3: The employee or Union shall notify the Regional Manager or his designee within three (3) working days after receipt of the Department Manager's second step decision of its intent to pursue the grievance. The Regional Manager, or his designee will meet with the Union's Business Representative, or his designee, to resolve the matter. In the event a settlement is not reached within five (5) working days, a dispute shall exist, and the resolution of the dispute shall be subject to arbitration. Grievances involving the suspension or discharge of an employee may begin at Step 3.
Those parties agree to follow each of the foregoing steps in the processing of grievances, and that if at any step the Company fails to give its answer within the time limit set forth, the Union may appeal the grievance to the next step. If at any step the employee fails to require the grievance to be submitted to the next step within three (3) working days following the expiration of the time limit as set forth in the step procedure, the grievance will be deemed by both parties to be settled.
The Company and the Union may extend the time limit set forth in the grievance procedure by mutual agreement. The party requesting the extension must do so in writing. Only a single grievance may be heard by the arbitrator at one time, except by mutual agreement.
It is understood that the Company may bring forward and give to the Union at any time any grievance:

(2)	with	respect to the	conduct of the employees generally;
(3)	with	respect to the	application or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.
The Company will first discuss with the Union the circumstances giving rise to the grievance before submitting a formal grievance herein.
The grievance will be presented in writing to the officials of the Union and meeting will be held within seven (7) calendar days with the Union and its Representative. Failure to agree within a period of four (4) calendar days subsequent to the meeting will permit the Company to refer the matter to a Board of Arbitration as hereinafter described, within thirty (30) calendar days.
10
11.02	ARBITRATION
A dispute shall be deemed settled unless a written notification requesting arbitration is received by the Company from the Union Business Representative within ten (10) working days of the Union's receipt of the Company's Step 3 decision under the grievance procedure. The written notification must state the issue to be arbitrated. If the Union submits a written request, the Company and the Union shall attempt to agree upon a neutral person whom they shall designate as the arbitrator. If they are unable to agree upon the selection of such an arbitrator, they shall request the Ministry of Labour for Ontario to appoint an arbitrator.
Employees, including Union Stewards, Representatives, and committeemen requested by the Union to attend a hearing during working hours, shall not be paid for the time lost.
The Company has the right to insist that the griever be present during the hearing.
Any arbitrator selected under the provisions of this Article shall have the authority to render a decision which shall be final and binding on the parties to the extent provided by the law. Such decisions must be rendered within thirty (30) days of the hearing, unless otherwise agreed to by both the Company and the Union. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter or modify any of the terms of this Agreement, or to impose on any party a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.
