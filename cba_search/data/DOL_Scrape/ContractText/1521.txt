2. Both Parties to the Agreement believe that

fere with the workmen during working hours.  
(d) If any of the Parties of the First Part engage in  
any class of work not embodied in Heavy and/or

this Agreement is of no force or effect on any such  
contract.  
3. The Employer agrees that he will not disci-  
pline or discharge any employee who refuses to  
cross a bona fide labor union picket line. The right

the Employee to penalties.

2. Grievance Procedure: All grievances or dis-  
putes involving any controversy, dispute or misun-

or observance of any provisions of this Agreement  
shall be handled in the manner hereinafter set forth.  
Step 1. All grievances must be made known in  
writing to the other party within seven (7) working  
days after the reason for such grievance has  
occurred. An authorized representative of the

Job Superintendent, or his duly authorized repre-  
sentative. The authorized representative of the  
Union of the Employee or Employees involved  
shall be present at any meeting between the Job  
Superintendent and such employee or employees.  
The Job Superintendent or his duly authorized rep-  
resentative must make a written disposition of the  
matter within forty-eight (48) hours after the sub-  
mission of such written grievance thereto.  
Step 2. If the disposition of the matter by the Job  
Superintendent or his duly authorized representa-  
tive is not satisfactory, the matter must be taken up  
by the Business Agent, and representative of the  
Employer with authority to act within forty-eight  
(48) hours of the written disposition set forth in

(2) the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  
or (3) the labor panel of the American Arbitration

such arbitration and be bound by and follow the  
decision rendered. Failure to do so on the part of

arbitrator shall be selected by alternately eliminat-  
ing names from the seven (7) person list until one

Employer's service. If the Employer contends there  
is a question of fact regarding the alleged violation,  
he may file for arbitration within the aforesaid three  
(3) working days. When a request for arbitration  
has been initiated, there shall be no work stoppage

tention is rejected by the arbitrator, and by the  
Union in case its principal contention is rejected by  
the arbitrator, except, however, that each party shall  
pay all of the fees of its own representatives and wit-  
nesses. Any dispute as to whose principal con-  
tention is rejected shall be determined by the arbi-  
trator, In the case that both parties’ principal  
contention is upheld in part, the arbitrator shall  
designate what part of the costs are to be borne by
