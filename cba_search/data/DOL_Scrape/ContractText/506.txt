Attention: Mr. |. W. Bonbright, Manager of Industrial Relations  
Gentlemen:  
This (etter shall supersede Letter Agreement No, 87-83-PGE  
_ Since January 1987, Company and Union have had discussions regarding a work efficiency experiment at  
the District headquarters in Livermore, California. We have also pay, discussed preliminary plans for similar  
trials at other locations. in order to provide a consistent approach to the Livermore experiment and to other work  
efficiency experiments, the Union proposes that the Manager of Industrial Relations and the IBEW Business Manager  
may aoe © the establishment of individual work efficiency experiments and that the following conditions  
appli  
4. Company and Union may agree locaily to the specific conditions of each experiment including the  
criteria to be used to judge the productivity and the quality of the work, except that changes in the conditions of any  
Labor Agreement requires an agreement between the Manager of Industrial Relations and the appropriate Union  
Business Manager(s).  
2. Each experiment will have an Advisory Committee to consist of Company members, IBEW  
members, Engineers and Scientists of California, MEBA, and at least one consultant to be agreed to by the parties.  
The number and size of the Advisory Committee shall be determined by the Cammittee.  
Bh Each experiment will have a local Steering Committee and a consultant to be agreed to by the  
parties. The size of this committee is to be determined locally. The Steering Committee may also utilize  
representatives from various departments on a subcommittee basis, as they deem appropriate.

### ADDENDUM TO TITLE 206 AND 306  
### DEMOTION AND LAYOFF PROCEDURE  
### JOB SECURITY  
During the course of 1990 General Se the parties spent a great deal of time addressing the issue of job  
security with particular emphasis on the ability of Company to place non-bargaining unit ee into the  
bargaining unit. Company agreed that Letter Agreement 88-104 would remain in effect which limits Company's ability  
to place non-bargaining unit personnel into the ang unit. Further, in the application of Titles 206 and 306 of the  
Physical Agreement and Title 19 of the Clerical Agreement, Company agrees that should such placements occur,  
bar ping unit employees in the department and headquarters will not be impacted by demotion, displacement or  
myer for the next three years subsequent to the placement of the hon bargaining unit employee inio the bargainin  
unit, unless such employee leaves that headquarters for any reason. Employees at tha headquarters in tha  
department during the three year period will not be impacted by demotion, displacement, or iayolt unless such  
demotion, displacement or layoff is unrelated to the placement of the non-bargaining unit employee into the  
bargaining unit, in which event the original ee unit employee will be affected first if the number of  
employees in that department and headquarters is being reduced.  
Example 1. Supervisor is returned to Lineman position in Antioch. The Supervisor must be placed in a vacancy  
as such placement cannot result in a displacement, demotion or layoff.  
Example 2. Eight months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit, another Lineman bids out of the  
Antioch headquarters. Assuming there is no contracting of Electric T&D work, therefore, no 88-104  
implications, the headquarters may elect to not fill the vacancy and reduce through attrition.  
Example 3. Thirteen months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit, the Concord Electric T&D  
Department effects a displacement for lack_of work and a Lineman has 206.4 rights into Antioch,  
since Antioch is not reducing in the Electric T&D Department, the affected Lineman in Antioch would  
be the one wilh ine least Which may of May Hot be the former Supervisor,  
Example 4. Fifteen months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit Antioch decides to downsize the  
Electric T&D Department by reducing the number of Linemen by one. Since a reduction is taking  
place, the Supervisor is the first to be demoted, displaced or laid off.  
Example 5. At any time the Supervisor leaves the Antioch Electric T&D Department and headquarters for any  
reason (bid, transfer, displacement), the headquarters and department has returned to status quo  
and may be reduced through demotion, displacement or layoff. -

November 1, 1991  
Local Union No. 1245  
International Brotherhood of  
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO  
P.O. Box 4790  
Walnut Creek, CA 94546  
Attention: Mr. Jack McNally, Business Manager  
Gentlemen:  
This cancels and supersedes our letter dated set 23, 1991 to reflect changes proposed in Union's letter of October  
25, 199t. Pursuant to Sections 205.19 and 18.17 of the Physical and Clerical Agreements, Company proposes the  
following procedures for the See of the hardship transfer provisions of the Physical and Clerical Agreements  
.@., Sections 205.17 and 18.15). The purpose of these Sections was to allow the Company, through agreement with  
the Union, to fill a job vacancy by appointing an employee who requests the position for reasons of urgent necessity.  
Urgent necessity includes impairment of the employee's health or that of a member of the employee's family or the  
lack of educational facilities for the employee's children in the location in which he/she is currently employed.  
Following are the procedures to be utilized:  
1, An interested employee must write to the Human Resources Department of his/her division (or General  
Office department), explaining the circumstances and request a transfer pursuant to the provisions of Section 205.17  
(physical) or Section 18.15 (clerical), whichever is applicable.  
94  
   
2. The Division or Department Human Resources Department must then undertake a preliminary investigation  
to determine whether or not a bona fide reason exists to apply the appropriate section. For situations involving  
impairment of an employee's health or that of a member of the family, medical documentation is required.  
3. If the Human Resources Department believes that the matter should be pursued, they then contact the IBEW  
Business Representative assigned to that area and both will make a thorough investigation to determine whether a  
exists. If they agree a hardship exists, then they must then prepare a list of in the Company that  
could alleviate the  
4, This list must be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager and Business Representative of each division  
(and/or General Office department) where such a location is identified. Each of these locations must also agree, in  
writing, that hardship transfer consideration should be afforded the employee. To avoid conflicting responses to an  
employee, all of the divisions solicited for hardship consideration should communicate with each other.  
5, The first vacancy in any Of the listed locations to any classification to which the employee is qualified to fill that  
does not have a higher wage schedule than the employee's current classification must de offered to the employee. If  
the employee declines such offer without a substantial reason or the Company does not make such an offer, the  
entire matfer shal! be dropped at this point, and the 205.17/18.5 request is invalidated.  
6. If the individual accepts the offered position, a written agreement must then be prepared and signed by both  
the host and receiving Division Human Resources Managers and IBEW Business Representatives. A copy of such  
should be forwarded to the Manager of Industrial Relations and the IBEW Business Manager, as well as  
all of the other locations earlier identified.  
While the Division Human Resources Manager and IBEW Business Representative must send a hardship  
request to each suitable location, employees must also submit bids and transfers to each of these locations. The’  
bids and transfers must be to every classification that would qualify in alleviating the hardship. lf an employee  
declines a bona fide bid or transfer job offer, without a substantial reason, or if they refuse to submit bids and  
transfers to appropriate positions in all of the locations identified, his/her hardship would also be invalidated.  
Many hardship requests are location specific, This appears to be an attempt by some employees to relocate  
using the hardship provisions rather than the normal bid and transfer procedure. Those location specific requests

### LABOR AGREEMENT INTERPRETATION  
SUBJECT: Comparable Substitute for Usual and Average Meals (Meals at Home)  
TITLE 104 - MEALS - Agreement  
TITLE 16 - MEALS - Clerical Agreement  
Section 104.1 of the Physical Agreement and Section 16.1 of the Clerical Agreement state that provisions of  
the Meal Titles shall be interpreted and applied in a practical manner which shall conform to the intention of the  
parties in negotiating with respect to meals; namely, that a comparabie substitute shall be provided when employees  
are prevented from observing their usual and average meal practices or are prevented from eating a meal at  
approximately the usual time therefore.  
In the Company's Guidelines with respect to the application of Title 104 originally issued in October 1965 and  
amended in October 1966 and July 1968, the following statement is made with respect to the definition of a  
comparable substitute: .  
“The meal provided.....should but may not be quite the same as the meal would be at the same time if eaten  
at home. Dependent upon the circumstances present at the time, and where practical or possible, a  
substitute to the missed meal should be fumished.  
"It may be necessary to provide meals at times of the day or night when the employee would not observe a  
customary mealtime... The meal provided, again dependent upon the circumstances of that situation, should be such  
as to adequately compensate for the need for food resulting from working beyond or before customary meattime.  
“There have been no maximum cost limits for meals agreed upon because the cost of meals may vary due to  
such factors as the time of day, location, conditions and other circumstances. However, the requirement of  
reasonableness in the selection of a ‘comparable for the meal missed should be followed."  
The following guidelines, but not necessarily in the order listed, should be kept in mind by both emipoyes  
and supervisors in determining whether or not a meal purchased as a comparable substitute is or is not reasonable.  
1, The cost of meals at the average restaurant available in ihe general area, but excluding such luxury  
items as filet mignon or combination steak and seafood dinners. The foregoing is not intended to mean menu  
averaging.  
2. The availability of restaurants which can provide a comparable substitute within a reasonable  
distance of the job site or between the job site and the headquarters,  
The breakfast, luncheon or dinner menu where comparabie substitutes are available, but excludin  
extra ala carte items. The foregoing does not preclude ordering a la carte when that is all that is available nor does  
preclude a la carte desserts with dinner meals. .  
4. The weather or other extreme working conditions to which the employees have been subjected.  
5. The amount by which the time limits in the Agreement and in the Guidelines have been exceeded,  
with some consideration as to whether or not sandwiches and a hot beverage have been supplied on the job. Exce  
for lunch, the foregoing does not imply that sandwiches and a hot beverage are to be considered as a comparabie  
substitute nor is it intended to mean that employees are to be worked routinely nor excessively beyond the  
aforementioned time limits.

### CRITICAL CLASSIFICATIONS  
Locai Union No. 1245 March 8, 1974  
International Brotherhood of  
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO  
  
Walnut Creek, California 94596  
Attention: Mr. L.L. Mitchell, Business Manager  
Gentlemen:  
This letter cancels and supersedes ail previous proposals submitted to you on the same subject.  
As discussed with you on numerous occasions, it has become increasing! difficuk for the Company to  
properly staff and maintain qualified personnel in certain ave? gill classifications ana in the system. In an  
attempt to solve this problem, Company proposes the following:  
1. When the complement of a joumeyman classification is 10% or more below the desired strength for  
90 days or more at a specific headquarters, Company may upon giving written notice to Union designate the  
apprenticeship teading to such journeyman classification, the journeyman classification, and classifications above the  
designated journeyman classification, as critical classifications. Non-apprenticeship situations shall be handled in  
accordance with Paragraph 8 below.  
in order to bring the complement at the aftected headquarters to the desired level, Company will  
initially seek volunteers system-wide for assignment to such critical classifications through the postbid procedure.  
Employees voluntarily transferring to the critical classifications shall be designated critical and be subject to the  
conditions outlined below. if sufficient empioyees are obtained in this manner to alleviate the critical situation, no  
further action will be taken. lf, however, a sufficient number of employees are not obtained for critical status,  
ey shall designate all apprentices appointed after the date critical status was applied at that headquarters as  
“critical apprentices.  
3. (a) Except as provided in (b} below, employees on critical status shall be paid 8% above their basic  
weekly rate as provided for in Exhibit X.  
{b) Employees in a critical renticeship status shall be paid the following percent adjustment  
above their basic weekly rate as provided for in Exhibit X:  
° Start 3%  
End § months 4%  
End 1 year 5%  
End 18 months 6%  
End 24 months 7%  
End 30 months 8%  
4 Employees on critical status will not have their prebids or postbids for vacancies in or below their  
present classifications nor their application for transfer considered for any job outside of their existing headquarters or  
outside of their Line of Progression.  
114  
5. A joumeyman’s “critical” status shall be for a period of three years with the exceptions set forth in  
Item 6 below. However, by mutual agreement, the “critical classification” designation may be lifted on either an  
individual or on a total basis. Apprentices on critical status complete their training at the "critical" headquarters.  
6. Apprentices designated as critical who progress to unassigned ee Status shall continue on  
"critical" status for two additional years under ihe conditions ovilined above. if the desired strengih has been met at  
the concerned headquarters, the unassigned journeyman may replace the senior journeyman on “critical” status who  
desires such replacement. Upon his release from “critical status," the 8% weekly allowance and the freeze on bidding  
and transfer rights will cease.  
7. — Company will give the Union and the involved 90 days' notice of the cancellation of the  
“critical classification” designation. However, upon cancellation by employees on critical status shall  
continue to receive the toh tape weekly allowance for the remainder of their applicable term or until such time as  
they bid or transfer to another classification or headquarters.  
8. In critical situations where a formal apprenticeship is not involved Company proposes to ly the  
8% weekly allowance and the freeze on bidding and transfer rights to the journeyman Classification under the  
conditions outlined above. However, in each instance, the added weekly pay and the total tangth of the bid or transfer  
freeze for classifications leading to such non-apprentice journeymen shall be established by agreement between  
Company and Union. Such agreement shall be, to the extent possible, consistent with the framework outlined above  
for apprentice situations.  
If you are in accord with the foregoing and agree thereto, please so indicate in the space provided below and  
return one executed copy of this ietter to Company.  
Yours very truly

_ For the purpose of determining the extent of a retroactive wage adjustment resutting from the submission of  
a continuing grievance timely filed under the applicable provisions of Section 102.2 or 9.2, the following procedure will  
be observed. For this purpose, a “continuing grievance" is defined as a continuing course of conduct allegedly in  
violation of the Labor Agreement as opposed to a single isolated and completed transaction.

af fling such grievance in writing in the form and manner prescribed by Section 102.2 or 9.2, whichever is applicable,

and a supervisor of grievant, who is authorized fo make the correction, had declined to do so. The period of  
retroactive wage adjustment in this case {or an adjustment made pursuant to the provisions of Section 102.7 or 9.7)  
shall commence with the date it can be established that grievant made such request. In either event, however, if the  
request was made within thirty (30) calendar days of the day the alleged violation first occurred, the adjustment shall  
commence with the first day the violation occurred.  
It is further understood and agreed that this interpretation shall in no wey limit Company's right to make funher wage  
adjustments which result from unintentional or inadvertent érrors which are not alleged to be a matter of law or  
interpretation of the Labor Agreements.

there are insufficient volunteers available for emergency duty, Company will continue to require employees ta report  
for work on an emergency basis.  
_ (b) Employees shall not be required to be on-call, however, Company with Union's cooperation shall  
establish a call-out procedure for employees who volunteer to be readily available for duty in case of emergency.

which an employee is available for duty shall not be considered as hours worked.

opportunity to remove themselves from the cail-out roster or note in writing on the list that all contact information is  
correct. This open period will allow employees to reevaluate their commitment after they determine where they stand  
in the call-out sequence. Employees who do not take the opportunity to remove their names from the roster will be  
expected to meet the commitments of availability as described earlier in this interpretation. (Amended 1-1-00)

### ADDENDUM TO TITLE 206 AND 306  
### DEMOTION AND LAYOFF PROCEDURE  
### JOB SECURITY  
During the course of 1990 General Se the parties spent a great deal of time addressing the issue of job  
security with particular emphasis on the ability of Company to place non-bargaining unit ee into the  
bargaining unit. Company agreed that Letter Agreement 88-104 would remain in effect which limits Company's ability  
to place non-bargaining unit personnel into the ang unit. Further, in the application of Titles 206 and 306 of the  
Physical Agreement and Title 19 of the Clerical Agreement, Company agrees that should such placements occur,  
bar ping unit employees in the department and headquarters will not be impacted by demotion, displacement or  
myer for the next three years subsequent to the placement of the hon bargaining unit employee inio the bargainin  
unit, unless such employee leaves that headquarters for any reason. Employees at tha headquarters in tha  
department during the three year period will not be impacted by demotion, displacement, or iayolt unless such  
demotion, displacement or layoff is unrelated to the placement of the non-bargaining unit employee into the  
bargaining unit, in which event the original ee unit employee will be affected first if the number of  
employees in that department and headquarters is being reduced.  
Example 1. Supervisor is returned to Lineman position in Antioch. The Supervisor must be placed in a vacancy  
as such placement cannot result in a displacement, demotion or layoff.  
Example 2. Eight months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit, another Lineman bids out of the  
Antioch headquarters. Assuming there is no contracting of Electric T&D work, therefore, no 88-104  
implications, the headquarters may elect to not fill the vacancy and reduce through attrition.  
Example 3. Thirteen months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit, the Concord Electric T&D  
Department effects a displacement for lack_of work and a Lineman has 206.4 rights into Antioch,  
since Antioch is not reducing in the Electric T&D Department, the affected Lineman in Antioch would  
be the one wilh ine least Which may of May Hot be the former Supervisor,  
Example 4. Fifteen months after the Supervisor's return to the bargaining unit Antioch decides to downsize the  
Electric T&D Department by reducing the number of Linemen by one. Since a reduction is taking  
place, the Supervisor is the first to be demoted, displaced or laid off.  
Example 5. At any time the Supervisor leaves the Antioch Electric T&D Department and headquarters for any  
reason (bid, transfer, displacement), the headquarters and department has returned to status quo  
and may be reduced through demotion, displacement or layoff. -

International Brotherhood of  
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO  
P.O. Box 4790  
Walnut Creek, CA 94546  
Attention: Mr. Jack McNally, Business Manager  
Gentlemen:  
This cancels and supersedes our letter dated set 23, 1991 to reflect changes proposed in Union's letter of October  
25, 199t. Pursuant to Sections 205.19 and 18.17 of the Physical and Clerical Agreements, Company proposes the  
following procedures for the See of the hardship transfer provisions of the Physical and Clerical Agreements  
.@., Sections 205.17 and 18.15). The purpose of these Sections was to allow the Company, through agreement with  
the Union, to fill a job vacancy by appointing an employee who requests the position for reasons of urgent necessity.  
Urgent necessity includes impairment of the employee's health or that of a member of the employee's family or the  
lack of educational facilities for the employee's children in the location in which he/she is currently employed.  
Following are the procedures to be utilized:  
1, An interested employee must write to the Human Resources Department of his/her division (or General  
Office department), explaining the circumstances and request a transfer pursuant to the provisions of Section 205.17  
(physical) or Section 18.15 (clerical), whichever is applicable.  
94  
   
2. The Division or Department Human Resources Department must then undertake a preliminary investigation  
to determine whether or not a bona fide reason exists to apply the appropriate section. For situations involving  
impairment of an employee's health or that of a member of the family, medical documentation is required.  
3. If the Human Resources Department believes that the matter should be pursued, they then contact the IBEW  
Business Representative assigned to that area and both will make a thorough investigation to determine whether a  
exists. If they agree a hardship exists, then they must then prepare a list of in the Company that  
could alleviate the  
4, This list must be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager and Business Representative of each division  
(and/or General Office department) where such a location is identified. Each of these locations must also agree, in  
writing, that hardship transfer consideration should be afforded the employee. To avoid conflicting responses to an  
employee, all of the divisions solicited for hardship consideration should communicate with each other.  
5, The first vacancy in any Of the listed locations to any classification to which the employee is qualified to fill that  
does not have a higher wage schedule than the employee's current classification must de offered to the employee. If  
the employee declines such offer without a substantial reason or the Company does not make such an offer, the  
entire matfer shal! be dropped at this point, and the 205.17/18.5 request is invalidated.  
6. If the individual accepts the offered position, a written agreement must then be prepared and signed by both  
the host and receiving Division Human Resources Managers and IBEW Business Representatives. A copy of such  
should be forwarded to the Manager of Industrial Relations and the IBEW Business Manager, as well as  
all of the other locations earlier identified.  
While the Division Human Resources Manager and IBEW Business Representative must send a hardship  
request to each suitable location, employees must also submit bids and transfers to each of these locations. The’  
bids and transfers must be to every classification that would qualify in alleviating the hardship. lf an employee  
declines a bona fide bid or transfer job offer, without a substantial reason, or if they refuse to submit bids and  
transfers to appropriate positions in all of the locations identified, his/her hardship would also be invalidated.  
Many hardship requests are location specific, This appears to be an attempt by some employees to relocate  
using the hardship provisions rather than the normal bid and transfer procedure. Those location specific requests  
must be viewed very carefully to ensure that the iocation(s) requested the only location(s) that would alleviate  
the employee's hardship. Often there are many locations that- would accommodate the employee's particular  
Situation. All of those locations must be included for consideration.  
Often times employees send hardship requests directly to the Division Human Resources Department(s} in  
the location(s) where they wish to be considered. Those requests must be returned to the employee's Human  
Resources Department for consideration and processing.  
This agreement may be cancelled by either party upon 30 days written notice to the other of such cancellation.  
If you are in accord with the foregoing and agree thereto, please so indicate in the space provided below and retum  
one executed copy of this letter to Company. ,

### LABOR AGREEMENT INTERPRETATION  
SUBJECT: Comparable Substitute for Usual and Average Meals (Meals at Home)  
TITLE 104 - MEALS - Agreement  
TITLE 16 - MEALS - Clerical Agreement  
Section 104.1 of the Physical Agreement and Section 16.1 of the Clerical Agreement state that provisions of  
the Meal Titles shall be interpreted and applied in a practical manner which shall conform to the intention of the  
parties in negotiating with respect to meals; namely, that a comparabie substitute shall be provided when employees  
are prevented from observing their usual and average meal practices or are prevented from eating a meal at  
approximately the usual time therefore.  
In the Company's Guidelines with respect to the application of Title 104 originally issued in October 1965 and  
amended in October 1966 and July 1968, the following statement is made with respect to the definition of a  
comparable substitute: .  
“The meal provided.....should but may not be quite the same as the meal would be at the same time if eaten  
at home. Dependent upon the circumstances present at the time, and where practical or possible, a  
substitute to the missed meal should be fumished.  
"It may be necessary to provide meals at times of the day or night when the employee would not observe a  
customary mealtime... The meal provided, again dependent upon the circumstances of that situation, should be such  
as to adequately compensate for the need for food resulting from working beyond or before customary meattime.  
“There have been no maximum cost limits for meals agreed upon because the cost of meals may vary due to  
such factors as the time of day, location, conditions and other circumstances. However, the requirement of  
reasonableness in the selection of a ‘comparable for the meal missed should be followed."  
The following guidelines, but not necessarily in the order listed, should be kept in mind by both emipoyes  
and supervisors in determining whether or not a meal purchased as a comparable substitute is or is not reasonable.  
1, The cost of meals at the average restaurant available in ihe general area, but excluding such luxury  
items as filet mignon or combination steak and seafood dinners. The foregoing is not intended to mean menu  
averaging.  
2. The availability of restaurants which can provide a comparable substitute within a reasonable  
distance of the job site or between the job site and the headquarters,  
The breakfast, luncheon or dinner menu where comparabie substitutes are available, but excludin  
extra ala carte items. The foregoing does not preclude ordering a la carte when that is all that is available nor does  
preclude a la carte desserts with dinner meals. .  
4. The weather or other extreme working conditions to which the employees have been subjected.  
5. The amount by which the time limits in the Agreement and in the Guidelines have been exceeded,  
with some consideration as to whether or not sandwiches and a hot beverage have been supplied on the job. Exce  
for lunch, the foregoing does not imply that sandwiches and a hot beverage are to be considered as a comparabie  
substitute nor is it intended to mean that employees are to be worked routinely nor excessively beyond the  
aforementioned time limits.

### CRITICAL CLASSIFICATIONS  
Locai Union No. 1245 March 8, 1974  
International Brotherhood of  
Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO  
  
Walnut Creek, California 94596  
Attention: Mr. L.L. Mitchell, Business Manager  
Gentlemen:  
This letter cancels and supersedes ail previous proposals submitted to you on the same subject.  
As discussed with you on numerous occasions, it has become increasing! difficuk for the Company to  
properly staff and maintain qualified personnel in certain ave? gill classifications ana in the system. In an  
attempt to solve this problem, Company proposes the following:  
1. When the complement of a joumeyman classification is 10% or more below the desired strength for  
90 days or more at a specific headquarters, Company may upon giving written notice to Union designate the  
apprenticeship teading to such journeyman classification, the journeyman classification, and classifications above the  
designated journeyman classification, as critical classifications. Non-apprenticeship situations shall be handled in  
accordance with Paragraph 8 below.  
in order to bring the complement at the aftected headquarters to the desired level, Company will  
initially seek volunteers system-wide for assignment to such critical classifications through the postbid procedure.  
Employees voluntarily transferring to the critical classifications shall be designated critical and be subject to the  
conditions outlined below. if sufficient empioyees are obtained in this manner to alleviate the critical situation, no  
further action will be taken. lf, however, a sufficient number of employees are not obtained for critical status,  
ey shall designate all apprentices appointed after the date critical status was applied at that headquarters as  
“critical apprentices.  
3. (a) Except as provided in (b} below, employees on critical status shall be paid 8% above their basic  
weekly rate as provided for in Exhibit X.  
{b) Employees in a critical renticeship status shall be paid the following percent adjustment  
above their basic weekly rate as provided for in Exhibit X:  
° Start 3%  
End § months 4%  
End 1 year 5%  
End 18 months 6%  
End 24 months 7%  
End 30 months 8%  
4 Employees on critical status will not have their prebids or postbids for vacancies in or below their  
present classifications nor their application for transfer considered for any job outside of their existing headquarters or  
outside of their Line of Progression.  
114  
5. A joumeyman’s “critical” status shall be for a period of three years with the exceptions set forth in  
Item 6 below. However, by mutual agreement, the “critical classification” designation may be lifted on either an  
individual or on a total basis. Apprentices on critical status complete their training at the "critical" headquarters.  
6. Apprentices designated as critical who progress to unassigned ee Status shall continue on  
"critical" status for two additional years under ihe conditions ovilined above. if the desired strengih has been met at  
the concerned headquarters, the unassigned journeyman may replace the senior journeyman on “critical” status who  
desires such replacement. Upon his release from “critical status," the 8% weekly allowance and the freeze on bidding  
and transfer rights will cease.  
7. — Company will give the Union and the involved 90 days' notice of the cancellation of the  
“critical classification” designation. However, upon cancellation by employees on critical status shall  
continue to receive the toh tape weekly allowance for the remainder of their applicable term or until such time as  
they bid or transfer to another classification or headquarters.  
8. In critical situations where a formal apprenticeship is not involved Company proposes to ly the  
8% weekly allowance and the freeze on bidding and transfer rights to the journeyman Classification under the  
conditions outlined above. However, in each instance, the added weekly pay and the total tangth of the bid or transfer  
freeze for classifications leading to such non-apprentice journeymen shall be established by agreement between  
Company and Union. Such agreement shall be, to the extent possible, consistent with the framework outlined above  
for apprentice situations.  
If you are in accord with the foregoing and agree thereto, please so indicate in the space provided below and  
return one executed copy of this ietter to Company.  
Yours very truly
