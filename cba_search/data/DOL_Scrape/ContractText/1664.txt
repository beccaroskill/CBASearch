be discriminated against for this reason.  
SECTION 4. Job Steward.

SECTION 2. Termination Slip.

check. The Employer shall make a good faith effort to provide the Employee with a copy  
of their report when report results change terms of employment, resulting in employment  
termination or results in withdrawal of employment offer. The background information  
will be kept confidential and the Employer and the Employee will be the only parties  
with access to this information.  
SECTION 6. Tunnel, Shaft, and Dredge Work.

entire so held or declared invalid or illegal shall forthwith cease to be of  
further force and effect, and in such event either party hereto may, upon not less than

substitution of a new section, sections, or agreement consistent with the decision of the  
Board or Court.
