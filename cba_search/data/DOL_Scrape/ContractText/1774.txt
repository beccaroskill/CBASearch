### PREAMBLE  
THIS AGREEMENT between the Associated General Contractors of Alaska, and Local Union  
No. 867 of the Operative Plasters and Cement Masons, within the legal boundaries of the State of  
Alaska is a successive principal Agreement of the 2010 - 2013 Agreement and all other prior  
agreements between the Associated General Contractors of Alaska, and the aforementioned  
union.  
### PURPOSES  
It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide a document which can form the basis of a  
collective bargaining agreement between Employers and Unions thereby assuring a supply of  
competent and capable persons for the performance of the work undertaken by Employers,  
maintaining the continuity of employment to the persons employed, preserving amicable labor-  
management relations, eliminating work stoppages and delays in the prosecution of all work  
undertaken by Employers, improving the competitive position of the organized sector of the  
construction industry, and recording the terms of agreement with respect to rates of pay hours of  
work, and other conditions of employment arrived at through the process of collective  
bargaining. Any reference to either the male or female gender in this Agreement is intended to  
include both genders and is not to be considered as a limitation on either sex. The term  
journeyman(men) as used within this Agreement shall be considered a performance level and not  
a gender term.  
### ARTICLE I  
### PARTIES AND COVERAGE  
SECTION 1. Parties.  
The term "Union" shall refer to Local Union No. 867 of the Operative Plasterers and Cement  
Masons. The term "AGC" shall refer to the Associated General Contractors of Alaska. For  
purposes of this agreement, the AGC is not acting as an agent or collective bargaining  
representative for any Employers who are or may become signatory to this agreement.  
SECTION 2. Union Recognition and Employee Coverage.  
The Employers recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for all  
their Employees on building, marine, offshore, heavy and highway construction jobs, who  
perform work within the jurisdiction of the Union, and this Agreement shall apply to such  
Employees.  
SECTION 3. Effect of Other Agreements.  
The Provisions of this Agreement to be agreed upon between the Employer and the appropriate  
Union(s), shall apply to all work identified in Article I, Section 2, notwithstanding provisions of  
National Union Agreements which may conflict or differ with the terms of this Agreement.  
SECTION 4. Subcontracting - Uniform Conditions  
a)  
b)  
Cc)  
d)  
Except as provided in paragraphs b and c & d below, the Employers agrees not to  
subcontract any work at the site of the construction covered by the terms of this  
Agreement to any subcontractor unless said subcontractor agrees in writing to perform  
said work subject to all terms and conditions of this agreement. Prime contractors shall  
assure that subcontractors engaged to perform work under the terms of this Agreement  
shall become signatory to this Agreement prior to performing said work. The Union  
agrees to allow a subcontractor to be bound by the terms of this agreement, on that  
work [performed for an Employer on an individual project] without binding the  
subcontractor to this Agreement on any other work for the same or any other Employer.  
Whenever the Employer is obligated to satisfy DBE-WBE recruiting requirements the  
Union and the Employer mutually agree to waive this provision prior to  
commencement of the work in the event an Employer and Union are unable to find  
qualified competitive union minority subcontractors.  
When potential union subcontractors are not available in the locality of the job site to  
perform the work and/or where the general contractor receives no competitive union  
bids, the Employer and the Union mutually agree that this provision Section 4 is fully  
waived.  
For the purposes of this Agreement, the Employer is entitled to designate a bid as non-  
competitive when it is not the lowest bid.  
If requested, furnish the Union the name and address of said sub-contractor  
immediately upon awarding the sub-contract.  
SECTION 5. Favored Nations.  
If the Union enters into any Agreement with any individual Employer or group of Employers  
performing work on any project or in any geographical area covered by the terms of this  
Agreement and that Agreement provides for more favorable wages, hours or conditions to any  
other Employer, the Employers signatory hereto, after sending written notice of such intention,  
shall be afforded the privilege to adopt such advantageous terms and conditions with respect to  
that geographical area and/or project(s).  
The Union will provide the AGC with a true copy of any Agreement signed by any Employer  
that covers work recognized as field construction work that differs in any material way from the  
working terms and conditions or wages contained in this Agreement within five (5) calendar  
days of such signing.  
### ARTICLE Il  
### HIRING OF PERSONS  
SECTION 1. Hiring Hall. |  
The Union agrees to maintain a hiring hall and to solicit qualified workers, both Union and non-  
Union, in order to fill necessary requisitions for workers. The Employers agree to exclusively  
use the services of such hiring hall and will call upon the Union to furnish all the qualified  
workers they may require in the classifications herein mentioned, subject to the following terms  
and conditions.  
SECTION 2. Union Notification.  
Whenever the Employers require Employees, they shall notify the Union office either in writing  
or by telephone, stating the location, starting time, anticipated work schedule, approximate  
duration of the job, the type of work to be performed, and the total number of Employees  
required. The Employers agree that no Employee will be sent initially to any other job site than  
the job site the Employee was dispatched to.  
SECTION 3. Selection of Applicants.  
Selection of applicants for referral to jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall not be  
based on, or in any way affected by Union membership, by-laws, regulations, constitutional  
provisions, or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership, policies or requirements.  
SECTION 4. Employer Rejection of Applicants.  
The Employer retains the right to reject any job applicant referred by the Union, in which event  
the Union shall refer another applicant. Should an Employer reject an applicant, a legitimate  
reason shall be given in writing to the Union. Failure to comply with this provision shall  
necessitate a four (4) hour show up time which shall be paid to the rejected Employee. After the  
initial rejection, the Union will have twenty-four (24) hours to refer applicant(s). The time  
referred in this Article (24 hours) shall start over upon such rejection(s).  
### SECTION 5. Violation of Hiring Hall.  
Any alleged violation of this Article may be the subject of a hearing under Article III. In the  
event the Employer has employed an individual in violation of this Article, the Hiring Hall  
Committee shall decree that the Employer shall pay to the individual who would have been  
dispatched to that job had the procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement been followed,  
the full amount of wages which said individual has lost, together with the payment into the  
various fringe benefits trusts on behalf of said individual.  
SECTION 6. Registration.  
Registration or re-registration of applicants for referral shall be accepted by the Union during its  
customary hours. All applicants shall be registered in the order of time and date of registration.  
To remain on the registration list, an applicant for referral must renew their registration not later  
than ninety (90) days from the date of their last registration or re-registration. Registration or re-  
registration and placement on the appropriate list shall be in person except in the case of  
registrants who are "Residents," as herein defined, of areas not connected by maintained public  
roads to the dispatch halls.  
There shall be three (3) groupings of the out-of-work list. All workers shall be registered on the  
appropriate list. Each applicant for referral shall be required to furnish such data records, names  
of Employers and length of employment and licenses as may be deemed necessary, and each  
applicant shall complete such forms or registrations as shall be submitted to them. Applicants  
for employment shall also list any special skills they may possess.  
Employers and the Union agree that there will be no discrimination in hiring or referral of  
workers due to their race, creed, color, age, or sex; provided further, that notwithstanding these  
hiring hall provisions, the Union, when requested by an Employer, shall dispatch to allow an  
Employer to comply with: state or federal affirmative action requirements; any other local, state  
or federal law; or any reasonable contractual obligation imposed by an Owner.  
SECTION 7. Referral Procedure.  
a) Upon the request of an Employer for workers, the Union shall refer registrants to that  
Employer in sufficient number required by the Employer in the manner and under the  
conditions specified in this or of a related agreement from the list in the following order  
of referral:  
1. | Applicants shall be referred from the "A" List in successive order as their names  
appear on the out-of-work list and, when the "A" List has been exhausted, then  
2. Applicants from the "B" List in successive order as their names appear on the out-  
of-work list, and when the "B" List is exhausted, then  
3. The applicants from the "C" List and the remaining successive Lists in successive  
order as their names appear on the out-of- work List.  
b) Separate lists will be established and maintained for apprentice workers, and referrals  
shall be made on the same basis as that for workers except that the experience conditions  
set out in Section 1 of this Agreement shall, as to apprentice workers, not be applicable or  
required.  
c) Any applicant who is rejected by the Employer shall be restored to their place on the  
appropriate list on which they are registered. When a worker quits a job of their own  
volition without good and sufficient cause they shall be registered at the bottom of the  
appropriate list.  
d) When a registrant is referred for employment and is actually employed on a job for one  
(1) day such registrant's name shall be removed from the list. When their employment  
terminates, they shall be registered at the bottom of the appropriate list on which they are  
e)  
g)  
entitled to be registered. A registrant may refuse to be referred to employment in regular  
order without prejudicing their position on the appropriate list on which they are  
registered.  
The referral procedure as contained herein shall be followed except that:  
1.  
Requests by Employer for key workers to act as foremen shall be honored without  
regard to the requested worker's place on the out- of-work list. Foremen hired  
under these provisions shall not be reduced to a lower classification and their  
employment as requested foremen shall not qualify them for callbacks under the  
rehire clause contained in subsection 2 below. To qualify as a foreman under this  
Section, the Employee must actually perform the duties of a foreman. Employers  
shall not abuse the privilege of requesting foremen.  
Requests by the Employer for a particular person previously employed by the  
Employer or a joint venture of which the Employer was a member and who has  
been laid off or terminated by the Employer within three (3) years previous to the  
request shall be honored, and a request for a particular worker who has been laid off  
or terminated more than three (3) years, but not more than five (5) years prior to the  
requests shall be honored to the extent that one person referred to the Employer by  
the Union from the out-of-work list shall be employed for every person so requested  
by name.  
Bona fide requests from the Employer for workers with special skills and abilities  
will be honored; the dispatcher shall refer persons possessing the skills and abilities  
in the order in which their names appear on the out-of-work list. Such a decision of  
the dispatching agent in referring registrants is appealable to the Joint Hiring  
Committee as herein provided.  
Requests by Employers for bona fide residents of the vicinity immediately  
accessible to the job site in a remote area shall be honored in accordance with the  
place of the local resident upon the registration list in relation to other registrants in  
the same area. Residence for the purpose of this section shall mean that the  
individual shall have resided in the area for a period of twelve (12) months  
immediately prior to the date of the requests.  
Requests by an Employer for a particular individual with no priority shall be  
honored without regard to the requested person's place on the out-of-work list,  
provided said individual shall occupy the status of son or daughter of management,  
or son or daughter of workers.  
All "A" List workers on the out-of-work list may be requested by name, regardless  
of place on the list.  
A subsidiary corporation or one under control of another corporation shall be considered  
the same Employer as the parent controlling corporation for the purpose of transferring  
workers to or from the parent, subsidiary, or controlled corporation.  
In the event that the referral facilities maintained by the Union are unable to fill the  
requisition for any Employer for workers within a forty-eight (48) hour period after such  
requisition is made by the Employer (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays excepted), the  
Employer may employ applicants without reference to the referral procedure. In such an  
event, the Employer will notify the Union of the names and dates of such hiring’s within  
forty-eight (48) hours of such hiring’s.  
SECTION 8. Employment Clearance.  
a)  
b)  
To avoid duplication of orders and to effect an orderly hiring procedure, the Employers  
agree, when calling on the union for workers, to designate a responsible representative  
for each project whom the Union shall recognize as the agents of the Employers with  
authority so to hire. Furthermore, the Union shall be notified in writing as to the names  
of the authorized representatives and the parties mutually agree that employment will be  
made only through such order.  
The Union and the Employer shall post, in places where notices to all Employees and  
applicants for employment are customarily posted, all provisions relating to the  
functioning of the hiring provisions of this Agreement.  
SECTION 9. Registration Requirements.  
The Union will maintain a roster of job applicants and an Employee is eligible for registration on  
that roster as follows:  
LIST A: Workers who are bona fide residents of Alaska and have worked in the trade  
for an Employer or Employers for an aggregate time of at least 400 hours  
during the last two years.  
LIST B: Workers who have worked for such Employer or Employers in the trade for an  
aggregate time of at least 400 hours during the last two years.  
LIST C: All other applicant workers for employment.  
SECTION 10. Residents.  
For the purposes of this Agreement, a "bona fide resident within the geographical jurisdiction of  
the Union" shall mean an individual who has resided continuously, for at least twelve (12)  
months, within the geographical area for which the union has craft jurisdiction, as defined by the  
charter of the Union. A person claiming residency may not claim or maintain a residency  
outside the geographical jurisdiction of the Union. The criteria for establishing residency shall  
be determined by the Union.  
SECTION 11. Drug and Alcohol Screening  
Workers required by the Employer to take a pre-employment drug and alcohol screening will not  
be on the payroll of the Employer during drug and alcohol screening if the procedure is identified  
in the Employers policy and procedures manual. If the Employee is put to work while they are  
awaiting the results they will be paid for time worked. The Employer will pay for all drug and  
alcohol screening.  
SECTION 12. Referral Disputes:  
Any and all disputes arising out of work registrations, work referrals and the preparation of the  
referral registration lists will be submitted to the Union. Any applicant or registrant shall have a  
right to present any dispute arising out of and relating to the operation or functioning of the job  
referral plan to the Union.  
SECTION 13. Severability Clause: |  
It is not the intent of this Article to in any way violate State or Federal Law or regulation and the  
development of any such situation shall be cause for immediate negotiations between the  
signatories to this Agreement to correct the language. In the event that, as a result of a charge or  
suit against any party to this Agreement (to include any member of the Associated General  
Contractors of Alaska, or any Employer who adopts and works under this Agreement), any  
section or provision hereof or the entire Agreement shall be declared or held to be invalid or  
illegal by any authorized Board or Court, the part, section, provision or the entire Agreement so  
held or declared invalid or illegal shall forthwith cease to be of further force and effect and in  
such event either party hereto may, upon not less than thirty (30) days written notice to the other,  
have the right to open negotiations for the substitution of a new section, sections, or agreement  
consistent with the decision of the Board or Court.  
### ARTICLE Ill  
### HIRING HALL COMMITTEE  
SECTION 1. Creation of Committee.  
As needed, the parties to this Agreement shall create a Joint Hiring Hall Committee, composed  
of not more than two (2) representatives of the Employer and two (2) representatives of the  
involved Union.  
SECTION 2. Powers of Committee.  
a) The Joint Hiring Hall Committee shall be empowered to hear and determine any and all  
disputes or grievances arising out of 1) work referrals, and 2) placement on hiring hall  
list.  
b) Before any individual(s) may appear before the Committee, they must exhaust the  
administrative procedures provided by the Union.  
c) The Committee shall also determine the criteria for establishing residency within the  
jurisdiction of the Union.  
SECTION 3. Employer Disputes.  
If an Employer has a dispute concerning the dispatch of an individual, the Employer shall submit  
that dispute to the Committee for resolution.  
In case the Committee deadlocks, the matter shall be referred to an impartial umpire. The  
impartial umpire shall be designated by mutual agreement of the parties and if they shall be  
unable to agree upon the impartial umpire, they shall be selected in the manner provided under  
the disputes provisions of this Agreement. All decisions of the Joint Hiring Hall Committee or  
the impartial umpire shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.  
### ARTICLE IV  
### UNION SECURITY  
SECTION 1. Union Shop.  
All Employees covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on  
the effective date of this clause shall remain members in good standing. Those who are not  
members in good standing on the effective date of this clause shall, within fourteen (14) days  
following the effective date of this clause, become and remain members in good standing in the  
Union. Employees hired or covered by this Agreement subsequent to the signing of this  
Agreement shall be required to become and remain members of the Union in good standing  
within fourteen (14) days of hire or being covered. All requests by the Union for the dismissal of  
any Employee for failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be in writing.  
The Union agrees to defend any charge or suit made or brought against any Employer as the  
result of the dismissal or termination of any Employees pursuant to the provisions of this section  
and to hold the Employer harmless.  
SECTION 2. Checkoff of Dues.  
The Employers agree to deduct from the wages of each Employee such amount of the Union  
dues and/or assessments owing by them to the Union, as may be certified by the Financial  
Officer of the involved Union, provided the Employee has executed a written assignment calling  
for such deduction. If an Employer transfers an Employee to a subsidiary and/or sister company,  
or if an Employee is transferred by the Employer to a joint venture that is formed by the  
Employer, it is agreed that for purposes of Union dues and/or assessments, the Employee need  
not execute a new written assignment calling for such deduction. Consequently, the deductions  
will continue without interruption and will be forwarded to the Union by the Employer who is  
then paying the Employee. Such deductions shall be transmitted to the Union within fifteen (15)  
days following the end of each calendar month. Appropriate transmittal forms shall be supplied  
to each Employer by the Union. Each signatory Union shall notify the Employer of the amount  
to be deducted. |  
The above deductions shall be made by the Employers so long as such payments are deemed in  
compliance with applicable law, and the Union agrees to indemnify the Employer for any  
litigation costs, expenses, or liabilities which an Employer may incur from compliance with this  
provision.  
SECTION 3. Discrimination Forbidden.  
The Employer shall be the sole judge of a workers ability, competence and performance. No  
person shall be discriminated against for upholding Union principles and any person who serves  
on a Committee shall not lose their position or be discriminated against for this reason.  
SECTION 4. Job Steward.  
One or more working stewards may be appointed by the Union that will represent the Union on  
the job at all times, subject to the supervision of the Union. The Employer shall be informed of  
the names of the appointed stewards, in writing, and only such stewards will be accorded  
recognition by the Employer. The job steward shall be the last person terminated provided they  
are qualified for the last work available on the job. The designated Union Representative shall  
be consulted by the Employer prior to a job steward's termination for cause. The job steward  
shall be allowed to discuss grievances arising under this Agreement with the job supervisor  
during working hours without loss of compensation for such time spent in the pursuit of their job  
steward duties. These duties shall include, but not be limited to, taking a weekly report of all  
members employed, checking newly dispatched Employees, caring for the tools and effects of  
any injured member, caring for the injured in the absence of an authorized first aid person,  
notifying the Union Representative of injuries, and transmitting to the Union Representative all  
complaints and grievances emanating from the job.  
SECTION 5. Discipline.  
The Union shall retain the right to discipline its members at all times. The Union shall have the  
authority to remove any member from a job who becomes more than two (2) months delinquent  
in his Union Dues. Provided, however, that these members would be removed before the start of  
a shift or after a shift is completed.  
### ARTICLE V  
### GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE  
SECTION 1. Grievance Procedure.  
Any grievance, complaint, or dispute (except jurisdictional disputes) arising out of this  
Agreement involving its interpretation or application shall be considered a grievance and subject  
to resolution under the following procedure, and it is further agreed that until said procedure is  
exhausted, there shall be no work stoppage or lockout.  
a) The Employee shall report to their job steward or such other business representative as  
may be designated by the Union, any grievance, complaint, or dispute that arises  
between the Employee and the Employer. The designated job steward or business  
representative will attempt to resolve the matter, between the parties on the job  
immediately.  
b) Failing to agree, the designated job steward or business representative shall report the

Employer makes satisfactory arrangements with the Administrator to satisfy the debt, which  
arrangement may include the posting of a bond or other security, the making of weekly  
contributions, or any combination of the above, then the Administrator may advise the Union  
that work persons may be dispatched to the Employer. If the Employer contests the amount of  
contributions due and owing, the Employer may request an audit by the trust auditors, which  
would proceed as soon as possible. If the Employer is found to be delinquent then the Employer

Employer deems it appropriate to do so without violating any provision of the Agreement or any

particular supervisor to issue instructions to the craft working foreman utilized by the Employer  
to prevent duplication and confusion of orders.

the Union or Unions involved.  
SECTION 7. Termination for Cause.

duties, and violation of the owner's rules imposed upon the Employer.  
SECTION 8. Injured Person to Get Priority for Rehire.  
An Employee who is required to leave employment because of job connected injuries shall, upon  
recovery therefrom, be given priority of hire by their former Employer when that Employer  
needs one or more Employees in the injured person's classification, provided the said Employee  
has a medical release and is ready, willing, and able to return to work. This Section shall not  
apply for a different project, after a winter shutdown, or if the previously injured Employee has  
worked elsewhere since his recovery.  
SECTION 9. Restriction of Work of Supervisors.  
Department heads, non-working foreman, and supervisory personnel shall not be permitted to  
perform any of the work covered by this Agreement.

cases of immediate and pressing necessity.  
Contractors will furnish all special tools, such as troweling machines, tamps, bull floats, darbies,  
knee boards, grinders, rubber floats, brushes, etc.  
Plasterers and Cement Masons shall not use their personal vehicles for transporting tools that are  
supposed to be furnished by the Contractor.  
Whenever hi-early cement or any type of additives are to be used in concrete mixes for quick  
setting purposes, the cement mason foreman on the job will be notified of the amount and type to  
be used so that additional workers will be assigned if needed to adequately handle the work.
