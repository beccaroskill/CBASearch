Employer's job or project, provided there has been an appropriate demand made in writing to  
recover said wages and fringe benefits. If the Employer has included the delinquent Subcontractor  
on a duly filed Job Registration Form, a copy of such demand will be furnished to the Employer. If  
the state law is amended to relieve the Employer of such responsibility, then this Section shall  
continue to be applicable on the Employer’s responsibility to the extent of any monies remaining  
due from the Employer to the Subcontractor who is liable for wages or fringe benefit contributions.  
303. Prior to implementation of this paragraph, the Union or Trust Fund will make a good faith  
effort to promptly notify the Employer of any and all delinquencies of the Subcontractor and make  
a good faith effort to exhaust execution of the Subcontractor’s bond or bonds.  
304, The terms and conditions of this Agreement insofar as it affects the individual Employer  
shall apply to any subcontractor under the control of or working under contract with the individual  
Employer upon work covered by this Agreement, and said subcontractor with respect to such work  
shall be considered as the individual Employer. Any subcontractor performing work under the  
jurisdiction of this Agreement must furnish all materials and equipment for the fabrication and/or  
installation thereof (except carpenter hand tools) and must compensate carpenters at the wage rates.  
fringe benefits and working conditions as specified in this Agreement.

entity that holds a valid State Contractor's License, wherever required by law, and who agrees  
under contract in writing with the Employer or in writing with his subcontractors to perform any  
work covered by this Agreement and who employs workmen as employees to perform services  
under this Agreement, who agrees in writing to perform for or on behalf of an Employer or other  
subcontractor any part or portion of the work covered by this Agreement.  
306. The Employer and his subcontractors shall refrain from the use of materials which will  
tend to cause discord or disturbance on the job site.

The Union may withhold or withdraw workers from the Employer or subcontractor for failure to  
comply with this Section II (301); only after first (1") notifying the employer or subcontractor in  
writing 48 hours before withdrawing workers from the employer or subcontractor.  
308. The parties recognize and acknowledge the importance of prompt remedial action to collect  
delinquent fringe benefit contributions from Employers of Subcontractors who are habitually  
delinquent in their payments to the Funds and will use their good faith efforts to encourage such  
action. The parties also recognize the responsibility to file appropriate documents in connection  
with bankruptcy of any Employer or Subcontractor as part of a prudent effort to collect unpaid  
wages or fringe benefit contributions.

conditions of employment for employees performing job site construction industry work in  
classifications similar to those set forth in this Agreement in the work and territorial jurisdiction of

necessary for the completion of the audit.  
The CAC shall submit evidence of any alleged violation of this Agreement to the  
Association and the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, and shall then  
submit the matter to the Joint Adjustment Board for adjudication as though the  
complaint or grievance were filed by a Local Union, an individual Contractor or an  
individual worker.  
In case the auditors designated by the Board of Trustees conduct an audit and  
determine that a Contractor has violated the provisions of this Agreement for hours  
worked (or paid for) in that the gross compensation, including any remuneration or  
compensation not required or permitted by this Agreement, divided by hours  
reported, exceeds the employee's base rate plus One Dollar ($1.00) per hour, or if  
adequate records are not made available to allow the auditor to make his  
determination in that regard, or if hours worked for each payroll period are not  
recorded on payroll records, then the auditors shall calculate or estimate gross  
compensation including any remuneration or compensation not permitted in this  
Agreement from whatever information is available. This amount determined to be  
the gross compensation, when divided by the appropriate hourly wage, exclusive of  
vacation and other fringe benefits, and then multiplied by the appropriate hourly  
fringe benefit contribution rate according to this Agreement, shall be considered due  
the respective Trust Funds.  
The failure to register jobs as required by Article III of this Agreement and/or the  
failure to report accurately all hours worked in a given period to the respective Trust  
Funds and/or to pay fully the required amounts to said Trust Funds as required by  
Article V of this Agreement shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to violate  
this Agreement and shall require the auditors to apply the above-stated formula to  
determine the amount due the respective Trust Funds. The amount determined to be  
due by the application of the above formula shail be paid by the individual  
Contractor to the respective Trust Funds, unless challenged through the grievance  
procedure within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the demand for payment.  
If the Contractor fails to pay the said amount, and if a grievance is filed, the Joint  
Adjustment Board or arbitrator shall be authorized to assess damages in addition to  
any other remedies deemed appropriate by the Joint Adjustment Board or the  
arbitrator.  
615. The failure to register jobs, and/or accurately report hours on jobs as required by this  
Agreement, shall entitle all of the Trusts to assess fringe benefits based upon the reports of the CAC  
field personnel as to their estimate of the hours that should have been paid on the particular job or  
jobs. Such estimate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount due and owing unless the estimate is  
found by the Joint Adjustment Board and/or the arbitrator to be arbitrary and capricious.  
616. All payments required to be made by each Employer to the Vacation Savings Plan, the  
Health and Insurance Trust Fund. Grievance and Arbitration Administration Trust Fund, Carpenters  
Contractors Cooperation Committee, Contract Administration Trust, the Carpenters International  
Training Fund. the Pension Trust Fund, the Joint Apprenticeship Committee and the Journeyman  
Upgrading Fund, when applicable, under this Section shall be due and payable to the appropriate  
trust fund and Joint Apprenticeship Committee no later than the tenth (10%) day of the month for all  
hours worked by employees covered by this Agreement during the preceding month. An Employer  
who has not made such payments by the twentieth (20") day of the month shall be considered in  
violation of the Agreement and a delinquent Employer. The grievance and arbitration procedure  
contained in Section XV shall not apply to any cases involving the failure of a contractor to pay  
fringe benefits as required herein. The Union shall take appropriate action against the Employer or  
Subcontractor who is delinquent in the payment of fringe benefit contributions under this  
Agreement, up to and including the withholding of manpower.  
617. A list of Subcontractors or others who are delinquent in payment of fringe benefit  
contributions under this Agreement will be provided monthly to Employers and Employer  
Associations representing Employers, as close as reasonably possibly to the first of the next month  
succeeding the due date of reports referenced above.

contracting for labor only. The contracting Employer agrees that all work covered by this  
Agreement shall be performed by carpenters and that such workmen shall be employees of the

general foreman. Any foreman who does not work, with his tools during regular working hours

### APPENDIX “G” - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND DETECTION  
7000. The parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the  
construction industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs.  
Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to  
maintain a drug and alcohol free work environment, individual employers may require applicants  
or employees to undergo drug testing. The parties agree that (fa testing program ts implemented  
by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and  
Management:  
7000.t It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs,  
narcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on  
the Employer's job premises or while working on any site in connection with work  
performed under the applicable agreement.  
7000.2 All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug test at the direction  
of the Employer, but not later than five (5) days after commencement of work, at a  
facility agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The cutoff levels for both the initial  
test and the confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of  
Health and Human Services. The facility where the sample Is tested will be approved by  
the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Employer agrees to pay  
each applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug test for all the time it takes to  
undergo the drug test up to a maximum of two (2) hours travel time plus lab time. If an  
employee fails the drug test and has time coming to him or her, the employer may  
withhold the cost of the drug test from the final check. Employers may use an oral fluid  
test or urine screen, solely as a type of pre-employment screening process. Testing  
procedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the products’ manufacturing  
specifications «“Avitar ORAL screen” or Branan Medical Corp. “Oratect”). Any “non-  
negative” test results shall be designated as inconclusive. Employers may seek a urine  
test at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing procedure set forth in this  
collective bargaining agreement to confirm results.  
7000.3 Applicants not passing the drug test will not be placed on the Employer's payroll  
or receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug test will be removed from  
the Employers payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug  
test.  
7000.4 The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs and alcohol  
where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from  
performing his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one (1) of  
whom may be a Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-disctiminatory  
manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For  
employees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph  
have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been  
positive for an unlawful substance.  
7000.5 An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be  
tested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the  
accident resulted from drug usage.  
7000.6 There will be no individual random drug testing by the signatory Employer.  
7000.7 It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of  
prescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for  
removal.  
7000.8 A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and  
confirmation test. The initial test will be an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique  
(E MIT). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test a  
confirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or  
applicant. The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G  
C/M S). The cutoff levels for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those  
established by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. Confirmed  
positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long term frozen  
storage for a minimum of one (1) year. Collection and transportation of each sample  
must be done in accordance with the procedures mandated by the Federal Department of  
Health and Human Services.  
7000.9 Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a  
program at the employee's expense. When such program has been  
successfully completed, the Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the  
employee. If work, for which the employee is qualified, exists, he or she shall be  
reinstated.  
7000.10 Any dispute which arises under this drug and alcohol policy shall be submitted  
to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.  
7000.11 In the event an individual Employer is required, as a condition of contract  
award, to abide by the terms and conditions of an owner's drug and alcohol policy, the  
Employer will notify the interested Unions in writing prior to implementing such policy.  
7000.12 The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an  
employee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found  
unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over  
the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shail be unaffected and the parties shall  
enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.  
7000.13 The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all  
claims, demands, sutts or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's  
application of the Substance Abuse Program.  
oe  
   
7000.14 The Employers will be allowed to conduct periodic jobsite drug testing on  
construction projects until completion of work under the following circumstances:  
7000.14.1 The entire jobsite must be tested including all employees of the  
Employer.  
7000.14.2 Prior to start of periodic jobsite testing the Employer will notify the  
Union in writing.  
7000.14.3 Analysis shall be conducted by a Federal Department of Health and  
Human Services certified lab.
