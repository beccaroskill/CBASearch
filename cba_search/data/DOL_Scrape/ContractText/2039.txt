dispute and the aggrieved employee, but shall not be considered as a precedent in any

informally as possible, consistent with a full and fair hearing of the issues. The parties to  
the proceeding shall be permitted to participate only through full-time operating officials  
who are not lawyers. The Arbitrator shall establish appropriate informal arbitration  
procedures and have the authority to exclude any representative of either party who does  
not meet the qualifications set forth in this Section.

by the party seeking to produce such evidence or testimony. For the purposes of this  
Section, time spent as a witness shall not be construed as working time under the  
provisions of this Agreement.

of this Agreement. Any expenses incidental to the conduct of the hearing, and the fee of  
the Arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the parties.

as to override the desirability of the expedited and informal arbitration procedures  
contained in this Article, such party shall advise the other in writing of its desire to  
proceed to arbitration under the provisions of Article 8 of this Agreement, wherein the  
parties are not limited to representation by any person of their choice.

the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shal] not be affected  
hereby.
