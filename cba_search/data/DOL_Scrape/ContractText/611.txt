by this Agreement. Seniority for full-time employees shall be measured on the following two (2)  
divisions of the Employer's division:  
1. All territory serviced by the former Newark Division in New Jersey (Local 464A).  
2. All territory serviced by the former Paterson Division in New Jersey and New York (Local  
464A).  
Layoffs and rehiring of such employees shall be based upon seniority within classification within the  
Division. Promotions within the Employer unit shall be based on fitness and ability, with seniority a  
factor only when all other things are equal.  
Full-time employees with more than one (1) year's seniority if laid off, through no fault of their own,  
shall be given preference for available part-time employment before new part-time employees are  
hired. Such employees shall be paid the hourly rate equivalent to the full-time hourly rate of pay  
previously received. Rights under this Article shal! continue for a period not exceeding one (1) year  
from the date of layoff, except as provided in paragraph (T) of this Article.  
When a full-time employee is rehired within the one (1) year period of layoff as provided for in  
paragraph (C), his seniority rights shall be restored on the first (ist) of the month following his  
reemployment. During the period of layoff, all fringe benefits shall be canceled and the period of  
layoff shall not be counted as months of employment in relation to fringe benefit credits, or in relation  
to progression on the wage scale.  
When a part-time employee is rehired within ninety (90) days of layoff, his seniority rights shall be  
restored on the first (4st) day of the month following his reemployment, and if he qualifies as required  
he shall be granted vacation and welfare benefits and shall be rehired at the same rate of pay as of  
the date of such termination.  
When full-time openings become available, part-time employees will be given first consideration to fill  
the full-time openings. When promotions become available, full-time employees on the payroll will be  
given consideration to fill the openings, provided they have submitted desires and qualifications to  
management, in writing. Ali part-time employees who are interested in obtaining full-time positions  
shall place their names on a bid sheet. Bid sheets shall be posted for a six (6) month period.  
Employees may place their name on bid sheets in the months of March and September each year.  
Any full-time employee who is laid off and fails to report for work when recalled from the layoff within  
seven (7) days (unless excused for a longer period by the Employer's employment office) after the  
Employer has deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, a registered letter directed to the  
Union and to such employee at his last known address as shown by the records of the Employer,  
shall terminate his seniority.  
When two (2) or more employees are hired on the same day in the same seniority area, the Employer  
will notify the Union of their seniority status.  
The Employer agrees to give one {1} week's notice to the full-time employees and the Union prior to  
layoff because of lack of work, and the full-time employee agrees to promptly notify (within one (1)  
week) the Employer of his choice of accepting part-time work in lieu of layoff.  
In the event of demotion, with one (1) week’s notice to the Union, and subject to the grievance  
procedure, any of the aforementioned Department Heads or Head Cashier, will be slotted into Clerk  
seniority fist of full-time employees. Such employee will be credited with services as a Department  
Head or Head Cashier in the computation of his seniority. In all other respects this Article shall apply  
to Department Heads, Head Cashiers, and Clerks as separate classifications.  
Any discharged employee who is reinstated through the grievance or arbitration procedure of this  
Agreement shall have his seniority status made whole upon his return to work.  
The Union may elect or appoint one Shop Steward for each store from among the employees. They  
shall be at all times full-time employees and shall be the last to be taid off. The Employer shall be  
notified of the election or appointment of such Shop Steward. The Employer agrees to cooperate  
with the Local Union in allowing Shop Stewards the opportunity to attend Shop Steward Conferences  
by scheduling a day off (with pay - eight [8] hours) during the calendar year to attend a seminar.

the Union disagrees, the issue shall be subject to the grievance procedure.  
All full-time permanent transfers shall be based on seniority, except where mutually agreed upon by  
the Employer and the employee; with prior notice given to the Union for other than a seniority  
transfer. In the event a full-time employee is permanently transferred to another store, the Union and  
the employee shall be notified in writing at least one (1) week in advance of said transfer. Any such  
transfer for a period in excess of two (2} weeks shall be considered a permanent transfer. When a  
full-time employee is transferred from one division to another (whether or not it involves a transfer  
from the jurisdiction of one Local Union to another), he shall be credited in the new division with the  
seniority accrued in the Company for vacation, paid leave, and pay purposes only. The Employer will  
consider the request of full-time employees for transfers within the respective bargaining unit of each  
Local. A temporary transfer of an employee in any given day to more than one (1) store shall be  
avoided except in case of extreme emergency. Any abuse of this provision shall be subject to the  
grievance procedure. Such temporary transfers shall be successively made on the basis of  
classification (i.e. Journeyman Butchers, Apprentices, Wrappers, Grocery employees) and unit  
seniority in the store. Seniority shall not apply in cases involving temporary transfers to new or  
remodeled stores but employees subject to such transfers shall not again be transferred, except in  
order of seniority. The present assignment of an employee to another store on a regular relief basis  
shall not be considered a transfer.  
Employees who are temporarily transferred to shore areas or summer points shall be transferred  
back to their respective areas as soon as possible after Labor Day.  
Separate seniority lists of full-time employees by classification and part-time employees shall be  
made available to the respective Union.  
Layoffs of part-time employees shall be based upon seniority. Part-time seniority shall be measured  
on a store unit basis. Part-time employees transferred from one store to another within the  
bargaining unit shall carry with them their accumulated seniority. Seniority rights under this  
paragraph shall continue for a period not exceeding ninety (90) consecutive calendar days from the  
day of layoff.  
in the event of a store closing, part-time seniority shall prevail within classification and job assignment  
within a District Manager's area, provided the employee is qualified and available to work the hours of  
the least senior employee replaced.  
Before new full-time are hired on the day shift, all full-time employees who have worked  
one (1) year or more on the Night Shift and request a transfer to the day shift will be granted said  
transfer, if the following conditions shall be available. The Employer and the Union shall establish a  
list of full-time night workers who desire transfer to the day shift. The Employer and the Union shall  
develop a system for such transfer based upon length of service on the Night Shift.

Employer and made avaiiabie to the Union. On demotion, pursuant to section (J) above of a Meat  
Department Head, he shall be returned to his former job as !ce Box Man or Journeyman, as the case  
may be, and slotted into the seniority list of full-time employees. Such employee shall be credited  
with service as Meat Department Head in the computation of his seniority. In all other respects this  
Article shall apply to Meat Department Head as 2 separate classification.
