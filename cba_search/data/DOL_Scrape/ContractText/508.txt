Attention: Mr. Ben Hudnall, Business Manager  
Sentlepersons:  
Pursuant to Letter Agreement 93-27 -and in accordance with Section 26.1 of the Agreement between -  
the Company-and ESC, “the parties propose as a result of negotiations the following:  
_ 1. ° Company agrees ‘to the establishment of a monthly Labor Management Committee whose a  
goals will include free and open communication, mutual respect for the legitimate needs of the  
respective parties, informal problem solving, and the promotion of harmony and efficiency to .  
‘the end that the Company, the Union and the general public may benefit.  
2. Voluntary Severance offer to all- Design and Drafting classifi cations {including EA positions)  
‘capped at 16. Cap does not include any employees who elect layoff rather than displacement  
to the field. No layoffs through September 30, 1994.- This no-layoff policy does not include  
those employees who elect severance rather that relocate to field positions.  
3. Company agrees to redeployment as. follows:  
A. Redeployment within the General Office complex will follow the principles Of Section.  
22.9 of the Agreement in so far-as possible considering the Company's operational  
requirements regarding the Engineering disciplines needed for work groups.  
B. ff redeployment of personnel ftom the San Francisco General Office Complex to remote :  
. locations is necessary, who are displaced, pursuant to the provisions of.  
Section 22.9, may elgct layoffs with severance as an altemative to relocation.  
C. Telecommunications decentralization begins immediatety upon execution of a separate  
~ Letter of Agreement whose outline is attached-as Exhibit 2.  
4. Company and Union agree to cooperate in an effort to accomplish Engineering and Drafting  
workuutilizing PG&E personnet to the fullest extent feasible within operational constraints. The  
mutual goal will be.to contract out work to accommodate peak work loads that-can't be ~  
accomplished by existing staff at the time the contract is let, for specific expertise not -  
available in house, to meet unanticipated time constraints set by clients, or if it is more cost  
effective. The parties agree that contracting will not be used for the pu rpose of dispensing  
with the services of PG&E employees.  
A. ~ Exhibit 1 is Company’ S proposal for the Buitding and. Site Unit formerly a part of ENCON  
‘Business Unit ane currently residing in bri General Services  
121  
i  
B. The parties agree to jointly develop a methodology for accurately caiculating the  
comparative costs of completing ‘projects in house vs. the utilization of contractors.  
Further, this joint ad hoc committee will review, and negotiate a clarification of the  
lanquage set forth in paragraph 12.a of the 1987 cover letter to the Agreement.  
Further, the Campany agrees to utilize-the Procedures set forth in LOA 93-7 with regard  
to the of work.  
Company and Union agree that training and maximum utilization of employee skills optimize  
productivity and performance. Company proposes to delineate the desired qualifications  
including demonstrated skills requirements for classifications and to provide ’  
training where it is needed. Union in turn recognizes that training is mandatory and  
must be willing and able to adapt to the new technologies and methods of doing  
work. Both parties agree that the employee has a role'in assuming responsibility for.his/her  
development. Company recognizes that different employees learn at different speeds, and the ~,  
importance of creating an environment that is encouraging and conducive to learning.  
PG&E Management and ESC are committed to efficiency, timeliness and quality in the work  
place. These goals are furthered by utilizing each worker to the maximum of his/her current  
abilities and making | work assignments that promote growth of those abitities.  
‘ - oN  
Current rigid jurisdictional guidelines are often impediments to the above stated goal.  
Therefore, for a six month pilot period, the parties shall institute the following system to  
promote mutual trust and cooperation in the achievement of the above stated goal. At the  
end of the pilot period, the system will be evatuated for possible improvements or may be  
abandoned if either party is dissatisfied. .  
A.. Ifa bargaining unit employee is assigned exempt duties in accordance with the sbove  
goals, the Union will neither claim jurisdiction to the assigned work, nor will the Union  
demand upgrade pay for Senior Design Engineers. Company. agrees to pay Design  
Engineers performing exempt functions upgrade pay to Sr. Design Engineer, |  
Assignment of exempt job functions to particular employees shall.be at Management's  
discretion, but will be voluntary. Employees performing such duties will not be subject  
to discipline during the pilot for work beyond their job description. Work experience  
gained during ‘the pilot will not be cited as qualifications for promotion within the  
bargaining Unit.  
  
B. ° The parties agree that the most efficient procedures may occasionally require  
performance of a minor amount of bargaining unit work to exempt engineers. Ifa  
dispute arises over the question of exempt employees doing bargaining unit work; the,  
issue will first be raised at a monthly Labor Management Meeting. The purpose of - ‘  
discussion will be to resolve the problem in light of the above stated Once the  
issue is resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, it will:no longer be subject to the -  
grievance procedure. It is anticipated that the vast majority of issues raised  
-resolved in Labor Management.  
The Ad Hoc Committee and its sub-committees will continue to work toward finding mutuat  
solutions to identified problems, and to propose methods.for accomplishing the goals set forth  
‘ in Letter of Agreement 93-27, ~Any ad hoc committees established as a result of these  
negotiations will within men charters set completion target dates.  
‘A. The Ad Hoc Committee or its subcommittee will consider classification issues, including  
the appropriate Staffing levels far lead positions.  
B. TheAd Hoc Committee or its sub-committee will review the disciplines and procedtires  
set forth in Exhibit L with the goal of revising this section to address the new operational  
and organizational structure of PG&E, ,  
122  
C. The.Ad Hoc Committee or its sub-committee will jointly.develop performance criteria.  
which will-include evaluation procedures and the consideration of performance based  
progression systems. _ 4

Bargaining Unit employees will have full responsibility for all jobs assigned. “Job assignments  
will come from Project Managers and the Design Unit Supervisor. Senior Design Engineers  
will perform professional engineering and architectural work and direct the work of others. The  
performance of exempt duties for Design Engineers will be done as needed and assigned by  
the Senior Design Engineers. Assignment of these duties must be for the substantial portion  
of a day before upgrade pay is required. The Design Unit Supervisor maintains final authority  
over the assignment of exempt duties. The Design Unit Supervisor will coordinate the  
scheduling of jobs, facilitate communications between the Project Managers and the Design  
Unit, and pertorm administrative functions.  
Because a collaborative relationship between: the Design Unit Supervisor and Bargaining Unit  
employees is critical to the success of this innovative approach, Union wil appoint 3-5  
members from the Design Unit to represent Bargaining Unit employees and assist the Design  
Unit Supervisor | in coordinating the work of the unit. Union -will also be given an avenue to °  
provide input in the selection of a Design Unit Supervisor with retaining all rights  
to selection. . ‘ ;  
.  
The long range success of this group will depend on its ability to complete projects on time  
with high technical quality at a competitive price. To assure this outcome the transition to self-  
direction must be well-planned and supported with appropriate technical training and  
equipment. The coordination committge established in Paragraph 3b will work with the  
Design Unit Supervisor to jointly develop recommendations on required training and  
equipment and will assist in its scheduling and implementation.  
‘In calculating the cost of work performed by the Design Unit, fully loaded costs will be used. -  
‘ Fully loaded costs include nonproductive and nonbillable time, overtime, benefits, employee  
expenses, space and equipment costs and Corporate overheads and indirects specific tothe ,  
Design Unit. The cost of start-up training and equipment provided in 1994 be included .  
in calculations of the Design Unit's cost-effectiveness. Company and Union will jointly agree  
ona methodology for calculating the Design Unit's comparative costs.  
To benchmark the competitiveness of the Design Unit, J of the work included in the scope  
_ of Paragraph 2a will be contracted out on an ongoing basis for the term of the general  
Agreement between the Company and ESC. At the end of the four year term, this procedure  
will be reviewed by both parties and mutual agreement will be needed to continue. This  
contracting will be done to ensure that projects similar in scope to those regularly performed  
by the Design Unit are used to gather benchmark information. The Company will not be  
to offer overtime before contracting this work. Company wili consult with the Union  
. concerning the selection of contracts to be benchmarked. Further, Company will not layoff for -  
_ Jack of work while contracting Design Unit work for benchmarking purposes.  
Former Building and Site work not within the scope of Paragraph 2a may be contracted out  
with no requirement for the Company to offer overtime to the Design Unit provided that the  
employees are fully utilized on 2a work. Before contracting out 2a work, overtime wil! be  
offered in accordance with the provisions of the contract. :  
Union recognizes that large contracts or contracts for work outside the scope if 2a and 2b  
may include some portion of 2a and 2b work. Company will not be required to extract that .  
work or offer overtime. ;  
Decisions to contract out work within the scope of Paragraph 2a will be made i in conjunction  
with the coordination committee established in Paragraph 3b, except in case of an .  
emergency. The mutual! goal will be to contract out work within the scope of Paragraph 2a.  
only to accommodate peak work loads that can't be accomplished by existing staff at the time  
the contract is jet, for specific expertise not available in-house, to meet unanticipated time -

purpose of with PG&E employees.  
lf work within the scope of Parag raph 2a is contracted out for any reason the Union steward  
_ will be notified, given a.copy of the contract and the reason it was let. Company and Union  
will work cooperatively to a common understanding of the appropriate use of  
contracting. :  
-  
Except as otherwise provided in this Exhibit, contracting and offering overtime for the Design-  
Unit shalt follow the provisions of the General Contract between PG&E and the ESC and any  
additions or modifications of that Agreement that have been or will be negotiated between the  
‘parties. | . ,  
'  
In the event of a lack of work within the scope of Paragraph 2b, Bargaining Unit  
| employees of the Design Unit will be assigned former BSEC work outside the defined scope  
or assigned work normally performed by other design groups for which they are qualified, or  
temporarily assigned to another design group. These assignments will only be made if the  
receiving department has a need. Such temporary assignments are not intended to result in  
the contracting out of work within the scope of Paragraph 2a and 2b. If however, employees  
are committed fo other work projects or on loan to ather design units, they will be considered  
unavailable for 2a and 2b work for the period of that commitment. In the event work within 2a  
or 2b scope is available during: this-time, Company may contract'without having to recall those  
employees currently committed. It is not Company's intent to contract out large portions of -  
work during this time and exacerbate the reduced workload upon the return of loaned  
employees.  
Compahy and Union will annually review the success of the Design Unit, inciuding cost-  
effectiveness, technical quality of the work performed and client satisfaction. Either party may  
suggest improvements or changes to improve the Design Unit's competitiveness.  
Th rough labor management cooperative efforts, Company and Union will work together to  
resolve issues involving the self managed work group. The grievance process will only be  
utilized for self-directed work unit issues that can not through these efforts.

| result in atleast a 2-42 percent wage increase,  
| E. days from the effective date of this Agresment, Service Planners will be reclassified  
‘as gas or ‘electric Engineering Estimators.  
F. Service Planner duties described in LOA 96-21-ESC are included i in the Estimator  
classification and have been incorporated in the revised Estimator/Senior/ADE job duties as  
Exhibit |." These duties, underscored in Exhibit 1, may be assigned to all classifications within  
the Estimator line of progression, ETP modules 1 and 2 are available to help employees  
develop basic estimating Skills { in opposite commodity work.  
G. Itis the intent of this Agreement.that progression through the ETP Modules and associated  
On-the-Job training be continuous.: Delays in program progression initiated by the trainee  
may im pact future wage treatment and/or status in the Estimating line of  
‘progression.  
' a  
H. The ETP Program Administrator may implement appropriate prog ram controls and systems to  
assure effective administration and protect the integrity of the training program: The ETP Ad

New Wage Schedule : .  
An-Estimator wage schedule is enclosed as Exhibit ll. The current Estimator wage range will be  
eliminated and the new wage schedule shall be effective the first of the month following the  
signing of this Agreement. Instructions for converting current Estimators and Service Planners to  
‘the new wage schedule are contained in Exhibit tH.  
f  
Wage & Training Progression:  
A.  
,  
New hires entering ETP shall be placed at the beginning wage step of Estimator and  
begin the training with Module 1. Requests for exceptions will be referred to the ETP Ad  
Hoc Committee.  
a  
Employees enteri ng the ETP are expected to immediately begin the training program,  
starting with Module 1. These employees will progress in accordance with the provisions -  
_ of this Agreement {at six month intervals), Upon successful completion of the training  
program these employees will progress to the Senior Estimator classification.  
When an employee successfully completes a module: his/her wage rate will be increased  
the next workday to the appropriate-wage step, Dut.no than six months nam the  
start of the module or the last progressive wage increase. |  
Progression ‘shall be edntingent on the successful completion of each module until the  
employee completes.the final ETP module. The employee will then progress to Senior  
Engineering Estimator at the appropriate wage step. The effective date will be either the  
next workday, or six months from the start of the final module; whichever comes later.  
Promotion dates for employees entitted to accelerate may be as S early) as 4.5 months from  
Start of the final module.  
An employee entering the ‘Estimator classification with a wage rate above the. beginning |  
step of Estimator may retain that rate as long as it does not.excéed the 12-month step of  
Senior Engineering Estimator. (f above the latter, the wage rate will be reduced to the 12-  
month step of Senior Engineering Estimator. The employee will receive no further  
‘increases (except for general wage increases) untit progressing to a module with a wage  
step higher than his/her own. Upon successful completion of the training program, the .  
employee will progress to Senior Estimator and paid in accordance with Section 15.4 (a}  
(1} of the Agreement. ~  
-For employees with 1997 of earlier Estimator or Service Planner classification dates, the  
ETP Ad Hoc Committee Decision (Exhibit V} provides additional guidance on progression.  
  
Unsatisfactory Progress  
A. Unless the employee has “incumbent” status, those who fal to successfully complete any.  
module shalt . .  
» be notified of inadequate performance in writing prior to the date the trainee would be  
scheduled to receive the next higher wage step,

For Lack Of Work” ) of the Agreement if the module is not successfully completed . -  
within the 90 day period.. |  
‘B. Employees who havé been removed from the program may hot re-enter ETP in the same  
Commodity without the approval of the ETP Ad Hoc Committee. If they have not already  
passed the EFI Technical Test Battery, they must meet that test standard before entering  
an Estimator position in another line of progression/commodity.- Failure to meet the EEI  
test standard will not preclude employees as defined in Section 3. 2 of the Agreement,  
from entering non-estimating classifications such as Mapper.

CL. The process for “Incumbents” (Estimators of record as of October 2, 1992) and former.  
Service Planners covered by LA 96-21-ESC differs from the foregoing guidelines. Exhibit  
iV describes the procedure for addressing unsatisfactory progress for ihese em ployees.  
All other provisions of 96-21-ESC not mod ified by this agreement or the ETP Ad Hoc Committee  
Decision, (Exhibit V), will remain in effect. This agreement may'be amended by mutual  
agreement of the ETP Ad Hoc Committee?
