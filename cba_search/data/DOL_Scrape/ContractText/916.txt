This hiring procedure agreement is entered  
into between

Local Union No. 181, International Union of Op-

Union, in order to provide the Employer with a  
means of securing an efficient and competent  
working force on a nondiscriminatory basis, and  
9  
in order to minimize casual employment by se-  
curing a fair distribution of work among the work- |  
ers represented by the Union. To these ends the  
Employer and the Union agree as follows:  
1. The Employer shall give the Union twenty-  
four (24) hours’ notice of its need for workers,  
and within such 24 hour period shall not hire  
persons not referred by the Union. If, however,  
the Union fails to refer workers within such 24  
hour period after having been notified to do so,  
the Employer shall have the right to hire per-  
sons not referred by the Union.  
2. In notifying the Union of its need for work-  
ers, the Employer shall specify to the Union {a)  
the number of workers required, (b) the location  
of the project, (c) the nature and type of con-  
struction involved, (d} the work to be performed,  
and (e) such other information as may be’nec-  
essary to enable the Union to make proper re-  
ferral of applicants.  
3. The Employer shall have the right to de-  
termine the competency and qualifications of the  
empioyee referred by the Union, and the right to  
hire or not hire accordingly.  
4. The selection of applicants for referral to  
jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and  
10  
shall not be based on, or in any way affected by  
Union membership, bylaws, rules, regulations,  
constitutional provisions or any other aspect or  
obligation of union membership, policies or re-  
quirements.  
5. The Union shall register and refer all ap-  
plicants for employment on the basis of the pri-  
ority groups listed below. Each applicant shall  
be registered in the highest priority group for  
which he or she qualifies.  
### GROUP A  
All applicants who have worked as Operat-  
ing Engineers for the past four (4) years; have  
been employed for an aggregate time of at least  
one (1) year during the last four (4) years by  
employers who are parties to the Collective Bar-  
gaining Agreements with the Union, not contain-  
ing discriminatory referral provisions; and who  
have maintained residence for the past year  
within the geographical area constituting the  
normal construction labor market as hereinafter  
defined.  
### GROUP B  
All applicants for employment who have  
worked as Operating Engineers for the past four  
11  
(4) years and have been employed for an ag-  
gregate time of at least six (6) months during  
the last four (4) years by employers who are  
parties to Collective Bargaining Agreements with  
the union, not containing discriminatory referral  
provisions.  
### GROUP C  
All applicants for employment who have  
worked as Operating Engineers for the past two  
(2) years and who have maintained residence  
for the past year within the geographical area  
constituting the normal construction labor mar-  
ket, hereinafter defined.  
### GROUP D  
All applicants for employment who have  
worked as Operating Engineers for one (1) year.  
### GROUP E  
Alt other applicants for employment.  
6. The Union shall maintain a separate list  
for each of the five Groups set forth above, and  
shall tist the applicants within each Group in the  
order in which they register as available for em-  
ployment.  
12  
7. In referring applicants to the Employer,  
the Union shall first refer applicants in Group A  
in the order of their places on the list, and then  
refer applicants in the same manner succes-  
sively from the lists for Groups B, C, etc. Any  
applicant who is rejected by the Employer shall  
be restored to his place on the list for his Group.  
When a registrant is referred for employment and  
is actually employed on a job for more than five  
(5) days, such name shall be re-  
moved from the list. When his employment ter-  
minates he shall be registered at the bottom of  
the appropriate Group list on which he is en-  
titled to be registered. If a registrant, upon being  
referred for employment in regular order, refuses  
to accept the employment, such  
name shall be placed at the bottom of the Group  
list on which he is registered.  
8. Re-registrations for referral shall be ac-  
cepted by the Union at any time during its cus-  
tomary office hours. New registrations shall be  
accepted by the Union at least once each week  
during office hours. Reasonable notice of new  
registration periods shall be posted by the Union  
in the union office and in any other place where  
notices to employees and applicants for employ-  
ment are customarily posted.  
13  
9. The Union will use its best efforts to no-  
tify an applicant for referral when such applicant  
is to be referred to a job pursuant to the request  
of the employer but assumes no obligation or  
responsibility for failure to locate such applicant.  
10. The priorities of referral set forth in para-  
graph 5 above shall be followed except that in  
cases where the Employer requires and calls  
for employees possessing special skills and  
abilities, the Union shall pass over any appli-  
cants on the register not possessing such spe-  
cials skills and abilities.  
*The Employer shall request only men who  
are registered out of work in Group A only, and  
they shall have been a former employee who has  
worked for the requesting Employer in the past  
year in the geographical area. All requests shail  
be in writing. Applicant must have been on the  
referral register at least five (5) days before em-  
oloyee can be requested by the Employer. If an  
employee is called back to the same Employer  
within five (5) working days, such employment shali  
be considered continuous and shall  
be counted as such. In cases where the union does  
not have twenty-four (24) or more hours to fill an  
order for referral for a few-day job (5 or less days)  
the Union may pass over applicants on the regis-  
ter in order to promptly fill the order.  
14  
11. The Union shall require all job applicants  
who have not previously registered to submit a  
resume of experience and qualifications.  
12. In the event any job applicant is ag-  
grieved with respect to the functioning of this  
hiring agreement, he may, within ten (10) days  
following the occurrence of the event which con-  
stitutes the basis for the grievance, file with the  
person in charge of registration and referral a  
written statement of the grievance clearly and  
specifically setting forth the wrong or violation  
charged. An Appellate Tribunal consisting of an  
Employer-Representative, a Union-Representa-  
tive and an impartial Chairman appointed jointly  
by the Employer and Union, shall consider such  
grievance and render decisions which shall be  
binding. The Appellate Tribunal is authorized to  
issue procedural rules for the conduct of its busi-  
ness, but is not authorized to add to, subtract  
from, or modify any of the provisions of this  
Agreement and its decision shall be in accord  
with the Agreement.  
13. The Union and the Employer shai! post
