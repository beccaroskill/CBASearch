ing schedules must be established by the Company and  
may from time to time be changed to meet changing condi-  
tions.  
B. Normal work schedules will be established by the Com-  
pany and posted for each employee or group of employees.

ployee who is off duty. When notification of such  
substitution occurs after the beginning of a work  
week in which the substitution is to occur, only the  
working hours of the substituting employee’s W-  
days will be changed for that work week. If the  
substitution extends beyond the end of the work  
week, or if the substitution starts at the beginning  
of a work week, the schedule of the substituting  
employee will be the normal work schedule of the  
relieved employee.  
When it is necessary to carry out work which must  
be done outside normal working hours, such as  
work on equipment which cannot be made avail-  
able during normal working hours, and work in two

ing hours of the W-days may be changed; (b) the  
ST-days will not be changed; (c) temporary sched-  
ules will be prepared and posted at the Headquar-

and (b) of this Paragraph A (2) shall not be appili-  
cable to employees involved in equipment outages  
that have a direct effect on the operating capacity  
of power generating stations.  
(3) When an employee is scheduled to attend a for-  
mal training school or other Company training pro-  
grams. In-these cases, both the W-days and ST-  
days will be changed to conform with the training

ule may be returned to his normal work schedule at any  
time. Lunch periods established for such schedules shall

Hours worked on the first W-day of a changed shift  
schedule providing a substitution for an employee  
off duty, which had not been scheduled for the sub-  
-Stituting employee prior to quitting time on the last  
W-day of the work week preceding the substitu-  
tion. This applies only to the first such change in  
any work week. For the purpose of this Paragraph,  
such changed shift schedule is one which involves  
a change from one shift to another—day shift to  
middle or night shift, etc., and does not include  
either a change involving only different hours in  
the same shift or a return from a temporary shift  
schedule to a regular shift schedule.

ally worked, which would have been scheduled  
for the employee if it were a W-day or which were  
scheduled for the employee for whom he is  
substituting, will be paid for at:  
(a) Double and one-half time, when it is the  
second ST-day in a work week.

### Section 5. Rest Periods  
A Rest periods shall be applicable in accordance with  
the following provisions when employees are called out or  
when arrangements are made in advance for work during  
non-scheduled hours provided employees are eligible as  
defined in the “Rest Period Rules” of Exhibit B of this Agree-  
ment.  
B. Employees working for a period that consists of at least  
three (3) overtime hours, and up to sixteen (16) consecutive  
overtime hours, shall be entitled, when relieved from duty,  
to a rest period as shown on the table in Exhibit B. If sched-  
uled hours fall within the time designated as a rest period,  
the employee will be paid straight time pay for these sched-  
uled hours. Employees required to work during scheduled  
hours that fall within the prescribed rest period, will receive  
pay at time and one-half the employee’s straight time rate  
for such hours worked.  
C. Employees working sixteen (16) or more consecutive  
hours shail be entitled, when relieved from duty, to an eight  
(8)-hour rest period or a rest period as shown on the rest  
period table, whichever is greater, without loss of straight  
time pay for scheduled hours falling within the rest period.  
However, employees required to work during this period will  
be paid two times the straight time rate for any hours worked  
within eight (8) hours after being released from the previous  
work period and their rest period will be calculated using  
the twelve (12)-hour cumulative rule as provided for in Ex-  
hibit B.  
D. The intent of rest periods is for employees to be re-  
leased from work when they have worked sufficient over-  
time hours to become eligible for a rest period. If an em-  
ployee requests to be released on rest period, their request  
shail be granted unless there is an emergency or the com-  
pany is unable to obtain relief, when necessary.  
20  
Articte I\¥ — Sec. 5-7  
E The rest period table as described in Paragraphs B  
and C of this Section 5 is not applicable to vacation days,  
holidays, paid personal time off and ST-days.  
Section 6. Exempt - Non-Exempt Employees  
A. Both parties recognize that certain employees cov-  
ered by this Agreement are in jobs which are exempt from  
the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and that em-  
ployees may be hired or transferred to new jobs which will  
likewise be exempt. In order to meet the requirements of  
the Act, the Company will continue to classify all employees  
as exempt or non-exempt.  
B. Some of the jobs may be of such nature that the work  
cannot be scheduled to conform to a definite schedule (such  
as a forty (40)-hour week or five (5) eight (8)-hour days) and  
that, therefore, the overtime provisions of this Agreement  
may not be applicable to these jobs.  
C. It is agreed that for any new jobs in which there are  
employees eligible for Union membership, the Union and  
Company will jointly determine whether the work is of this  
nature.  
Section 7. Residence Requirement

Company will maintain at the respective Headquarters a  
roster of certain employees likely to be called and will select  
from these lists on a rotating or cumulative overtime basis  
as applicable such available employees as are needed. The  
purpose of this arrangement is to provide an equitable dis-  
tribution of overtime work when required. Being subject to  
call-out is not to be considered as hours of work and no  
additional compensation will be paid to cover this respon-  
sibility. The Company will maintain records of overtime

comes impossible to secure qualified replacements.

scheduled working hours of a W-day and the minimum time  
period overlaps his scheduled hours.

### ARTICLE V  
### SENIORITY  
Section 1. New Employees  
A. Seniority will be credited to an employee only after six  
(6) months of continuous employment but shall include this  
first six (6) months’ period. During this six (6)-month period,  
the employee shall be considered probationary and the Com-  
pany shall have the sole and exclusive right to discharge  
such employee and Article Ill of the Agreement shall not  
apply.  
Section 2. Promotions — Transfers — Demotions  
A. The Company will give preference to the employee  
with seniority when fitness and ability among employees are  
substantially equal in considering them for the purpose of  
promotion, transfer or demotion.  
B. For such purposes, employees in an established line  
of progression (such as operating jobs within a power plant,  
jobs within a coal gang, and line workers systemwide) will  
be considered before those not in that line of progression.  
C. When non-supervisory employees covered by this  
Agreement are placed in supervisory jobs, their seniority,  
for this purpose, will be determined by the following:  
27  
eee  
Article V — Sec. 2  
(1) Temporary  
(a) Non-supervisory employees who are promoted  
(b  
~~  
to supervisory positions when there is a tem-  
porary increase in work load: when additional  
temporary supervisory manpower is essential;  
or when other comparable situations arise  
have a right to return to their former job classi-  
fication at their former work location for a pe-  
riod of six (6) months following their promo-  
tion; however, the employee will not accrue  
1600 or job seniority for time spent as a Su  
pervisor and they will not pay Union dues or  
remain on the call-out roster. In this situation,  
1600 or job seniority will not be a criteria for  
selection. In order to maintain rights in their  
former Union job, they must be returned to non-  
supervisory status within six (6) months of the  
temporary promotion. If they return after the  
six (6)-month period, they will be placed in an  
entry level position and for 1600 or job senior-  
ity purposes will only be considered to be  
ahead of other employees with less than Six  
(6) months of Company Service. It is further  
understood that the utilization of this provision  
is not intended to provide temporary supervi-  
sors on a continual basis to circumvent the  
creation of permanent supervisors.  
Non-supervisory employees temporarily pro-  
moted to supervisory positions as replace-  
ments for supervisors who are off duty wil! be  
selected basically by job seniority at the work  
location provided fitness and ability are sub-  
stantially equal. In this situation the employee  
will continue to accrue job Seniority, pay Union  
28  
Article V — Sec. 2  
dues, and remain on the call-out roster. Pay  
treatment will be in accordance with Article VI,  
### Section 4, Paragraph A of this Agreement.  
(2) Permanent  
(a) Non-supervisory employees who are promoted  
to supervisory positions have a right to return  
to their former job classification at their former  
work location for a period of twelve (12) months  
following their promotion. However, the em-  
ployee will not accrue 1600 or job seniority for  
the time spent as a supervisor and they will  
not pay Union dues or remain on the call-out  
roster. in order to maintain rights in their former  
Union job, they must be returned to non-su-  
pervisory status within twelve (12} months of  
the promotion. If they return after the twelve  
(12)-month period, they will be placed in an  
entry level position and for 1600 seniority pur-  
poses will only be considered to be ahead of  
other employees with less than:six (6) months  
of Company Service.  
(b) When former non-supervisory employees  
have held a supervisory position for twelve (12)  
months or longer and are returned to non-su-  
pervisory jobs, for disability reasons only, they  
will be placed in such a manner as to be able  
to perform meaningful work without adversely  
affecting the job seniority or overtime of em-  
ployees in that line of progression. These  
cases will be referred to the Disability Com-  
mittee for resolution.  
D. (1) A transfer in this Paragraph D is defined as a  
change from one job to another in the same job  
classification and progression line.  
29  
Article V — Sec. 2  
(2) Employees cannot transfer to a job in the same  
progression line or change jobs to other progres-  
sion lines during the first six (6) months of em-  
ployment. Employees will be considered for pro-  
motions in their line of progression during the first  
six (6) months of employment based on their abil-  
ity and job seniority. For posted job vacancies,  
employees with less than six (6) months’ Com-  
pany Service may submit job bidding forms. How-  
ever, only employees who have attained six (6)  
months’ Company Service must be given consid-  
eration for the posted job.  
(3) Transfer requests shall be made in writing by  
(4  
  
the employee before a vacancy exists and em-  
ployees shall forward a copy to the Local Union  
Business Office. For seniority purposes, employ-  
ees requesting a transfer will be considered on  
the basis of their job seniority in comparison to  
the job seniority of employees in the next lower  
job classification in the progression line. Trans-  
ferred employees will retain their job seniority  
date for promotional purposes only.  
Employees with more than six (6) months Com-  
pany Service voluntarily requesting a transfer  
within the same job classification and same pro-  
gression line are restricted to one (1) transfer ev-  
ery five (5) years for each job classification. This  
applies to all job classifications and all pro-  
gression lines. No transfer requests will be al-  
lowed across progression lines.  
An employee who was displaced and obtains a  
iob at a different facility within their  
progression line will have no tiie limits for hon-  
oring transfer letters as long as they are  
30

Se  
Article V — Sec. 2  
attempting to return to the facility they were  
originally displaced from. This would also ap-  
ply if they were attempting to return to any  
closer facility within their progression line. For  
example, if an employee was displaced from a  
job at the Harrisburg SC, and obtained a job in  
the placement process at the Newport SC, he  
would be allowed to submit transfer requests  
to either West Shore SC or Harrisburg SC with-  
out the five (5)-year restriction.  
Employees in the Office Jobs Concept with more  
than six (6) months Company Service requesting  
to change jobs to other progression lines must  
enter those progression lines at bottom entry level  
jobs. For seniority purposes, employees chang-  
ing jobs to other progression lines will receive a  
new job seniority date effective the start of the  
first pay period after notification of selection.  
Employees with more than six {6} months Com-  
pany Service transferring on posted job vacan-  
cies will not be restricted to the one (1) transfer  
rule. For seniority purposes, employees transfer-  
ring on a posted job vacancy within the same pro-  
gression line will retain their original job seniority  
date. Employees who change jobs to other pro-  
gression lines as a result of bidding on a posted  
job vacancy will receive a new job seniority date  
effective the start of the first pay period after noti-  
fication of selection.  
Voluntary return rights within the first six (6} months  
of a job change shall be restricted to progression  
line promotions and posted jobs. Employees who  
accept a posted position at a location and vol-  
untarily return during their probationary period  
31  
Article V — Sec. 2  
will not be permitted to rebid the same job clas-  
sification at that location for four (4) years.  
(8) Employees entering Apprenticeship Programs on  
or after August 2, 1982 are restricted from bid-  
ding into other Apprenticeship Programs after the  
six (6)-month probationary period has been  
completed.  
E. The Company may administer tests for determining  
the aptitudes of employees being considered for entry level  
positions and for entry into formal training programs. After  
suitable training, tests of achievement and ability may be  
administered for the purpose of determining qualifications  
for progression within formal training programs, and to com-  
ply with governmental regulations.  
Employees will not be required to successfully complete  
tests to retain a job classification unless periodic testing is  
specifically required as a part of a formal training program  
or by governmental regulations. If an employee success-  
fully performs a job for six (6) months within the past five  
(5) years without having taken the appropriate entry test(s),  
this test(s) will be waived for this employee.  
Employees who fail a minimum entry test two (2) times  
will be restricted from re-testing for a period of six (6)  
months from the date of the second test. If the employee  
can show the Company that they have made efforts to  
improve their skills, the six (6) month restriction will be  
waived.  
Employees who meet or exceed test cut-off scores will  
be considered to have passed the test on an equal basis,  
and will be considered for job openings in accordance with  
Article V, Section 2, Paragraph A of the Labor Agreement.  
The confidentiality of all tests shall be preserved and  
actual test questions, employee answer sheets and indi-  
vidual test scores will not be released by the Company.  
32  
Article V — Sec. 2  
The Company will review actual test questions and results  
with employees upon request, for ail skill assessment tests  
for purposes of identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
Upon request the-Company will continue its practice of  
reviewing the :areas of strengths and weaknesses related  
to aptitude’ tests: with employees.  
lf a question arises regarding test administration or the  
validity of a test relative to the job in question, it may be  
submitted through the Grievance Procedure of Article Ill for  
resolution. It is further understood that tests and agreements  
on testing reached prior to August 2, 1982 will remain in  
effect and for the purpose of filling job vacancies, the Com-  
pany may administer tests to determine job qualifications,  
which will be discussed with the Union prior to implementa-  
tion. Any resulting disputes may be submitted through the  
Grievance Procedure.  
If an employee voluntarily quits, or was discharged  
for cause, and is rehired, he will not receive credit for his .  
previous period of Company Service. If an employee is re-  
employed within two (2) years after layoff, he will receive  
credit for Company Service and 1600 Seniority, but will be  
given a new job seniority date.  
G. Seniority will not be considered when it is necessary  
fo rearrange temporarily an employee’s duties to meet an  
emergency.  
H. The Company will notify the Local Union President  
before the effective date of any promotion, transfer, demo-  
tion or lay off. If a disagreement arises concerning the  
decision involving fitness, ability and/or senior-  
ity, such disagreement may be submitted under Articte [I] of  
this Agreement.  
l The Company will provide the Union with monthly  
compuier updates of employee information as agreed to in  
the Memorandum of Agreement signed April 6, 1987.  
33  
Article V — Sec. 2  
J. If an employee, selected to fill a job vacancy, is de-  
layed in reporting to such job because the Company is un-  
able to release him, he will be credited with seniority from  
the start of the first pay period after the notification of his  
selection. {f the new job represents a promotion for the-em-  
ployee, the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit  
two (2) pay periods following the start of seniority credit,  
and will be considered on probation for a period of six (6)  
months from the day the employee reports to the new job.  
In the event the new job represents a transfer or demotion,  
the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit and  
begin the six (6) months probationary period at the time the  
employee actually reports fo the new job.  
K. Voluntary and involuntary job changes shall be handled  
as follows:  
(1) When employees voluntarily or involuntarily  
demote in the same line of progression during the  
- six (6) months’ probationary period, they will de-  
mote to their former job classification at their former  
work location. They will receive job seniority in the  
lower classification for all time spent in the higher  
classification. Employees voluntarily or involun-  
tarily returning from a job in another line of pro-  
gression during the six (6) months’ probationary  
period will return to the job classification at the work  
location where they last satisfactorily completed  
their probationary period. Employees voluntarily  
returning will receive no seniority credit in the job  
they return to for the time spent in the other pro-  
gression line. However, seniority credit will be re-  
sumed starting with the first pay period after re-  
ceipt of their written request to return. Employees  
invoiuniarily returming will receive seniority credit  
in the job they return to for the time spent in the  
other progression line.  
34  
Article V — Sec. 2  
(2) When employees involuntarily demote in their pro-  
(3  
~~  
——  
gression line after the six (6) months’ probation-  
ary period for reasons other than displacements,  
they will return to the next lower job classification  
they are capable of performing satisfactorily, which  
may result in subsequent promotions for other  
employees in the line of Progression, unless a  
vacancy exists in the lower classification. Employ-  
ees will receive job seniority credit in the lower job  
Classification for the time spent in the higher clas-  
sification.  
When it is necessary to involuntarily return em-  
ployees to jobs outside their Progression line after  
the six (6) months’ probationary period, consider-  
ation will be given to the employee's previous Com-  
pany Service and experience. New seniority date  
for progression line and/or department service  
shall be established effective the date of the  
return. If such employees are returned  
to the job they previously held because a non-su-  
pervisory employee promoted to a supervisory  
position and subsequently returns within twelve  
(12) months of that promotion, the returned em-  
ployee will receive seniority credit in the job they  
return to for the time spent in the other progres-  
sion line.  
To demote voluntarily after the six (6) months’ pro-  
bationary period, employees May request to be  
placed in a vacancy in a lower job classification in  
the progression line they held, un-  
less the lower job was not in the progression line  
when the employee promoted to the higher job. in  
this instance, the employee can demote to a posi-  
tion they did not hold. if a vacancy is not available  
35  
L. Po  
When  
Article V — Sec. 2  
and it is possible to demote the employee to a job  
classification he satisfactorily held in the progres-  
sion line through subsequent promotions in the  
progression line, with the approval of the Com-  
pany and Local Union Office, such a move may be  
initiated. For job seniority purposes, the employee  
will receive no seniority credit in the lower classifi-  
cation for time spent.in the higher classification.  
However, if the employee subsequently promotes  
to the higher classification, he will be credited with  
the time previously held in the higher classifica-  
tion.  
When a vacancy occurs within a progression line  
and employee requests for demotion and/or trans-  
fer are on record prior to the vacancy, they will be  
considered along with promotional candidates.  
Employees shall forward a copy of the demotion  
or transfer request to the Local Union Business  
Office. For seniority purposes, the consideration  
order will be determined by comparing their job  
seniority in their respective job classifications. The  
employee with the greatest job seniority date will  
receive first consideration.

. his supervisor and the reasons why his perfor-  
mance or progress is considered unsatisfactory

cause he has failed to meet the job requirements  
while on probation or upon completion of a tem-  
porary job, his salary rate will be reduced to the  
step he would have attained in his former job. The  
reduction in salary rate will be made immediately  
upon the employee assuming the duties of the  
lower job. The same procedure will apply when  
the demotion to his former job classification is at  
his request and for his personal advantage during  
the probationary period.

period, their salary will be reduced to the step for  
which their Company Service qualifies them or the  
next lower step rate below their present rate which-

pared on or before March 1 of that year. These schedules  
shall be considered tentative and may be modified by, or  
with the approval of, the Department Head as unforeseen  
conditions develop.  
B. These schedules shall be prepared by the Depart-  
ment Head using as a basis dates (first, second and third  
choices) selected by the employees. It shall be the respon-  
sibility of the Department Head to schedule these vacations  
throughout the entire year in order that the Company’s busi-  
ness and operation may continue in an efficient manner.  
Whenever there is a conflict in dates, it will become a matter  
to be straightened out between the employees involved. If  
this procedure fails, the Department Head will decide the  
matter, taking into consideration length of service of the em-  
ployees involved, the reasonableness of each employee's  
claim to the particular time, the settlement of similar con-  
flicts in previous years and all other pertinent factors.

ing calendar year to the same vacation period, including  
longevity allowance, to which he was entitled during the said  
current calendar year. However, an employee who initially  
during such succeeding calendar year becomes entitled to  
increased vacation or longevity allowance under Paragraph  
A of Section 1 of this Article VII, upon meeting the eligibility

of vacation pay (as defined in Section 1 C of this Article  
in of such vacation allowance equivalent to the pay which  
he would have received in respect of such vacation period

lar vacation and longevity entitlement for the current calen-  
dar year the same ratio as the number of full calendar months  
worked in the current calendar year bears to twelve (12)  
months and rounding the result to the nearest multiple of  
eight (8) hours. For the purpose of this Paragraph, an em-  
ployee whose employment terminates because of long term  
disability shall be considered as one who retires. An addi-  
tional allowance determined in the same manner will be paid  
to the person legally entitled thereto for an employee who  
dies.  
J. Except as provided in Section 3 K of this Article, vaca-  
tion allowance not taken in the calendar year during which  
the employee is entitled thereto cannot be accumulated and  
added to the vacation allowance of succeeding year or years  
unless the employee was prevented from taking his full va-  
cation allowance because of illness, injury or at supervisory  
request with mutual agreement. Unused vacation allowance  
as a result of illness or injury shall be taken as soon as it  
can be scheduled after the first full pay period following the  
return to work; and in the case of supervisory  
request, within the first three (3) months of the succeeding  
calendar year. When an employee is permitted to take such  
vacation, it shall not be considered part of the employee's  
vacation entitlement for any succeeding calendar year un-  
der the provisions of Section 3 G of this Article.  
K. An employee with a period of employment of eight (8)  
or more years, subject to the approval of the Department

calendar year in which he is entitled thereto but may elect to  
carry over vacation allowance into the succeeding calendar  
year under the following conditions:

to carry over vacation as early as possible  
in the current year ul, in no event, later than No-  
vember 1.  
(3) When an employee is permitted to take such va-  
cation, it shall not be considered part of the  
employee’s vacation entitlement for any succeed-  
ing calendar year under the provisions of Section  
3 G of this Article.  
L. (1) When an employee is off duty because of sick-  
ness or injury at the time his vacation is sched-  
uled to begin, the vacation may be rescheduled.

cation may reschedule that portion of their vaca-  
tion which was spent in the hospital, provided the  
‘hospitalization was of more than one (1) day’s  
duration and a hospital certificate containing the  
admission and release dates is submitted to the  
Company.

### ARTICLE VII  
### . GENERAL PROVISIONS |  
Section 1. Sick Pay |  
A. Sick pay allowances will be determined by multiplying  
an individual’s number of full years of Company Service  
completed, up to a maximum of thirty (30), times eighty (80)  
_ hours, and subtracting from this total the number of hours  
- allowed with pay for sickness or injury in the preceding seven  
(7) calendar years and the current year to date. The net hours  
derived from: this calculation, up to a maximum of 2400, .  
represent the number of hours that may be allowed to the  
employee for time off due to a non-occupational illness or  
injury. The day an employee becomes ill is the date from  
which the sick pay entitlement for that period of disability is  
57  
Anticte Vill — Sec. 1  
determined. Therefore, when a disabled employee crosses  
an anniversary date of Company Service or the date when  
the seven-year history under the Plan is updated, any addi-  
tional entitlement is not available for the period of disability  
_already in progress. However, the additional entitlement is  
available for future absences upon the employee’s return to  
work.  
B. To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must have  
completed’ a period of employment of six (6) months and  
have properly reported the cause of the absence in accor-  
dance with established procedures. New employees who  
complete their six (6)-month probationary period will be  
eligible to borrow forty (40) hours of sick pay from the  
eighty (80).hours that they will be entitled to after one  
year of employment.  
C. All cases of iliness or injury must be bona fide. If there  
is a question regarding the nature of the illness or injury,  
medical certification may be required. False claim for sick  
pay shail subject employees to disciplinary action.  
D. Employees are required to furnish medical certifica-  
tion of illness for all absences in excess of five (5) in a pay  
period year. Employees returning to work from the sixth oc-  
illness, and each subsequent illness within the  
year, without proper certification, shall have the period of  
absence charged to “Time Off Without Pay - No Permis-  
sion.”  
(1) Employees scheduled to work either Saturday or  
‘Sunday, who are ill on one or both of these days,  
and properly report off, shall have up to a maxi- .  
mum of forty-eight (48) hours to obtain medical  
certification for the sixth occurrence of illness and  
thereafter.  
E. Employees will be notified when they have depleted  
approximately 80% of their sick pay and employees who  
58  
Article Vill — Sec. 1  
have utilized their full sick pay allowance will be consid-  
ered for further sick pay on the earlier of the next anniver-  
sary of their Company Service date or on January 1st fol-  
lowing the adjustment of their seven (7) year history.  
F The Company will pay the difference between the  
employee's full pay and the amount paid by Workers’ Com-  
pensation for employees absent from work due to occupa-  
‘tional disease or injury. The amount of time available for  
such allowances will be calculated in the same manner as  
basic sick pay under Paragraph A above. When such allow-  
ances are exhausted, employees will receive Workers Com-  
pensation and/or Long Term Disability payments in accor-  
ance with the eligibility requirements of those programs.  
_ (1) To be eligible for such payments, employees ab-  
sent from work due to occupational injury must  
properly notify the Company of an accident before  
the end of the W-day during which it occurs, or at  
the beginning of the next W-day if the injury oc-  
curs during non-scheduled hours in the absence  
of a supervisor. Occupational! disease must be  
reported as soon as possible but no later than forty-  
eight (48) hours after the onset of the disease to  
be eligible for the payments provided in this Para-  
graph.  
G. Employees who exhaust their full allowances for ill-  
ness or injury under Paragraphs A and F above, and who  
are not on leave of absence, will be retained on Company  
records on a no-pay status for purposes of continuing eligi-  
bility for employee benefit plans for a period of time that,  
combined with the exhausted allowances, does not ex-  
ceed 26 continuous weeks of absence from work.  
H. Employees with more than one (1) year of Company  
Service who have had no time off with or without pay under the  
Payroll Codes in this Paragraph, for twenty-six (26) consecu-

their regular job after reasonable accommodations have  
been made, or when a change in jobs is indicated by local  
physicians or specialists, the case shall be referred to a joint  
committee of Union and Company representatives known  
as the Disability Committee. The Committee shall study all  
factors and giving due emphasis to the length of service,  
pay and regular job, shall place the employee as advanta-  
geously as possible into a vacant position in which the  
employee is able to perform the essentia! functions satis-  
factorily. The disabled employee being reassigned by ac-  
tion of the Disability Committee will be given preference  
over any other employees, with less 1600 Seniority, for any

mittee will have access to Sections 1, 2, 4, or 8 of Articie X to  
74

employee. The rate of pay shall be the same as that paid  
other employees in that position except as provided in Para-  
graphs B and C of this Section 10.

shall be examined by an impartial physician or specialist  
selected by the Joint Committee and paid for by the Com-  
pany. Employees will be provided meaningful work within  
their limitations and consistent with their current rate of pay  
until placement by the Committee.  
If the Committee is unable to resolve a particular issue  
brought to it within 90 calendar days after the Committee  
receives all information pertaining to the case, the employee  
will be temporarily placed in the title of “Utility Person” until  
such time as the Committee places the employee in an avail-  
able job consistent with the employee's capabilities. Place-  
ment in the “Utility Person” classification will be on an in-  
cumbent only basis. Duties assigned to such individuals will  
vary depending upon their capabilities. The rate of pay shall  
be the same as that paid other employees for comparable  
assignments except as provided in Paragraphs B and C of  
this Section 10.  
Employees in the “Utility Person” classification will be pro-  
vided on-the-job training as the circumstances justify to im-  
prove their future job prospects.  
Any unilateral placement by the Company without con-  
currence of the Committee may be submitted to arbitration  
in accordance with Article II] of the Labor Agreement.  
After having been placed in another job by the Disability  
Committee, employees with twenty (20) or more years of  
service will not be subject to further demotion, because of  
such disability, as long as they remain at work. However,  
when circumstances warrant, they may be reassigned other  
duties.

Article Vill — Sec. 10-11  
B. Employees placed in alternative positions as a re-  
sult of disability shall receive the rate of pay and all pay  
increases applicable to the job classification to which they  
are assigned. However, if such assigned job has a lower  
rate of pay than their regular job, they shall not receive a  
rate of pay less than the following percent of their regular  
rate of pay in their former job at the time of placement if they  
have a period of employment of:  
Less than 20 years- 75%  
20 or more years - 100%  
Should they recover from the disability, they may be em-  
ployed in their former job with accumulated seniority and  
other privileges if they are physically and mentally qualified  
to perform the duties required.  
C. An employee assigned to a job having a lower rate of  
pay than their regular job under this Section 10 shal! have  
their rate of pay reduced in accordance with the provisions  
of Article VI, Section 5 K (1).  
### Section 11. Extended Illness or Temporary Disability  
A. An employee who is absent due to illness or tempo-  
rary disability will accrue job seniority, 1600 Seniority, and  
Company Service during the entire period of time the em-  
ployee is absent. Refer to Exhibit L for job seniority adjust-  
ments while on Long Term Disability.  
An employee with ten (10) or.more years of Company  
Service will be eligible for any promotional opportunities that  
occur within his progression line during the entire period of  
absence. An employee with less than ten (10) years of  
Company Service will only be eligible for a promotional  
opportunity that occurs within his progression line during  
the period of time resulting from the sum of his full sick pay  
entitlement plus vacation and Personal Time Off (Mini-Va-  
cation) entitlements.  
76  
Article Vili— Sec. 114  
When a promotional opportunity occurs, the Company  
will contact the employee who is off duty to determine if he  
is interested in the vacancy. If the employee elects to pro-  
mote and is accepted, the vacancy will be filled on a tempo-  
rary basis and will be held for the employee. The employee's  
former job will then be filled on a permanent basis.  
If additional promotional opportunities occur, the em-  
ployee must again be contacted. Only one (1) job will be  
held for an employee; i.e., if he accepts a second promo-  
tion, the first one he accepted will be filled by another em-  
ployee on a permanent basis.  
When a promotion is held for an employee, the appropri-  
ate pay credit and six (6) months’ probationary period will  
begin at the time the employee actually reports to the new  
job. The employee will be credited with job seniority from  
the start of the first pay period after notification of selection.

modified duty who are not performing the primary duties of  
their job description will be postponed for a corresponding  
period. Additionally, general wage increases for employ-  
ees off duty for one pay period or more for such reasons  
will be deferred until the employee returns to full duty un-  
less the employee is on modified duty as the result of an  
on-the-job accident in which case the employee will re-  
ceive the general wage increase applicable to the job the  
employee is performing.

responsibilities or results in the elimination of a non-super-  
visory job. A supervisor shall not do the work ordinarily per-  
formed by a non-supervisory employee solely to prevent  
overtime work by a non-supervisory employee. This shall  
not prevent a supervisor from doing any type of work in an

time they will have full access to the place-  
ment process.

If Box 3 is not available, and if the displaced employee  
chooses a preferred location, canvass other preferred work

Article X — Sec. 4-7  
locations in the same progression line for volunteers in the  
same rate or classification to retire or sever. The resulting  
vacancy must be at a location in a classification desig-  
nated by the displaced employee. If a vacancy is created,  
the displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and  
the process ends.  
### OR  
Section 5. Box §  
If Box 4 is not available or no location is selected, the  
displaced employee may bump the most junior employee  
(1600 Seniority) at the next closest work location where the  
same classification exists, in the same Progression line.  
### OR  
Section 6. Box 6  
At the same location, the displaced empioyee may roll-  
back to next lower job in their Progression line and bump  
the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classifica-  
tion at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who de-  
cline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay ta-  
péered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is available,  
but the employee declines and chooses to go to Box 8, the  
employee loses red-tag rate of pay. If this option is not  
available, go to Box 7 with 100% red-tag.  
Section 7. Box 7  
At the next closest work location where lower jobs exist  
in the progression line, the displaced employee may roll-  
back to the next lower job in their progression line that the  
displaced employee’s 1600 Seniority will allow and bump  
the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classifi-  
cation at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who  
decline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay  
tapered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is not  
89  
Article X — Sec. 7-8  
available or not selected, the employee moves to Box 8  
with a 100% red-tag rate of pay.  
Section 8. Box 8  
Canvass all employees for volunteers to retire or sever.  
From this list, the displaced employee can select up to 5  
progression lines designating job classifications and loca-  
tions they are willing to accept. If a vacancy is created, the  
displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and the  
process ends.  
A. Step 1 - In determining eligibility compare the dis-  
placed employee’s 1600 Seniority to the 1600  
Seniority of the employee in the progression line  
who would be eligible to promote to the vacancy  
created by the volunteer. If the displaced employee  
has the 1600 Seniority and qualifications, they take  
the vacancy and allow the volunteer to leave.  
B. Step 2 - If the displaced employee does not have  
the 1600 Seniority and qualifications to fill the job  
of the volunteer, and has designated the next lower  
job as one of their preferences, fill the vacancy  
through a progression line promotion and then  
compare the 1600 Seniority of the displaced em-  
ployee to the 1600 Seniority of the employee in  
the progression line who would be eligible to pro-  
mote to the resulting vacancy. !f the displaced  
employee has the 1600 Seniority and qualifica-  
_ tions, they take the vacancy and allow the volun-  
teer to leave.  
C. Step 3 - If necessary, continue this process until  
the displaced employee fits somewhere in the pro-  
gression line where there is a volunteer holding a  
job designated by the employee.  
90  
Article X — Sec. 8-10  
If the displaced employee cannot fit into any des-  
ignated job in the progression line, then there is  
no appropriate vacancy created and therefore the  
volunteer cannot leave. |  
(1) If Box 6 is available and the employee  
elects to go to Box 9, there will be no red-  
tag rate of pay.  
(2) If Boxes 6, 7, or 8 are unavailable or no  
selection is made in Box 7 or no progres-  
sion line selected in Box 8, the employee  
can select from Box 9 at 100% red-tag.  
### OR  
Section 9. Box 9  
If the employee is not handled in Box 8, he then moves to  
Box 9 selecting a bumpable level job (B-04 and below) by  
1600 Seniority or moves to Box 10.  
A. |fBox 6 is available and the employee elects to go  
to Box 10, the employee will assume the rate of  
the selected job through the pay tapering process.  
B. If Box 7 is unavailable or no location was selected, or  
if Box 8 was unavailable or no progression line se-  
lected or no job was selected in Box 9, the employee  
moves to Box 10 with 100% red-tag rate of pay.  
### OR  
Section 10. Box 10  
Bump LIFO* employee based on 1600 Seniority and  
qualifications. The Union will handle employees in Box 10  
within 30 days of the date the last displaced employee  
reaches Box 10. Employees displaced after the 30-day clock  
starts, if eligible, can go through Boxes 1 to 9 and wait until  
the current employees in Box 10 are handled. Both parties  
agree to cooperate in the administration of this process. All  
employees’ pay and expenses will be paid in accordance  
91  
Article X — Sec,10—11  
with the labor agreement. Employees not handled in Box  
10, and who are eligible for a company offer as defined  
below, will move to Box 11. |  
Section 11. Box 11  
Except as provided in this section, no regular, full-time  
employee hired prior to May 18, 1998 who has attained ten  
(10) or more years of 1600 Seniority, or hired after May 18,  
14998 who has attained fifteen (15) or more years of 1600  
Seniority, shall be laid off because of a reduction, elimina-  
tion or reassignment of work, unless the employee has ex-  
ercised all of his rights under the placement process. In the  
event of such a reduction, elimination or reassignment of  
work, the employee will have access to the placement pro-  
cess stated above with pay protection signified by the term  
“red-tag”. If the employee utilizes the placement process  
without securing a job, the company will select for the af-  
fected employee a job, which may then be available any-  
where within the bargaining unit. If the employee selects  
this offer, their pay will be red-tagged unless previously lost  
in the placement process. In making such selection, the  
Company will consider the qualifications of the employee,  
his residence, his potential for training and contribution to  
company efforts now and in the future and his 1600 Senior-  
ity and that of other employees affected. Moving expenses  
will be paid by the company in accordance with Article Vill,  
Section 13. Company offers under this paragraph shall not  
be subject to Article Ill of the labor agreement.

### Section 12. Notes  
A. If the employee is bumped in Boxes 3 to 9, go to  
Paragraph A for processing.  
B. If the empioyee is bumped in Box 10 (LIFO em-  
ployee), the employee can bump only those with  
less 1600 Seniority than he has.  
C. A displaced or bumped employee can elect en-  
hanced severance/layoff/retirement at any step of  
the process.  
D. Any vacancy not created by this process will be  
filled in the following sequence: 1) recall of dis-  
placed employee, 2} progression line promotion/  
demotion (includes transfers), and 3) post. If a dis-  
placed employee is the successful bidder and still  
has their red-tag, they will be awarded the bid job  
at their 100% red-tag rate of pay or at the rate of  
the job if it is higher. If the employee voluntarily  
leaves this bid job during the probationary period,  
the employee then becomes displaced and loses  
the red-tag rate of pay. If the employee involun-  
tarily leaves the bid job, they will keep their 100%  
red-tag rate of pay.  
E Employees who reject the Company offer in Box  
11 or are unable to select a position in Box 10 will  
retain their Article Il rights.  
### . Section 13. Associated Issues  
A. Recall Rights - employees who are displaced will  
retain recall rights to their former progression line  
from which they were displaced for a period of 4  
years as provided below. The demotion criteria  
are no longer applicable for recall.  
93  
Article X — Sec. 13  
Employees may be considered for vacancies de-  
clared by the Company in either higher, equal or  
lower job classifications in their former progres-  
sion line, based on the following order of consid-  
eration:  
(1) Same Job Classification - Employees who held  
the vacant job classifications prior to their  
placement in another progression line. Em-  
ployees will be considered based on their Lo-  
cal 1600 Seniority ranking. Employees recalled  
to their former job will have their previous job  
seniority date restored.  
Higher or Lower Job Classification - Fill through  
normal progression line promotion/demotion  
rules. Fill subsequent vacancies through #1  
above.  
Employees with return rights may request to  
be placed in their former progression line in a  
vacancy in a higher or lower job classification  
than the one from which they had been dis-  
placed if the vacancy is not filled through nor-  
mal progression line rules. Empioyees will be  
considered based on their Local 1600 Senior-  
ity. Recall rights will be satisfied if the em-  
ployee returns to a higher or lower job in the  
progression line.  
These opportunities remain in effect for a pe-  
riod of four years from the date the employee  
accrues job classification seniority in another  
progression line, regardless of the number of  
opportunities extended. However, an em-  
ployee who refuses recall back to their former  
job at their former work location will lose their  
recall rights.  
(2  
~~  
94  
Anicle X — Sec. 13  
Returning employees who accept a lower.  
level job in their former progression line will  
receive job classification seniority credit for  
the time previously spent in that job classifi-  
cation and will retain their red-tagged rate of  
pay, if applicable.  
(3) In the event the vacancy is not filled pursuant  
to Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it will then be  
posted. If it cannot be filled through the post-  
ing process it will be filled through the reem-  
ployment provisions. |  
. Reemployment - employees, who have been laid  
off, shall have reemployment rights for 2 years.  
An employee who refuses a reemployment offer  
to their former job at their former location will be  
considered to be resigned.  
Red-tag - The term Red-tag shall mean the  
regular rate of pay shall not be reduced  
from that which he received in his former job and he  
will receive all applicable pay increases or portions  
thereof when the maximum rate of the job he is  
performing equals or exceeds such pay. Employ-  
ees who are red-tagged and subsequently bid to a  
new progression line will retain their red-tagged  
rate if any of the jobs in that progression line are  
equal to or higher than their current position. Such  
employees who return to their former job during  
their probationary period will retain their red-tagged  
rate of pay. If a red-tagged employee bids to a pro-  
gression line/job with no equal or higher job, they  
will lose their red-tag and wiil assume the rate of  
the new job. Such employees who return to their  
former job during their probationary period will lose  
their red-tagged rate of pay. Comparisons will be at  
95  
Article X — Sec. 13  
the top step of the jobs to determine whether it is an  
equal or higher level job.  
Bumping Criteria - see Exhibit A for the job titles  
and qualifications required in order for employees  
to bump into these positions.  
Probationary Period - does not apply to jobs ac-  
cepted through this placement process (including  
progression line promotions associated with this  
placement process). Hardships, involuntary demo-  
tions and job swaps associated with this process  
will be handled between the parties on a case-by-  
case basis.  
Pay Taper - employees who have been demoted  
and who are not red-tagged in connection with a  
job change as a result of the placement process  
shall have their salary reduced in 25% increments  
every 6 months for a period of 18 months in order  
to reach the appropriate rate of pay of the lower  
job. The first reduction will occur when the em-  
ployee physically reports to the job.  
. Temporary Assignments - displaced employees  
who are temporarily assigned to a higher rated  
job will be paid the higher salary after four (4) pay  
periods of reporting to the job. Displaced employ-  
ees who are assigned to an equal or lower job  
will continue to receive their current rate of pay.  
Residence Requirements - employees who are  
handled under the placement process will not be  
required to move to accept a job with residence  
requirements.  
Service - employees who are laid off and return  
to employment will not have their Company Ser-

Material and Transportation  
For Transmission & Distribution, Mechanical &  
Electrical, Transportation and Material work assign-  
ments. within a region, if additional personnel are  
needed at a particular work location for normal  
work, the Company will retain the right to make the  
sole determination where personnel are needed,  
what classifications of personnel are needed and  
what work location or work locations will supply the  
personnel. The most junior employees, by job clas-  
sification/specialty, on the work location roster at  
109  
Article Xl] — Sec, 2  
the supplying work location will be temporarily as-  
signed to fulfill this need.  
For normal intra-regional work assignments, the  
junior employee in a job classification/specialty  
will be assigned within twenty (20) miles from his  
regular headquarters. For subsequent intra-re-  
gional assignments outside twenty (20) miles re-  
quiring the same classification/specialty of em-  
ployee from the same work location, the junior  
employee will be reassigned to the location out-  
side twenty (20) miles. This reassignment will  
not apply to any intra-regional assignments within  
twenty (20) miles nor to assignments outside the  
region. No roster can be both a sender and re-  
ceiver of employees of like job classification/  
specialty for intra-regional assignments. (The  
intent of this paragraph is to assign the most |  
junior employee by job classification/specialty  
first to intra-regional work assignments).  
For normal work assignments outside a region,  
the most junior employee by job classification/  
specialty in the region will be assigned. No re-  
gion can be both a sender and receiver of em-  
_ ployees of like job classification/specialty for  
inter-regional assignments.  
When it is necessary to dispatch Local 1600 per-  
sonnel on emergency inter-regionai assistance and  
foreign utility assistance during scheduled or non-  
scheduled working hours, or intra-regional assis-  
tance during non-scheduled working hours, the  
Company will retain the right to make the sole de-  
termination where personnel are needed, and what  
classifications of personnel are needed and what  
work location or work locations will supply the per-  
110  
on  
Article X!lI— Sec. 2  
sonnel. Employees will then be selected by job  
classification/specialty in conjunction with their  
position on the call-out roster at the time they are  
to be dispatched. However, for intra-regional emer-  
gency assistance started during working or ex-  
tended hours, crews may be dispatched intact if it  
is deemed expedient.  
Contractors may be assigned to a region to per-  
form unscheduled critical work for no more than  
five (5) days while employees assigned to those  
rosters are shipped out.  
Field Services - Generation  
Field Services - Generation employees will have  
work rights on their plant rosters according to job  
classification seniority. Shipment of employees  
outside of their plant roster will be according to job  
classification seniority. No plant roster or quadrant  
can be both a sender and receiver of employees  
of like rates/skills. However, for assignment in or  
out of Susquehanna SES, management will select  
employees based on NRC requirements, such as,  
security clearance, radiation exposure, literacy re-  
quirements. The parties recognize the special re-  
quirements needed to work at Susquehanna SES;  
therefore, due to an inability to gain access to  
SSES, it'may be necessary to send employees to  
an alternate roster. Contractors may be assigned  
to aplant or quadrant to perform unscheduled, criti-  
cal work for no more than five (5) days while em-  
ployees assigned to those rosters/quadrants are  
shipped out.  
The parties recognize that situations may occur  
where it is necessary to take immediate action to  
111  
Article XIl — Sec. 2  
restore or maintain operating capacity of a gener-  
ating station. in these situations, employees may  
be required to remain at a work assignment out-  
side their roster/quadrant while other employees  
are brought in with like skills. Under these circum-  
stances, the employees will remain outside their  
roster/quadrant for a period normally not to exceed  
seven (7) days and shall not exceed fourteen (14)  
calendar days. Those employees who remain out-  
side their roster/quadrant during this period will be  
eligible for travel time and reasonable out-of-pocket  
expenses including mileage, meals, and lodging  
where applicable for any days of the assignment  
in excess of seven calendar days.  
General  
Employees will be temporarily assigned to other  
work locations in PPL’s service territory as neces-  
Sary. For non-service territory work, the Company  
will provide the Union with timely notification of the  
work location and entire scope of the work. For  
this work, the Company will maintain volunteer lists  
of employees and will conduct another canvas for  
volunteers for each job. For voluntary assignments  
outside the service territory, the senior-most quali-  
fied volunteer will be sent first. If sufficient volun-  
leers are not secured, the junior people by job clas-  
Siftcation systemwide will be assigned to the job.  
Employees assigned to this work will have the op-  
tion to return home on a biweekly basis paid for by  
the Company. The parties also agreed to meet to  
discuss enhancements to encourage people to vol-  
unteer.  
112  
Article XIl — Sec. 2  
### B. Specialties  
The recognized specialties that will be consid-  
ered for sending a senior person out or allowing a  
junior person to remain at their regular work loca-  
tion are welding, machining, electronics, equip-  
ment operation, and planning. The existing plan-  
ning work rules for overtime and job assignments  
will be retained. If an employee has one or more  
of these specialties, it will be indicated on the work  
location roster. Transmission line, distribution  
line, and telecommunications specialty designa-  
tions will be retained until employees are quali-  
fied to perform the duties in the new jobs.  
The number of specialties will be designated for  
each region and quadrant. Employees can apply  
for these designations and selections will be based  
on seniority and demonstrated ability. Employees  
desiring to designate a specialty will be given the  
opportunity based on the need within a classifica-  
tion at the region or quadrant. Employees will com-  
municate their interest in a specialty by letter to  
management with a copy to the Local Union stat-  
ing their classification and the specialty desired.  
Upon an anticipated need for the specialty within a  
classification, management will train the employee  
based on seniority in the classification of those who  
have submitted a request.  
Employees who desire to discontinue their specialty  
status will submit a letter to management with a  
copy to the Loca! Union stating their intent to dis-  
continue the specialty and reasons for the request.  
Requests for certified medical reasons will be  
granted. Other requests to discontinue a specialty  
113  
   
Article XIl — Sec, 2  
will be granted based on securing a trained re-  
placement.  
Field Services - Regional Electrician  
Specialties  
The following applies to specialties within the  
Regional electrical progression line. Acquiring  
these specialties will not affect the current job  
ranking seniority.  
All employees in the Field Services ~ Regional  
Electrical Progression Line will be trained and  
qualified within their job classification to per-  
form work on underground systems (URD). URD  
work will not be considered a specialty.  
All employees presently in the Regional Elec-  
trical Progression Line, who previously held any  
of the former Electric Repairman titles will be  
considered as qualified to perform any work in  
that discipline with a Substation specialty.  
All employees presently in the Regional Elec-  
trical Progression Line, who previously held any  
of the former Underground Repairman titles will  
be considered as qualified to perform any work  
in that discipline with a Network specialty.  
Employees promoting or entering the Regional  
Electrical Progression Line at the Electrician  
Classification or above shall indicate a prefer-  
ence within their respective probationary time  
frames.  
For initial staffing, the Company will identify the  
number of Substation and Network specialties  
114  
Article Xll — Sec. 2  
needed at each roster location. The Company  
will select additional employees for the special-  
ties based on the employees’ preferred  
choice(s) by seniority. In the event the number  
of employees has not met the number of needed  
specialties at a roster location, the most junior  
employee in that job classification at that ros-  
ter location will be required to accept the  
needed specialty.  
In the event the Company needs to increase the  
number of specialties at a roster location, the  
Company will offer the specialty to those em-  
ployees who did not have their preferred choice  
for that specialty satisfied at that roster loca-  
tion by seniority. If the need is not met, the Com-  
pany will canvass the employees at that roster  
location for new choices prior to requiring the  
junior employee to accept the specialty.  
An employee may have multiple specialties.  
These situations may be approved after all em-  
ployees in the job classification at that roster  
location have had their first choice preference  
for a specialty satisfied.  
The Company agrees to maintain on a regional  
basis, for the duration of the labor agreement,  
a ratio of one (1) Leader to five (5) employees in  
the Regional-Electrical Progression Line, un-  
less otherwise agreed to by the parties.  
The Susquehanna 230 Kv Switching Station will  
be considered in the Susquehanna Region for  
work rights.

### C. Overtime Procedures T&D and M&E  
Separate overtime rosters will be established for  
call out and cumulative overtime.  
Call-Out Rosters  
The rotational call-out rosters will be used for:  
1.  
2.  
Emergency work during non-scheduled hours  
at the employee's normal headquarters.  
To dispatch employees on inter-regional assis-  
tance and foreign utility assistance during  
scheduled or non-scheduled working hours.  
To dispatch employees on intra-regional assis-  
tance during non-scheduled working hours.  
Employees will be selected by job classifica-  
tion in conjunction with their position on the cail-  
out roster at the time they are to be dispatched.  
However, for intra-regional assistance during  
working hours, crews may be dispatched intact,  
if it is deemed expedient.  
The rosters will be grouped by high side, low  
Side and support rosters.

### Cumulative Overtime Roster  
The cumulative overtime roster will be used for overtime  
opportunities not covered by call-out  
1.  
5.  
Alt overtime hours worked that are not associ-  
ated with the call-out roster (defined above) will  
be charged to the cumulative overtime roster, in-  
cluding working through lunch and overtime  
hours that are a continuation of the work day.  
Employees will be charged for overtime worked  
. or offered. Time charged a person is determined  
by the number of hours worked by the employee  
who works the overtime.  
If employees are assigned to a temporary work  
_ location, they will remain on the cumulative roster  
at their reguiar job headquarters only for weekend  
. overtime opportunities if they are not working at  
the assigned work location. In addition, they can  
be offered overtime at the temporary work loca-  
tion after it has been offered to all the employees  
on the regular roster at that location.  
For cumulative overtime purposes, a new person  
coming into this roster will be assigned the amount  
of overtime equai to the average time of the em-  
ployees in that classification.  
The cumulative overtime roster will be updated on  
a daily basis.  
D. Overtime Procedures for Field Services - Generation

### E Overtime for Transportation  
The 1993 Memorandum of Agreement that ad-  
dresses Transportation call-out and prearranged  
overtime will remain in effect.  
F Call-out Response  
Each roster can elect to utilize a self-managed  
call-out roster with options to have a primary and  
secondary roster and the ability to use body swaps.  
Employees who exhibit a poor call-out response  
shall be subject to Article VI, Section 5, Paragraph  
### J, and Article VIII, Section 2, Paragraph F, of the  
### Labor Agreement.  
Section 3. Staffing  
A. Temporary Furlough  
In the event the workload declines to a level where there  
is a need to reduce the workforce, management will iden-  
tify the excess employees by job classification and roster  
location. The necessary reductions will be made in the fol-  
lowing manner:  
1.  
Voluntary Furloughs: Employees at the identified  
roster location may volunteer for temporary fur-  
lough and they will be released on the basis of  
their job classification seniority, with senior em-  
ployee given first choice. Second preference to  
volunteer will be given to employees in the same  
progression line at other roster locations and they  
will be released on the basis of their job classifica-  
tion seniority, with senior employee given first  
choice. Such temporary furloughs will be for spe-  
cific time durations and volunteers will return no  
later than the specified ending date. There is no  
limit on voluntary furloughs.  
118  
Article XIl— Sec. 3  
2. Rollbacks: If there are not enough volunteers, em-  
ployees hired after May 18, 1998, may either bump  
the most junior employee hired after May 18, 1998,  
in their job classification and progression line or  
rollback to lower positions within their progression  
line based on their Local 1600 Seniority. If they do  
not bump another employee, they will be assigned  
to an available Utility Worker position closest to  
their home based on Local 1600 Seniority. In all  
cases, the employee will assume the rate of pay  
for the classification selected. Such employees will  
be subject to furlough or temporary assignments  
to other classifications for up to twelve (12) pay  
periods per rolling year until they attain fifteen (15)  
years of Local 1600 Seniority. .  
3. Employees on furlough will continue to accrue  
Company Service, Local 1600 Seniority, and  
receive full benefits, excluding coverage for any  
injury while working for another employer.  
4. If employees are on furlough or rolled-back in  
this process, contractors cannot be utilized in such  
employees’ quadrant, region, or roster location to  
perform unscheduled, critical work the Company  
employees would have normally performed for  
more than five (5) days during any furlough  
period. If contractors are used and employees  
are not offered the opportunity to return, such  
employees will be paid at the rate of pay for their  
regular classification for all days that contractors  
work in their quadrant, region, or roster location.  
B. Utility Worker Pool  
The parties agree to establish a pool of temporary em-  
ployees, Utility Worker, to replace contractors performing  
Building Custodian, Handyman-Power Production, Handy-  
€  
119  
Article XIl — Sec. 3  
man-Distribution, Groundman, and Laborer functions. This  
poo! will also provide opportunities for employees cov-  
ered under Article XII when their workload declines and it  
is necessary to temporarily reduce the work force. This  
provision will replace the use of Specific Temporaries in  
Article XIl.  
New employees will be hired to work as Utility Workers.  
Their Local 1600 Seniority will be the date of hire regard-  
less of the number of layoffs and such employees are eli-  
gible to bid on posted jobs while actively employed. In the  
event a period of layoff exceeds thirteen (13) pay periods a  
new Local 1600 Seniority date will be established. They are  
not eligible for benefits and travel expenses nor guaranteed  
forty (40) hours per week. Utility Workers will receive the  
same employee benefits and entitlements as defined in  
Article V, Section 4, Paragraph A as Specific Temporary  
employees. an employee is bumped by an Article XiIl  
employee, they can bump other Utility Workers with less  
Local 1600 Seniority.  
The intent of this concept is to replace the contractors  
doing this work with Local 1600 employees. However, to  
meet temporary peaks for flaggers at a particular location,  
contractors may occasionally do this work.  
When regular Article XII employees are assigned to this  
pool, they will be given the Utility Worker position closest to  
their home by Local 1600 Seniority and will continue to re-  
ceive benefits and travel expenses in accordance with the  
Labor Agreement.  
Utility Workers on layoff will have reemployment oppor-  
tunities before a new employee is hired into the Utility Worker  
Pool.  
C. Temporary Promotions  
Employees will be temporarily promoted to meet Field  
Services - Generation welding needs.  
120  
Articla XII — Sec. 3-4  
D. Temporary Promotion to Supervisor  
Non-supervisory employees may be temporarily pro-  
moted to supervisory positions in accordance with Article V,  
Section 2, Paragraph C(1) a, b.  
Section 4. Genera!  
A. Jobs Postponed or Canceled  
Whenever crews report for regular work and the job is  
canceled or postponed, they will be given First Aid, Safety,  
or other instructions or other work, and will be allowed, pro-  
vided they accept miscellaneous assignments, a minimum  
pay for that day equal to the pay for eight (8) hours at straight  
time rates.  
Whenever crews report for prearranged overtime work  
and the job is canceled or postponed they will be given First  
Aid, Safety, or other instructions or other work, and will be  
allowed, provided they accept miscellaneous assignments,  
a minimum pay for that day equal to the pay for four (4)  
hours at straight time rates. If the employee accepts the  
cancellation of prearranged overtime and elects not to re-  
port to work, the minimum compensation shail not apply.  
Employees who report for work and are not offered any other  
assignments will be eligible for the minimum compensation.  
B. Travel Time  
Travel time both ways between work headquarters and  
the job will be considered time worked.  
C. Short Shifting  
Employees who have their work schedule changed, per  
the Labor Agreement, will have at Jeast eight (8) hours of  
rest at home. They will be released from their regular as-  
signment at the time they are notified. Employees who have  
their work location changed will have at least eight (8) hours  
of rest at home before reporting to the new location.  
121  
Article XIl — Sec. 4  
### D. Safety  
The parties agree all employees need to be committed  
to maintain an accident-free environment. No employee  
will be expected to perform work assignments for which  
they have not been trained or have an equivalent level of  
practical experience.  
When PPL employees perform work for others, they will  
follow PPL Safety Rules. In these situations, PPL Energy  
Control Process procedures will be followed as closely as  
possible.  
The President of Loca! 1600 shall select the bargaining  
unit members of joint Safety and Health Committees.  
When a lineman is working in the danger zone, a second  
lineman will be at that location.  
E. Training  
Formal training will be provided to employees at each  
level of the progression lines. Employees will begin training  
on the appropriate modules when they promote/select the  
new position. Employees must pass associated module  
testing in their current position prior to being considered for  
future promotions. Failure of training modules is not cause  
for an employee to be removed from their current position  
and employees who fail may re-test. Training will be com-  
pleted within four (4) years of the date of promotion/selec-  
tion. If a vacancy occurs before the employee completes all  
the modules, he will not be denied the promotion.  
F. Modified Duty  
Employees who are released for limited duty by a physi-  
cian or medical specialist following a period of illness or in-  
jury will be considered for available work under the follow-  
ing conditions  
122  
Article Xil — Sec. 4  
### Article XIlt-— Sec. 1  
1. Modified duty resulting from an occupational dis-  
ease or injury will be provided if the employee is  
able to perform satisfactorily.  
2. Modified duty resulting from a non-occupational  
disease or injury may be provided if the employee  
is able to perform satisfactorily.  
Employees who are on modified duty as the result of an  
occupational disease or injury will have preference for any  
available work and for assignments closer to their perma-  
nent residence.  
The rate of pay for employees on modified duty will be  
determined in accordance with Article VIII, Section 11C. Work  
assignment and training school expense provisions of this  
Agreement will apply when an employee is on modified duty.  
The assignment of overtime will be at the discretion of the  
Company. This provision for modified duty will not apply when  
the sickness or injury is the result of willful intention to injure  
ones self (or some other person), by commission of any  
crime, or as a consequence of working for an employer other  
than the Company or working for remuneration through self-  
employment.

for the following reasons will not be considered a break  
in service, but will not be credited to the four (4) year  
period:  
(1) Bidding on posted positions and returning  
within six (6) month probationary period  
(2) Military leave of absence  
124  
Article Sec. 2  
(3) Personal leave of absence  
(4) Child care leave of absence  
(5) Medical leave of absence  
(6) Union leave of absence  
This language will not restrict the employees’ option  
to bump within the Care Center before meeting the four  
(4) year eligibility requirement. Any employee entering  
the Care Center with Article X rights will retain those  
rights.  
F. If reductions occur within the Customer Care Center,  
employees will have the option to bump within the Customer  
Care Center by Local 1600 Seniority. The most junior  
bumped employee will be laid off unless there are contrac-  
tors working whose work they can perform or they can bump  
a junior part-time employee working in the Customer Care  
Center. If the person affected was hired prior to May 18,  
1998, they can exercise their displacement rights in accor-  
dance with X.  
G. All Customer Agents, Lead Customer Agents and  
Telemarketing Clerks will be subject to silent cai! monitor-  
ing, remote call monitoring and side by side call monitoring  
In accordance with the law.  
H. In the event the senior Customer Agent is assigned to  
substitute for a Lead Customer Agent for any reason, the  
substitute will be paid the appropriate CC-03 rate of pay if  
the substitution extends beyond one (1) day within the work  
week.  
I. While it is not the intent to fully staff the Customer  
Care Center with part-time employees, part-time employ-  
ees will be utilized to efficiently address the work load and  
Company recruiting needs. Part-time employees will not be  
scheduled to work less than two (2) hours a day or more  
than twenty (20) hours a week. In the case of job sharing,

staffing level by job classification.  
J. Employees will be offered the opportunity to bid  
and test for the positions of Customer Agent-Billing and  
Customer Agent-Calls semi-annually (every 6 months)  
in June and December. When a position vacancy oc-  
curs (determined by the approval date of the personne!  
requisition), it will first be offered to employees who have  
submitted a request for a lateral transfer. If no candi-  
dates accept or exist, the position will then be offered  
to the bidders who have successfully passed all of the  
required tests, and the telemarketing clerks, according  
to IBEW Local 1600 seniority. Employees who have sub-  
mitted their bids but have not completed al! of the re-  
quired tests will have to wait until the next available  
vacancy after all of the required tests are completed.

less modified by the above rules.

### EXHIBIT B  
### REST PERIOD RULES & TABLE  
In accordance with Article IV, Section 5 of the Labor Agreement,  
the following rules shall be applicable for determining “qualifica-  
tions of eligibility” and “length of rest period”.  
### RULES:  
1.  
2.  
Employees must actually work a minimum of three (3) non-  
scheduled overtime hours.  
When the number of non-scheduled hours worked and the  
time of the overtime completion are represented on the rest  
period table, mathematical “rounding off” principles are ap-  
plicable. °  
All overtime hours worked during the twelve {12}-hour period  
prior to starting time is accumulative for purposes of deter-  
mining total non-scheduled hours worked provided the sum  
of the non-scheduled hours worked equals or exceeds the  
three {3)-hour requirement as defined in Rule #1.  
For purposes of determining the time of the overtime comple-  
tion:  
a. Starting time of the scheduled work hours is always uti-  
lized if the work is not completed and/or the employee  
cannot be released at starting time.  
b. If more than one work period is involved, utilize the hour  
that the last work period ended.  
c. Travel time is not utilized in determining the time of over-  
time completion.  
The rest period table is not applied to vacation days, holi-  
days, paid personal time off and ST-days.

### TWO MEN ON A CALL-OUT  
in an effort to insure proper understanding as to the number of  
employees to be called out, the following guidelines are set forth  
and are established on a sunset to sunrise basis.  
### A. CALL-OUTS WHERE TWO EMPLOYEES WILL BE DIS-  
### PATCHED FOR DISTRIBUTION LINE TROUBLE (Second man  
will be called from the applicable roster.)  
1  
2.  
3.  
6.  
Zs  
Fires of major proportions or where information indicated  
it is probable that a second man is needed to assist.  
Reports of broken poles pertaining to auto accidents, etc.  
Reports of wires down; reports of wires burning or spark-  
ing.  
. Severe driving conditions due to ice, snow or fog.  
. When work to be done involves working directly on ener-  
gized primary circuits.  
Primary line work that will have to be done in darkness  
(including patrolling). (See exceptions below.)  
“UD” distribution trouble.  
### B. CALL-OUTS WHERE ONE EMPLOYEE WILL BE Dis-  
### PATCHED FOR DISTRIBUTION LINE TROUBLE  
1,  
&  
6.  
7.  
No-light involving one customer or restricted block of cus-  
tomers. (Normally performed by tap or transformer fuse  
replacements or closing of OCR.)  
. Customer service complaint, such as flickering lights, volt-  
age or partial service.  
. Re-connects.  
. Street light bulb replacement.  
. Substation check. (Visual inspection, including joad and  
voltage check.)  
Load or voltage check on lines.  
Switching.  
It is obvious that no set of rules can be written to cover all situa-  
tions that may occur. The above rules are set forth as a guideline  
only. It will be the responsibility of the employee receiving the call-  
166  
out to conscientiously assess the situation at hand and determine  
if an additional employee is required.  
Good judgment must also be used in responding to emergency  
situations which may require that the first man available proceed  
promptly white the second man, if required, will follow in a second  
vehicle.  
This itern is concerned with call-outs only and should in no way  
restrict or change the present practices involving the work of em-  
ployees in the Troubleman-FS or any other classifications.  
167  
### EXHIBIT D  
### NON-SUPERVISORY MOVING PLAN  
### STATEMENT OF POLICY  
It is the intent of the Company’s Non-Supervisory Moving Ex-  
pense Policy to minimize the inconvenience and financial hardship  
for those employees who qualify under the provision of the Pian.  
To accomplish this, the Company will as specifically noted below  
(1) pay reasonable living or commuting expenses for a period of up  
to 90 calendar days, during which arrangements can be completed  
by the employee to obtain new living quarters and accomplish the  
necessary disposition of the former fiving quarters; (2) pay the cost  
of moving the household effects when this is performed by profes-  
sional movers; and (3) pay real estate commission fees for selling  
a presently owned residence when employees move at the request  
of the Company.  
### ELIGIBILITY  
A. Employees must have a minimum of two (2) years’ Company  
service unless they are being promoted in a progression line  
to a job with residence requirements in which case there is no  
minimum.  
### LIVING, COMMUTING AND MOVING EXPENSES  
A. The following examples are situations where expenses will  
be paid in the manner so described:  
1. Promotions in a progression line to a different work loca-  
tion.  
a. Job has residence requirement, or  
b. Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually  
agreed that it is in the best interest of both the em-  
ployee and the Company to have the employee live in  
the general area of his Job Headquarters. Company's  
decision will be made by the Labor Relations Depart-  
ment to get uniformity.  
Living, commuting and moving expenses will be paid.  
2. Filling a “posted” job at a different work location. New job  
may be more, same or less pay.  
a. Job has residence requirement, or  
168  
Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually  
agreed that it is in the best interest of both the em-  
ployee and the Company to have the employee live in  
the general area of his Job Headquarters.  
decision will be made by the Labor Relations Depart-  
ment to get uniformity.  
Living, commuting and moving expenses will be paid.  
3. Promoting in a progression line or filling a posted job at  
the same work location.  
a.  
b.  
Job has residence requirement, or  
Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually  
agreed that it is in the best interest of both the em-  
ployee and the Company to have the employee live in  
the general area of his Job Headquarters. Company's  
decision will be made by the Labor Relations Depart-  
ment to get uniformity.  
Only moving expenses will be paid.  
4. Job change due to:  
a.  
b. Disability  
Cc:  
d. Management decision to return employee to former  
Displacement  
Work relocation  
job during a probationary period of a new job.  
Living, commuting and moving expenses will be paid.  
In all of the above, it must be in the best interest of the  
employee and the Company to have the employee live  
in the general area of his new Job Headquarters.  
B. The following examples are situations where expenses will  
not be paid:  
1. Move is occasioned solely by the employee's desire or  
convenience such as a home in a different section of the  
same locality.  
2. When an employee asks for a change in work location,  
other than a posted job, and takes a demotion or lateral  
transfer in his own progression line.  
3. Where an employee is taking a posted job and he has  
169  
been reimbursed for moving expenses in the last two (2)  
years.  
4. job and work location is moved from one (1)  
location to another location in the same general commu-  
nity.  
5. Moves of employees from one (1) Job Headquarters to  
another unless requested by the Company on a long-term  
basis.  
### REAL ESTATE EXPENSES  
For all except A-2 and A-3 above, if the employee owns and  
resides in a home that must be sold to make a move to a new work  
location, the Company will pay the appropriate real estate commis-  
sion fee if a realtor was utilized in selling the home. All other costs |  
are the responsibility of the employee.  
### DEFINITION OF A MOVING PERIOD  
Employees may elect to meet the residence requirement any  
time during the probationary period but no later than 90 calendar  
days after completing their probationary period unless an exten-  
sion is granted. The 90 calendar day period for receiving living or  
commuting expenses will commence at the option of the employee  
but no later than the completion of the probationary period. During  
this 90 calendar day period, employees have a daily choice of  
either “staying over” or “commuting.”  
### CESSATION OF LIVING/COMMUTING EXPENSES  
if employees are in the process of collecting living/commuting  
expenses and during this period elect not to relocate to take the  
position, expenses shall terminate immediately.  
lf employees, in the process of collecting living/commuting ex-  
penses, are declared unacceptable to meet the requirements of  
ithe job, they will continue to receive expenses until they can be  
returned. However, expenses shall not exceed the prescribed time  
as allowed in the Moving Expense Plan.  
### EXTENSION OF MOVING PERIOD  
This Plan allows as much as a 90 calendar day extension be-  
yond the original normal 90 calendar day period in cases where  
170  
the employee is (1) experiencing difficulty in disposing of an exist-  
ing residence, (2} obtaining quarters at the new location or (3) is  
obligated to delay his move because of family circumstances.  
Where an employee is being held up on his move because of not  
being able to sell his home, the extension-will only be granted if he  
can prove his “asking price” has been realistic. - If the employee  
requests, the Company will have independent local appraisals made  
at its expense.  
if an employee has not moved his personal possessions within  
the moving period for which he is allowed living expenses, he will  
have his mover’s bills paid at such time when he actually moves,  
provided the move is made within one (1) year from the date he  
reports to his new job.  
Likewise, if he has not sold his home during the period for which  
he is allowed living expenses, and subsequently sells his home  
within a year from the date he reports to his new job, the real estate  
commission fee, if applicable, wil! be paid by the Company.  
In’ considering if an extension is warranted, it must be ascer-  
tained to the satisfaction of the employee’s supervisor that real ef-  
_ forts are being made to effect the move and that there is a conse-  
quent real need for the extension. The principle of extension is  
never to grant more days than needed. There may be several ex-  
tensions, but the total of such extension is not to exceed 90 calen-  
dar days, which, with the original 90 calendar day period, would  
result in a final limit of 180 calendar days.  
### BASIS FOR HANDLING MOVING EXPENSES  
The following “ground rules” will be applied:  
1. Staying Over - Motel expenses and meals will be paid ona  
reasonable out-of-pocket basis. Weekly Round-Trip Home -  
Mileage allowance covering one (1) round-trip per week at  
the rate specified in the Labor Agreement.  
2. Commuting Daily - Mileage allowance as specified in the  
Labor Agreement.  
3. Familiarization Allowance - if an employee elects not to move  
and decides to commute on a continuing basis, his transpor-  
tation will be paid for a period of two (2) weeks to enable him  
171  
to familiarize himself with his new work location.  
Selection of Mover - The employee must contact the Traffic  
Section of the Procurement Department, Allentown, to ar-  
range for a reputable freight carrier to transport the personal  
household items of the employee and his/her family. The bill  
should be made out to PPL and it will be paid directly to the  
mover.  
Realtor Fee - Since the realtor fee is payable at the time of  
settlement, the employee may elect to pay this fee at this  
time and be reimbursed for these expenses, or may request  
that a check from the Company be prepared, payable to  
the realtor, for the appropriate fee. ;  
Appraisals - To assure that the employee is getting the true  
value for his home, and at the same time assuring that the  
employee’s asking price is realistic, a competent and impar-  
tial appraisa! should be obtained no later than two (2) weeks  
after the effective date the employee reports to his new work  
location. If the employee is agreeable, the Company will have  
independent appraisals made at its expense.  
_ Tax Rulings - Under present law, regulations and interpreta-  
tions, the Company is required to withhold Federal and State  
Income Taxes from certain items reimbursed under this policy.  
These items are subject to withholding at the time of pay-  
ment and must be reported as part of the total wages shown  
on the annual W-2 form furnished to the employee. To help  
offset the additional Social Securlty Tax, Federal and State  
Income Taxes as a result of relocation, the Company will  
provide tax offset provisions (gross-up) for taxable items cov-  
ered under this exhibit.  
Employee's Responsibility - The employee who is eligible for  
reimbursement for expenses under this policy should carry  
out his plans and arrangements to move in a manner which  
will keep his related expenses to a reasonable minimum and  
at the same level as if he were incurring all such expenses  
for his own personal account.

day of the assignment, plus one round trip per week, time and mileage. For allowance amounts refer to Article VIII, Section 6 (B).  
For training, mileage expense is not applicable to passengers or if Company offers transportation.  
3. Mileage expense is not applicable to passengers or if Company offers transportation. Those employees car pooling will receive  
mileage expense from their home to @ reasonable meeting point (excluding miles of normal commute - max. of 30 miles each way). In  
no case will the reimbursement to the car poolers exceed the reimbursement had they driven the entire distance to the temporary  
assignment or training location.  
4. Refer to Article Vill, Section 6 (F).  
   
      
### EXHIBIT F  
### TEMPORARY CHANGE IN WORKING  
### HOURS-SUBSTITUTION  
To understand this provision, each situation must be addressed  
individually. This Exhibit separates Substitution from Temporary  
Change in Schedule.  
### 1. SUBSTITUTION FOR EMPLOYEE WHO IS OFF DUTY  
a. When notification of a schedule change occurs after the be-  
ginning of the work week in which the substitution is to occur,  
only the working hours of the substituting employee will be  
changed, not the ST-days.  
b. When notification of a schedule change occurs before the  
beginning of the work week in which the substitution is to  
occur, or the substitution continues beyond the end of a work  
week, the work schedule of the substituting employee will  
that of the relieved employee.  
_ In 1{a) in accordance with Article IV, Section 4, Paragraph A (2),  
since the notification of the substitution occurred after the start of  
the work week in which the substitution is to occur, the substituting  
employee would receive 1X for the first change of working hours  
on the first W-day and the employee's ST-days for that week would  
not be changed.  
In 1(b) since notification of the substitution occurred before the  
start of the work week in which the substitution is to occur, the  
substituting employee would assume the schedule of the relieved  
employee.  
Therefore, in 1(b) if the employee is before quitting time  
of his last W-day of the preceding work week, premium pay for the  
change is not applicable. However, if he is notified after quitting  
time of his last W-day of the preceding week but before the start of  
the work week, premium pay for the first change is applicable and  
he would assume the shift of the relieved employee.  
When this occurs, (both 1(a) and 1(b)) - since it becomes in fact  
4 substitution, the employee is relieved of his original shift assign-  
ment, therefore, meal allowances or rest periods which could be  
associated with the employee’s original shift are not applicable. For  
substitution purposes, the meal allowance is applicable when:  
174  
i. An employee is called out for substitution purposes on his  
ST-day or  
2. An employee is called out to substitute for split shift opera-  
tion in which case the employee would retain the responsibil-  
ity for his originally scheduled shift.  
Utility classifications and operators or employees on extra duty  
assignments were specifically established to provide substitution  
for time off requests such as vacation, sickness and personal time  
off. Since these requests can be for less than a full week’s dura-  
tion, it is possible for a utility employee to provide substitution for  
more than one employee in any one work week. In order to provide  
this multiple substitution, it is not practical to assign the utility em-  
ployee the ST-days of one of the employees for whom the substitu-  
tion is being provided. In such cases the ST-days are assigned as  
necessary to allow the maximum substitution. In many instances,  
due to time off requests, these employees’ schedules cannot be  
determined until the week preceding the work week and, therefore,  
schedules are posted forty-eight (48) hours prior to the work week  
in accordance with Article IV, Section 3D. Subsequent changes for  
Substitution after the forty-eight (48)-hour notice are governed by  
1(a) on page 1 of this Exhibit.  
It must be remembered that substitution may have to occur with  
a minimum of notification, however, this in practically all cases is  
beyond the control of the Company.  
### 2. TEMPORARY CHANGE OF SCHEDULE  
Temporary change of schedules (Article IV, Section 3, Paragraphs  
A (2) and (3)) occur as a result of the necessity to complete work  
on equipment that must be taken out of service and the work must  
be done outside normal working hours. This could inctude sched-  
uled overhaul of equipment or unforeseen breakdown of equipment.  
in addition, in accordance with Paragraph (3) it may occur as a  
result of scheduling an employee to attend Company training schools  
or programs,  
Excluding Paragraph (3), when this occurs, only the working hours  
of the employee's W-days will be changed, not the ST-days. An:  
exception here is equipment outages that have a direct effect on  
the operating capacity of power generating stations as specified in  
175  
the Labor Agreement where employee’s ST-days may be changed.  
Article |V, Section 4, Paragraph (3) provides pay at for the  
first eight (8) hours working on a temporarily changed schedule.  
Should this occur on the ST-day, since the employee is  
already receiving premium pay, he would not be entitled to pre-  
mium pay on the first W-day. In addition, if an employee has al-  
ready been credited for a normal work shift for the day (i.e., worked  
or rest period) and is informed and incurs the initial change of shift  
as supplemental overtime on the same day, since he is already  
receiving premium overtime pay it would not in effect carry over to  
the next W-day. If the employee has already supplied one meal for  
the day in question, the Company will assume the additional meal  
entitlements. If the employee has not supplied a meal, he is re-  
sponsible for the first meal as spelled out in Article Vill, Section 5,  
Paragraph A. In any case, if eligible, the employee is entitled to  
shift differential for the change of shift and work rules applying to  
shift workers become applicable.  
On prearranged equipment outages and attendance at schools  
or training programs, since schedules are known in advance, the  
employee is usually notified well in advance of the change. On pre-  
arranged equipment outages, regardless of length of notification,  
the employee receives premium pay for the first eight (8)-hour  
change and is relieved of all responsibilities of his originally sched-  
uled shift. In the case of attendance at schools or training programs,  
if the employee is notified forty-eight (48) hours before the begin-  
ning of the work week, overtime for a temporary change in work  
schedule will not apply. However, if notified less than forty-eight  
(48) hours before the beginning of the work week, the overtime will  
apply.  
Unscheduled equipment outages or breakdowns are unpredict-  
able and advance notification many times is impossible. In any event,  
once the employee is notified that his normal shift is changed, he is  
relieved of all responsibilities for his original shift. Premium pay will  
apply to the first eight (8)-hour change and allowances such as  
meal allowances and rest period for his original shift are not appli-  
cable.

.feturn to work,  
in all other cases, notification will be submitted at least  
30 days before the date the leave is to begin or as  
soon as practicable where the need for feave is not  
foreseeable.  
—  
. Employees may request to take an intermittent leave or a  
reduced leave schedule to reduce their usual number of  
hours per day or days per week worked. This leave shall  
177

sole and exclusive right to grant or deny the request. The  
Company may temporarily assign an employee who is on  
intermittent/reduced schedule leave to an available alter-  
native position, without loss of pay for time worked, if the  
employee is qualified for the position and it better accom-  
modates the recurring periods of leave than the  
employee's permanent position.  
_ When the child care leave of absence is granted, the  
employee's supervisor shall make to fill the  
employee’s job with a temporary or permanent replace-  
ment depending on the intended leave. The vacancy will

sal premiums are required to make contributions at the  
same level as before the leave began. Health care cover-  
ages at the level the employee had at the time of leave  
may be extended beyond the twelve (12) weeks if the  
employee pays the cost for the duration of  
the unpaid leave.  
(1) Female employees, who are on extended illness due  
to pregnancy and childbirth, will have this time included  
in the twelve (12) week maximum for Company-paid  
health care coverage.  
(2) If employees are married to each other and request a  
child care leave, their total combined entitlement for  
Company-paid health care coverage cannot exceed  
twelve (12) weeks.  
178  
(3) The twelve (12) week entitlement of Company-paid  
health care coverage is renewed at the end of each  
pay period year and is not cumulative nor does any  
unused portion get carried over from year to year.  
2. Rights Upon Reinstatement  
a. Employees who are granted a child care leave of absence  
up to twenty-six (26) weeks, upon return to the Company  
will be reinstated to the same job, work location and rate  
of pay that they held prior to the child care leave of ab-  
sence.  
b. Employees who are granted a child care leave of absence  
from twenty-six (26) weeks up to fifty-two (52) weeks, upon  
return to the Company, will be reinstated to a job at their  
former work location when an opening is available. If no  
opening is available at that work location, the employee  
will be considered for the first available job opening. Upon  
reinstatement, the employee will receive the rate of pay  
applicable to that job. However, the employee will have a  
commitment to the first job vacancy in the employee's  
former job classification at his/her work location. Employ-  
ees will lose this commitment if they voluntarily change  
jobs before the commitment is fulfilled. Employees who  
refuse a vacancy offered by the Company at the termina-  
tion of the child care ieave of absence will be considered  
to have resigned.  
c. Female employees, who are on extended illness due to  
pregnancy and childbirth and decide to return to work  
immediately upon certification by their doctor that they  
are no longer disabled, wil! be entitled to reinstatement in  
accordance with the policy on extended illness due to ma-  
ternity. Their vacation, wage increases and other benefits  
will be handled under the existing policies. Female em-  
ployees who are granted a child care leave are required  
to submit to their supervisor a certification from their doc-  
tor at the end of their disability.

maximum of twelve (12) weeks during any pay period year  
. under the following conditions:  
a. Employees will be eligible for leave in the case of a seri-  
ous health condition for themselves or to care for a spouse,

days before the date the leave is to begin or as soon as  
practicable where the need for leave is not foreseeable.  
c. In situations where the Company has reason to question  
the validity of the medical certification, the employee will  
be required to obtain a second opinion from a Company  
designated health care provider at Company expense. If  
the opinions of the employee's and Company's designated  
health care providers differ, the Company may require the  
employee to obtain medical certification from a third health  
care provider, again at Company expense. The third health  
care provider must be approved jointly by the employee  
and the Company and this third opinion shall be final and  
binding.  
d. Employees whose time off in excess of ten (10) consecu-  
tive days is charged to sickness, whether paid or unpaid,  
may have this time applied toward the twelve (12) week  
leave allotment.  
e. Employee requests for an intermittent leave or a reduced  
leave schedule to reduce their usual number of hours per  
day or days per week worked, not to exceed twelve (12)  
weeks, shall be granted whenever medically necessary.

is on intermittent/reduced leave to an available alterna-  
180  
tive position, without loss of pay for time worked, if the  
employee is qualified for the position and it better accom-  
modates the recurring periods of leave than the  
permanent position.  
When the medical Jeave of. absence is- granted, the  
supervisor shall make arrangements to fill the  
job with a temporary or permanent replace-  
ment depending on the intended duration of the leave.  
The vacancy will be handled in accordance with the exist-  
-: Ing rules applicable to temporary or permanent replace-  
ments,

tion, each employee’s leave cannot exceed twelve (12}  
weeks.  
.* Care for an employee's parent(s).with a serious heath  
condition, the total:combined leave for both employees  
cannot exceed twelve (12) weeks. Providing care fora  
- Parent-in-law is not applicable.

ill mother, therefore; Employee B has only six (6) weeks leave avail-  
able to care for her father.  
>  
  
h.+ Current health benefits (Hospital, Medical and Surgical

signed.  
182  
3.  
Requests for personal leaves of absence for extreme hard-  
ships which do not meet the conditions outlined in this Sec-  
tion will be reviewed by the Company and the Union on a  
case by case basis. Approvals or disapprovals of such re-  
quests will be mutually agreed upon by the.parties.  
### D. CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO CHILD CARE, MEDICAL AND  
### PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE  
1.  
While on leave of absence employees cannot work for an-  
other employer or become self-employed without the approval  
of the Company. Employees who work for another employer  
or become self-employed without Company approval will be  
considered to have resigned.  
It will be the employee's responsibility to contact the offices  
of Local Union 1600, IBEW, regarding payment of Union dues  
during their leave of absence.  
Job seniority will not accrue during the period of the leave of  
absence except for any time period that employees may be  
eligible for sick pay; and upon return to the Company, the  
job seniority will be adjusted to reflect the amount  
of time the employee was on the leave of absence.  
Employees on leave of absence will not be considered for  
promotional opportunities and are not eligible to bid on any  
vacancies that occur during the feave of absence.  
Benefits, Vacations, Wage Increases .  
a. Benefits - Except as provided in Section A, Paragraph j  
and Section B, Paragraph h above, coverage (Group Life  
Insurance, Hospital, Medical and Surgical Insurance,  
Major Medical, Dental Assistance and Long Term Disabii-  
ity) in the amount the employees had at the time of the  
leave may be retained by the employees paying the  
Company's full composite cost for the duration of the leave.  
b. Retirement - Employees on leave of absence will have  
their participation in the Retirement Plan suspended until  
their return to active employment. Upon return, the em-  
ployee will have the opportunity to make payments equal  
to the full costs including interest in order to make them-  
183  
selves whole for the duration of the leave of absence.  
Employees who do not return to the Company will partici-  
pate in the usual vesting provisions available under the  
credited service requirements of the Plan.  
c. Vacation - Prior to a child care or medical leave of ab-  
sence in excess of 12 weeks or a personal leave of ab-  
sence of any duration, an employee must utilize all ex-  
cept five (5) days of remaining vacation entitlement, ei-  
ther as time off or payment for remaining entitlement.  
Upon return to work, vacation entitlement will be prorated on the  
basis of actual time worked by the employee in the previous year  
and the year he/she returns and added to any allowance the em-  
ployee elected to retain when commencing the leave of absence.  
These allowances may be scheduled two (2) pay periods after rein-  
statement. Proration is not applicable to any time period that em-  
ployees are eligible for sick pay and will only be applied for leaves  
in excess of two (2) weeks.  
Example 1: An employee whose normal vacation entitlement is  
fifteen (15) days takes a child care leave commencing September  
1, 1991 retaining three (3) days of vacation. The leave terminates  
March 1, 1992. When the employee returned he/she will have  
worked 8/12 of 1991 and will work 10/12 of 1992. Therefore, in  
1992 the employee would receive 8/12 of his/her vacation entitle-  
ment or ten (10) working days (rounded to the closest whole day)  
plus the three (3) retained vacation days. These vacation days may  
be scheduled after April 1, 1992. In 1993, the employee would re-  
ceive 10/12 of his/her vacation entitlement which is thirteen (13)  
days.  
Example 2: An employee whose total vacation entitlement is 96  
hours is granted a paternal intermittent child care leave without pay  
encompassing twelve (12) full weeks (3 months) in 1994. When  
determining the succeeding year’s vacation allowance, the employee  
would receive 9/12 of the 96 hours vacation entitlement totaling 72  
hours of available 1995 vacation time.  
d. Mini-Vacation - Employees will not be required to utilize  
mini-vacation prior to leave of absence. Upon their re-  
turn, employees will be eligible to use any mini-vacation  
184  
that was not utilized prior to going on leave of absence,  
and will be eligible for any additional mini-vacation in ac-  
cordance with Article VIil, Section 2, Paragraph B.  
### . Wage Increases  
(1) Step increases for employees who return to work will:  
be’ postponed for a corresponding period of time in  
accordance with Article VI, Section 5, Paragraph | of  
### the Labor Agreement.  
(2) General wage increases for employees will be deferred  
until. the employee returns to work. Employees who  
are reinstated to a lower position than that which they  
held prior to leaving will receive the general wage in-  
crease applicable to that job.  
185  
### EXHIBIT H  
### CUMULATIVE OVERTIME PROCEDURES  
Whenever necessary, the Company will maintain rosters of  
certain employees likely to be called and will select from these  
rosters such employees as are needed ona cumulative over-  
time basis by job classification.  
Overtime will be assigned with an attempt to equalize the  
opportunity for overtime by job classification at a work loca-  
tion.  
Separate rosters will be maintained for call-out and prear-  
ranged overtime. Equalization of overtime for call-out and  
prearranged work will be separate.  
In areas of the Company where calls involving overtime are  
not the responsibility of the Customer Service Representa-  
tive Shift, the appropriate supervisor initiating the calls shall  
be responsible for administering the provisions of this Ex-  
hibit.  
Total call-out overtime hours contiguous to an employee's  
regular shift (before or after) which exceed two (2) hours will  
be charged to the cumulative overtime call-out roster. The  
supervisor will inform the Customer Service Representative  
Shift as soon as possible after the overtime work is com-  
pleted so the cumulative call-out roster can be adjusted ac-  
cordingly.  
Employees will be charged for time worked or time offered.  
Time offered includes situations such as, employee is not  
available for work: there is no answer; telephone line is busy;  
employee isn't home; employee reports sick after having  
worked his regular shift. In these cases, time offered will be  
chargeable for any call-outs up to the employee’s normal  
starting time the next day.  
The amount of time charged to a person is determined by  
the number of hours worked by the employee who responds  
to the call or works the prearranged job.  
For vacation and sickness purposes, it will be the employee's  
responsibility to inform the supervisor and the party respon-  
sible for initiating the call (in most cases the Customer Ser-  
186  
10.  
vice Representative Shift) when the employee should be  
taken off and put back on the roster. If the employee fails to  
do so, he will be considered as available for overtime work  
and charged accordingly. In cases where an employee is  
unavailable to notify the Customer Service Representative  
Shift (i.e. hospitalized, etc.), the supervisor will inform the  
Customer Service Representative Shift of the employee's  
unavailability on behalf of the employee and will so inform  
the employee. However, when the employee is again avail-  
able, it will be the employee’s responsibility to initiate the  
appropriate notification.  
Employees entering a progression line or promoting into a  
higher classification will be assigned the amount of overtime  
equal to the average overtime of the employees in that clas-  
Siftcation.  
Normally, the person called/assigned first is the person with  
the least amount of overtime, providing continuity of work is  
not adversely impacted by a work unit change, or unless the  
skills necessary are not available; or in cases of extreme  
11.  
12.  
emergency. In these situations, it is necessary to inform the  
bypassed employee of such action giving reasons for the  
bypass. Bypassed employees and employees who are inad-  
vertently missed will have the opportunity to equalize the  
overtime by remaining low person on the cumulative over-  
time list. While the Company cannot assure complete equal-  
ization of overtime, periodic review between the appropriate  
Steward and the responsible supervisor should provide as-  
surance that the effort is being made to the extent possible.  
The call-out roster will be updated on a daily basis and the  
prearranged roster will be updated per prearranged job. The  
Customer Service Representative Shift will provide current  
reports to the field locations.  
It is understood by the parties that the clerical responsibili-  
ties for the call-out roster maintenance will have no effect on  
the Customer Service Representative Shitt’s rate of pay.

### JOB CHANGE REQUESTS FOR ENTRY LEVEL  
### OFFICE JOBS CONCEPT POSITIONS  
In accordance with Article V, Section 2, Paragraph M of the Labor  
### Agreement, the jobs of Steno/Clerk-Entry, Customer Service Clerk,  
Operator-Printing Services, Assistant Operator-Office Services, Mail  
Clerk, Enroliment/Billing Clerk, and Clerk-Cash Receipts will be  
filled by newly hired employees. However, employees may request  
a job change to one of these positions. If such requests are submit-  
ted prior to the vacancy, employees shall be considered on the  
following basis before hiring from the street, provided they meet the  
minimum entry requirements for the position.  
1.  
Requests from employees in the same progression line in  
the same division’ if qualified and performing satisfactorily in  
existing position.  
Requests from employees in other QJC progression lines in  
the same division’ if qualified and performing satisfactorily in  
existing position.  
Requests from employees in OJC progression lines from  
other if qualified and performing satisfactorily in  
existing position.  
Requests from employees in progression lines outside the  
OJC in the same division’ if qualified (for every third vacancy  
only provided none of the above requests are on record).  
Requests from employees in progression lines outside the  
OJC outside the division’ if qualified (for every third vacancy  
only) provided there are no requests on record as cited in  
(1}, (2) and (3) above.  
NOTE: Requests to demote to the entry level job within the same  
progression line will be considered along with transfer  
requests in accordance with Article V, Section 2, Para-  
graph K (5). Examples of the aforementioned process are  
described in the Office Jobs Concept Administrative Pro-  
cedures dated June 25, 1985.  
‘The designation of divisions also includes power plants and  
General Office.

### EXHIBIT J  
### RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS  
As an electric utility providing an essential service to a public  
which is rapidly becoming even more dependent upon our service,  
we recognize our responsibility to provide such service with the  
highest possible degree of continuity.  
Although much can be and has been done to meet this respon-  
sibility by the installation of modern facilities, in the final analysis it  
_ can only be fully accomplished by having sufficient numbers of key  
personnel available to report for duty rapidly when emergency con-  
ditions arise.  
### STATEMENT OF POLICY  
All jobs designated in Article !V, Section 7 of the Labor Agree-  
ment have residence requirements and as such will be governed  
by the following statements:  
1. The residence requirement in accordance with Article IV,  
Section 7, Paragraphs A and B stipulates employees must  
live within thirty (30) miles’ driving distance between home  
and their Job Headquarters. Distance is defined as the mile-  
age driven on the most commonly used roads.  
2. All new employees and all employees in jobs that are not  
designated as having a residence requirement, who wish to  
be considered for jobs which are designated as having resi-  
dence requirement, must agree to move to a location within  
the prescribed requirements to the Job Headquarters or for-  
feit the right to be considered.  
3. Employees who are incumbents in a line of progression and  
are assigned to a Job Headquarters as of the date of this  
Agreement and whose jobs will now have a residence re-  
quirement will not be asked to move to retain their present  
job and will be considered for any future promotions in that  
line of progression at that particular Job Headquarters. How-  
ever, should these employees desire to be considered for  
promotions or transfers in other lines of progression or other  
work locations within their present line of progression, they  
will then be expected to meet the residence requirement of  
that job. For example, a Journeyman Lineman is assigned to  
189  
a Job Headquarters “A” and his home is beyond the pre-  
scribed travel limitations. He need not move to retain his  
present job and he will be considered for any future promo-  
tion at Job Headquarters “A”. However, should a promotion  
become available to him at any other work location, he must  
then agree to meet the residence requirements of that job. !n  
addition to the above, if employees decide to relocate their  
residence while in their incumbent position, they will be re-  
quired to comply with the residence requirement. Incumbent  
employees with residency waivers will continue under those  
waivers.  
Any employee who has agreed to move as a condition for  
placement in a job who subsequently refuses to honor his  
commitment shall be demoted or transferred to a job not  
having a residence requirement.  
Employees who are handled under the placement process  
will not be required to move to accept a job with residence  
requirements. However, such employees will be subject to  
the uniform residence requirement outlined above if they sub-  
sequently bid into jobs shown as having such a requirement.  
In addition, if the Company establishes a new Job Head-  
quarters either through consolidation of facilities or by build-  
ing new headquarters, employees whose jobs have residence  
requirements will not be subject to the new requirements as  
long as they continue to work at the new headquarters.  
It will be the joint responsibility of the employee and his su-  
pervisor to see that the provisions of the uniform residence  
requirements are maintained. However, disputes regarding  
the interpretation of the residence requirement will be resolved  
by the Local Chief Steward and the supervisor involved.  
It will not be mandatory that employees be required to move  
during the probationary period of their new job. They will,  
however, be required to conform to the provision of this policy  
within 90 days after the probationary period ends, unless an  
extension is granted by mutual agreement due to extenuat-  
ing circumstances.  
The Non-Supervisory Moving Plan (Exhibit D) will apply.

### EXHIBIT K  
### SUSQUEHANNA S.E.S.  
### SECURITY SCREENING ACCESS  
### AUTHORIZATION PROGRAM  
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires Nuclear Power  
Plant Licensees to have personnel security programs that are in  
conformance with 10 CFR 73.56 Personnel Access Authorization  
Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants. In compliance with this,  
the Company has developed an Access Authorization Program for  
employees who will work at Susquehanna SES or who will be in-  
volved with Susquehanna SES in any way. The program involves a  
screening process consisting of a background check and psycho-  
logical evaluation which has been described in full to the Union.  
Any changes to this program will be discussed with Local Union  
1600 before they are effective and the Union will receive copies of  
the Fitness For Duty Manual (FFD) and the Site Access Program  
Manual (SAPM}) and be kept informed of any proposed changes.  
Therefore, the Company and Union agree upon the following with  
regard to non-supervisory employees:  
I. Confidentiality of all information obtained during the security  
screening process will be protected as described in the “Site  
Access Program Manual.” Neither the employee’s supervi-  
sor nor the employee’s Union representatives will have ac-  
cess to this information unless the employee gives express  
written authorization to the Site Access Services Supervisor  
to release the information to the individual or individuals stated  
in the authorization.  
(|. Access authorization processing will be accomplished in ac-  
cordance with the “Site Access Program Manual.” The Local  
Union will be notified when a determination is made with re-  
gard to the denial of access for one of their members.  
Ill. As part of every job posting for positions at Susquehanna  
SES or for positions that are involved with the Plant, there is  
a statement in bold print at the top of the posting notifying  
candidates that they will be subject to security screening and  
will be required to obtain unescorted access authorization in  
191  
order to remain at Susquehanna. During employment inter-  
views, the individuals are advised that they may be subjected  
to a background check and psychological evaluation for the  
purpose of determining eligibility for unescorted access au-  
thorization, and are asked to sign written authorization to this  
effect. If an individual refuses to sign such an authorization,  
he/she will not be considered for employment with the Com-  
pany.  
. In accordance with Article Section 3 of this Agreement  
employees hired prior to September 27, 1976 are subject to  
the following security screening guidelines:  
A. Employees who agree to access authorization screening  
and are granted unescorted access as described in the  
Site Access Program Manual will be able to remain in  
their present position at Susquehanna SES; or will be eli-  
gible for work at Susquehanna on a temporary basis or  
permanent basis. This also applies to employees who will  
be involved with Susquehanna, but are not necessarily  
required to work at the Nuclear Plant.  
B. For all employees who agree to access authorization  
screening but are denied unescorted access (denials) or  
employees who refuse to give authorization for screening  
(refusals), and employees whose unescorted access has  
been revoked (revocation) the following will apply:  
(1) A committee of representatives of Union and Man-  
agement will be established to handle denials and  
refusals. The name of the committee will be the  
Susquehanna SES Access Authorization Committee.  
The make up of the Committee shall consist of two  
members designated by the Union and two members  
designated by Management. A fifth and impartial mem-  
ber will be selected and utilized by both parties as  
necessary.  
(2) In the case of denials:  
(a) For an employee presently working in a position  
at Susquehanna, or involved with the Plant, the  
Committee will determine where the employee  
192  
should be placed. This will be dependent upon  
such factors including but not limited to job va-  
cancies, employee's present and former position  
and the work record. Anything uncov-  
ered in the access authorization screening pro-  
cess will not be made known to the Committee  
handling the employee involved. The decision  
made by the Committee will be final and binding  
and not subject to Aniicte lil of the Labor Agree-  
ment.  
For present employees who may be needed for  
work at Susquehanna on a temporary basis, al-  
though these individuals will not be able to be sent  
to Susquehanna they will be used for assignments  
at other locations.  
(3) In the case of refusals:  
(a) The employee will be required to provide the Com-  
pany with a written statement that he/she has re-  
fused to participate in the access authorization  
screening process. A copy of this statement will  
be sent to the Local Union Office.  
(b) The employee will be advised that upon his/her  
refusal, the employee has a right to have the Com-  
mittee review his/her refusal.  
(i) lf the employee asks for a review, the Commit-  
tee will review the facts and make a finding as  
to the validity of the refusa! and  
the action to be taken. If the Committee  
reaches agreement, this determination will be  
final and binding and not subject to Article 1II  
of the Labor Agreement. If the Committee can-  
not reach agreement, it will submit the case to  
a mutually agreed upon arbitrator, the fifth  
member of the Committee as specified above.  
The arbitrator's decision witl be final and bind-  
ing and will not be subject to Article Ill of the

Committee, the Company will weigh the facts  
and then take a position with re-  
gard to the person’s employment status. This  
determination will be subject to Articte of the  
Labor Agreement.  
(4) In the case of revocation:  
(a) In addition to the appeal process in the Access  
Processing Manual and the Labor Agreemeni, any  
matters pertaining to revocation and subsequent  
placement of an employee will be resolved by the  
President-Financial Secretary of the Local and the  
Vice President-Human Resources.  
In accordance with Article Il, Section 3 of this Agreement

A.  
When it is. necessary to fill vacancies created by employ-  
ees who become eligible for LTD benefits, they shail be  
filled on a permanent rather than a temporary basis.  
. All requests to return to the work force from an LTD sta-  
tus, or subsequent to the cessation of the benefit, shall  
be predicated upon medical and/or psychological certifi-  
cation authorizing the employee's return to work.  
. fan employee is unable to return to their regular job from  
LTD, they shall be handled by the Disability Committee in  
accordance with Article VIll of the Labor Agreement.

designated leave periods:  
1. Employees either notifying the Company or returning  
‘to the Company within six (6) months from the effec-  
tive date of their LTD status shall return to their former  
job classification and former work location, provided  
they are capable of satisfactorily performing the du-  
ties of the job. They shall receive job seniority and  
Company service credit for the duration of their LTD  
absence. If a vacancy is not available when they are  
certified to return, they shall bump the junior employee  
in their former job classification at their former work  
location, provided the job classification vacancy cre-  
ated by the employee who left on LTD status was filled.  
In cases where the job classification vacancy is not  
filled and the employee returns from the LTD status,  
placement will be handled per paragraph H of this  
Exhibit L.  
2. Employees either notifying the Company or returning  
to the Company after six (6) months, but less that two  
(2) years from the effective date of their LTD status  
shall return to their former job classification and former  
195  
work location provided they are capable of perform-  
ing the duties of the job and such a vacancy exists.  
When they return to their former job classification at  
their former work location, their job seniority date will  
be adjusted for the period of their absence. However,  
Company service shail be credited for the duration of  
the leave. If a job vacancy in their former job classifi-  
cation at their former work location is not available,  
employees shall be returned to an available job va-  
cancy within the scope of their experience and skills  
with a commitment to their former job classification  
and work location. They shall receive the rate of pay  
commensurate with paragraph H of this Exhibit L.  
If they are returned to a job in another progression  
line, their commitment shall be eliminated if they sub-  
sequently change jobs voluntarily; promote within the  
new progression line; or do not take the first opportu-  
nity to exercise their commitment.  
3. Employees requesting to return to the work force af-  
ter cessation of their LTD payments and two (2) or  
more years from the effective date of their LTD status  
shall be placed in an entry level job vacancy, when  
available, in line with their experience and skills with  
no commitments. They shall receive the rate of pay  
commensurate with the job to which they are returned.  
A new job seniority date shall be established; how-  
ever, Company service shall be credited for the dura-  
tion of the leave.  
E. Employees who have not returned to the work force within  
a two (2)-year period from the effective date of their LTD  
status and who do not qualify for continued benefits un-  
der the LTD Plan shall be notified by the Company when  
their LTD benefit ceases, with a reminder that failure to  
request a return to work within ninety (90) days from noti-  
fication of benefit cessation shall result in termination of  
their employment.  
196  
F. In alt cases of return to the work force as cited above,  
vacation shall be prorated as follows:  
1. Vacation - calendar year basis. Example - Employee

1992. In accordance with Article Vii, Section 3, Para-  
graph | of the Labor Agreement, vacation for 1992 will:  
be prorated based on time worked in 1991, and em-  
ployee will be paid off prior to leaving on LTD. There-  
fore, employee is not eligible for further vacation en-  
titlement for 1992. In 1993, the employee will receive  
ten-twelfths’ (10/12) vacation entitlement based on  
total time worked in 1992.  
G. When employees return to their former job classification  
and former work location, step increases and apprentice-  
ship program anniversary dates for returns in D-1 and D-  
2 above shall be resumed in accordance with the sched-  
ule in effect at the time the employees left on LTD.  
H. The Joint Disability Committee will have the op-  
tion to temporarily place a permanent, partially  
disabled employee returning from Long Term Dis-  
ability into an existing 40-hour, 52-week Utility  
Worker position. If this option is selected, the  
Committee will attempt to find a suitable Utility  
Worker position at the same or closest location.  
An employee returning from Long Term Disability with-  
out restrictions will be given the option of being placed  
in an existing 40-hour, 52-week Utility Worker posi-  
tion until a permanent placement becomes available  
in accordance with Exhibit L. If this option is selected  
the Company will attempt to find a suitable Utility  
Worker position at the same or closest location,  
Employees returning to work from Long Term Disabit-  
ity to an assigned job that has a lower rate of pay than  
their former job classification shall not receive a rate  
of pay less than the following percent of their regular  
rate of pay in their former job classification.  
197  
Less than 20 Years — 75%  
20 or more Years— 100%  
Employees have the responsibility to notify the Com-  
pany of their desire to return to work as soon as pos-  
sible. If the Company disagrees with the medical opin-  
ion to return the employee to work and requires an  
Independent Medical Examination (IME) or Indepen-  
dent Psychological Examination (IPE), the Company  
will have three weeks from the date the Company re-  
ceives the appropriate medical information from the  
employee's treating health care professional(s) to  
schedule and conduct its examination. The Company  
will be given another two weeks to receive and re-  
view the results of the IME/IPE. In addition, the Com-  
pany will be provided an additional two weeks to test  
the employee (if necessary) and provide a suitable job  
placement for return to work. If the results of the  
Company’s examination are the same as the  
employee’s health care provider(s), wages of the even-  
tual job placement will begin no later than seven weeks  
after the Company’s receipt of the employee’s  
medical information. After the employee returns  
to work, the Company will reimburse the em-  
ployee for time and mileage associated with test-  
ing for job placement. The Company will have met  
its seven week job placement commitment if the  
employee declines a sultable Utility Worker posi-  
tion. However, the employee will continue to be  
considered for other suitable positions under  
Exhibit L-.

‘take place only after he has returned to work.  
Any disability that extends from one calendar year  
into the succeeding calendar year or beyond an  
employee's anniversary date in any calendar year shall  
not entitle an employee to additional wage allowance  
for sick leave until he has returned to work and has  
met the requirements of Paragraph (1) above.  
In the event a regular employee is absent from work

case the Company will make no payment to the em-  
ployee. While absent from work under this provision,  
employees will continue to accrue Company service  
but shall not accrue allowances for vacation or mini-  
vacation.

employee receives payment because of occupational  
disease or injury shall not be deducted from the wage  
or salary allowance time to which an employee is en-  
titled in such calendar year as shown in the above  
schedule.
