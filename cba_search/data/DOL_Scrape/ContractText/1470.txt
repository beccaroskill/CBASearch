### PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO MAKE  
### CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDS  
The failure of any Employer to pay required contribu-  
tions to the Welfare, Pension, Supplemental  
Unemployment Benefit, Apprenticeship Training and  
retraining, Annuity and Savings Funds, or to pay interest  
on such delinquencies, or legal and auditing fees and costs  
assessed against such delinquent Employer, as provided  
herein, shall constitute a violation of this Agreement and  
the Union shall be authorized to remove the Employees  
from the job, in which case they shall report for work daily  
and shall be paid a day’s pay of eight (8) hours until the  
Employer settles his delinquent payments of contribu-  
tions, interest, legal and auditing fees with the Fund  
Administrator. If any Employer has a record of delin-  
quency on a prior job, the Union shall refuse to permit  
Employees to work for such Employer, until all such delin-  
quencies have been paid to the respective Funds, includ-  
ing interest and and auditing fees.  
If the Trustees or the Fund Administrator of any of said  
Funds is rquired to utilize legal services to collect  
Employer delinquencies or auditing services to ascertain  
the correct amount due from the Employer, the delin-  
quent Employer shall be required to pay, in addition to  
2% over the Prime Interest Rate, interest from date of  
delinquency, the reasonable cost of the auditing services  
and, in addition thereto, legal fees at the following rates:  
15% on the first $750.00; 10% on any amount in excess of  
$750.00; minimum collector fee of $15.00; and 50% on any  
amount fess than $100.00, due and payable on default.  
All contributions required to be made to any of the  
aforementioned Funds by the Employer shall be made on  
a weekly basis on the day the Employees are paid by the  
Employer delivering to the Lead Engineer or Shop  
Steward drafts made payable to each said Fund, in the  
imount required for each, for delivery to the Fund  
19  
Administrator, together with completed forms, furnished  
by each Fund, indicating the names of all Employees,  
number of hours worked or paid and amount of hourly  
wages as required, together with amount of contribution  
for each Employee to each Fund. Such periodic reporting  
forms must be filed by the Employer with the Fund(s)  
regardless of whether any contributions are due and owing  
the Fund(s) in the reporting period unless the Trustees  
upon application of the Employer excuse him from so  
reporting. In the event that the contributions are due and  
owing in the reporting period, the Employer shall so state  
on the form and the reasons therefore. With regard to the  
Savings Fund, the Employer shall furnish to each  
Employee on payday a statement of the amount of money  
contributed on behalf of such Employee to the said Fund.  
The Funds Trustees will have the right to conduct period-  
ic payroll audits of companies signatory to this  
Agreement.  
The Trustees in their discretion may permit an  
Employer to make monthly instead of weekly contribu-  
tions where the contribution record of the Employer justi-  
fies such an action.  
All covered by this Agicement must fic  
with the Trustees of the Fringe Benefit Plan, a Surety  
Company Bond in an amount no less than $25,000.00 in  
order to insure payment by them to the various Fringe  
Benefit Plans. The Trustees shall determine the amount of  
such Surety Bond. The Trustees shall also have the power  
to fix a lesser Bond for any Employer who pays weekly  
where the contribution record of such Employer justifies  
such action. However, effective January 1, 1982, any  
Employer may have as an alternative option the opportu-  
nity to purchase combination stamps from the 825 Fund  
Facility and in lieu of posting a Surety Bond will contribute  
directly to the Employee these stamps as a medium of pay-  
ment to the various contributory Funds in the amount  
determined by hours paid. The payment of stamps to each  
Employee will be made on a weekly basis on the  
Employer’s normal payday. (Article XI hereof}.  
No officers, agents, representatives or Employees of  
any Union or of any Employer shall be deemed an agent  
or representative of the Board(s) of Trustees or be  
deemed as authorized to make any oral or written repre-  
sentations, or give any form of commitment which may be  
relied upon by any Employee, his or her spouse, benefi-  
ciary or dependent. It is further agreed and understood  
that no single Trustee or Employee(s) of any Fund has  
authority to give any such representations or comitments  
since such representations or commitments can only be  
made by the Board of Trustees acting as Boards of  
Trustees.
