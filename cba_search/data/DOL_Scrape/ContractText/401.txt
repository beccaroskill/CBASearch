sociation in writing the employer may assign or permit assign-  
ment of excepted work to any other class of workers consistent  
with such waiver or interpretation. Among the waivers and in-  
terpretations that have been made and accepted are: (See Ap-  
pendix f, Memorandum of Understanding between [LWU and  
### IBT)  
1.41 The Employers have the right to have trucks come

shoremen, certified as capable of performing work  
now assigned by the Pacific Maritime Association  
member company to nonlongshoremen, are avail-  
able, such longshoremen will be assigned to such  
work, provided no union jurisdictional work stop-  
pages are caused and provided that such trained  
skilled longshoremen may be assigned to any skilled  
work they are capable of performing without limita-  
tion by reason of specialization.  
(b) Where Pacific Maritime Association or its member  
companies have existing bargaining relationships,  
_ have granted recognition to, and have assigned work  
to bona fide labor unions as a result of such relation-  
ships and recognition; or where status quo excep-  
tions relating to other unions are now set forth in  
Section 1, International Longshore and Warehouse  
Union will not make any jurisdictional claim or  
cause any jurisdictional work stoppage dispute in-  
volving Pacific Maritime Association or such mem-  
ber companies with relation to such work  
assignments. However, if the Union obtains the right  
to represent and bargain for such workers and no ju-  
risdictional work stoppage problems are created, the  
Association agrees that such exceptions regarding  
assignment of work to longshoremen will be elimi-  
nated.  
1.51 Theindividual employer sha!l not be deemed to be in  
violation of the terms of the Contract Document assigning  
work to longshoremen if he assigns work to a nonlongshore-  
man on the basis of a good-faith contention that this ts permit-  
ted under an exception provided for herein.  
### SCOPE OF THIS CONTRACT DOCUMENT AND SECTION 1  
### ASSIGNMENT OF WORK TO LONGSHOREMEN  
1.52 Should there be any dispute as to the existence or  
terms of any exception, or should there be no reasonable way  
to perform the work without the use of nonlongshoremen,  
work shall continue as directed by the employer while the dis-  
pute is resolved hereunder.  
1.53 Any such dispute shall be immediately placed before |  
the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee by the party at-  
tacking any claimed exception or proposing any change in an  
exception or any new exception. The Joint Coast Labor Rela-  
tions Committee decision shall be promptly issued and shal] be  
final unless and until changed by the parties or that Committee.  
The Committee may act on the grounds set forth in Section  
1.54 or on any other grounds. Both parties agree that its posi-  
tion on such 4 dispute shall in no case be supported by, or give  
rise to threat, restraint or coercion.  
1.54 Any such dispute that is not so resolved by the Com-  
mittee within 7 days after being placed before it, may be placed  
before the Coast Arbitrator on motion of either party. The Ar-  
bitrator shall decide whether an exception should be upheld  
and may do so on the following grounds only:  
(a) Nonlongshoremen were assigned the skilled or un-  
skilled labor in dispute under practices existing as of  
January-August 10, 1959, armved al by mutual con-  
sent and as thereafter modified or defined by the par-  
ties or the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee,

by and work cannot commence, continue or resume because of  
bad weather (such determination to be made by the employer)  
and the men are not ordered back after a midshift meal (See  
Section 3,23);  
3.1213 When extra longshoremen from the skilled  
classifications are ordered and tured to on an operation of  
short duration and are not shifted thereafter to comparable  
work on other docks or ships and are not ordered back after a  
midshift meal (See Section 3.24).  
3.1214 When men employed at Selby, California,  
are not shifted to other operations to fill out the 8-hour guaran-  
tee (See Section 3.27), and  
3.1215 As provided in Section 3.3.  
3.122 Where men have been ordered and fail to report  
to work at all or on time, thus delaying the start of an operation,  
the time lost thereby until replacements have been provided or  
until the man or gang has been tumed to shal! be deducted from  
. the 8-hour guarantee.  
3.123 When gangs are traveled and, as a result, their  
starting time is later than 9:00 a.m. so that itis impossible to fill  
out the 8-hour guarantee between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., the

hour guarantee, otherwise the guarantee is only 4 hours. Ef men  
are not shifted to other work bul are ordered back after a mid-  
shift meal, a second 4-hour minimum shall apply.  
3.13 Accompanying the obligation placed upon the em-  
ployers to furnish 8 hours of work each shift is the obligation  
on the part of the men to shift from one job to another when  
such move is ordered by the employers. Subject to the provi-  
stons hereunder the employers shall have the right to shift men  
and gangs, and men and gangs shall shift as ordered.  
3.131 Askill rated longshoreman may be shifted only  
toskill rated work suitable to his qualifications. (Note: See Sec-  
tions 4.32 and 10.32{e).)

barges, except that longshoremen listed on port lists, as agreed  
by Joint Port Labor Relations Committees as men being Jimit-  
ed to dock work, shall not be shifted to work aboard ships.  
{2} This Section 3,133 as it relaies to certain longshore-  
men being limited to dock work, is intended to im-  
plement reference in Coast Labor Relations  
Committee Meeting No. 28, December 27, 1961  
conceming the preferential assignment of dock work  
to “men either old or disabled.” It is understood that  
the Joint Port Labor Relations Committees will pre-  
18  
### SECTION 3 GUARANTEES  
pare such lists of men who are “old or disabled,” and  
who consequently wil] not be shifted away from  
dock work. The Joint Port Labor Relations Commit-  
tees shall limit such lists to those in fact old or dis-  
abled and shall consider the normal volume of dock  
work in the port and the shifting of men from ship to  
dock, in order that the number of men on preferred  
dock assignment lists may have sufficient work op-  
portunity to make reasonable hours of employment.  
(b) Included in such lists shall be machine operators  
(bull drivers} in order that such men, not necessarily  
filling the classification “old or disabled,” shal! not  
be forced off machines and put to work hand han-  
dling cargo on dock or ship. The period of time such  
machine operators have been doing such work shall  
be the major factor to be used by Joint Port Labor Re-  
lations Committees in placing such men on preferen-  
tial lists. This Section of the Contract Document shall  
not be construed to mean a guarantee of work or pay  
if insufficient work is provided.  
3.134 Employers may shift men from shovel, freezer,  
and calk shoe work to any other work including all dock and car  
work. When so shifted, the penalty cargo rate shall not prevail.  
The employer may not shift men dispatched for general cargo  
to shovel, freezer or cafk shoe work.  
3.135 The employer shall have the right to peel off  
gangs at any time during a shift or at the end of a shifl. The re-  
maining gangs can work at all gears.  
3.1351 The employers have the nght to order back  
after any shift only such gangs as are needed to finish the re-  
maining work. Such gang or gangs ordered back must be the  
gang or gangs which the employer believes in good faith have

the most work to do at their gear. They may be required to fin-  
ish the work at the gear of the released gangs. Under such cir-  
cumstances the gear prionty of the gangs released is  
suspended. Any gang peeled off under this rule cannot de re-  
placed at its gear by a new gang from the dispatching hall until  
the second subsequent comparable shift.  
3.1352 Gangs ordered to work under conditions  
which such gangs contend violate gear priority rules shal! work  
as directed and claim(s} forsuch violation shall be presented by  
the union. IFit is established that a gear priority violation did  
occur, then it will be automatic that the amount of time anoth-  
er gang worked in the hatch in which the gear priority violation  
was Claimed will be paid the gang whose gear priority was vi-  
olated on an hour for hour basis, unless the employer on whose  
ship the alleged gear priority violation occurred maintains that  
such incident happened for reasons beyond the employer’s  
control. The employer may then take that position and process  
it through the grievance procedure to the Area Arbitrator for fi-  
nal decision.  
3.136 The shifting of registered and limited registered  
men shail be carried out without bumping.  
3.137 Any gear priority rule will not prevent the  
shifting of men and gangs for the purpose of fulfilling the 8-  
hour guarantee.  
3.138 No “center line” and “imaginary bulkhead” or  
similar practices which result in division of work among gangs

or for the start of the next day’s shift. [f extended hours are re-  
quired to permit the second ship to shift or sail, the men or  
gangs will work up to but not beyond the end of the extension  
provided in Section 2.  
3.444 Men or gangs may be ordered to shift from a job

manning for holdmen shal] be 4 holdmen, subject to  
the Union’s right to claim that additional holdman  
manning is required because of onerousness. In such  
event the agreed-to procedure on “Onerousness” is  
to be followed to resolve such a dispute.  
(c) When cranes are utilized to load cargo to ordischarge

(b) If the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee under  
step (a) above does not reach agreement on the ship  
manning proposed by the employers, the matter shall  
be immediately referred 10 the Area Arbitrator for

Onerous Workload.  
11.41 Health and safety exception, Longshoremen shaii  
not be required to work when in good faith they believe that to  
doso is to immediately endanger health and safety. Only in cas-  
es of bona fide health and safety issues may a standby be justi-  
fied, The Union pledges in goad faith that health and safety will  
not be used as a gimmick. The employer shalt have the option  
of having the men who raise a question of health and safety  
stand by until a decision is reached or “working around” the sit-  
uation until itcan be resolved, and no further work shall be per-  
formed on that disputed operation until the health and safety  
issue is resolved.  
11.42 Onerous workload exception. Longshoremen on  
cargo handling operations shall not be required to work when  
in good faith they believe that to do so will result in an onerous  
workload. The Union piedges in good faith that the onerous  
workload claim will not be used as a gimmick. The employer  
shal] have the option of having the men claiming onerousness  
stand by until a decision is reached or “working around” the sit-  
uation until it can be resolved.  
11.421 When a man is directed to take his own relief  
without a man being assigned to relieve him, this does not au-  
tomatically present a question of onerousness of work or tndi-  
vidual] speedup for the men remaining on the job, regardless of  
the basic gang structure involved. A change in operations or  
manning to remove unnecessary men, or the handling of larg-  
er loads does not, in and of itself, automatically present any  
question of onerousness of work or individual speedup.

insuch cases, they shall be the Joint Coast Labor Re-

11,4221 The foregoing Section 11,422 is intended  
to mean that agreements reached on changed operations or re-  
duced manning in accordance with the Contract procedures  
shall not be challenged as being onerous operations if no fur-  
ther change has been made following such agreement. In oth-

ofequal numbers ofemployer and employee representatives at  
the job level. Each category of employees should be represent-  
ed. Emptoyers’ representatives should be from the superviso-  
ry level. The purpose of the committees will be to obtain the  
interest of the men in accident prevention by making them re-  
alize that they have a part in the program, to direct their atten-  
hon to the real causes of accidents and provide a means for  
making practical use of the intimate knowledge of working  
conditions and practices of the men on the job. It is further in-  
tended that this program will produce mutually practical and  
effective recommendations regarding corrections of accident-  
producing circumstances and conditions.

17.512 The Coast Arbitrator shall be selected by the  
Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee to serve a term coex-  
tensive with the term of the Agreement. The Coast Arbitrator  
may be reappointed for the term of the next Agreement by mu-  
tual agreement of the Parties. The Coast Arbitrator shall be a  
highly qualified neutral arbitrator with maritime experience,  
located on the West Coast. [f the Committee fails to agree on  
the selection of the Coast Arbitrator, the individual shall be se- .  
lected by a 6-person panel of prominent industry representa-  
tives: 3 selected by the Union and 3 selected by the Employers.  
17.5121 Ifafler thirty (30} days, the Panel is unable  
to select 2 Coast Arbitrator, the Panel shall submit to the Fed-  
era! Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) a request for  
alist of seven (7) highly qualified neutral arbitrators with mar-  
itime experience, located on the West Coast. If the Union and  
the Employer representatives agree that the list is unaccept-  
abie, they may jointly request that the FMCS provide a second  
list. In the event, the Parties cannot mutually select a Coast Ar-  
bitrator from the FMCS Panel, the selection shall be deter-  
mined by a striking process. The first strike shall be determined  
by a coin flip. The Party that correctly calls the coin flip shal]  
have the choice of striking first or last.  
Note: John Kagel will succeed Sam Kagel as Coast  
Arbitrator upon the effective date of this contract (February |,  
2003). It is agreed that since PMA nominated John Kagel, in  
the event a FMCS Panel is required to select the successor to  
John Kagel, the Union shall have the choice of a first or last  
strike. Thereafter, the procedure of coin flip set forth in Section  
17.512] shall apply.

arising under the Agreement including cases dealing with the

17.53 Arbitrators’ decisions must be based upon the show-  
ing of facts and their application under the specific provisions  
of the written Agreement and be expressly confined to, and ex-  
tend only to, the particular issue in dispute. The arbitrators  
shall have power to pass upon any and all objections to their ju-  
rsdiction. [fan arbitrator holds that a particular dispute does  
not arise under the Agreement, then such dispute shall be sub-  
Ject to arbitration only by mutual consent,

tion in an informal hearing; such referral may be prior to for-  
mal disagreement in any Joint Labor Relations Committee or  
upon failure to agree on the question in the Joint Area Labor  
Relations Committee. Such hearing may be ex parte if either  
party fails or refuses to participate, provided that the arbitrator  
may temporarily delay an ex parte hearing to permit immedi-  
ale bona fide efforts to settle an issue without a heanng.  
17.62 The arbitrator shal] act with his powers limited

proceedings nor shall employment of counsel be necessary.

im ruling with respect to the grievance or dispute and thereafter  
confirn it in writing. An interim ruling shall be binding on the  
parties regarding the particular issue on the particular ship on

Labor Relations Committee, provided that the arbitrator  
may temporarily delay a hearing to permit prompt bona fide  
efforts to settle the question in the Port or Area Joint Labor  
Relations Committee.

intenm ruling can be waived by consent of both parties with  
respect to any particular dispute or grievance. If al the begin-  
92  
### SECTION 17 JOINT LABOR RELATIONS COMMITTEES, ADMINISTRATION  
### OF AGREEMENT, AND GRIEVANCE PROCEOURES  
ning of the informal procedure either party establishes a good  
faith claim that an issue, other than a dispute with respect to  
Section } 1, is of general significance or that the forma! proce-  
dure will be necessary to settle such issue, the arbitrator shall  
role that the informal procedure be bypassed regarding such is-  
suc. Inthe absence of such waiver or decision to bypass, the ar-  
bitrator shall hold an informal hearing and issue an interim  
ruling regarding the dispute in accordance with the procedure  
set forth above.

of this Section. Any employer may file with the Union a com-  
plaint against any member of the Union and the Union shali act  
thereon and notify the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee

PMACES facilities within the Port Area CFS Zone.  
(a) Containers of convenience. Where the vesset operat-  
ing carrier requires cargo to be transferred from one  
container to another, or where containers are utilized  
by the vessel operating carrier for its own conve-  
nience, the stuffing or unstuffing of such cargo shall  
be performed by employees covered by the [LWU-

Memorandum of Understanding,  
4.521 Existing Contracts. Where there are existing  
contracts between ILWU locals and vessel operating carters  
and/or CFS employers, a transition period will end no later  
than the expiration dates of such contracts. Where there is a ju-  
risdictional problem between two segments of the [LWU hav-  
ing to do with stuffing and unstuffing of containers, containers  
will be discharged or loaded without penalty and as directed by  
the employer without interference by the ILWU, and the ILWU  
wiil be responsible for solving its own jurisdictional problems.  
1.522 Subcontracting. All vessel operating carriers, or  
other employers covered by the ILWU-PMA Pacific Coast  
Longshore and Clerks’ Agreement or this CFS Supplement  
thereto, shal! discontinue their past practice of subcontracting  
of stuffing or unstuffing of containers and to refrain from fu-  
ture subcontracting work as defined in CFS Sections 1.5 and  
1.5(a) to employers not parties to this Agreement, except that  
such subcontracting practices may continue during the period  
legally required by the subcontract plus any additional time re-  
quired to build, expand, lease, equip, or provide facilities to be  
operated within the Port Area CFS Zone under the PCL&CA  
orthis CFS Supplement. During such period containers may be  
received from or delivered to such subcontractars without  
penalty, but such penalty-free period shall not extend beyond  
35 days following the implementation date set forth in this doc-  
ument. Each company having subcontracts will promptly no-  
tify PMA of the date it will be operating under this Agreement  
and such information shall be furnished to the Union.  
1.5221 All vessel operating carriers shall be re-  
quired to have all LCL (less-than-container load) cargo which  
is booked and/or controlled by them stuffed or unstuffed by  
163

Clerks’ Agreement or this CFS Supplement thereto, unless any  
of the exceptions stated in CFS Section 1.5 are applicable. All  
published LCL tariffs and/or advertisements shall delete all  
references to off-dock Container Freight Stations where such  
work on behalf of vessel operating carriers has been performed  
in the past by other employees.  
1.52211 The language in CFS Section 1.5221  
above which reads “all LCL cargo whichis booked and/or con-  
trolled by them” includes such cargo which 1s stuffed or un-  
stuffed by a non-vessel operating carrier (NVOCC), freight  
forwarder, or consolidator within the Port Area CFS Zone, if  
such company is owned by a vessel operating carrier or the ves-  
sel operating carrier has a proprietary financial interest in the  
company.  
1.52212 CFS Sections 1.533 and 1.534 shall not  
be used as a subterfuge by any vessel operating carrier to avoid  
their obligation set forth in CFS Section 1.522] above. Any vi-  
olation found to be a subterfuge or deliberate evasion of re-  
sponsibility on the part of the vessel operating carrier shall  
result in the penalty set forth in CFS Section 1.54 doubled toa

### CFS PROGRAM FUND  
The parties acknowledge their mutual interests in develop-  
ing productive work opportunities that preserve fordockwork-  
ers their work and living standards. Such a program will retain  
and attract to the industry responsible, reliable and skilled per-  
sons whose availabslity will assure a stable work force and will  
minimize the costs of those industry programs that are now re-  
quired when work is unavailable,  
The parties recognize that the continued movement of con-  
tainer work from the docks jeopardizes their aforesaid mutual  
interests. They desire to reverse that movement and encourage  
the establishment, development and growth of efficient and  
productive container freight stations on the docks to preserve  
the work which has historically been performed by the long-  
shore work force.  
To achieve these ends they have agreed as follows:  
(1) The employers will expend annually during the term  
of this contract approximately $3 million to be raised  
upon containerized cargo tonnage. (The reference to  
a is not acap upon the sum the em-  
ployers may be required to expend annually to  
achieve the objectives ‘of this program.) The funds  
shall be managed by PMA and distributed by it to  
those of its members who operate CFS facilities,  
such distribution to be on a basis which will encour-  
age the preservation, growth and increase of such  
container stuffing and unstuffing facilities, PMA will  
report periodically to the Union on the receipts and  
disbursements of the Fund.  
(2) The provisions of the Container Freight Station Sup-  
plement shall] not be burdened by arbitration deci-  
sions or past practices prior to July 1, 1984 whether  
189

oral or written. Any restrictions on the employer that  
are in conflict with the provisions of the Container  
Freight Station Supplement will be considered null  
and  
(3) The parties will henceforth commit themselves to in-  
creasing CFS productivity and the elimination of  
wasteful work practices.  
(4) The parties agree to set up committee to report  
periodically to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Com-  
mittee on the progress of this program and to make  
recommendations as to further implementation.  
(5) Disputes which arise with respect to this program  
shall be first referred to the Joint Port Labor Rela-  
tions Committee for the port where the dispute may  
arise and, if necessary, may be referred by either par-  
ty to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee and  
then by either party to the Coast Arbitrator.  
(6) This program may be terminated with the mutual  
written consent of the parties upon 60 days’ written  
notice to afl employers receiving distributions under  
this program and, inall events, this program shall im-  
mediately terminate if the provisions of CFS Sec-  
tions 1.5 through 1.543 of the 1970-7] Container  
Freight Station Supplement and CFS Sections 1.53,  
1.54, 1.55 and 1.57 ofthe amended Container Freight  
Station Supplement that were entered into February  
10, 1972 are determined to be legally enforceable.

### SKILLED HOLDMEN — HOLDMEN  
### CAPABLE OF DRIVING LIFTS  
CLRC No. 11, August 5, 1966 (Item 2(e}}  
The Employers stated they will not pay the skill differential  
to men until they are capable of driving lifts,  
The Union suggested the approach that where it is recog-  
nized at the local level that a gang does not have qualified ma-  
chine operators therein, then prior to the 2 men receiving-the  
differential, holdmen capable of driving lifts will replace them  
in the gang.  
It is the dispatchers’ obligation to make up gangs properly,  
and this now iacludes providing 2 holdmen capable of driving  
lifts.  
It was further agreed as follows:  
1. In gang boss ports, itis the gang bosses’ obligation to see  
to it the basic gang is properly constituted, and the holdmen ca-  
pable of driving lifts are to be designated by him, where there

patchers’ responsibility to see that the basic gang is properly  
constituted on dispatch;  
2. other ports the dispatchers shall dispatch the prop-  
er holdmen;  
3. Should the employer find there are no holdmen capable  
of driving lifts he may—  
(a) Swing in'skilled men from the dock who are not on  
the old or disabled preferential] list and swing out the  
. holdmen who were dispatched as the men capable of  
driving tifts, or  
(b) Discharge the gang, or  
(c} Call for replacements, or  
(d) Suspend the skill differential, and  
(e) Process the compiaint through the grievance ma-  
chinery. .  
4. The local LRC’s have the discretion of filling these  
skilled hold jobs with either Class A or Class B longshoremen,  
and such men are to be regularly attached to the gang.  
CLRC No. 21, November 3, 1967 (Item 2)  
The Committee again discussed the issues in this case and  
agreed that if there are no lift drivers available, meaning if no  
lift drivers are employed by the employer in the dock or termi-  
nal area, skilled holdmen may operate the lift on the dock for  
the purpose of bringing or removing gear or other necessary  
equipment to or from the hatch when no productive work is  
being performed.

### IN LIEU OF TIME  
CLAC No. 7, May 4, 1961 (Item 3)  
in Liew of Time |  
The parties have discussed and have reached agreement on  
a general rule covering the assignment of work set forth in Sec-  
of the Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement. It was fur-  
ther agreed thai the adoption of this general rule for assignment  
of work under Section |.6 will not be interpreted to support  
claims for in lieu of pay for work performed by American  
crews under the status quo understanding.  
Subject to the foregoing understanding the parties agree:  
(1) Longshoremen shall be assigned to work covered by  
Section 1.6commencing when the ship is tied up on and  
ending when lines are let go for the ship to leave the dock, ex-  
cept for the purpose of shifting within a port. (Shifts between  
poris shall nat be included in longshore work assignment.)  
(2) Exceptions to (1) above are as follows:  
(a) The crew may be used for the complete rigging of the  
Jumbo gear.  
(b) The crew may secure gear, lower booms, and swing  
in booms alongside the dock.  
(c) Handling ship’s siores, If loads are to be built on the  
dock and ship’s gear is to be used, longshoremen  
shall build the loads and handle gear to land such  
loads on deck. During a shift when no jongshoremen  
are employed the crew may use ship’s gear to bring  
Stores aboard.  
The agreement to assign the above described work to long-  
shoremen shall not result in the payment of in lieu of time to  
Jongshoremen if such work is performed by crew members un-

CLRC No. 25, October 30, 1961 (Item 4) In Lieu  
of Time—interpretation of Paragraph 2(c}  
(Reference is made to CLRC Meeting No. 7, May 4, 1961,  
ftem 3.)  
The agreement reached on “In Liew of Time” in the meeting  
of the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee noted above is  
noi to be interpreted so as to support claims for in lieu of pay for  
work normally and properly performed by un-  
der the status quo understanding ortoalter such understanding.  
Thus, the agreement to assign work as described to longshore-  
men does not result in payment of in lieu of time to longshore-  
men if such work is performed by crew members under the  
status quo for American ships. ;  
Reference is made ta the following paragraph as contained  
in the above noted minutes:  
(c) Handling Ship’s Stores. If loads are to be built on the  
dock and ship’s gear isto be used, longshoremen shall build the  
loads and handle gear to land such loads on deck. During a shift  
when no longshoremen are employed the crew may use ship’s  
gear to bring stores aboard.  
The Committee agrees that the crew under the above lan-  
guage would not be used during meal hours or between shafts.  
Ship's stores may be hand-carried aboard by the crew, If no  
longshore gangs are on the ship during a shift, the crew can use  
the gear (includes conveyor or sideport operation) and load  
ship’s stores, including the building of loads.  
It was further agreed that:  
1. Ship's stores that have been pre-palletized may be hoist-  
ed aboard ship (to be thereafter de-palletized and stowed by  
ship’s crew) by any longshore gang already employed on the

ship providing sucha gang hasin its complement winch drivers  
and hatch tender, front men or swingmen to hook on the loads,  
and sufficient holdmen or swingmen as part of the gang on  
board to unhook said loads. A gang may be supplemented to  
reach this complement,  
2. Ship's stores delivered to ship’s side that are to be built  
into loads on the dock and then hoisted aboard ship to be there-  
after de-palletized and stowed by ship’s crew can be so built  
and hoisted aboard with a basic gang that is already employed.  
Two of the 4 holdmen will assist the front men in building the  
loads on the dock, and the cther 2 holdmen will unhook the  
loads on the deck.  
3. Iffongshoremen are directed by an employer to stow the  
stores in the various appropriate lockers or compartments, the  
basic 4 holdmen gang must be supplemented by not fewer than  
4 swingmen; however, the contractual exception in paragraph  
23 of the October 18, 1960 Memorandum of Agreement shall  
apply, and the gang may Or may not be further supplemented on  
the ship or dock, based on the needs of the operation at the em-  
ployer’s option.  
4, Where standing gear is not being used to load stores,  
longshoremen when employed to load stores under these cir-  
cumstances shal] be employed in such.numbers, skilled and  
unskilled, as required for the particular operation.  
The parties agreed that in connection with the above under-  
standing, the matter shall be reviewed by the Joint Coast Labor  
Relations Committee in 90 days or during a subsequent wage  
review.

The Committee, after discussion, agreed that when the  
Union alleges that the crew is or has been performing long-  
shore work on which an “in lieu of” claim will be filed, such no-  
tification must be given to the stevedoring company involved  
and/or the Association within 24 hours. On Sundays and holi-

### JOBS OF SHORT DURATION  
CLRAC No. 25, October 30, 1961 (Item 1)  
Amended in CLRC No. 12, June 23, 1962 (ftem 1)  
The Coast Committee is aware that ithas ruled on many dis-  
putes on this subject, but desired to define a job of short dura-  
tion so that it would be clearly understood. The Commitiee  
agreed upon the following definition:  
An operation of short duration is one which is comprised of  
the following elements and only when the order is placed fora  
man of short duration;  
l, It must be 6 hours or less with no meal.  
2. It pertains to the man and not the gang.  
3. It pertains toa man ina skilled classification (i.e., winch  
drivers, lift truck operators, bull drivers, etc.).  
4. it pertains to a specific shift.  
§. lt requires a 4-hour minimum  
6. It allows a skilled man to be shifted to comparable work  
on the original ship or dock.  
7. Askilled man may be shifted to comparable work on an-  
other ship or dock but if this is done, such a man receives an 8-  
hour guarantee rather than the 4-hour guarantee.  
8. Askilled man of short duration shal] be ordered at regu-  
lar dispatch to start the job at any time. This does not preclude  
orders for jobs of short duration during the course of the shift  
where the need could not be foreseen at regular ordering time.  
9. Askilled man of short duration must be one supplement-  
ing askilled man of the same skill already on the job on the shift  
in which the requirement for the extra skill man occurs. Each  
shift stands on its own insofar as employment of short duration  
is concerned.  
   
221  
### NO DISCRIMINATION ADDENDA  
Example 1. A jeb of short duration beginning after the  
midshift meal but not completed by the end of that shift may  
be continued on the next immediate shift as day follows night  
or night follows day, with another man employed for a job of  
short duration,  
Example2. Ajob ofshort duration during a given shift and  
completed before the end of such shift and with cargo apera-  
tions not requiring the man of short duration occurring afterhis -  
release, may be repeated on the next comparable shift and both  
such jobs shall be considered as jobs of short duration.  
Example3, Ajob of short duration during a given shift and  
completed at the end shift and with cargo operations not  
requiring a man of short duration at the beginning of the next  
comparable shift will permit the employment ofa man of short  
duration on that next comparable shift.  
Example 4, It is not permissible under the Agreement to  
consider as jobs of short duration work which takes a man of  
short duration to the end of one shift and the start of the next  
comparable shift. Employment on such a basis will require  
payment of 8-hour guarantees on both such shifts.  
### NO DISCRIMINATION

### EEO POLICIES & PROCEDURES ADDENDA  
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and its  
Locals (ILWU) that discrimination, harassment, and retalia-  
tion of any kind for filing or supporting a complaint of dis-  
crimination or harassment, committed by anyone, will not be  
tolerated in connection with any action subject to the terns  
of the Pacific Coast Longshore & Clerk’s Agreement (the  
PCLCA or Agreement) {including at work sites, joint dis-  
patch halls, training sites, and other locations, when reason-  
ably related to employment covered by this Agreement).  
The policy against discrimination and harassment stated in  
Section 13 of the Pacific Coast Longshore & Clerk's Agreement  
shall be administered as described in this document.  
2. Responsibility for Following Section 13.2  
All longshore workers, clerks, walking bosses/foremen,  
superintendents or managers, outside truck drivers, vendors,  
contractors and others are required to follow this Policy and  
shall not engage in any Prohibited Conduct in connection with  
any action subject to the terms of the PCLCA (including at work  
sites, joint dispatch halls, training sites, and other locations,  
when reasonably related to employment covered by this  
Agreement). It is important not to assume that the Employers,  
PMA or the ILWU know of particular incidents of discnmina-  
tion or harassment. Discrimination and harassment can be elim-  
inated from the workplace only if everyone working under the  
PCLCA who experiences or sees such problems files a griev-  
ance using the Special Section 13.2 Grievance Procedures for  
discrimination and harassment. It is also important if you  
believe you are a victim of discrimination, harassment or retali-  
ation that you immediately inform the offending party that you  
find his or her conduct offensive and ask that it be stopped.  
224  
### ADDENDA EEO POUCIES & PROCEDURES  
3. Examples of Prohibited Conduct Under 13.2  
Discrimination and harassment can take many forms.  
Certain actions or even words can constitute discrimination  
_and harassment. As a general matter, it is a violation of this  
Policy for anyone to treat another in a way that is threaten-  
ing, intimidating, embarrassing or offensive, or that denies a  
person equal treatment and opportunities because of his or  
- her sex, race or other unique characteristics. So-called “good  
intentions” or “joking around” (as determined by the  
Arbitrator) does not excuse Prohibited Conduct,  
To assist you in recognizing and avoiding behavior which  
may be considered harassing, discriminatory, or retaliatory,  
the following examples of Prohibited Conduct are listed:  
Physical Harassment: Unwelcome touching or grab-  
bing or sexual assault, blocking movement,  
standing close.  
Verbal Harassment: Racial or sexual jokes, name-call-  
ing, using slurs, derogatory terms, belittling remarks, or abu-  
sive language related to a person’s gender, race or other  
defining characteristics.  
Visual Harassment: Displaying objects, messages, pic-  
tures, pornography, graffiti, or drawings of a sexual or racial  
nature; engaging in offensive and unwelcome personal con-  
duct such as offensive gestures, staring (especially at partic-  
ular body parts), mooning, leering; showing a lack of respect  
for privacy in toilet facilities and locker rooms.  
Unwelcome Romantic or Sexual Attention: Unwelcome  
flirting, pressuring another for a date and sexual  
advances; also demanding sexual favors or romantic attention  
as a condition of any type of employment benefit.  
226  
### EEO POLICIES & PROCECURES ADDENDA  
Discriminatory Dispatch, Jab Assignments and  
Discipline :Assigning work based on sex or race, segregat-  
ing workers by sex or ethnic group on work assignments,  
disciplining or evaluating women more harshly than men  
(or vice versa), setting someone up to fail, hard-timing (such  
as failing to help co-workers of one sex or ethnic group to  
the same degree as you help co-workers of another sex or  
ethnic group), filing false reports because of the person's sex  
or race.  
4. Special Section 13.2 Grievance Procedures for Com-  
plaints of Discrimination, Harassment & Retaliation  
All registered and casual longshore workers and clerks  
have the right and responsibility to promptly report any  
Prohibited Conduct of which they are aware to their Local  
{through the ILWU business agent or a Union official) and  
on-the-job supervision (such as the walking boss/foreman or  
clerk supervisor or management). To correct any incidents  
of discrimination, harassment (including hostile work envi-  
ronment) or retaliation which violate this Policy, the long-  
shore worker or clerk experiencing the problem must  
promptly file, within ten (10) calendar days of the incident,  
a grievance under the ILWU-PMA Special Section 13.2  
Grievance Procedures For The Resolution of Complaints Re  
Discrimination and Harassment’ Under the Pacific Coast  
Longshore and Clerks Agreement (referred to as the “Special  
Grievance Procedures”), a copy of which is attached.  
Grievances may be filed only by longshore workers, clerks,

### PICKET LINE LANGUAGE  
CLRC No. 1, January 29, 1954  
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines: There was a gener-  
al discussion of language pertaining to this subject, wherein  
the Union stated that they did not expect Jongshoremen to get  
paid for observing picket lines, but on the other hand, did not  
want longshoremen necessarily ordered day after day.  
It was agreed that the following language which was ini-  
tialed by the parties, wili be the guide to settle any claims in the  
future and, likewise, wipe out the meaning of past arbitration  
awards on the subject.

### PICKET LINE LANGUAGE ADDENDA  
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines:  
A local shall, through its president or its secretary, notify  
PMA in writing of intention to respect a specific picket line.  
Delivery of such written notice shall relieve the dispatching  
hall of obligation to furnish men or gangs to the picketed oper-  
ation until a decision under the grievance machinery is issued  
ordering the start or continuance of work.  
Men or gangs ordered priorto or within 2 hours of such writ-  
ten notice to PMA shall report to work without benefit of cov- ©  
“erage of minimum report time as provided in the Agreement.  
Men or gangs ordered later than 2 hours following such re-  
ceipt but prior to the issuance of a determination by the parties  
through grievance machinery shall, ifthey accept the order and  
-report, be covered by the minimum provisions of the Agree-  
ment, provided, however, that failure of the employer to place  
orders following such receipt shall not constitute any waiver of  
the employer’s position nor an acceptance of the union’s posi-  
tion, pending decision as hereinafter provided.  
Following the establishment of any picket about the  
premises of an employer affecting the work of employees cov-  
ered by ILWU-PMA Agreements, either party may require a  
meeting of the Joint Labor Relations Committee of the port af-  
fected (or an Area Committee or the Coast Committee, if  
such is agreed to be appropriate) and such meetings shal) be  
held immediately.  
The Committee shall promptly examine the facts and issue  
its written decision as to whether the picket line is legitimate  
and bona fide under the Agreement. Should a Committee fail  
to reach such a decision, then either party may refer the matter  
to the Area Arbitrator for prompt interim decision.

### STEADY SKILLED MEN  
CLRAC No. 14, October 11, 1966 {item 1)  
The Employers inquired as to what the Union had in mind  
in implementing the “Steady Skilled Man” provision of the  
new Agreement.  
‘There was considerable discussion following which the  
Employers stated they would discuss this matter further and be  
prepared to talk about it again in the afternoon session.  
The Employers stated they reviewed the matters discussed  
at the moming session and feel the following proposal will  
meet the needs of both parties:  
1. A guarantee to skilled men regardless of category ata  
minimum of 173 hours per month at the 25¢° differential shall  
be paid to steady employees. Such guarantee shall be paid irre-  
spective of how long an individual is retained during any  
month as a steady skilled man; provided, however, that should  
such steady skilled man be released for cause during any  
month, the guarantee shall be prorated over the period such  
employee was relained as a steady man;  
2. Should asteady man be upgraded, he will receive the  
applicable higher skill differential for the balance of the shift  
regardless of the period of time of utilization on the equipment  
carrying the higher differential;  
248  
### SAN FRANCISCO STEADY SKILLED MEN ADDENDA  
3. All hours worked (including dead time hours under  
the 8-hour guarantee) by such steady man will count against  
his guarantee;  
4. Travel time will not be a part of the guarantee;  
§. of the employers’ right  
to work such steady men over and above such guarantee; 1.e.,  
the guarantee represents 2 minimum payment for the privilege  
of obtaining steady skilled men;  
6. mot intended to allow an employer to hire steady  
skilled men so that he may then order longshoremen to make -  
up a basic gang, thus avoiding using a basic gang from the hall;  
7. Wherea skilled man is required fora job of short dura-  
tion the employer may use his steady skilled men.  
The Union members of the Committee agree in principle  
with the above proposal and as a result thereof, it was agreed  
that with the above as the basis for the employment of steady  
skilted men, ihe employers may begin discussing such em-  
ployment with the men and employing steady men. It was fur-  
‘ther agreed the Crane provisions of Section }4 on steady men  
are retained.  
  
### SAN FRANCISCO STEADY SKILLED MEN

sis of inverse job seniority unless the application of inverse  
seniority wil] not provide the employer with sufficient em-  
ployees qualified to operate the employer’s mechanical or  
powered equipment. Ifa man believes he is being released im-  
properly, he may make suchclaim and have it resolved through  
the grievance machinery,  
C. The employer shall provide to the union a notice of a steady  
employment position for posting in the joint longshore dis-  
patch hall. The notice shall be posted for ten (10) days prior to  
selection and employment of the steady employee.  
Amended July 15, 1999, Memorandum of Understanding  
as follows:  
For San Francisco steady skilled men, the provisions of  
CLRC Meeting No. 14-66, [tem |, Paragraph ({1.) are modified  
as follows:  
The day and night monthly (four week) pay guarantee shall  
be 180 hours (45 hours per week) at the proper (first or second)

Preference categories who have lost PGP eligibility due to  
lack of work shall be made eligible for PGP in the following  
manner:  
- Longshoremen on the Dock Preference Board will sign in  
to establish availability until the end of the first full payroll

in Section 20.5332.  
At the end of the second and third consecutive quarters  
following ratification, the eligibility shal] be also based on the  
50% test which shall be applied to the cumulative full payroll

Employer.  
8. Semitractor Dispatch Board  
A“Semitractor Dispatch Board” or Boards shall be established  
by the JPLRC upon the basts of the fallawing proposal,  
Semitractor Dispatch Board  
Based upon the common acknowledgment that trained  
skilled operators are essential to overall efficient longshore op-  
erations, the parties agree to the establishment of a Class A  
Semitractor Dispatch Board.  
The creation of the Class A Semitractor Dispatch Board is to  
assure the dispatch of longshoremen who have been trained to  
efficiently operate the semitractors which are essential to con-  
tainer operations in the port.  
The Semitractor Dispatch Board shall be created with dis-  
patch priority to be given to those on the Boards as follows:  
1. First priority shall be given to Class A longshoremen  
with over 5 years’ experience, who volunteer to be on the  
Board,  
   
263  
ey ae  
### LOS ANGELES/LONG BEACH UTR ORIVERS ADDENDA  
2. Second priority shall be given to Class A longshoremen  
with less than 5 years’ experience, who have completed the  
ILWU-PMA Semitractor Training Program.  
3. The next-in-line dispatch sequence for jabs not filled by  
the Class A Semitractor Board shal] be under the principle of  
low-man-first to be dispatched on the Jitney Board and then the  
Low Board dispatch sequence.  
4, The fourth priority shall be given to Class B longshore-  
men who have completed the ILWU-PMA Semitractor Train-  
ing Program.  
With respect to those Class A tongshoremen in 2 above, itis  
understood that time on the Semitractor Dispatch Board shal]  
count toward meeting the “5 years in the hold” requirement  
(subject to the necessary waiver being granted by the Joint  
Coast Labor Relations Committee).  
The Joint LLRC shall, in accordance with Section 9.4, pro-  
vide for the appropriate number of Class A longshoremen (in 2  
above) on the Semitractor Dispatch Board from longshoremen  
elevated to Class A status after July 1, 1987. Any disagreement  
shall be submitted to the Area Arbitrator for resolution.  
Jobs dispatched from the Semitractor Dispatch Boards and  
semitractor sobs from the Class B Board must be accepted or a  
flop shall be given.  
The next-in-line dispatch sequence for jobs not filled by the  
above dispatch sequence shall then go to the next recognized  
procedure in the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach. Semitractor  
jobs shall be dispatched at least one-half hour prior to the nor-  
mal shift starting time.  
C. Monthly Employment  
1. UTR’s shall, at the option, be employed on a  
monthly basis, These operators can be used against all vessels’  
operations as required by the Employer.  
254  
### ADDENDA LOS ANGELES/LONG GEACH UTA DRIVERS  
2. Monthly employees shall be guaranteed monthly a mini-  
mum/maximum of 195 hours of work or pay at the applicable  
shi UTR rate of pay.  
3. These UTR operators shall report to the job one-half  
hour prior to the start of the shift for work other than actual han-  
dling or moving of cargo. The phrase “other than actual han-  
dling or moving of cargo” is intended to permit the preparation  
of equipment including chassis for movement to or from the  
vessel so long as there is no actual movement of cargo  
to or from the vessel.  
4. Employers who elect to employ UTR operators on a  
monthly basis for both day and/or night operations may order  
up to 50% of the average daily number of UTR operators used  
against their operations during the previous payroll quarter as  
recorded by the Joint Dispatch Hall and PMA Allocations.  
New Employers or new container terminals may employ  
monthly UTR operators after a payroll quarter of operation,  
based on the foregoing formula.  
5. All ship operations with monthly UTR operators shall  
start on time should the Dispatch Hal] on any given day or days  
be unable to fil the remainder of UTR operators from the Hal!  
at the start of any shift.  
6. Monthly UTR operators shall work against vessels as di-  
rected, on all UTR rated equipment, providing full flexibility  
as required by the Employer. Such flexibility shall include all  
work before vessel's arrival and after vessel’s departure on that  
shift. (This means carge preparation for that vessel or dock  
storage of discharged cargo from that vessel.} -  
7. Full flexibility includes the use of monthly UTR opera-  
tors for utilization between the vessel/CY and container move-  
ments to or from Container Rail Transfer Yards. Other UTR  
dock work remains as per past practice (i.¢., container move-

ment from vessel toCY, vessel to Rail Container Transfer Yard,  
CY to Rail Container Transfer Yard and vice versa).  
8. First preference for monthly UTR work shall be given to  
those individuals checked in on the Dispatch Hall C/L/UTR  
Board; second preference - Secondary UTR Board; third - low  
boards; fourth - B Board. Dispatch shall be based on “low man.  
out” (lowest sign-in hours dispatched first}. Individuals wili  
have a timely check-in procedure for the 30-day dispatch.  
9. Monthly UTR’s will be responsible for arranging their  
own relief in accordance with Section 2.3 and subsections of  
the PCLCD. This allows the Dispatch Hall to dispatch relief  
UTR jobs on the low-man-out principle.  
10. Four days prior to the end of each month, Employers  
‘will notify the Dispatch Hall of their requirement of monthly  
UTR operators for the subsequent month. The number of such  
jobs shall be posted by the joint Dispatchers in the Dispatch  
Hali 3 days prior to the end of the month. On the first day of  
each month, the dispatch of monthly UTR operators shall oc-  
cur at a time so as to guarantee arrival of al! monthly UTR op-  
erators to their Employer one-half hour prior to the start of the  
shiit.  
11. This procedure for the employment and use of monthly  
UTR operators shall be effective September 1, 1990.  
12, The JPLRC shall, after September 1, 1991, review the  
foregoing conditions and consider expanding the utilization of  
monthly UTR operators by mutual agreement. Any such  
JPLRC agreement shall be. subject to CLRC approvai.  
13. Practices as of July 1, 1990 with respect to the employ-  
ment and the utilization of operators from the UTR category  
shall remain unchanged.  
14, For efficiency of dispatch, monthly employees may be  
dispatched individually or as units. The dispatching method

### DISPATCH HALL COSTS  
Effective January 1, 1997, the PMA agrees to be obligated  
to pay 63% of all 1996 base year Dispatch Hall expenses and  
the Union agrees that each loca! will be obligated to pay 35%  
of afl 1996 base year Dispatch Hall expenses. For the purpose  
of these obligations, the 1996 base year expenses of the Dis-  
patch Halls shail be the January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1996,  
equally shared expenses which appear on the audited financial  
statements. Whenever, due to reduction in dispatch hall costs  
or increase in the PCL&CA holiday cost, the average cost ofa  
holiday exceeds 15% of the 1996 base year expenses, the  
Union’s 35% share shall be reduced by a proportionate amount  
allocated to the local dispatch halls administratively by the  
JCLRC. All additional jointly agreed to expenses above the  
base year expenses shall be shared equally between PMA and  
the Local Union. The formula for sharing extraordinary capi-  
ta] improvements shall be subject to mutua) agreement of the  
parties.  
(Notwithstanding the fact that PMA’s contribution towards  
Dispatch Hall costs is by virtue of this Agreement greater than  
the contribution of the ILWU, nothing herein contained or oth-  
erwise shall in any way change or modify the basic principle  
and understanding of the parties as expressed in this Agree-  
ment that the Dispatch Halls shall cantinue in the future, as  
they have in the past, to be maintained and operated jointly and  
equally by the ILWU and the PMA.)
