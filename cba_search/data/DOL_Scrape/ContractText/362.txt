e Replace Section 6 with the material entitled "Other Absences” from the agreement

e Add a new “Section 7. COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF” which reads:  
### GENERAL  
The corporation's contracts with the Air Force and other customers describe technical  
tasks to be carried out and require that work performed on the various tasks be reported  
accurately. Exempt employees (i.e., salaried employees) report such work in terms of  
hours of effort.  
Exempt employees perform work that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) describes as  
professional, administrative, or executive in nature and are paid a weekly salary that is  
not based on the number of hours worked. Exempt employees are not subject to the  
overtime provisions of the FLSA or the California Wage Orders.  
The corporation is reimbursed for Staff-year of Technical Effort (STE) deliveries.  
Employees report their effort using a standard workweek of 40 hours. Actual hours  
worked over 40 are prorated by the e-Time Collection System to 40 units of effort.  
Hours of effort include all time during which an employee is directly subject to the  
control of the corporation. Time spent in work-related travel is included in the reported  
hours of effort. Time spent in traveling from home to and from the usual work place is  
not included.  
The corporation is establishing a Compensatory Time Off program as a pilot during FY  
2005. Regular full-trme exempt employees are eligible for this program. Part-time  
exempt employees are not eligible for the pilot program. Non-exempt employees are not  
eligible for compensatory time off programs.  
In order to accrue compensatory time, an employee must work at least 48 hours in the  
workweek. Hours worked by the employee beyond 48 accrue compensatory time up to  
the maximum accrual of nine hours. Accrual of compensatory time is subject to approval  
by management.  
Absences during the workweek are not counted towards accruing compensatory time.  
Final MOA 2004-2005 Page 6 of 27  
### MMS MMD  
Distribution of effort and absences are recorded by the e-Time Collection System. The e-  
Time Collection System will utilize a separate “C” field with the related Job Order (JO)  
to identify the work effort eligible for compensatory time accrual.  
The maximum accrual at any one time Is a total of nine hours of compensatory time. An  
employee is not limited in the number of times he/she earns and uses compensatory time.  
Accrued compensatory time off may be taken in one-hour increments, not to exceed one °  
day per week. Utilization of compensatory time off by the employee must be coordinated  
in advance with management. Borrowing of compensatory time off is not allowed.  
Accrual and utilization of compensatory time must occur within the same fiscal year.  
Accrued compensatory time must be utilized a minimum of two weeks prior to the end of  
Fiscal Year. All unused compensatory time is forfeited at the end of the Fiscal Year.  
### RESPONSIBILITIES  
Managers  
Management is obligated for ensuring that their subordinates’ work efforts are consistent  
with the needs of the customer(s). The manager is responsible for reviewing the  
applicability of the subordinate’s work efforts, including work-related travel. The  
manager is also responsible for ensuring that the subordinate’s reported work effort is  
accurate. The manager’s review and approval of the subordinate’s weekly e-Time  
submittal is an integral part of this responsibility. :  
Employees  
The employee is expected to coordinate any work effort eligible for compensatory time  
accrual in advance with management. The employee will utilize a separate “C” field with  
the related Job Order (JO) in reporting his/her work effort in the e-Time Collection  
System to identify any work effort eligible for compensatory time accrual.  
The employee is expected to coordinate the utilization of compensatory time in advance  
with management. Utilization of accrued compensatory time is recorded in the e-Time  
Collection System.”

program, any eligible bargaining unit employee who refers an applicant who is  
subsequently hired as a regular full-time, part-time, temporary or casual bargaining unit  
(BU) employee shall receive an award of $2500.  
An additional $2000 will be awarded if the hired BU employee has a current SBI  
clearance.  
There is no limit on the number of awards an individual may earn. A referral is valid for a  
period of twelve (12) months. A referral requiring longer than 12 months to be processed  
is subject to the approval by the Principal Director, Human Resources.  
Candidates already sourced through corporate sponsored events and activities can be  
referred by MTS after a twelve (12) month waiting period.  
Employees representing Aerospace in corporate sponsored recruiting events or activities  
are ineligible for this bonus program. Those employees employed by Human Resources,  
those at Level 5 or above and all in-line supervisors are ineligible.  
To be eligible to receive cash, the referring employees must submit a completed  
Employee Referral Card along with either an Employment Questionnaire (EQ) or resume  
from the applicant being referred. No awards will be authorized if the referral card is  
submitted after an EQ or resume has been received by Staffing Resources. New hires  
potentially associated with company-sponsored advertising or recruiting activities shall  
be eligible as bonus referrals if an EQ or resume has not been previously received within  
the past twelve (12) months by Staffing Resources at the time of the referral.”
