Trustees of any of the Funds listed in Sections  
1 through 4 hereof, the Employer shall remit  
all payments due under this Article XVI,  
together with the dues check-off required by

Funds, as the receiving agent for such funds,  
unless permission to submit same on a month-  
ly basis and/or to submit by mail directly to  
the Fund Office, 6650 Belair Road, Baltimore,  
Maryland 21206, is granted by the Trustees of  
the various funds. If payment is due monthly it  
must be made by the twentieth (20th) day of  
the month after the month for which the pay-  
ment is due. All Employers covered by this  
Agreement who are members of the Labor  
Relations Division of the Maryland Chapter of  
the Associated General Contractors of  
America, Inc., and its affiliated organizations  
may submit payments and forms by mail to  
the various funds on a monthly basis. Any  
payment which is not made in full or any  
report which is not completed in full will not  
comply with the requirements hereunder. If an  
Employer has no covered employees during a  
reposting period, he shall still file a remittance  
report duly noting there were no covered  
employees during the period.  
Section 6. The Employer agrees to abide by  
the terms and conditions of the Agreement and  
Declaration of Trust of each of the Funds list-  
ed in Sections 1 through 5 of this Article XVI,  
as heretofore and hereafter adopted by the  
Trustees pursuant to such Agreements, as  
amended. The Employer accepts the  
42,  
“Employer Trustees” heretofore or hereafter  
' designated pursuant to such Trust Agreements  
as his representatives to administer such  
Funds. The Employer hereby ratifies all action  
already taken or to be taken by the Trustees of  
each of the Funds within the scope of their  
authority.  
Section 7. Notwithstanding anything in this  
Agreement to the contrary, if the Employer  
fail to properly and timely report and/or  
pay on all employees covered by this  
Agreement the Union may, at its option, strike  
and/or picket said Employer on the day fol-  
lowing the day on which such payments  
and/or reports are due or at any time there-  
after, and said strike and/or picketing may be  
continued unti} such time as the Employer  
properly reports and/or makes the required  
payments plus any liquidated damages and  
interest which may have accrued thereon.  
Section 8. The Employer and the Union rec-  
ognize and acknowledge that the regular and  
prompt payment of the payments required to  
be made under Sections 1 through 5 of this  
Article are essential and that it would be  
extremely difficult to fix the actual expense  
and damage to the Funds, to the Union and to  
the employees which would result from the  
failure of the Employer to make such pay-  
ments within the time provided by Section 6  
43  
hereof. Accordingly, the amount of damage  
resulting from each such failure shall be pre-  
sumed to be the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00)  
per delinquency or twenty percent (20%) of  
the amount due, whichever is greater, which  
amount shall become due and payable to the  
Fund as liquidated damages and not as a  
penalty, upon the day immediately following  
the date on which such payment became delin-  
quent, and shall be in addition to the delin-  
quent payment. In addition, interest at the rate  
of 18% per annum of each monthly delinquen-  
cy shall be paid from the date of delinquency.  
Section 9. The Employer agrees to send  
with its required payments under this Article a  
remittance report form in the format prepared  
by the Funds setting forth for each employee  
who worked during the month for which the  
payments are made his name, social security  
number, the hours worked during the month  
and such other pertinent information as may  
be required. If the Employer should fail to  
submit a remittance report setting forth the  
information required to be stated thereon, the  
statute of limitations with respect to such fail-  
ure on any amount which should have been  
remitted to the Funds therewith shall not begin  
to run until the Employer complies with its  
duty to report on all employees. The Employer  
44  
hereby waives the defense of the statute of  
limitations on suits to collect payments due  
but not reported to the Funds.  
Section 10, Any Employer required to make  
payments under this Article shall, upon  
demand of the Trustees, deposit with any of  
the Funds listed in Sections 1 through 4 of this  
Article the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars  
($10,000.00) per fund, or a bond in a form  
acceptable to the Trustees of the Fund for the  
Same amount. At the termination of this  
Agreement, any sum or bond on deposit and  
not applied to unpaid payments shall be  
returned to the Employer or its successor with-  
out interest. The Union agrees that the Labor  
Relations Division of the Maryland Chapter of  
the Associated General Contractors of  
America, Inc. may make the payments or post  
the bond required by this Section for its mem-  
bers who have given it written authorization to  
negotiate with the Union and further agrees  
that the maximum payments or bond to collec-  
tively cover all such members shall be limited  
to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). -  
Section 11. The Employer hereby acknowl-  
edges that the Trustees of the Funds listed in  
Sections | through 4 of this Article have a  
substantial interest in the enforcement of the  
provisions of this Article for the benefit of the  
45  
employees covered by this Agreement. ©  
Accordingly, the Employer agrees that the  
Trustees shall have the right, through their  
designated representative, to inspect, audit and  
copy the payroll records of the Employer with  
respect to employees covered by this  
Agreement, to sue for the collection of any  
sums due under this Article without the neces-  
sity of joining the Union or any employee or  
any other party in such action, and generally  
to enforce the provisions of this Article as ful-  
ly as if they were parties hereto. Upon request  
of the Trustees of the Construction Workers’  
Trust Fund, the Employer agrees to execute a  
standard Health and Welfare Agreement used  
by the Fund.  
Section 12. Upon notice to the Employer by  
the Union that a subcontractor of the  
Employer is delinquent in payments to  
Laborers’. Benefit Funds, or any Union Trust  
Fund for which Laborers’ Benefit Funds act as  
collection agent, the Employer shall immedi-  
ately withhold from any payments becoming  
due such subcontractor, an amount sufficient  
to pay the amount of the delinquency, or a rea-  
sonable estimate thereof plus an amount esti-  
mated to cover the amount expected to be due  
for the current reporting period. Such sum  
shall be withheld until the subcontractor pre-  
sents proof that it has paid the delinquent  
46  
amount and the payment for the current  
reporting period. It is understood and agreed  
that the Employer shal] only be obligated to  
withhold that amount of said delinquency that  
was incurred by said subcontractor as a sub-  
contractor of the Employer. The Employer  
may discharge its obligations under this  
Section by issuing a check payable jointly to  
the subcontractor and Laborers’ Benefit Funds  
for the amount being withheld.  
### ARTICLE XVII  
### LABORERS’ POLITICAL  
### LEAGUE (LPL)  
During the life of this Agreement, the  
Employer agrees to deduct two cents ($.02)  
per hour from the pay of each employee as a  
voluntary contribution to Laborers’ Political  
League (LPL), provided that each such  
employee executes or has executed an appro-  
priate P.A.C. checkoff authorization form. The  
Employer further agrees to continue to deduct  
the voluntary contributions to said Political  
Action Committee from the pay of each  
employee for whom it has on file an unre-  
voked P.A.C. authorization form.  
Deductions shall be made only in accor-  
dance with the provisions of and in the  
amounts designated in the P.A.C. checkoff

authorization form, together with the provi-  
sions of this Section of the Agreement.

with the fringe benefit payments and report  
forms required under Article XVI, to the

required amount is deducted.

### CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY  
### ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM  
Section 1. In recognition of the need for  
providing a means whereby construction  
industry employers can facilitate and supple-  
ment financing of activities, which include but  
are not limited to, public relations, public edu-  
cation, scholarships, accident prevention, dis-  
aster relief, employer expenses incurred in the  
promotion of stability of relations between  
labor and management, the promotion of legit-  
imate markets, standardization of contracts,  
and research, the parties hereto agree:  
a. Effective April 1, 2005, each Employer  
53  
shall pay to the Construction Industry  
Advancement Program of Baltimore Maryland  
(hereinafter called the “CIAP”) a sum equal to  
twelve cents ($.12) for each hour worked by  
each employee covered by the terms of this  
Agreement. Said sum shall be paid to the  
CIAP Board consisting solely of representa-  
tives designated by the Maryland Chapter of  
the Associated General Contractors of  
America, Inc. and by the Employers who are  
not members of the Chapter but who have  
become subject to the provisions of this  
‘Article by executing or adopting a collective  
bargaining agreement requiring the payment  
of contributions to the CIAP. Payment to the  
CIAP shall be due and payable to the  
Laborers’ Benefits Funds office, as the col-  
lecting agent designated by the CIAP, monthly  
by the twentieth (20th) day of the month next

poses hereinabove stated including the admin-  
istrative expenses incurred by the CIAP.  
b. The Employers recognize and acknowl-  
edge that the regular and prompt payment of  
the sums due to CIAP under this Article is  
essential to the operation of the CIAP, and that  
it would be extremely difficult, if not impossi-  
ble, to fix the actual expense and damage  
which would result to the CIAP from the fail-  
54  
ure of any Employer to make such payments  
within the time provided. Therefore, the  
amount of damage resulting from each and  
every such failure shal! be presumed to be the  
sum of $10.00 per delinquency or 10% of the  
payment due, whichever is greater, plus inter-  
est on the amount of the payment due at the  
rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per  
month until paid, which amount shall become  
due and payable as liquidated damages, and  
not as a penalty, upon the day immediately  
following the date on which the payment  
becomes delinquent and shall be in addition to  
said delinquent payment. Such delinquent  
Employers shall also be liable for all reason-  
able expenses incurred by the CIAP directly  
attributable to the cost of collection (including  
reasonable attorney’s fees) of said delinquent  
payments.  
Section 2. The Union shall be under no  
obligation to strike for the purpose of com-  
pelling any Employer to participate in the  
CIAP. It is specifically understood that the  
Union will not be required nor called upon to  
enforce the collection of the aforesaid pay-  
ments. Monies collected by the CIAP shall not  
be used for lobbying or sponsoring any legis-  
lation detrimental to the Union nor shall any  
such monies be prorated to any individual  
Employer during a strike or lockout. In no  
a2  
instance shall any of the foregoing funds be  
used for advertising or propaganda against the  
Union. This Article shall be applicable only to  
an Employer who is subject to the terms, con-  
ditions and wages covered by this Agreement.  
Section 3. The establishment of this pro-  
gram is subject to all applicable Federal and  
State laws,  
Section 4. The Union shall furnish to the  
CIAP regularly and currently the names of  
Employers who ‘are signatory to this  
Agreement.
