### ARTICLE V--SENIORITY  
### SECTION A  
1. Seniority shall be the length of continuous service of an SRP in the school system. Continuous service shall  
be determined in reference to unbroken service in the district with each year in which an SRP has been in a  
paid duty status for at least (1) day more than one-half (1/2) of the normal work year for the position counted  
as one (1) year of service. If an SRP takes ten (10) or more successive days of unpaid leave, these days shall  
be deducted from the normal work year, and if this deduction reduces the normal year to less than one (1) day  
more than one-half (1/2) the normal work year for the position, the year shall not be counted.

and when decreasing hours within an area of assignment at a worksite. However, at an alternative school for  
disruptive students, cost effectiveness and efficiency and the needs of students shall be among the factors  
considered when making work assignments. In instances in which work assignments can be made in which  
students’ needs are met and cost effectiveness and efficiency are not adversely affected, seniority shall be  
considered in making the work assignments.  
3. If it becomes necessary to establish precedence among SRP with the same seniority, the beginning date of  
continuous service shall be used. Leave duly authorized and granted in accordance with provisions of this  
Agreement shall not constitute a break in service.  
### SECTION B  
The first week of each month, the Board shall provide seniority data to the Union. The data will contain job  
classification of the names of all SRP employed in the district and total number of years of continuous service in  
the district as determined by the District School Board of Pasco County. Seniority lists may be posted on the  
Union bulletin board at each worksite. The Union shall provide the district with a computer and a peripheral  
storage device to transmit the data.

2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 8  
### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
4.  
It is the Board's intention that the best-qualified applicant be hired for each vacant position. The Board  
agrees to give full consideration to the professional background and attainments of applicants for vacancies.  
If the SRP is qualified for said position, he/she shall be interviewed by the appropriate supervisor.  
Applicants shall be notified in writing of the decision by the worksite supervisor.  
### SECTION D - LAYOFF PROCEDURE  
1.  
Layoff is defined as the reduction in force for lack of funds or changes in allocation without fault on the part  
of any employee. Layoffs may occur due to staff reduction at a worksite or the closing of an existing facility.  
The Board shall notify the Union immediately upon determination that layoffs must occur.  
. In case of staff reduction at a worksite, volunteers for layoff will first be sought from among the affected  
SRP. In the event the number of volunteers is not sufficient, the SRP with the least seniority in the district  
among those assigned to the worksite at which the reduction must occur within the area of assignment  
affected shall be laid off first. "Area of assignment" shall mean specific job title. Should it become  
necessary to reduce the number of Bus Driver/Paraprofessionals at an alternative school for disruptive  
students, the school principal after receiving recommendations from the staff relative to program needs and  
needs of students, will determine the SRP to be laid off. SRP selected for layoff and the Union shall be given  
notice of the layoff and the reason therefore in writing.  
If a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and a Paraprofessional  
(ESOL/Bilingual) is the only Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is  
proficient in the same home language, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter  
6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the seniority requirement contained in paragraph 2 above relative to the layoff of a  
Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  
An SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall be placed on leave without pay for a period of  
twelve (12) months. This leave may not be extended beyond one (1) year for any reason.  
An SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall retain his/her seniority upon recall. Layoff shall  
not be considered a break in service if the SRP is recalled under the Recall Procedure, Article VII, Section E.  
An SRP who is placed on leave because of layoff shall have the right to unemployment compensation, and  
nothing contained herein shall be construed to abridge that right.  
### SECTION E - RECALL PROCEDURE  
1.  
2.  
Laid off SRP shall be recalled to their job classification in inverse order of layoff.  
Recall lists by job title shall be maintained districtwide and positions shall be offered regardless of where  
they occur in the district, except that no school or department shall be required to fill more than fifty percent  
(50%) of its vacant positions by job title from recall lists unless no other vacant positions are available within  
the district. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the principal, after interviewing an employee on  
a recall list in which the school has a vacancy, may decline to hire the employee. An employee on a Bus  
Driver/Paraprofessional recall list will be granted preference in hiring over outside applicants for district  
positions for which he/she possesses required qualifications provided that no recall lists exist for these  
positions and there are no laws or regulations which would bar this procedure. A Bus  
Driver/Paraprofessional who wishes to claim this preference must notify the worksite supervisor and the  
District Human Resources Office in writing of his/her intentions at the time of application for an advertised  
vacancy. Failure to make this notification will bar relief through the grievance process in the event  
preference is not granted. The Union shall be notified of all SRP on the recall list, in order of recall. This list  
shall be updated whenever there is a change in the SRP sequential recall order.  
It shall be the responsibility of each laid off SRP to provide the Board with a telephone number and mailing  
address at which he/she can be reached or at which a message may be left during working hours. Telephone  
calls for the purpose of recalling SRP shall be made Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when the  
district office is in normal operation, based on the twelve (12) month work calendar. The Union shall be  
provided with a copy of this calendar.  
Before the recall procedure is initiated, the Union shall be notified that a position is being offered to a  
specifically named SRP. When a vacancy occurs in a position for which a recall list exists, the Board shall  
attempt to contact the person at the top of the list by telephone at least three (3) times per day over a three (3)  
day period and offer the position to the SRP. A busy signal shall not count as an attempt to reach the SRP.  
In the event an SRP's telephone is out of order due to no fault of said SRP, the SRP shall be returned to the  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 9  
### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
10.  
top of the recall list upon confirmation of this situation. In the event a person cannot be reached after these  
attempts, he/she shall be placed at the bottom of the list and notified of this action by certified mail. In the  
event a person cannot be reached after following this procedure two (2) additional times, the Board shall be  
released from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons  
from the employment of the Board.  
If a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and there is no  
Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is proficient in the same home  
language, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter 6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the  
seniority requirement contained in paragraph 1 above relative to the recall of a Paraprofessional or  
Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  
The person at the top of the recall list for a specific position vacancy must respond within forty-eight (48)  
hours of an offer of a position. If the person does not accept that position, he/she shall be placed at the  
bottom of the recall list. If the SRP declines the second position offered by the Board, except as provided in  
Article VII, Section E, paragraph 7, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the  
person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board. It shall be  
the obligation of the notified SRP, except in an emergency, to respond to a job offer made under the  
provisions of this section. Non-response without cause shall be deemed to be a resignation for personal  
reasons.  
When an SRP is offered a position at a worksite which is twenty (20) miles further from the SRP's previous  
worksite, he/she shall have the right to turn down two (2) such offers before being placed at the bottom of the  
recall list. When said SRP reaches the top of the recall list again, the Board shall offer him/her the next  
available position. If the SRP declines this position, the Board shall be released from further recall  
obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  
the Board.  
When an SRP who is a tobacco user and who is on the recall list is offered a position at a smoke and tobacco  
free site, he/she shall have the right to turn down the position and shall retain his/her current place on the  
recall list. If the SRP who is a tobacco user turns down a position at a smoke and tobacco free site and gives  
being a tobacco user as the reason for turning down the position, he/she shall retain his/her current position  
on the recall list but will no longer be offered positions at other smoke and tobacco free sites.  
If, after accepting a position, an SRP does not report to the new position within five (5) working days of the  
offer being made, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed  
to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board.  
If an SRP has not been recalled within twelve (12) months of layoff, the Board shall have no further recall  
obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  
the Board.  
### SECTION F - EVALUATION  
1.  
Prior to September 15, all SRP shall receive a copy of the assessment instrument, and an explanation of the  
assessment process shall be provided. In the event an SRP is employed after other SRP have received this  
information, said instrument and explanation shall be given upon employment.  
The worksite supervisor or designee making the evaluation shall meet with the SRP to discuss the areas in  
which the SRP's performance is satisfactory, and any area(s) in which the SRP's performance is unsatis-  
factory/deficient, or in which the SRP needs improvement.  
After each assessment of an SRP, the SRP or witness shall sign and be given a copy of the assessment  
instrument. The signature of the SRP shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the assessment but only  
acknowledges that he/she has read the report.  
An SRP shall be given the opportunity to include his/her comments in writing concerning the assessment  
report or, in the case of subparagraph 5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies. These  
comments shall be placed in the SRP's personnel file if the assessment report or, in the case of subparagraph  
5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies is placed in the SRP's personnel file.  
In the event an SRP is not performing satisfactorily, the worksite supervisor or designee shall advise the SRP  
in writing of the specific deficiencies in his/her performance and shall give the SRP reasonable time and  
assistance to overcome these deficiencies. The worksite supervisor or designee will:  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 10  
### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
a) notify the SRP in writing that deficiencies exist,  
b) provide a full and complete explanation of deficiencies and suggested corrections,  
c) offer administrative and supervisory assistance, and  
d) provide reasonable time for correction of deficiencies.  
This written notification of performance deficiencies may be accompanied by a completed assessment  
instrument. However, at an alternative school for disruptive students, an SRP whose performance has not  
met the expectations of the principal shall be subject to involuntary transfer to another worksite twenty-five  
(25) days after the principal has provided the SRP with an opportunity to improve his/her performance and  
the performance continues to be below expectation. At any time during this period, beginning with the initial  
notification to the SRP that he/she may be subject to involuntary transfer, the Union has the right to represent  
the SRP. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the salary of an SRP who is involuntarily  
transferred to another worksite shall be no less than he/she would have earned at the alternative school for the  
remainder of the school year. SRP involuntarily transferred shall not be transferred to a worksite which is  
twenty (20) miles further from his/her residence than the alternative school for disruptive students.  
All confidentiality of the assessment allowable by law will be granted by the Administration.  
All SRP will be evaluated, through the use and completion of an approved assessment instrument, at least  
once during the school year. Should a worksite supervisor not meet the date designated by the Human  
Resources Department for the completion of an SRP’s evaluation, the worksite supervisor will inform the  
SRP of the reason for the delay. If an SRP receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, the SRP has the option of  
another evaluation to determine if satisfactory performance has been demonstrated. All evaluations shall be  
conducted only by worksite supervisors, their designees, or district-level supervisors.  
All recommendations regarding continued employment except for positions affected by the layoff procedure  
shall be based upon information contained in the SRP's personnel file.  
### SECTION G - STAFF DEVELOPMENT  
1.  
By February 1, the worksite supervisor and the SRP building representative will jointly conduct an election  
of all bargaining unit members at that worksite to elect a representative to coordinate SRP staff development  
activities there. The employee receiving the highest number of votes will be selected as that worksite's SRP  
staff development coordinator. All bargaining unit members at that worksite and the Union will be advised  
of election results.  
The Board and the Union shall meet to assess the district’s staff development programs as they relate to SRP  
and to make recommendations for changes/improvements.  
All staff development components offered within any calendar month shall be posted in each worksite by the  
fifteenth (15th) working day prior to the activity.  
When appropriate, SRP may serve as instructors for staff development components. The total compensation  
paid to SRP serving as instructors shall be one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular hourly rate of pay for  
each meeting hour taught and such SRP shall be paid for mileage necessary to perform his/her duties as  
instructor under this section. Such mileage payment shall be in accordance with Article XI, Section A,  
paragraph 3 of this Agreement.  
Attendance at staff development components shall be voluntary except for those components required to  
implement additional programs or goals established by the Board, the Legislature, or federal grants.  
SRP within a specific field shall have first opportunity to attend staff development components related to  
their field.  
Master inservice points may be used for recertification, and each group of twenty (20) points shall be  
equivalent to one (1) semester hour for this purpose.  
### SECTION H - POLITICAL ACTIVITY  
   
1. All SRP shall have the freedom of political action when not engaged in their work assignments or other  
assigned responsibilities during the workday provided such action is within the laws of the United States of  
America and the State of Florida and their jobs are not used for their political advantage.  
2. The right of all SRP to work and to vote for the party and candidate of their choice shall never be questioned,  
abridged, or denied by either the Board or the Union.  
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 11  
### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
3. All SRP shall be entirely free from political domination, coercion, or the pretended necessity of making  
political contributions of money or other things of value or engaging in any political work or activity against  
their wishes under the assumption that failure to do so will in any way affect their status as employees of the  
school system or as members of the Union.  
### SECTION I - WORK DAY/WORK YEAR  
1. Each SRP shall be granted at least a thirty (30) minute duty-free non-paid lunch period. However, at an  
alternative school for disruptive students, the thirty (30) minute lunch period for Bus Driver/Paraprofes-  
sionals may not be duty-free and shall be included within their eight (8) hour workday. An SRP who does  
not receive a paid lunch period shall be permitted to leave the worksite during his/her lunch period.  
2. Paid Relief Periods/Breaks  
a) Paid relief/break periods are intended to provide relief from the work schedule so as to reduce employee  
fatigue and to allow SRP to attend to personal needs. As such, paid relief/break periods should not be  
taken at either the start or end of the workday. The worksite supervisor shall designate the relief period  
for each SRP.  
b) SRP who work six (6) to eight (8) hours a day shall be granted two (2) fifteen (15) minute relief periods

longer be guaranteed minimum hours for that school year;  
d) route selection for the regular school year will occur seven (7) calendar days prior to the first student day.

day during the regular work year:  
a) guarantee will be calculated on a biweekly pay period basis;  
b) the Transportation Assistant will be given the opportunity to work the difference in hours provided by  
his/her route and the guaranteed minimum hours by substituting on other runs or, if substitute work is not  
available, by working in assigned schools; in the event a Transportation Assistant is unwilling or unable  
to work the difference in hours, he/she will be paid for the time worked, not the time guaranteed;

instruction for students in the district’s Juvenile Justice Programs. In order to provide these additional  
services to students in such programs, additional days must be provided for SRP beyond their regular

The current practice whereby the worksite administrator designates employee outdoor smoking area(s) that  
are shielded from student view and are located away from regularly used student activity areas on existing  
School Board grounds shall continue, except under the following conditions:  
a) Effective July 1, 1996, newly acquired worksites, including all School Board real and personal property  
located on those sites, shall be designated as smoke and tobacco free. No employee at these sites shall  
use any tobacco product in the building(s) or on any outside grounds. This includes the use of such  
tobacco products in motor vehicles, with the exception of those vehicles entering or exiting the  
worksite(s).  
b) A committee shall exist consisting of six (6) members, three (3) representing the Board and three (3)  
representing the Union, for the purpose of resolving problems that may arise due to the implementation of  
the Tobacco Free Policy.  
All employees assigned to any School Board facility which is not smoke and tobacco free shall be  
surveyed once each year if requested by any employee at the facility. Such request shall be made in  
writing by September 30 to the Director of Employee Relations, with a copy provided to the President of  
the Union. The intent of the survey is that, as all employees at any such facility declare that they are non-  
tobacco users or are willing to refrain from the use of tobacco products at the facility, the facility shall be  
declared tobacco free.  
When an SRP who is a tobacco user and who is on the recall list is offered a position at a smoke and tobacco  
free site, he/she shall have the right to turn down the position and shall retain his/her current place on the  
recall list. If the SRP who is a tobacco user turns down a position at a smoke and tobacco free site and gives

2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 15  
### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
being a tobacco user as the reason for turning down the position, he/she shall retain his/her current position  
on the recall list but will no longer be offered positions at other smoke and tobacco free sites.  
### SECTION R - RELIEF BUS DRIVERS  
1. In an effort to provide an adequate number of Bus Drivers, the position of “Relief Bus Driver” has been  
established. It is the intent of the Board to fill vacancies in this position from within the ranks of Bus Drivers  
currently employed with the district and to use Relief Bus Drivers as described in the approved job  
description.  
a) Relief Bus Driver hourly rate will be based on a forty (40) hour week using the salary schedule for Bus  
Drivers (SRP 19). Overtime, if any, will be kept to a minimum. However, any Relief Bus Driver who is  
called to work shall be paid for a minimum of two (2) hours.  
Advertising for Relief Bus Driver positions will be conducted “in-house.” Should this not result in filling  
all available Relief Bus Driver positions, advertising will be conducted to attract applicants from outside  
of the Transportation Department.  
c) A regular Bus Driver who moves to a Relief Bus Driver position will retain seniority as a Bus Driver.  
Such seniority will be retained for purposes of layoff/recall, route bidding on an open position, and route  
selection if the Relief Bus Driver reenters the selection process prior to the start of the school year. A  
single seniority list will be kept for the group comprised of Bus Drivers and Relief Bus Drivers for these  
purposes.  
Relief Bus Drivers will be allowed to reenter the selection process prior to the start of the school year in  
order to bid for a regular route, according to the procedures as established in the SRP Master Contract,  
Article VIII, Section A, paragraph 10. A Relief Bus Driver who wishes to reenter the selection process in  
this manner must apply in writing to the Director of Transportation on or before May 15 preceding the  
start of a new school year.  
e) Relief Bus Drivers will be allowed to bid on open routes. However, the Relief Bus Driver may be  
required to remain in the Relief Bus Driver position until his/her replacement is hired.  
b  
  
d  
—  
f) Relief Bus Drivers will be afforded the same rights to bid on Summer School routes as are Bus Drivers.  
g) Relief Bus Drivers can choose to be in the field trip rotation. However, the Relief Bus Driver recognizes  
that because of the requirement to keep overtime to a minimum, the opportunity for field trip assignments  
is diminished.  
h) Relief Bus Drivers may be used as coaches or to assist in training of new drivers. Relief Bus Drivers will  
not be used in a supervisory capacity.  
2. The Board and the Union will work together to resolve problems, if any, as the problems become identified.  
### SECTION S - SCHOOL ADVISORY COUNCILS  
1. The composition of and procedures for SRP, education support employees, membership on School Advisory  
Councils (SACs) shall be in accordance with guidelines provided in the district manual “Pasco County

2. According to the provisions of Florida Statute 1001.452(1)(a), education support employee means any person  
employed by a school who is not defined as instructional or administrative personnel and whose duties  
require twenty (20) or more hours in a normal working week.  
3. Upon the Union President's request, the Superintendent and/or his/her designee shall meet with the Union  
President on mutually agreeable date(s) and time(s) for the purpose of facilitating the communication of  
information regarding school accountability and improvement.  
### SECTION T - MISCELLANEOUS  
1. The SRP are essential persons in the educational process and shall be treated with dignity and respect.  
a) Within the context of an appropriate setting, SRP shall be encouraged to provide input and suggestions in  
matters pertaining to their job duties.  
b) Insofar as SRP are involved in disciplinary matters concerning students, administrators shall support SRP  
in disciplinary matters in a manner consistent with the facts of each incident, the disciplinary record of the  
student involved, the provisions of the Code of Student Conduct, and any other factors which have a  
bearing on the matter under consideration.

Upon request, an SRP shall receive a courtesy pass for regular season district athletic events which will admit  
him/her free of charge.  
The regular appointment date as a Transportation Assistant shall be used to determine the order for route

the school.  
At the end of their first year, SRP who volunteered to work at an alternative school for disruptive students  
shall have the right to return to their previous worksite position. If an SRP wishes to exercise this right,  
he/she must notify his/her current and previous worksite supervisors and the district Human Resources  
Department in writing of his/her intentions prior to April 1. Failure to make this notification will bar relief  
through the grievance process in the event another person has been appointed to the previous worksite  
position for the next school year.

authorized by the worksite or district/program supervisor, and has successfully completed child-specific  
training by a licensed practical nurse, a registered nurse, a licensed physician, or a licensed physician  
assistant. All procedures shall be monitored periodically by the nurse. Those procedures include, but are

### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### SECTION A - RULES GOVERNING  
1.  
Any SRP on approved leave shall retain seniority rights. No approved leave shall be considered a break in  
service for any reason, but seniority shall not be accrued during that time except in the case of Military Leave  
or the Union President's leave.  
Any SRP on approved leave with pay shall be eligible for all benefits during the period of the leave including  
but not limited to retirement and retention of employment status.  
During any approved leave of absence, the SRP shall have the right to participate in all group fringe benefit  
plans provided by the Board. In the event the leave is unpaid, the SRP shall be permitted to make his/her  
own and the Board's regular contributions to all benefits requiring such contributions.  
Any SRP on approved, extended leave who returns to the position held prior to going on leave without a  
break in service shall be placed on the appropriate salary step upon return. If the SRP does not return to the  
position held prior to going on leave or if there is a break in service, salary step placement shall be governed  
by the rules in effect at the time of rehire. However, those SRP returning from Military Leave within the  
time legally stipulated shall be advanced to the appropriate position on the salary schedule as if they had been  
in actual service in the district.  
a) Positions shall be held for SRP who are granted unpaid leave under the following conditions:

8) Unpaid Personal Leave not to exceed nine (9) workdays for circumstances not covered by 1 through  
7. In cases of documented family problems, household emergencies, and/or legal business which  
necessitates the SRP being absent from work, an additional eleven (11) days of unpaid Personal Leave  
may be granted. The supporting reasons for such additional unpaid Personal Leave must be submitted  
in writing.  
b) Upon request, an SRP shall be granted any unpaid leave listed in Article VIII, Section C-Unpaid Leaves  
under the provisions stated therein for which he/she qualifies for a period up to one year, but his/her  
position shall not be held except for SRP who are granted Civic Participation Leave, Education Leave,  
Military Leave, FMLA Leave, or Union President's and Union-designated leave. Further, no extension of  
leave beyond one (1) year shall be granted except for Civic Participation Leave, Military Leave, or Union

applying for such leave if the position exists. Persons hired to replace SRP who are on extended, unpaid  
leave and whose position is being held will be notified prior to employment that their appointment is only for  
the period of time that the SRP is on leave. In the event that the SRP does not return from leave or extends  
his/her leave and no longer qualifies for the position to be held, the person occupying the position shall  
continue in the position. Prior to recommending approval of an extended, unpaid leave, the worksite  
supervisor shall inform the SRP in writing whether or not his/her position will be held for the return of the  
SRP from leave. If the position will not be held, the SRP will be terminated at the end of his/her leave.  
However, an SRP will be given consideration for other positions for which he/she may be qualified when  
he/she is ready to return from leave.  
7. a) If an SRP has exhausted all paid leave and is still unable to work because of personal illness or injury,  
he/she will be granted unpaid Sick Leave for a period not to exceed twenty (20) additional workdays, and  
his/her position will be held. If the SRP is still unable to return to work at that point, he/she shall be  
granted Health Leave under the provisions contained in Article VIII, Section C-5. If the SRP is unable to  
return to work after the first ninety (90) days of Health Leave, his/her position will no longer be held.  
b) Unpaid leave granted under the provisions of Article VIII, Section C-7 a) 5), Family and Medical Leave  
(FMLA), based on the serious health condition of the SRP, will be counted toward the days available for  
unpaid Health Leave, and will be counted toward the ninety (90) days of Health Leave in which an SRP's  
position will be held.  
Should an SRP be granted FMLA Leave due to the SRP's serious health condition, and such leave be  
granted beyond the first ninety (90) days of unpaid Health Leave, the SRP's position will be held until the  
conclusion of his/her approved FMLA Leave. If the SRP is unable to return to work after the conclusion  
of the approved FMLA Leave, his/her position will not be held.  
8. An SRP who is absent without leave on a temporary basis shall not be subject to loss of pay and/or subject to  
reprimand or dismissal if said absence is beyond the individual's control and the SRP is unable to notify the  
worksite supervisor or designee and said SRP is eligible for paid leave during his/her absence. Upon request  
by the worksite supervisor or designee, reasonable documentation, if the situation permits, and/or explanation  
will be furnished by the SRP at the earliest possible time.  
### C  
  
9. When an SRP receives an unpaid leave of absence after the beginning of the second semester that extends to  
the end of the school year, the number of days remaining to be paid to the SRP shall be divided by the

### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
number of days in the SRP regular payroll check to determine the number of pay periods for which the  
school district will pay benefits except as provided for FMLA Leave.  
10. When bus routes are picked at the beginning of the school year, a Bus Driver or Transportation Assistant on  
extended leave for whom a position is not being held who wishes to return from leave and is otherwise

3) the placement and/or care of a child in the foster care of the employee.  
4) the care of a child, spouse or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition (as defined in  
Part a) 5). For purposes of this paragraph: (a) the term "spouse" means a husband or wife as defined  
or recognized under State law for purposes of marriage; (b) the term "parent" means a biological  
parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a  
child — this term does not include parents "in law"; (c) the terms "son" or "daughter" mean a  
biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco  
parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental  
or physical disability.  
5) the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his/her job.  
A "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that  
involves:

overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility);  
b. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  
more than three (3) calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the  
supervision of) a health care provider; or  
c. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or long-  
term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  
period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or for prenatal care.  
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not "serious health  
conditions" unless inpatient hospital care is required.  
b) The twelve (12) month period for entitlement under this section will be measured from July 1 through  
June 30.  
c) In order to be eligible, the employee must have been employed by the Board for at least one year, and the  
employee must actually have received pay for 1,250 or more hours from the Board during the twelve (12)  
month period immediately preceding the unpaid leave. Holidays, earned Sick Leave, and vacation time  
for which the employee has been paid but has not worked shall be included in the calculation of the 1,250  
hours. Workers' Compensation, suspension with pay, and Sabbatical Leave for which the employee has  
been paid will not be included in the calculation of the 1,250 hours. Sick Leave Bank days for which the  
employee has been paid will not be included in the calculation of the 1,250 hours. Should an SRP apply  
for FMLA Leave based on the serious health condition of the SRP as described in subparagraph 7 a) 5),  
and such requested leave immediately follows Sick Leave Bank days which were granted for the SRP's  
serious health condition, the twelve (12) month period in which the SRP received pay will be calculated  
prior to the first day of approved Sick Leave Bank.

1), a) 2), and a) 3), must conclude within one (1) year from the date of the birth, adoption, or placement of  
the child.  
f) Leave for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child with an employee as described in subparagraphs 7 a)

toward the days that may be granted as Health Leave under Article VIII, C-5.

be counted toward the SRP's annual entitlement of up to twelve (12) weeks of FMLA Leave.

1) Anemployee must first use all available earned paid Sick Leave before unpaid FMLA Leave will be  
granted.  
2) The employee will be restored to his/her former position unless the employee's position has been  
affected by reduction in force and/or layoff.  
3) The Board shall require materials documenting the reason for the leave before granting a leave of  
absence under this section.  
4) It is the responsibility of the employee to obtain the necessary documentation and to furnish the  
documentation to the Board.  
5) The Board may request verification of a medical condition for which leave has been granted under  
this section at any reasonable interval, but not more often than once every thirty (30) days, unless:  
a. the employee requests an extension of leave;  
b. circumstances described by the original documentation have changed significantly (i.e., the  
duration of the illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or  
c. the employer receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the  
documentation.  
6) If the Board pays the employee contribution missed by the employee while on leave, the employee  
will be required to reimburse the Board for delinquent payments (on a payroll deduction schedule)  
upon return from leave. The employee will be required to sign a written statement at the beginning of  
the leave period authorizing the payroll deduction for delinquent payments.  
7) An employee may continue coverage by continuing to pay the employee's portion of the premiums,  
including dependent coverage, while on leave.  
8) The employee must notify the Board as soon as practicable once the employee knows that a leave will  
be needed. For a foreseeable leave, such as for birth, adoption, or planned medical treatment, the  
employee must provide at least thirty (30) days notice to the Board. In all cases, the employee must  
furnish a request to the Board on a form provided by the Board.  
9) Prior to the employee's return to work from an employee disability, the employee shall submit  
medical certification of the employee's fitness to return to work.  
10) The Board retains the right to implement reasonable rules and regulations with regard to the use of  
leaves of absence within the requirements of the FMLA. This includes but is not limited to requiring  
a second opinion, at the Board's discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  
disability, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation, and fitness to return  
to work.  
11) In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  
with the first doctor's opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  
Board-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and employee. This third opinion will be  
final and binding upon the Board and the employee.  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 28  
### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
j) Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave  
An eligible employee who is entitled to a twelve (12) week leave under the provisions of this section may  
take that leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in certain cases. An intermittent leave  
schedule is one in which the employee may take the allowable leave intermittently, or in blocks of days at  
a time, as needed. A reduced leave schedule is one in which the employee's daily or weekly work hours  
are reduced, as needed. Leave will be granted intermittently or on a reduced leave basis in the case of the  
serious health conditions of the employee or of the child, spouse, or parent of the employee, provided that  
it is medically necessary and that a certification from a physician is obtained.  
The amount of Family and Medical Leave used where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a  
reduced leave schedule will be determined in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Family  
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, currently 8825.205 of the Interim Regulations.  
Effect of Leave on Board-Paid Benefits  
During the period of leave governed by this section, the Board will pay the portion of the insurance  
premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major medical, surgical, dental, vision, life,  
and flexible benefits. The cost of these benefits will be paid by the Board based on the expectation that  
the employee will return to work following the approved FMLA Leave. Return to work means that the  
employee must return to work for at least thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion of approved  
FMLA Leave or following the conclusion of other approved leave which is granted under Article VIII and  
which is immediately subsequent to the FMLA Leave. Non-contracted days during summer break, and  
unpaid holidays during winter and spring break will not be used in calculating the thirty (30) calendar  
days. If an employee does not return to work for the Board after FMLA Leave, the Board shall take  
necessary steps to recover the Board's share of the health premium payments made on the employee's  
behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA Leave unless:  
1) the employee's position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff;  
2) the employee has a continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would  
entitle the employee to leave under FMLA; or  
3) other circumstances beyond the employee's control. In cases where an employee does not return to  
work and claims the reason to be "other circumstances beyond the employee's control," the details  
regarding such circumstances will be reduced to writing and submitted for review by the Board's  
designee responsible for FMLA Leave. The Board may require additional documentation to support  
the employee's claim. The Board will use applicable Federal Regulations and existing case law to  
determine whether the circumstances claimed by the employee as resulting in the employee not being  
able to return to work were beyond the employee's control.  
1) The SRP’s position will be held.  
8. Continuous Service Health Leave Benefits  
a) The purpose of this provision is to extend certain insurance benefits to SRP who are not eligible for those  
benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and subsequent language as provided in  
Article VIII, Section C, paragraph 7 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract because their work  
calendar(s) (days and hours) for the preceding twelve (12) months does not equal 1250 hours or more as  
required for eligibility under FMLA, but who are eligible for Health Leave under Article VIII, Section C,  
### paragraph 5 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract.  
Specifically, for this purpose an eligible SRP is one who:  
k  
—  
b  
—  
1) has completed ten (10) years of continuous employment by the Board;  
2) is in an insurance benefit earning position;  
3) during the twelve (12) month period preceding the unpaid health leave has been in a paid status for at  
least 95% of the SRP’s contracted hours. Holidays, earned sick leave, and vacation time for which  
the employee has been paid but had not worked shall be included in the calculation of the hours.  
Workers’ Compensation, suspension with pay, and Sabbatical Leave for which the employee has been  
paid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Sick Leave Bank days for which the  
employee has been paid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Should an SRP apply for  
Health Leave and such requested leave immediately follows Sick Leave Bank days which were

### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
granted for the SRP’s serious health condition, the twelve (12) month period in which the SRP  
received pay will be calculated prior to the first day of approved Sick Leave Bank; and  
4) documents that Health Leave is required for the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents  
the SRP from performing his/her job. A “serious health condition” means an illness, injury,  
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:  
a. any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to in-patient care (i.e., an  
overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility);  
b. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  
more than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision  
of) a health care provider; or,  
c. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or long-  
term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  
period of incapacity of more than three calendar days; or for prenatal care.  
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not “serious health  
conditions” unless in-patient hospital care is required.  
c) The twelve (12) month period for entitlement of insurance benefits under this provision will be measured  
from July 1 through June 30.  
d) Any insurance benefits paid as a result of the approval of days by the Sick Leave Bank under the  
provisions of Article VIII, Section B, paragraph 6, will be counted toward the SRP’s annual entitlement  
of up to twelve (12) weeks of insurance benefits.  
e) The receipt of insurance benefits as mentioned in this provision is subject to the following restrictions and  
privileges:  
1) The Board shall require the SRP to obtain and to furnish to the Board the necessary documentation of  
a serious health condition as described in paragraph b) 4) b, and c of this provision.  
2) The Board may request that the SRP provide additional verification of a serious health condition at  
any reasonable interval.  
3) The Board retains the right to implement reasonable rules and regulations with regard to the approval  
of benefits based on a claim of a serious health condition. This includes but is not limited to requiring  
a second opinion, at the Board’s discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  
condition, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation, and fitness to return  
to work.  
4) In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  
with the first doctor’s opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  
Board-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and SRP. This third opinion will be final  
and binding upon the Board and the SRP.  
5) Board-Paid Insurance Benefits  
For SRP who are eligible for continuous service health leave benefits, the Board will pay the portion  
of the insurance premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major medical, surgical,  
dental, life, and flexible benefits. The cost of these benefits will be paid by the Board based on the  
expectation that the SRP will return to work following the approved Health Leave. Return to work  
means that the SRP must return to work for at least thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion  
of approved Health Leave or following the conclusion of other approved leave which is granted under  
Article VIII, and which is immediately subsequent to the Health Leave. Noncontracted days during  
summer break and unpaid holidays during winter and spring break will not be used in calculating the  
thirty (30) calendar days. If the SRP does not return to work for the Board after approved leave, the  
Board shall take necessary steps to recover the Board’s share of the health premium payments made  
on the SRP’s behalf during a period of unpaid Health Leave unless:  
a. the SRP’s position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff,  
b. the SRP has a continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle  
the SRP to additional health leave, or  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 30  
### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
c. other circumstances beyond the SRP’s control. In cases where an employee does not return to  
work and claims the reason to be “other circumstances beyond the employee’s control,” the details  
regarding such circumstances will be reduced to writing and submitted for review by the Board’s  
designee responsible for approval of such leave. The Board may require additional documentation  
to support the SRP’s claim. The Board will determine whether the circumstances claimed by the  
SRP as resulting in the SRP not being able to return to work were beyond the SRP’s control.  
f) SRP are not entitled to more than twelve (12) weeks of combined leave in any year (July 1 to June 30)  
under provisions of the FMLA and Continuous Service Health Leave Benefits.

or Board policy.  
The Board and Union recognize that situations may arise in which an SRP may use reasonable force to  
protect himself/herself, students, or others from harm in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Code  
of Student Conduct. Any SRP shall immediately report any instance involving the use of physical force to  
protect himself/herself or another employee and/or student, or the restraining of disruptive students, and any

there shall be no deduction made for Sick Leave allowance credited to such SRP.  
2. Absence from work related to an injury/illness-in-the-line-of-duty during the school year in which the ILD  
occurred shall not cause an SRP who is otherwise eligible and is drawing Workers' Compensation benefits to  
lose credit for seniority, step increases, insurance benefits, or contributions to the Florida Retirement System.

modified duty, benefits to which the SRP is eligible under Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, shall be paid while  
the Board seeks additional information regarding the medical condition, medical limitations, and/or medical

determine the credibility of such threat. When administration has been notified properly the student shall not  
have direct contact with the SRP during school hours or on school property until the threat assessment is  
concluded and the SRP is notified of the results. If the threat is made by a person not under the jurisdiction  
of the school board, the SRP will not be required to meet with that person until the matter has been  
investigated and documented by the worksite supervisor and the SRP has been notified of the results of that  
investigation. The SRP has the right to have an administrator present at any future meetings with the person  
making the threat.  
2. Any student found to have committed assault or battery against an SRP will be subjected to disciplinary  
action as provided in the Code of Student Conduct.

SRP in the course of fulfilling his/her employment responsibilities or from any act by the SRP for the  
purpose of preventing injury to persons or damage to property located on the worksite during any worksite-  
related activity. The reimbursement of damaged or vandalized personal property (other than motor vehicles)  
is limited to those items that the SRP uses to perform his/her job and/or duty responsibilities. Theft of cash  
or any other personal property is not covered by this provision. No claim covered under other provisions of  
this Agreement shall be paid from this account.

year.  
3. clothing and/or personal property is insured, the SRP must submit a claim to the appropriate insurance  
company. In the event of full reimbursement for such claim, the Board shall make no payment. If the  
insurance company reimburses all but the deductible amount specified in the SRP's policy, the Board will  
pay an amount equal to the deductible amount not to exceed $500.00. If the claim is for less than the  
deductible amount specified or the clothing or personal property is not insured, the Board will pay an amount  
equal to the current value of the property not to exceed $500.00. In determining the current value of personal  
property, factors such as the age, condition, and current replacement cost of the personal property will be  
considered by the Board.

possible and complete the Comprehensive Accident/Injury/Loss form and submit it to the worksite  
supervisor.  
5. After review of the initial request for reimbursement, the Board may require additional information and/or  
documentation related to the request, including a second estimate if the reported damage is to the SRP's  
personal vehicle. After review of the submitted information, the Board will provide to the SRP a written  
statement as to whether the request for reimbursement has been approved. If the request for reimbursement  
is approved, the Board will state in writing that the request was approved, and state with particularity and  
limitation(s) on the amount which may apply to the request. If the request is not approved, the Board will  
State in writing the reason(s) why the request for reimbursement was not approved. In cases which involve  
personal property other than motor vehicles, the Board may require that the damaged property be submitted  
to the Board's representative before the Board authorizes reimbursement to an SRP for the replacement  
and/or compensation for the value of damaged property.  
6. In the event the claim is for vandalism to the SRP's personal vehicle, a copy of his/her automobile insurance  
policy declaration page and an estimate for repair must be included with the Comprehensive

### C  
—  
All other SRP who work six (6) hours or more per day or thirty (30) hours or more in each normal  
working week for ninety (90) days or more per year shall be eligible for insurance benefits to the same  
extent as full-time SRP. SRP eligible for insurance benefits on November 19, 1987 shall continue to  
receive insurance benefits as long as they maintain current eligibility until such time as their employment  
with the district is terminated. If an SRP earning insurance benefits on November 19, 1987 drops below  
the work hours necessary to earn insurance benefits, he/she will lose said benefits. When the SRP’s hours  
are increased to at least four (4) hours, he/she again would earn insurance benefits.  
4. Insurance benefits are effective the first day of the month following the SRP’s completion of one calendar  
month of employment in a benefit earning position. If dependent coverage is desired, it must carry the same

and to the bargaining unit members on the first day of the annual open enrollment period.  
6. The open enrollment for insurance benefits shall be a minimum of thirty (30) days during the period this  
activity was accomplished during the 1987-88 fiscal year. A change in this period in subsequent years may  
be made with the mutual consent of the Board and the Union.  
7. Any SRP whose dependent status changes who wishes to add or delete dependent coverage after the  
enrollment period shall be restricted only by the provisions as stated in the Benefit Enrollment/Change Form  
(MIS #161).  
### SECTION C —- PAYROLL DEDUCTION FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS

deduction slot. These slots will be used for Union-designated programs to include but not be limited to  
purchasing additional insurance, annuity, or other related benefits; voluntary Political Action Committee  
(PAC) donations; or other Union-sponsored voluntary deduction programs for bargaining unit members.  
2. The Union agrees to reimburse the Board for any actual start-up programming costs incurred which are  
normally charged to other groups who benefit from payroll deduction services.  
3. A single payment will be remitted after each pay period to a depository designated by the Union for each of  
the two (2) additional payroll deduction slots.  
### SECTION D - EARLY RETIREMENT MONTHLY BENEFIT  
1. Effective January 1, 1997, the Board shall provide an early retirement benefit for all SRP who:  
a) are fifty (50) years of age or older at the time of retirement,  
b) have twenty-five (25) or more years of creditable FRS service,  
c) have reached the final step on his/her salary schedule,  
d) have completed twelve (12) years of Pasco service, the last ten (10) of which must be Pasco continuous  
service, and  
e) have retired under the Florida Retirement System (FRS) Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan) or who  
retires with any vested benefit in the Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan).  
Qualifying SRP who choose to retire early on or after July 1, 2001, will receive the early retirement benefit in  
accordance with the following:  
f) SRP who are at least fifty (50) years of age but less than fifty-five (55) years of age at the time of early  
retirement will receive an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the unreduced FRS retirement  
benefit. The unreduced FRS retirement benefit is calculated using the premise of the SRP being sixty-two  
(62) years of age at the time of retirement.  
g) SRP who are at least fifty-five (55) years of age but less than sixty-two (62) years of age at the time of  
early retirement will receive an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the difference between  
the unreduced FRS benefit and the reduced FRS early retirement benefit.  
At the time of early retirement, if the early retirement monthly benefit described in f) or g) above has a single  
sum value (present value) of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) as of the date the early retirement  
monthly benefit is first effective, then the Board will provide a one-time lump sum payment equal to the  
single sum value (present value) of the early retirement monthly benefit.  
In lieu of the benefits described in f) and g) above, any eligible SRP choosing to retire early and who has out-  
of-state service, or any other qualifying service, and is eligible to purchase such service according to FRS  
rules and regulations, the Board may purchase such service if the purchase of such service would total thirty  
(30) years and enable the employee to full retirement under FRS. It is clearly understood that the Board shall  
provide the monthly benefit or purchase out-of-state service, or any other qualifying service, whichever is  
more economical for the Board.  
2. This provision shall not prohibit the Board from paying additional retirement bonuses provided for in this  
Agreement or future bonuses agreed to by the Board and the Union.  
3. No employee shall be required by the Board to take advantage of the provisions of this article.  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 36  
### ARTICLE XI -- SALARY AND SCHOOL RELATED PERSONNEL WELFARE  
4. If an employee chooses one of these aforementioned early retirement options, the Board will have no further  
obligation toward his/her retirement benefits.  
5. SRP who select one of these aforementioned early retirement options are required to retire from the Florida  
Retirement System (FRS) and terminate their employment with the district. Therefore, such SRP are not  
eligible to participate in the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) as the DROP requires an SRP to  
retire from the FRS yet continue to work within the district.  
### SECTION E —- DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM (DROP)  
1. Effective July 1, 1998, employees who qualify for the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) may  
elect to participate in that program as provided by the procedures set forth by the district and by Florida  
Statute 121.091. An employee’s salary, benefits, terms, and conditions of employment as specified in this  
Agreement will remain in full force during the employee’s participation in DROP. An employee can void

6 Upon Separation 100.0%  
5. The rate of pay used to calculate the amount to be placed in the 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an  
Employer Paid 403(b) Plan shall be the employee’s rate of pay upon entering DROP or the employee’s rate

earnings will be used to contribute the same amount toward the retiree's health premium (medical, dental, and  
vision) each year as the Board does toward the premium of a regular employee. The contribution will begin  
upon retirement and continue until the retiree receives Medicare benefits or until twenty-four (24) months  
have elapsed from the date of retirement, whichever comes first.

employee or his/her dependent and paid as an allowable charge by the School Board benefits  
carrier/administrator shall be fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the overcharge that is recovered by the  
benefits carrier/administrator as a result of direct negotiation between the employee and the provider and

### ARTICLE XIII - DURATION  
### ADDENDUM A -- RULES GOVERNING THE SALARY SCHEDULE  
All SRP shall be paid according to their job title, salary schedule, and the rules governing that schedule.  
Effective November 19, 1987, any SRP employed in Pasco County whose service is interrupted due to active  
military service shall be granted experience for a maximum of four (4) years as if he/she had been serving  
within the district.  
In order to receive credit for a year of Pasco continuous service, an SRP must be in paid duty status one day  
more than one-half (1/2) of his/her work year. However, in the event an SRP is reassigned or promoted, credit  
will be given if that person would have received credit in either position. An SRP who receives credit for a year  
of Pasco continuous service will advance one (1) step on the salary schedule.  
Pay dates for the 2006-2007 school year and the number of salary warrants will be negotiated during the 2006-  
2007 negotiations.  
In the event that any regular pay date falls on a weekend or during any holiday period, paychecks shall be  
issued on the last working day preceding said weekend or holiday period.  
An SRP who terminates his/her employment during the school year shall receive all pay owed him/her within  
twenty (20) days of the termination date.  
SRP who have pay warrants due after their last day of work may leave a stamped, self-addressed envelope for  
each warrant due with the worksite supervisor who will mail the warrant(s) to the SRP.  
Upon Union request, step increases for the 2006-2007 school year shall be withheld to allow restructuring of the  
salary schedules.  
Summer School and/or Extended School Year salaries, effective for the 2005-2006 Summer School and/or  
Extended School Year shall be at the SRP’s regular hourly rate of the prior (ending) school year (e.g., 2005-  
2006 for 2006 Summer School and/or Extended School Year.)  
Service Factor  
1.  
To be eligible to receive the Service Factor, an SRP must have earned at least one year’s credit of Pasco  
continuous service since arriving at the top step of his/her salary schedule.  
The Service Factor is determined by multiplying five hundredths (.05) times the number of years of Pasco  
district employment times the number of hours worked daily times the length of the individual SRP’s work year  
to equal an amount. The amount is spread equally over the SRP’s pay dates.  
SRP eligible to receive the Service Factor will receive an additional eighty cents ($.80) per hour.

### FEDERAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM FOR HOLDERS OF FLORIDA  
### CLASS A OR B COMMERCIAL DRIVERS’ LICENSES  
The Board and Union recognize that employees who are required to hold a Class A or Class B Commercial Drivers  
License (CDL) as a condition of employment and/or who, in the course of their employment, may be required to  
drive a vehicle for which a Florida Class A or B Commercial Drivers License is required (hereinafter referred to as  
covered employees) must comply with the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (OTETA),  
regulations of the Federal Highway Administration contained in 49 CFR Parts 40 and 382, et al., and Section  
1012.45, Florida Statutes.  
Notification  
The Board shall provide all covered employees with educational materials that explain the requirements of the  
Program and the Board’s policies and procedures with respect to meeting these requirements. Each employee who  
has received a copy of these materials shall be required to sign a statement certifying that he/she has received a copy  
of these materials.  
Testing  
Testing of covered employees shall be done in accordance with applicable Federal and State law. The employee  
Shall be paid his/her regular hourly rate for the time involved for such testing beyond the employee’s normal  
working hours unless such testing results in an employee working beyond forty (40) hours that week. In such cases,  
the employee shall be compensated at one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular hourly rate unless exempt from  
the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Refusal to report for testing when notified to do so shall be  
considered a positive test.  
Positive Test Results for Alcohol or Prohibited Substances  
If a covered employee tests .02 to .039 for breath alcohol, he/she shall be removed from performing the duties of  
his/her safety-sensitive position for twenty-four (24) hours. If the employee has accrued Sick or Vacation Leave,  
he/she shall be permitted to use such leave during this period. A conference may be held with the employee in an  
attempt to determine why he/she tested .02 to .039 so as to prevent recurrence.  
If an employee tests .04 or higher for breath alcohol or tests positive for any prohibited substance, he/she shall be  
removed from performing the duties of his/her safety-sensitive position, and he/she shall be referred to a substance  
abuse professional. In addition, there will be other employment consequences which may include termination. In  
the event that the primary specimen confirms the presence of prohibited substances, and the employee believes there  
has been an error in the analysis, he/she may request that the split specimen be tested. The cost of this second  
analysis shall be the responsibility of the employee. However, should this analysis produce a negative result, the  
Board shall reimburse the employee for the cost.  
Reasonable Suspicion  
When a supervisor believes that a covered employee is in violation of OTETA regulations, he/she shall confer with  
the district OTETA administrator or designee who shall decide whether to proceed further. If the OTETA  
administrator or designee meets with the employee for the purpose of notifying him/her that reasonable suspicion  
testing will be required, he/she shall do so in conjunction with a trained supervisor. A Union representative shall be  
permitted to attend the meeting with the right to ask questions for the purpose of clarification. Because time is  
important when giving an alcohol test, the meeting will not be delayed if the Union representative is unable to be  
present at the specified time for the meeting to begin. During the meeting, the OTETA administrator will cite the  
indicators which led to the reasonable suspicion, and the employee shall be given an opportunity to give an  
explanation if he/she desires.  
Confidentiality  
Confidentiality required by OTETA regulations will be observed, and no voluntary report of a test required by these  
regulations shall be made to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Asbestos Exposure Procedure  
In compliance with the requirement of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), 40 CFR Part 763  
Section 91, the District School Board of Pasco County (DSBPC) has implemented an operations, maintenance, and  
repair program to deal with the disturbance of non-intact asbestos containing materials and intact materials that may  
become non-intact as a result of construction or maintenance activities. Furthermore, the DSBPC in adherence with  
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s construction standard for asbestos, 29 CFR 1926.1101,  
assumes certain building materials to be asbestos in buildings constructed prior to 1981. However, in all cases  
where information, data, and analysis supporting the determination that the assumed or Presumed Asbestos  
Containing Material (PACM) does not contain asbestos, then the material is considered a non-asbestos containing  
material.  
If materials that are suspect or PACM are encountered during the performance of their work, and these materials  
were not identified to them before the commencement of their work, employees are required to stop and inquire  
through their immediate supervisor to determine if the status of the material is known.  
In these situations, it is the policy of the DSBPC that no employee will proceed with his/her work until verification  
of the material has been made and any asbestos content determined. This determination will be made either through  
existing information contained in the AHERA Management Plan, or by collecting a sample of the material and  
sending the sample to a certified laboratory for analysis.  
In the event an employee has disturbed a material believed by him/her to be asbestos, the following procedures will  
immediately be implemented:  
1. All employees in the immediate area will stop work.  
2. The area around the place where the PACM has been disturbed will be cleared of all personnel.  
3. The affected employees will contact their immediate supervisor or the DSBPC’s environmental staff. Any  
supervisor who has been notified of a potential asbestos disturbance must immediately notify the DSBPC’s  
environmental staff.  
4. The area will be regulated and entry into the area will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Signs will  
be displayed on all approaches to the area to prevent unauthorized persons from entering.  
5. In compliance with AHERA, situations where more than three (3) square feet or three (3) linear feet of non-  
intact (friable) PACM has been disturbed, the air conditioning system for the affected area will be shut off to  
prevent the possible distribution of fibers to other areas of the building.  
6. As soon as the area is secure and the incident has been reported, the affected employee(s) must proceed to the  
nearest shower facility and either take a shower, or as a minimum precaution, wash his/her face, hands, and  
hair.  
7. In addition, if an employee has been exposed to non-intact (friable) PACM, he/she must take the following  
precautions. Place any clothing thought to have been exposed to a PACM into a plastic bag or other sealable  
container. The clothing must remain sealed in this container until the PACM has been analyzed or identified  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 46  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
as a non-asbestos containing material. If the PACM is determined to be asbestos containing, the clothing will  
be disposed of as an asbestos waste. Replacement clothing of equal value and type will be purchased from  
funds provided in Article IX, Section D of the SRP Collective Bargaining Agreement. Work boots will be  
HEPA vacuumed, wet-wiped, and reused.  
Following notification of the incident to the environmental staff, a cross-reference of the facilities AHERA  
Management Plan will be made to determine if the material has been previously identified, sampled, and analyzed.  
If the material cannot be referenced, it will be assumed that the disturbance has been of an asbestos containing  
material and the environmental staff will dispatch a clean-up crew through a DSBPC approved abatement  
contractor. The complete area will be cleaned using asbestos cleaning techniques. Either the DSBPC’s  
Environmental Specialist or a representative of the environmental consulting company will proceed to the site and  
collect samples of the suspect material for analysis and identification.  
In situations where the asbestos content of a material is unknown the site will be considered an asbestos  
contaminated area until the analysis of samples collected indicate otherwise.  
The DSBPC intends to continue to use certified asbestos contractors for the removal of asbestos containing materials  
in conjunction with maintenance personnel performing small maintenance projects on intact (non-friable) materials.

### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Job Sharing  
The Board and the Union recognize the need to allow increased flexibility in finding and successfully completing  
college courses, as well as maintaining a family focus. The district shall provide a job sharing program as follows:  
Job sharing is the employment of two (2) SRP performing the duties and responsibilities of one individual. Job  
sharing is not designed to be permanent part-time employment or to provide opportunity for individuals to work for  
another employer.  
Two (2) benefit earning SRP who wish to share one position must first request and obtain the approval of their  
principal/supervisor. Upon approval of the principal/supervisor, the request for job sharing must be sent to the  
Director of Employee Relations and the President of USEP by April 1 for approval. If approved, two (2) SRP may  
participate in the job sharing program for the next school year. Upon approval of the principal, the two (2) SRP may  
request to extend job sharing for additional years to a maximum of five (5) years. Each year, requests for extensions  
must be sent to the Director of Employee Relations and the President of USEP by April 1 for approval. Job sharing  
will be approved in one-year periods.  
Reasons for an SRP requesting to job share may include the following:  
a) Childcare.  
b) Medical condition of the SRP or immediate family member. Immediate family shall mean husband, wife,  
child, father, mother, brother, sister, or other close relative or member of his/her household.

assignments shall be made by the principal/supervisor. Any changes must be approved by the  
principal/supervisor.  
b) Each SRP shall be credited with four (4) one-half (1/2) days of Sick Leave at the end of the first month of  
employment each year and shall earn one-half (1/2) day of Sick Leave each month thereafter. Sick Leave  
will be credited each pay period until the yearly allotment is reached. Each SRP shall be allowed up to six  
(6) one-half (1/2) days of personal leave. Such leave will not be cumulative and shall be deducted from  
accrued sick leave when used.

k)  
Each SRP shall receive the appropriate contributions for the Florida Retirement System and social security.  
Each SRP will be paid as shown on the appropriate salary schedule.  
For the purposes of seniority and credit on the salary schedule, assignments for each SRP will constitute  
more than one-half of the school year thus entitling each SRP to one year of service.  
One SRP will receive full benefits, health, and flexible benefits, as provided by the district. The other SRP  
will sign a waiver of such benefits.  
Should one of the two SRP job sharing have to vacate his/her position during the year due to unavoidable  
circumstances, the remaining SRP will assume that position. However, in cases where a replacement for the  
vacating job sharing SRP can be found who is approved by the principal/supervisor, the Director of  
Employee Relations, and the President of USEP, the position may continue as a job sharing position.  
Upon return from an approved job sharing position of no more than one (1) year, an SRP shall be placed in  
the same position held upon applying for said job sharing position if such position exists. Any SRP who is  
hired for the purpose of replacing an individual who is job sharing will be notified upon employment that  
employment is for the period of the job share and will sign a condition of employment letter which states that  
they will be terminated at the end of the period. In the event the SRP does not return from his/her job sharing  
position or extends the job sharing agreement beyond one (1) year, the person occupying the position shall  
continue that position.  
If a job share is extended beyond one (1) year, upon completion of the job share one (1) of the two (2) SRP  
will be laid off in accordance with Article VII, Section D, of the SRP Master Contract.  
Other working conditions and benefits as stipulated in the SRP Master Contract may not be applicable and  
subject to waiver based upon the needs of the students, school, or position. Such waivers shall be agreed to  
by the Director of Employee Relations and the President of USEP.

Monitoring of Pre-K Students on Buses  
Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, all district prekindergarten students transported on district school buses  
will be transported in a specified Child Safety Restraint System and each bus transporting prekindergarten students  
will have a monitor on the bus.  
The Board and Union agree to the following guidelines relative to the use of school based instructional  
assistants/paraprofessionals for the bus monitoring function:  
1.  
2.  
Aap Se  
Appropriate training will be provided.  
When the monitoring assignment establishes a regular workday longer than what the SRP’s regular workday  
was without the monitoring duties, the workday will be represented in quarter hour increments. (7.25, 7.5,  
etc.)  
Sick leave will be earned based on the SRP’s established regular workday.  
Sick leave will be used according to the SRP’s established workday at the time of use.  
The length of the SRP’s regular workday may change due to student ridership or a bus route change.  
Seniority will be considered when making monitor assignments.  
SRP input will be considered when it is necessary to designate a pick-up or drop-off point for the monitor  
other than his/her regular worksite.  
Coverage for an absent monitor shall be provided by the Transportation Department whenever feasible.  
Should the Transportation Department be unable to provide coverage then the school will share in the  
responsibility for finding a replacement.  
The Board and Union further agree to monitor the implementation of this program throughout the 2005-2006 school  
year, and to meet and discuss any problems or issues that may arise.

No Child Left Behind Act Impact on SRP Layoff and Recall  
The Board and Union recognize that provisions of the Board’s Staffing Quality Classrooms plan, which was  
developed to reach compliance with certain requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, will have an impact on  
the administration of SRP layoff and recall procedures.  
Therefore, for the purpose of layoff and recall, the Board and Union agree that paraprofessionals and instructional  
assistants in a specific area of assignment will be considered as one group. {Example: Paraprofessional (ESE) and  
Instructional Assistant (ESE) will be considered as one area of assignment. }  
It is also understood that paraprofessionals hired after January 8, 2002, are not eligible for recall to a position in a  
Title I school. No paraprofessional, regardless of his/her date of hire, is eligible for recall to a Title I school  
beginning with the 2006/2007 school year.  
The Board and Union will evaluate the effect these conditions have on the layoff and recall process.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Noninstructional Sick Leave Withdrawal  
The Board and the Union agree to increase the number of days a Noninstructional Sick Leave Bank member may  
withdraw from the Bank for an illness or injury that is less than catastrophic from twenty (20) days to thirty (30)  
days. In any event no more than a maximum of thirty (30) days may be granted to anyone with a less than  
catastrophic illness or injury. This memorandum supersedes the language in Article VIII, Section B-6(b)(1).  
The effect this change may have on the Bank will be assessed at the end of the 2004-2005 school year. Should this  
change cause a significantly negative effect on the Bank, withdrawal limits will return to the levels specified in  
Article VIII, Section B-6(b)(1) of the SRP Master contract.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Refingerprinting, Retention of Fingerprints, and Five (5) Year National Check  
Florida Statutes require retention of fingerprints for SRP in a Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)  
automated fingerprint identification system and a national check of the fingerprints every five (5) years. All SRP  
fingerprints submitted on or after July 1, 2004 have been entered into this system. SRP fingerprints submitted prior  
to July 1, 2004 cannot be entered into the system. Therefore, all current SRPs fingerprinted prior to July 1, 2004  
must be refingerprinted. The refingerprinting must be completed prior to July 1, 2009. The statute states that the cost  
of the refingerprinting may be borne by the employee or employer.  
The refingerprinting fee is currently $61.00 per SRP. The fee includes a $24.00 fee for a national records check and  
a $6.00 fee for the first year of retention of the fingerprints by the FDLE. Thereafter, the retention fee must be paid  
each year and the fee for the national records check paid every five (5) years.  
In order to comply with the law and provide a benefit to SRP, the Board and the Union agree to the following:  
1. Beginning in the 2005-2006 school year, the Board will begin a four (4) year process of refingerprinting  
affected SRP with the intent of refingerprinting approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the group in  
each of the four (4) years.  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 51  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
2. The Board will perform the refingerprinting at each school/worksite. Advance notice of the date(s) the  
refingerprinting will occur at each school/worksite will be provided and SRP will sign up for a time to be  
refingerprinted.  
3. SRP who are not available to be refingerprinted when the refingerprinting is performed at their  
school/worksite must make arrangements to be refingerprinted at another school/worksite or the district  
office during that school year. SRP who fail to be refingerprinted during the year in which they are  
designated to do so will pay the refingerprinting fee when they are refingerprinted.  
4. No release time will be given for refingerprinting for those employees who failed to be fingerprinted at their  
scheduled location.  
5. The Board will pay the refingerprinting fee.  
6. The Board will pay the retention fee.  
7. The Board will pay the fee for the five (5) year national check.  
The estimated cost for 2005-2006 is $40,825. The fee structure as described is subject to change.

schedule plus any applicable supplements for the first thirty (30) days of such service.  
Thereafter, any such reservists shall have his/her total gross military pay supplemented up to the amount he/she was  
earning on the salary schedule plus any applicable supplements at the time the reservist was called to active duty.  
For the purpose of administering this provision, after the first thirty (30) days of such service, the reservist shall be  
required to provide documentation of total gross military pay by providing copies of the "monthly leave and  
earnings statement" or comparable certified information to the Board and shall provide a copy of his/her orders or  
comparable statement giving estimated length of full time active service. The reservist shall provide updated  
documentation should he/she experience a change of total gross military pay.  
During the leave of absence pursuant to this provision, reservists shall retain all seniority rights, continue to accrue  
seniority and sick and/or vacation leave, and shall be entitled to maintain dependent insurance coverage by making  
the employee's contribution toward the cost of such coverage.  
Upon returning from leave, the reservist shall receive credit on the salary schedule for the period of absence  
pursuant to this provision and shall be returned to the position held at the time he/she was called to active duty.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
School Choice Preference Employee Request  
An SRP assigned to a school site shall have preference given to his/her request to have his/her child(ren) (i.e., any  
child in his/her custodial care) attend school at his/her assigned worksite unless the following prevents granting the  
request:  
1. the appropriate educational program does not exist at that site, or  
2. other extenuating circumstances (i.e., expulsion, serious disciplinary infractions, etc.) exist that may be cause  
for the child(ren)’s nonattendance.  
The SRP may appeal any denied request to the Director of Student Services. The decision of the Director shall be  
final.  
In the event an SRP requests placement of his/her child in a school other than the actual school in which he/she  
works in order to continue the child’s attendance in the feeder pattern of that school, subject to the approval of the  
Director of Student Services and the Superintendent, the request will be granted. The decision of the Director of  
Student Services and the Superintendent will be final.

### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
SRP Attendance Incentive/Sick Leave Buy-Back  
The Board and Union recognize the positive impact that regular employee attendance has on job performance,  
student achievement, and the smooth operation of the school system. An actuarial study will be conducted to  
determine the impact of implementing a Sick Leave Buy Back Program for the district. Every attempt will be made  
to have this study completed by the end of 2005 calendar year so results can be reviewed by the Board and the SRP  
chief negotiators for use in the 2006/2007 contract negotiations.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
SRP Retiree Health Opt-Out Program  
Effective January 1, 2004, the Board shall implement a Retiree Health Opt-Out Program.  
The Retiree Health Opt-Out Program is available only to those retirees who are eligible for district-paid group health  
insurance in accordance with Article XI, Section F-1 and 2 of SRP Master Contract and who are enrolled in a  
comparable major medical health insurance plan through another carrier.  
When a retiree enrolls in the Retiree Health Opt-Out Program, the Board will pay the retiree the current value  
available to active employees, $1,008 for the 2005 plan year. Such amount is subject to federal income tax. An  
annual payment for the number of months the retiree participates in the Retiree Health Opt-Out Program will be  
issued in a lump sum in December of the plan year or upon termination of eligibility, whichever occurs first. A  
participant in the Retiree Health Opt-Out Program will not be required to contribute to the board his/her FRS Health  
Insurance Subsidy.  
A participant in the Retiree Health Opt-Out Program may reenroll in the district-paid group health insurance plan  
only if he/she is no longer covered by another major medical health insurance plan. Within thirty (30) calendar days  
following the date of cancellation/termination of the other major medical health insurance plan, the retiree wishing  
to reenroll in district-paid group health insurance plan must submit to the district’s department of Employee  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 54  
Memorandum of Understanding  
Benefits, Assistance, and Risk Management (EBARM) a written request to reenroll, completed application forms,  
and a letter from the previous major medical carrier or employer stating date of cancellation/termination of  
coverage. The letter must be on letterhead from the major medical carrier or employer, include the  
cancellation/termination date of coverage, and signature of the benefit administrator of the major medical carrier or  
employer. The effective date of coverage of the district-paid group health insurance coverage will be the first day of  
the month following the submission of the written request, application, and related documents. The district does not  
guarantee continuous health coverage.  
A retiree who fails to reenroll in the district-paid group health insurance plan in accordance with the timelines set  
forth in the above paragraph will remain in the Retiree Health Opt-Out Program until Medicare eligible or January 1  
following the next regularly scheduled district open enrollment period, whichever comes first.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Substitute Task Force  
The Board and the Union recognize the challenge of hiring and retaining qualified substitutes for SRP. The current  
district Substitute Task Force shall continue to function for this school year to further explore ways to recruit and  
retain qualified substitutes. The Board and the Union agree that the President of USEP shall continue to be a  
member of this task force.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Transfers — No Child Left Behind  
Paraprofessionals Assigned to Title I Schools  
Upon receipt of formal approval of the extension of the deadline for paraprofessionals to be highly qualified through  
NCLB, until the end of the 2005-2006 school year, the Board and Union have agreed to the following. The five  
paraprofessionals who are still on a recall list due to NCLB as of July 1, 2005 will be allowed to return to their  
previous position if it is still available or to be recalled to a Title I school for the 2005-2006 school year. The three  
paraprofessionals assigned to a Title I school planning on retiring December 22, 2005 due to the previous NCLB  
deadline (January 6, 2006) are permitted to amend their retirement to coincide with the end of the 2005-2006 school  
year.  
The Board and Union are committed to transferring these paraprofessionals in Title I schools at the end of the 2005-  
2006 school year into positions for which they are qualified by the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year, if  
positions are available. If no positions are available at the end of the 2005-2006 school year they will be laid off and  
placed on a recall list. They will then only be eligible for recall to a position in a non-Title I school.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Transportation Issues  
The Board and the Union agree to explore alternative programs and/or procedures for possible implementation this  
school year for any Transportation Department program and/or procedure now being used including the basic  
procedure for assigning field trips.  
### MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
Transportation “S-Endorsement”  
The Board and Union recognize the important role that transportation employees play in the operation of the school  
system. As a result of the recent Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act (FMCSIA) and the S-Endorsement,  
the Board and the Union agree to the following for all current employees in order to retain employees who have  
been affected by the FMCSIA:  
Testing  
The Board shall provide opportunities for employees to take the written examination at Marchman Technical  
Education Center (March 15, 2005), Central Garage (March 16, 2005), and Zephyrhills Compound (March 17,  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 55  
Memorandum of Understanding  
2005). For an employee who is not proficient in reading, or who speaks English as second language it is  
recommended that he/she wait for accommodations that may be provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles after  
July 1, 2005. If an employee does not pass the exam on his/her first attempt, the Board shall pay five (5) dollars for a  
second exam. The Board shall additionally provide a study area to employees who would like an opportunity to  
review material or ask questions prior to and/or between exams.  
Training  
Prior to any examinations, the Board shall provide all affected employees with the available curriculum for which  
they will be tested, as well as any other available information pertaining to testing procedures and scoring. In  
addition, the Board shall also provide at least three (3) hours of group training, prior to testing, for those employees  
electing to attend. The employee’s regular hourly rate shall be paid to all employees who attend. These trainings  
shall be conducted at locations within close proximity to each of the transportation compounds.  
Following the initial written testing, the conclusion of the 2005 legislative session, and the identification of the  
employees in need of the skills portion of the test, the Board and the Union agree to meet and review this  
memorandum and the district’s situation surrounding the S-Endorsement and make any changes that may be needed.

### TO ALL PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE BARGAINING UNITS  
### REPRESENTED BY THE UNITED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES OF PASCO (USEP):  
As required by law, USEP represents all members of the Instructional and School Related Personnel (SRP) units at  
the bargaining table. Only dues-paying members of the USEP, however, are eligible for all other services provided  
by the Union, including processing of grievances and legal counsel in the event of duty-related difficulties. Should a  
member obtain outside representation and/or legal counsel, USEP will cease to provide representation. In addition,  
the costs of such outside representation and/or counsel will be borne solely by the member.  
To be represented free of charge, the individual seeking assistance must have been a dues-paying member in good  
standing for a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date upon which the problem occurred.  
However, bargaining unit members who are new to the Pasco County school system and who have not previously  
been eligible for USEP membership will be entitled to receive the immediate benefit of the services described above  
if they join USEP during the first fifteen (15) working days of their employment. Any incident occurring after this  
fifteen (15) working day period will be subject to the thirty (30) calendar day restriction mentioned above.  
On occasion, USEP may elect to represent non-dues paying individuals. Such individuals may be required to pay  
annual membership dues and a professional service fee that will be based upon the complexity of the case.
