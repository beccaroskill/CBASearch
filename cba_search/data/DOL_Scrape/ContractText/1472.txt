### WITNESSETH:  
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to  
improve the relations between the Employer, his employees and  
the Union, and to establish an understanding relative to gross  
wages, hours of work, and all other conditions of employment so  
that the Employer, his employees and the Union may all profit  
from the fair and stable conditions in the industry which will result  
therefrom,  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises  
hereinafter set forth, the Employer and the Union hereby agree as  
follows:  
### ARTICLE |

sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for a majority of all  
persons eraployed as Carpenters in the geographical area coming  
within the jurisdiction of the Union; and  
The Union recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive  
collective bargaining agent for its members, the majority of  
contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and  
heavy con-struction work, for the purpose of collective bargaining  
in ihe geographical area coming within the jurisdiction of the  
nion.  
2. It is specifically agreed and understood that this Agreement  
exclusively govems the wages, terms, and conditions of employ-  
ment of al! Carpenters performing work of any description coming  
under the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and  
Joiners of America, employed by an Employer represented through  
the Association, the majority of contractors engaged in commer-  
cial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work, regard-  
tess of whether such Employer is acting in the capacity of a prime  
or subcontractor.  
3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they are  
subject to state and federal law and municipal ordinances regarding  
equal employment opportunity and fair employment practices and  
therefore will jointly take the necessary steps to comply with these  
laws and ordinances within the scope of this Agreement, and that  
the employment, referral or selection of all employees shall be on  
the basis of qualifications without regard to race, color, sex,  
religion, national origin or ancestry.  
4, The Union agrees to furnish competent workers, if available,  
upon notification to the office of the Union or authorized person  
ot persons. The Employer and Union agree that in the interest of

(a) in the event the National Labor Relations Act is amended,  
while this Agreement is in force so that an employee may  
lawfully be required to become a member of the Union as a

operative under this Agreement notwithstanding the provisions  
of Paragraph 5 above.  
(b) The Employer shali not be obligated hereunder to discharge  
or discriminate against any employee for nonmembership in  
the Union:  
(1} If he has reasonable grounds for believing that such  
membership was not available to the employee on the  
same terms and conditions generally applicable to other  
members, or  
(2) If he has reasonable grounds for believing that member  
2

failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the  
initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquir-  
ing or retaining membership.  
(3) The Employer shall be furnished with a notice in writing  
by the Union, signed by the proper officer, setting forth  
that the employee has refused to join the Union, although  
he has been offered membership on the same terms as  
other members or that the employee's membership in the  
Union has been terminated for reason of nonpayment of

### MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT  
### CARPENTER BACK-TO-WORK PROGRAM  
A carpenter injured while working for an Employer may return to  
work for that Employer at a reduced scale of wages to perform a  
limited work scope, "Bridge Job," as approved in writing by the  
administrating physician. A Bridge Job is construction-related work  
which may or may not be within the work jurisdiction of the  
Union. The scale of wages will be determined by the administrat-  
ing physician's classification of the tasks to be performed com-  
mensurate with the capability of the carpenter. The work classifica-  
tions are:  
Very Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occa-  
sionally lifting and/or carrying such articles as dockets, ledgers  
and small tools. Although a very light job is defined as one  
which involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be  
necessary in carrying out job duties. The amount of walking  
and/or standing permissible will be determined by the extent  
to which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk  
and/or stand.  
Light Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent  
lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds.  
Even though the weight lifted may be only a negligible  
amount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or  
standing to a significant degree or when it involves sitting with  
a moderate degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg  
controls.  
Medium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent  
lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to twenty-five  
pounds.  
The Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Joumey-  
man Base Wage. The Base Wage for Light Work will be 50% of  
the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Medium Work  
will be 75% of the Joumeyman Base Wage. For all work classifi-  
cations, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe  
benefits received by a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the  
applicable Base Wage. Compensation would increase as the  
carpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the  
physician's approval of the next level of physical demand.  
The Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an  
additional weekly amount to the employee as an added incentive  
to encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-to-Work  
Program. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the  
formula as provided for by the workers’ compensation guidelines.  
Refusal of a reasonable offer of employment may jeopardize the  
continued collection of benefits in accordance with State law.  
37  
A carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is  
limited to a maximum of six months for each incident. Implemen-  
tation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of the Employer,  
and is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for  
work by the administrating physician, the carpenter would return  
to full wages and be placed in available work.

hearing and render his award within five days after his selection

{A} In the event that the Association's obligation is only to pay

6 then the question to be decided by the arbitrator, in addition to  
whether the program of some phase of it was injurious to the  
Union, shall be as follows:

continue or modify the program? If the answer is that it was  
nat within the Association's control, then the Association  
shall not be obligated to reimburse the funds of the Industry  
Advancement Fund for the manies spent during the period  
between the date of the complaint and the date of the  
arbitrator's award.  
(b) If the award is that it was within the contro! of the As-  
socialion, then the arbitrator shall be asked to decide an  
_ additional question, viz.. would the discontinuance or  
alteration of the program have caused more harm to the  
Association than it would have caused fo the Union. [f the  
answer is in the affirmative, then, again, the Association  
shall be absolved of any liability to reimburse the funds of  
the Industry Advancement Fund for payments made between  
the date of the Union's complaint and the date of the award.  
If the answer is in the negative, Association shall reimburse  
the Industry Advancement Fund such expenditures as were  
made and incurred between the date of the Union's com-  
plaint and the date of the award.  
(B) Where the financing of the activities of the program is by  
points after its inception, or is provided for by a contract  
would impose upon the Association an irreducible obligatio  
a fixed amount irrespective of continuance or discontinuance of  
ihe program, then if the Union complains that any of the  
activities af the program are injurious fo the Union and the  
Association does not discontinue or modify such activities to  
meet the Union's complaint, and if the arbitrator awards that any  
of the activities of the program are injurious to the Union, then  
the shall be obligated to reimburse the Industry  
Advancement Fund for a portion of such prepayment or fixed  
amount as the quantity of service or time utilized in said  
program's activities after Union's complaint and until compliance  
wiih the arbitrator's award beass to the whale quantity of the  
service to be rendered ov t& the whole of the time to be utilized  
for the activities so prepaid or contracted fui.  
prepayment either ai the inception of the program ar at  
in any event, if the arbitrator's award is that any of the activities  
of the program were injurious, then, from the date of the award  
the Industry Advancement Fund monies may not be used to  
continue such activities of the program unless altered to abviate  
injury to the Union, although the program may be continued in  
its original form by the Association out of its own funds.  
C. None of the provisions in Section B of this Supplement  
operate to prohibit any communication from the Association  
members at any time, nor to prohibit the expression by such of 8  
Association's representatives as are paid with the monies of the In-
