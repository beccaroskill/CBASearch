have x responsibility for the performance of work other than providing the service of owner-operators, or from  
any other source other than subcontractors as defined in Section 6, shall be included in this section if otherwise  
covered by the language in this section.  
Legal or equitable title to the power equipment and all licenses and permits required by any governmental  
agency must be in the name of the actual owner-driver.

owner-operator perfurmis his services, as well as the ends to be accomplished, and shall be the sole judge of the  
capability of ihe owner-operator’s equipment to perform the work required to be performed and may if the  
Employer detertaines that the owner-operator’s equipment is not capable of performing the work required to be  
performed, terminate such owner-operator’s services; provided, however, that the owner-operator may file and  
process a grievance under Section 10(A) hereof on the grounds that the determination that the  
owner-operator’s equipment is inadequate was a pretext for terminating the owner-operator’s services. Fail-  
ure to work the day or one-half (4) day out, as directed, shall terminate the owner-operator’s employment and  
he shall be paid only for actual time worked prior to such failure. The Employer shall not pay for time spent by  
the owner-operator in repairing, servicing or maintaining his equipment after. termination of employment, or  
before or after his shift or half-shift, as the case may be.

provisions of Subsection O below, and as such, all the terms and conditions of this Master Agreement and  
any amendment or amendments thereto shal! be applicable to him except as provided elsewhere in this

name, Social Security Number and P.U.C. Permit Number of the owner-operator within twenty-four (24)  
hours after the owner-operator reports for work. Should the Employer fail to provide such notification,  
the Local Union may take economic action twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by the Employer of  
written notice from the Local Union of such intention.  
(3) | Any Employer who fails to place an owner-operator on the payro!} as required by Paragraph D (1) above  
maybe penalized through the grievance procedure in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100)  
per day for each such violation, such penalty to be paid into the Teamsters Benefit Trust Health and  
Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California. The Union shall have access to the Employer's payroll and  
ovher pertinent records for the drivers involved, upon reasonable request.

Separate checks shall he issued by the Employer for such wages and vacation payment and equipment.  
The amount of the separate check for such driver’s wages shall not reduce the amount actually received for  
cquipment compensation as distinguished from wages, to a level below that provided for in Subsection (J) of  
this section.

Employees any profit whatsoever for the leasing and rental of the equipment they drive. On the contrary,  
compensation for the equipment shall be set by Agreement between the Employer and the owner-opelator ata  
level which will not circumvent or defeat the payment of wages, fringes and conditions of any Empieyes covered  
by this Master Agreement and which will assure compensation to the owner-operator of not less than the actual  
cost of operation of such equipment.  
There shall be ne reductions by reason of the signing of this Agreement where the present basis of payment is  
more favorable to the owner-operator than the basis provided for herein.  
It is further understood and agreed that any arrangements which have heretofore been entered inte between  
employees (owner-operator) either among themselves or with an Employer applicable to owner-operator equip-  
ment contrary to the terms hereof shall be dissolved or modified within thirty days after this section becomes

same conform to this section, the question of dissolution or modification shall be submitted to the grievance  
procedure under Section 10(A) hereof.  
M. It is further mutually understood and agreed that the intent of this section is to assure the payment of wages,

equipment on the job during the period of the repair of the owner-operator’s equipment and not to exceed forty-  
eight (48) hours and so long as no Employee is laid off to provide work for such equipment. And the employment  
office in the locality where the work is to be performed, is unable to provide qualified workers.  
Q Owner-Operators shall be placed on the payroll of the Individual Employer and shall receive full fringe benefits  
from the first hour, provided, however, that any owner-operator who is a member in good standing of the Union  
(as defined in Section 1.4.(3)), or who has tendered full initiation fees and dues, and who is utilized by an  
Individual Employer or an employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, may elect  
not to be placed on the payroll of the Individual Employer, and the Individual Employer shall notify the Union of  
the option selected. Violation(s) of this subsection shall subject the employer to one (1) days pay plus fringes for

their equipment who have been on the seniority list of that permanent yard for at least thirty (30) days, from that locality  
to another locality without restriction. Such transfers shall be first offered to the most senior Employees in the  
permanent yard; but, after refusing such transfer, such senior Employees not have the right to bump less senior  
Employees on the job in the other locality.

### I. INTRODUCTION  
The Union and the Employer establish this Policy in order to provide the Individual Employers with a comprehensive  
substance abuse program, to provide Employees who abuse and/or are addicted to drugs, including alcohol, a means to  
receive treatment for their abuse and/or addiction, and to provide for a safe workplace.  
All Employees covered under the Policy will be subject to testing provisions mandated by the U.S. Department of  
Transportation (“DOT”) Code of Federal Regulations CFR 382 and 49, as well as other Regulations mandated by DOT  
for drivers and other workers in “safety sensitive” positions.  
### H. NOTICE  
A. An Individual Employer must give written notice to the Union that itis implementing this Policy.  
B. Failure to give a form of notice as set forth in this section shall make any drug testing engaged in by the  
Individual Employer a violation of the Master Agreement, and no results of any such test shall be relied upon to  
deny employment or pay or to discipline any Emptoyee.  
### III. PURPOSE OF POLICY  
A. The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union are committed to providing a safe and productive work  
environment for Employees. The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union recognize the valuable re-  
source we have in our Employees and recognize that the state of an health affects attitude, effort,  
and job performance. The parties recognize that substance abuse is a behavioral, medical and social problem  
that causes decreased efficiency and increased risk of accidents and of injury. The Employer, Individual  
Employer(s) and the Union therefore adopt this Policy. The intent of the Policy is threefold:  
1. Tomaintain a safe, drug and aleohol free workplace,  
9. To maintain our work force at its maximum effectiveness; and  
3.  Toprovide confidential referral to the Teamster Alcohol Rehabilitation Program/Teamster Assistance  
Program (“TARP-TAP”) and to provide confidential treatment to those Employees who recognize they  
have a substance abuse problem and voluntarily seek treatment for it. NOTE: Any reference to TARP  
should also be considered TAP.  
B. In order to achieve these purposes, it is our primary goal to identify those Employees and refer them to  
professional counseling, and treatment before job performance has become a disciplinary problem. Employees  
are urged to use the services available through TARP. TARP will assist them and refer them to the appropriate  
    
     
    
treatment program. Ages

Notification to Employer of Test Results The laboratory shall report negative test results to the Individual Employer. The  
laboratory will report positive test results to the MRO. The MRO will verify whether the test was positive or negative and  
will report the final results to the Individual Employer.  
### VII. TYPES OF PERMISSIVE TESTING  
### A. TIME OF DISPATCH TESTING  
An Individual Employer may require an Employee to be tested for the presence in the body of one of the drugs  
or by-products thereof set forth above at the time the Employee is dispatched (on one of the first three (3) days of  
employment). It must test all Employees at the time they are dispatched if it tests any Employee. The Individual  
Employer shail put the Employee to work or pay the Employee pending the test results unless the Employee has been  
dispatched to a DOT regulated assignment and the Individual Employer does not have any work for the Employee to  
perform which is not subject to the DOT regulations or if it has probable cause to believe the Employee is impaired,  
intoxicated, or under the influence of a drug. The standards for probable cause are set forth below in Section B. If the  
Individual Employer does not allow an Employee to work pending the test results because it believes it has probable  
cause, it shall make the Employee whole for ail lost wages and benefits if the Employee tests negative. Einployees who  
test positive will be referred to TARP. The Individual Employer shall not be obligated to employ any such Employee after  
TARP releases the Employee to return to work but may employ such Employee under the terms of a return-to-work  
agreement. An Employee who refuses to submit to a drug/alcohol test when dispatched shall not be paid show-up time.  
An Individual! Employer may test Employees who are recalled from layoff as provided for in the Job Placement  
Regulations who have not worked for thirty (30) days. If the Individual Employer tests any Employee who is recailed, it  
must test all such Employees. An Individual Employer may test all Employees at the time they are dispatched under this  
Section except for those who are recalled.  
### B. PROBABLE CAUSE TESTING  
An Individual Employer may require an Employee to submit to a drug test as provided for in this Policy if it has probable  
cause that the Employee is impaired, intoxicated, and/or under the influence of a drug. Probable cause must be based  
on a trained management representative's (preferably not in the bargaining unit) objective observations and must be  
based upon abnormal coordination, appearance, behavior, absenteeism, speech or odor. The indicators shall be recog-  
nized and accepted symptoms of intoxication or impairment caused by drugs or alcohol and shall be indicators not  
reasonably explained as resulting from causes other than the use of such controlled substance and/or aleohol (such as,  
but not by way of limitation, fatigue, lack of sleep, side effects of proper use of prescription drugs, reaction to noxious  
fumes or smoke, etc. ). Probable cause may not be established, and thus not a basis for testing, if it is based solely on  
the observations and reports of third parties. The trained management representative's observations and conclusions  
must be confirmed by another trained management representative. The grounds for probable cause must be docu-  
mented by the use of an Incident Report Form (see Form “B” attached). The Management Representative shall give the  
Employee a completed copy of this Incident Report Form and shall give the Union Representative, if present, a copy of  
the incident Form before the Employee is required to be tested. After being given e copy of the Incident Report form, the  
shall be allowed enough time to read the entire document and tc understand the reasons for the test.  
The Management Representative also shall provide the Employee with an opportunity to givean explanation of his/her  
condition, such as reaction to a prescribed drug, fatigue, lack of sleep, exposure to noxious fumes, reaction to over-the-  
counter medication or illness. If available, the Union Representative shall be present during such explanation and shall  
be entitled to confer with the Employee before the explanation is required. If the Management Representative(s), after  
observing the Employee, and hearing any explanation, conctudes that there is in fact probable cause to believe that the  
Employee is uader the influence of or itnpaired by, drugs or alcohol, the Employee may be ordered to submit to a drug  
test.  
  
The Individual Employer shall advise the Employee of his/her right to consult with a Union representative (including a  
Steward) and allow the Employee to consult with a Union representative before the Employee submits to the test, if the  
Union representative is available.  
Employees required to submit to a test under Section B will be paid for all time related to the test including the time the  
Employee is transported to and from the collection site, all time spent at the collection site, and all time involved  
completing the consent and release form if the test results are negative.  
### C. ACCIDENT TESTING  
An Individual Employer shall require Employees who are directly, or indirectly, involved in work related accidents  
involving property damage or bodily injury that requires medical care or work related accidents which would likely  
result in property damage or bodily injury be subject to a test as provided herein. The innocent victims of an accident  
will not be subject to a test unless probable cause exists. The Individual Employer shall complete an Incident Report  
Form (see Form B attached) whenever it tests an Employee under this Section.  
### D. RANDOM TESTING  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy, the Individual Employer may require its Employees who are covered  
by the DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations to submit to testing as required by those regulations. Such testing will  
be conducted in strict accordance with the Regulations. The Individual Employer may discipline an Employee who tests  
positive as defined by the Regulaticns subject to Section XI, REHABILITATION/ DISCIPLINE, of the Policy. TARP shall  
be the Substance Abuse Professional for al] Employees. TARP, to the maximum extent possible, shall provide the  
mandated training to all Employees. Empioyees who are subject to DOT regutations who have a positive “pre-employ-  
ment” test (as defined by the DOT regulations) will be paid show-up time only if the Individual Employer does not have  
any work for the Employee to perform which is not subject to the DOT regulations pending the test result. Employees  
who are tested under the DOT Regulations who are not allowed by those Regulations to continue to perform safety  
sensitive functions, as defined by the Regulations, shall be paid for hours worked.  
Random testing will be administered in strict accordance with DOT regulations and will apply to all bargaining unit  
employees on a non-discriminatory basis.  
### E. PRE-DISPATCH DRUG SCREEN  
The parties shall establish a joint committee to determine whether there is a feasible means by which the Union can  
conduct the drug/alcohol screen before dispatching an Employee so that only Employees with a negative test will be  
referred. . : 7  
### F. OWNER/AWARDING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS  
Whenever owner or awarding agency specifications require the Individual Employer to provide a drug-free workplace,  
the Union and the Employer or the Individual Employer shall incorporate such additional requirements herein. This  
Policy shall apply to all such testing.  
### G. DOT EXAMINATIONS AND OTHER PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Where an Employer elects to perform a urine drug screen in conjunction with a DOT or other physical examination, the  
Employee must be given at least seven (7) days’ advance written notice of such drug screen prior to the administration  
of the examination. The Employee is required to sign for the notice. Urine specimens must be analyzed pursuant to the

pursuant to DOT regulations. Physica! examinations may be performed once every two (2) years within sixty (60) days  
after an Employee’s anniversary date.  
### EMPLOYER REFERRALS  
A decline in an Employee's job performance is often the first sign of a personal problem which may include substance  
abuse or chemical dependency. Supervisory personnel will be trained to identify signs of substance abuse, chemical  
dependency, and declining job performance. The Individual Employer may formally refer an Employee to TARP based  
upon documented declining job performance or other observations prior to testing under Paragraph VII and/or disciplin-  
ing the Employee.  
### IX. EMPLOYEE VOLUNTARY SELF-HELP PROGRAM  
An Employee who has a chemical dependency and/or abuses drugs and/or alcohol is encouraged to participate in an  
Employee Voluntary Self-Help Program. Any such Employee shall be referred to TARP. Employees who seek voluntary  
assistance for alcohol and/or substance abuse may not be disciplined for seeking such assistance. Request by Emplovees  
for such assistance shall remain confidential and shall not be revealed to other Employees or management personnel  
without the consent. TARP shall not disclose information on drug/aleohol use received from an Employee for  
any purpose or under any circumstances, unless specifically authorized in writing by the Employee.  
The Individual Employer shal! offer an Employee affected by alcohol or drug dependence an unpaid medical Leave of  
Absence for the purpose of enrolling and participating in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and shall be required  
to re-employ any such individual after TARP Released the employee to return to work under the terms of a return- to-  
work agreement as provided in Section XI.  
An Employee who seeks voluntary assistance after being selected for a random test, prior to taking the random test,

Employer unless the Employee has the Individual Emp!oyer’s express permission to do so. An Employee shail not work  
while impaired, intoxicated or under. the influence of alcohol and/or any controlled substance. An Employee who uses  
medication prescribed bya physician will not violate these rules by using such medication as prescribed if the Employee's  
physician has released the Employee to work. An Employee who uses over-the-counter medication in accordacce with  
the manufacturer’s and/or shall not viclate the rules by using such medication. Impairment  
caused by prescribed medication and/or over-the-counter medication does not constitute a violation. The Individual  
Employer may prohibit an Employee who is impaired as a result of proper use of prescription or over-the-counter  
medication from working while the Employee is impaired but may not discipline such an Employee. An Employee who  
is impaired by misuse of prescription or over-the-counter medication violates the Policy and is subject to discipline as  
provided herein.

performance, the specific results of the test, and the history of past discipline.  
The Individual Employer is not required to refer to TARP any Employee who violates any provision of Paragraph X which  
prohibits the sale of, attempted sale of or manufacture of prohibited substances before it disciplines the Employee. Any  
disciplinary action that is disputed in regards to this Section shall be subject to Section 10(A) Grievance Procedure.

to work. The Individual Employer may re-employ the Employee when TARP releases him/her to return to work ifit has  
work available. It will not be required to lay-off any current Employee in order to re-employ the Employee. If it does not

develops and will allow the Individual Employer to require the Employee to submit to unannounced testing. The  
Individual Employer may disciptine the Employee for not complying with the return-to-work agreement. A positive test  
on an unannounced test will be considered a violation of the return-to-work agreement, and sudject the employee to
