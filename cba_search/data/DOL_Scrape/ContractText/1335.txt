Directors will direct an audit of the payroll account of any individual Employer named in the request within  
ten (10) days. If the initial audit on the payroll account does not provide enough information to determine  
whether or not any delinquency exists, then the Board of Directors will direct a further audit of whatever  
records or accounts exist in order to determine the amount of the delinquency.

of the Trust Funds specified in this Agreement are authorized to amend the liquidated damages and interest  
provisions of this Agreement. Any adjustments implemented by the Trustees shall be reflective of the true  
increases in the administrative and legal costs associated with the recovery of delinquent Trust Fund  
contributions.

respect to audit shortages are independent of and in addition to any and all provisions for liquidated
