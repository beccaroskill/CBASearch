or written contract with such individual employer on any work covered by this Agreement to he per-  
formed at the job site or job yard, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered  
as an individual employer covered by this Agreement.  
Han individual employer shall subcontract work herein defined, the work will be subcontracted to a  
subcontractor signatory to the appropriate Agreement with the Union. Such subcontract shall state  
that such subcontractor is or agrees to become signatory to an appropriate Agreement with the Union  
and will comply with all the terms and provisions of said Agrecment including the payments of wages,  
Trust Fund contributions and fringe benefit payments. A copy of the subcontract and signature shall be  
furnished to the Union upon request.  
The term “subcontractor” means any person, corporation or other entity, other than an employee covered  
by this Agreement, who agrees, orally or in writing, to perform for, or on behalf of the individual  
employer, any part or portion of the work covered by this Agreement. The subcontractor shall be  
properly licensed as required by the California State Contractors License Law.  
The individual employer will give written notice to the Union of any subcontract involving the perfor-  
mance of work covered by this Agreement within five (5) days of entering such subcontract and/or prior  
commencement of work by the subcontractor, unless such notice is prevented by emergency conditions,  
and shall specify the name and address of the subcontractor.  
(a) If thereafter the subcontractor becomes delinquent in the payment of any wages, Trust Fund  
contributions, or fringe benefit payments, the Union or the Trust Fund office shall give prompt  
notice of the delinquency, confirmed in writing, to the individual employer and to the subcontrac-  
tor. The notice shall specify the name and amounts, if known, of the delinquency.  
(b) Said notification by the Union or the Trust Fund office shall be provided within twenty (20) days  
of publication of the Delinquency List provided by the Trust Funds, or if in the case of failure to  
pay wages, five (5) days from the applicable pay day. If such notice is given, the individual  
employer shall pay and satisfy only the amount of any such delinquency by such subcontractor  
occurring Within ninety (90) days prior to the receipt of said notice from the Union, and said  
individual employer inay withhold the amount claimed to be delinquent out of the sums due and  
owing by the individual employer to such subcontractor.  
{c) Notwithstanding the provision set forth above, if the subcontractor is found in violation of the  
hiring provisions of this Agreement, pursuant to the provision of Section LX (Arbitration of  
Disputes), and the Union is unable to collect from the subcontractor the damages determined to  
be owing for such violation, the individual employer shall then be liable for the payment of such  
damages. The total of this liability, as it would apply to the individual employer, shall be for no  
more than five (5) days violation or the total of the subcontractor’s retention being held by the  
individual employer, whichever amount is greater.  
If the Individual Employer fails to give written notice as required in this Section I, he/she shall, until  
notice is received, assume liability for any violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at that  
particular jobsite or job yard, as may be determined by the Arbitration of Disputes. If the subcontractor  
is signatory or otherwise bound to an Agreement with the Union, the Individual Employer shall be liable  
only for delinquencies as set forth in subsection 5a of this Section I] for work on that jobsite or job yard.  
If the subcontractor is not in compliance with this Agreement, then the individual Employer shall be  
liable for any violation of this Agreement on that jobsite or joh yard.  
   
  
   
~}  
If the Union should make demand in writing for exercise of this Section, the Individual Employer will  
require that any subcontractor of the Individual Employer specified in the demand will, if the employer  
has not already done so, post a surety bond in an amount not to exceed $75,000.00 to cover payments of  
wages, Trust Fund contributions and fringe benefit payments specified in this Agreement. Failure of the  
Individual Employer to comply with this Section within two (2) days of demand will make the individual  
employer liable for the delinquencies of the subcontractor occurring on the individual employer's specific  
job. The amount of the bonds specified in this subsection in no way affects the amounts specified for  
bonding purposes elsewhere in this Agreement.  
8. The Individual Employer has the primary obligation for performance of all conditions of this Agreement. This  
obligation cannot be relieved, evaded or diminished by subcontracting. Should the Individual Employer elect to subeon-  
tract, the Individual Employer shall continue to have such primary obligation. Said primary obligation shall be deemed  
conclusive evidence of the Union's majority status for the purpose of establishing the obligation of the Individual  
Employer to bargain collectively pursuant to Section 8(a) (5) of the Nationa! Labor Relations Act as amended with the  
Union upon expiration of this Agreement but for no other statute, rule, regulations, or law.  
9.  
10.  
13.  
14.  
The provisions of this Section may be enforced only through the Arbitration of Disputes provisions of this  
Agreement.  
Itis the intent of the parties to enforce the provisions of this Section only to the extent permitted by law.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any Memorandum Agreement to the contrary,  
the provisions of this Section shall not be enforced by strike action or any other form of job shutdown or  
work interference; provided, however, that the rights provided in Section [X (Arbitration of Disputes) of  
this Agreement are retained to enforce primary obligations of any Individual Employer.  
Payment by cash or second multiple checks or combination thereof and the payment of excessive pre-  
miwm rates, excessive travel time, or bonuses shall be prima facia evidence of an attempt to violate the  
provisions of this Section. The foregoing shall not apply to an annual bonus paid to supervisors.  
Subcontracts shall not be in compliance with this Section if the effect of such subcontract is to diminish,  
eliminate or circumvent the payment of wages, fringe benefits or the hiring ball provisions established  
by this Agreement.  
Should an Employer party to this Agreement perform work or subcontract work covered by  
the Carpenters Master Agreement for Northern California, the Individual Employer shall observe the  
terms and conditions of that Agreement.

### SUBCONTRACTING  
Because of conditions sometimes imposed by owners or agencies, it is at times necessary for an Employer to subcontract  
with an entity that is not signatory to the Pile Drivers Collective Bargaining Agreement.  
In the event that an Employer must subcontract toa MBE or WBE or specialty contractor and a suitable signatory  
subcontractor is unavailable, the Union will give serious consideration, on a case by case basis, to waiving the require-  
ment for signatory status under those limited circumstances provided that the Employer shall not use such waiver to  
contend that it would apply in any other circumstance.  
This understanding is entered into by the parties signed hereto on 1994  
and shall remain in effect until the expiration of the Master Agreement.

For the purpose of simplifyin g the reimbursement of employees covered by this Agreement for travel expenses incurred,  
in accordance with the past practice in Northern California and in accordance with negotiations between the Contrac-  
tors and the Union consummated May 1, 1951, and May 1, 1952, effective June 16, 1974, it is agreed as follows:  
1.  
Reimbursement for transportation expense. as referred to in this Agreement, is defined as reimbursement for  
bridge tolls. all automobile expenses such as gasoline, oil, grease, tires, and any other miscellaneous traveling  
expenses and is not a reimbursement for wages, or for time spent traveling to or from the jobsite or place of  
employment.  
A,  
C.  
B.  
For the purpose of reimbursement of travel expense, four centers are designated within the area covered  
by this Agreement. These centers are Oakland, Stockton, Sacramento and Eurcka, the area surround-  
ing each of these four centers shall be divided into two (2) zones (except in the Bay Area as indicated in  
the attached chart), an inner or free zone referred to as the 20 mile zone, and an outer zone referred to  
as “beyond the 20 mile zone.”  
Men working under the scope of this Agreement employed on projects which are within the inner or  
“free” zone shall not be reimbursed for any transportation expenses to or from the work.

On the work on projects located in the outer zone, each man is to be paid $25.00 per work day (show-up  
days included) as reimbursement for transportation expenses.  
The boundaries of the respective zones in the San Francisco Bay Area are defined in the attached chart  
with the following explanation — where boundary lines are shown along or just outside the right of way  
of a road or highway the district should extend outward to include structures and projects on land on  
both sides of the road and within 500 feet of it (in terms of accessibility, both sides of the highway are  
equally accessible, which the location of the boundary line bas been most easily identifiable on the map  
by fixing it in or just beyond the highway).  
The attached chart creates and fully delineates a Northern and a Southern intermediate zone in the San  
Francisco Bay area. Men working within these intermediate zones shall be paid $8.00 per day as  
reimbursement for travel expense (Show-up days included).  
For further amplification the fotlowing interpretations of the chart are added, Within “Free” zone-San  
Leandro Dam and Reservoir,  
Crystal Springs and San Andreas Dams and San Mateo Bridge and its road approaches shall be  
contained in the Blue Zone. Within the Blue Zone Dunbarton Bridge and its road approaches Port Costa  
(and the area between the easterly boundary of Crockett and the westerly boundary of Martinez).  
Additionally the Blue Zone shall include the following geographic area:  
Travel North on Highway 680, turn East on Highway 84.

Travel North on Vasco Road, turn West on Highway 4 (Oakley).  
   
   
Travel West on Highway 4 to Highway 160, turn north on Highway 160 to the waters edge, turn West at  
the waters edge to North Highway 680.  
Also included is that area bordered by Highways 262. 680 and 101 in San Jose.  
Permanent Yard or Shop: An Individual Employer shall not pay travel and/or subsistence to employ-  
ees employed in its permanent yard or shop unless such employec is assigned to work ona job or project  
which is outside the permanent yard or shop and within a travel or subsistence zone. The actual zone  
rate shall be paid to employees working in an Individual Employers yard or shop when the employee is  
working on a project, which is new constriction or major alteration or demolition of an existing facility.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section t and 2 above, it is agreed that if an Individual Employer  
transfers members of its regular crew or requests the Union to send workers from the San Francisco  
Bay Area to work in the Stockton, Sacramento or Eureka area, or from the Eureka area to the Sacra-  
mente or Stockton area, the appropriate outer zone rate shall apply untess such workers live or usually  
work in such work area. In the latter event, reimbursement for transportation expenses shall be in  
accordance with Section | and 2.  
Nothing in this Section shall supersede or otherwise affect the provisions of Section 3 above.  
On a job or project located more than 100 miles from the Labor Temple of one of the four centers  
(Oakland, Sacramento, Stockton or Eureka) the following shall apply:  
Employees performing work covered by this Agreement whose residence is located more than 100 miles

### PURPOSE OF POLICY  
A. The Employer, Individual] Employer(s) and the Union are committed to providing a safe and productive  
work environment fur Employees. The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Univn recognize the  
valuable resource we have in our Employees and recognize that the state of an health affects  
attitude, effort, and job performance. The parties recognize that substance abuse ts a behavioral,  
medical and social probtem that causes decreased efficiency and increased risk of accidents and injury.  
The Employer, Individual Employer(s) and the Union therefore adopt this Policy. The intent of the Policy  
is threefold:  
1. To maintain a safe, drug and alcoho! free workplace;  
2. To maintain our workforce at its maximum effectiveness; and  
3. To encourage confidential referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) by Emptoyees  
Health and Welfare Program.  
   
   
B. Inorder to achieve these purposes, it is our primary goal to identify those Employees and refer them to  
professional counseling, and treatment before job performance has become a disciplinary problem.  
Employees are urged to use the services available through the union EAP Health and Welfare Plan  
1. Treatment for substance abuse and chemical dependency is provided under the Health and  
Welfare plan, up to the limits described in the plans.  
2. An Employee shall be granted necessary leave of absence for treatment.

Policy. All such records shall be kept in a locked file, which shall be labeled ‘Confidential’. Employee record, related to  
this Policy shall not be kept in the Employee’s personnel file.  
All information from an drug and alcohol test is confidential for purposes other than determining whether  
this Policy has been violated. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency or organization is prohibited unless  
written authorization is obtained from the Employee. The results of a positive drug test shall not be released until the  
results are confirmed. Every effort will he made to ensure that all employee issues relating to this policy will be  
discussed in private and actions taken will not be made known to anyone other than those directly involved in taking the  
action, or who are required to be involved in the disciplinary procedure.  
### Vv TESTING  
Testing for the presence of alcoho} or controlled substances and/or their by-products in one’s body may only be  
performed under the conditions set forth herein. All testing shall be done in accordance with the standards established  
hy the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), any successor agency, or any other  
agency of the federal government which has responsibility for establishing standards for drug testing. All such

standards are not complied with shall not be considered for any purpose under this Policy.  
Laboratories: All laboratories. which perform tests under this Policy, shal! be SAMHSA certified.  
Testing Procedures and Protocols: AH SAMHSA standards for testing standards and protocols shal! be followed. All  
specimens, which are determined to be positive by the SAMHSA approved screening test, shall be subject toa SAMHSA  
certified confirmatory test (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). This Agreement shall include the Varian Oral  
Screen or any of its equivalents, as approved by the G & M Committee.  
Second Test: The laboratory shall save a sufficient portion of each specimen in a manner approved by SAMHSA so that  
an Employee may have a second test performed. Immediately after the speeimen is collected, it will be labeled and then  
initialed by the Employee and a witness. If the sample must be collected at a site other than the drug and/or alcohol  
testing laboratory, the specimen shall then be placed ina transportation container. The container shall be sealed in the  
presence and the Employee shal! be asked to initial or sign the container. The container shall be sent to the  
designated testing laboratory on that day or the earliest business day by the fastest available method. Any Employee  
whose specimen is tested positive and who challenges a test result may have the second portion of the sample tested at  
his/her expense and at a laboratory agreed upon by the Employee and the MRO so long as that laboratory is SAMHSA  
certified. lf the second test is negative, the Employee will be considered to have been tested negative.

intoxicated, or under the influence of a drug. The standards for probable cause are set forth below in  
Section B. If the Individual Employer does not allow an Employee to work pending the test results  
because it believes it has probable cause, it shall make the Employee whole for all lost wages and benefits  
if the Employee tests negative. The Individual Employer shall not be obligated to employ any such  
Employee after EAP releases the Employee to return (o work but may employ such an Employce wader the  
terms of a return-to-work agreement. An Employce who refuses to submit to a drug/aleohol test when  
dispatched shall not be paid show-up time.  
An Individual Employer may test Employees who are recalled from layoff as provided for in the Joh  
Placement Regulations who have not worked for sixty (60) days. If the Individual Employer tests any

ees at the time they are dispatched under this Section without testing those who are recalled.  
### PROBABLE CAUSE TESTING  
An Individual Employer may require an employee to submit toa test as provide for in this Policy ifit has  
probable cause that the Employee is impaired, intoxicated and/or under the influence of a drug. Prob-  
able cause must be based on a trained management representative's (preferably not in the bargaining  
unit) objective observations and must be based upon abnormal coordination, appearance, behavior,  
speech or odor. The indicators shall be recognized and accepted symptoms of intoxication or impairment  
caused by drugs or alcohol and shall be indicators not reasonably explained as resulting from causes  
other than the use of such controlled substance and/or alcohol (such as, but not by way of limitation,  
fatigue, lack of sleep, side effects of proper use of prescription drugs, reaction to noxious fumes or  
smoke, etc.). Probable cause may not be established, and thus not a basis for testing, if itis hased solely  
on the observations and reports of third parties. The trained management representatives observations  
and must be confirmed by another trained management representative. The grounds for  
probable cause must be documented by the use of an Incident Report Form (see Form ‘B’ attached). The  
Management Representative shall give the Employee a completed copy of this Incident Report Form and  
shall give the Union Representative. if present. a copy of the Incident Form. The Employee shall be  
allowed enough time to read the entire document and to understand the reasons for the test.  
The Management Representative also shall provide the Employee with an opportunity to give an expla-  
nation of his/her condition, such as reaction to a prescribed drug, fatigue, lack of sleep, exposure to  
noxious fumes, reaction to over-the-counter medication or if available, the Union Representative  
shall be present during such explanation and shall be entitled to confer with the Employee before the  
explanation is required. If the Management Representative(s), after observing the Employee, and  
hearing any explanation, concludes that there is in fact probable cause to helieve that the Employee is  
under the influence of, or impaired by, drugs or alcohol, the Employee may be ordered to submit to a drug  
test.  
The Individual Employer shall advise the Employee of their right to consu!t with a union representative,  
including a Steward, and allow the Employee to consult with a Union representative before the Employee  
submits to the test, if the Union representative is available. Employees required to submit to a test under  
Section B will be paid for all time related to the test including the time the Employee is transported to and  
from the collection site, al! time spent at the collection site, and all time involved completing the consent  
and release form if the test results are negative.

Carpenters’ Bldg.

M.A. General President  
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America  
May 13, 1955  
Mr. 0.J. Lindell, R.S.,  
Local Union No. 34,  
457 Bryant Street  
San Francisco, California  
Dear Sirand Brother:  
lam herewith submitting the findings of the General Executive on the controversy between carpenters and pile drivers  
classifications in the West Coast area.  
The subcommittee convened Wednesday, July 15, 1954, and Thursday, July 16, 1954, in the Empire Room of the Sir  
Frances Drake Hotel, San Francisco, California. Testimony was received from forty-seven (47} witnesses representing  
Toca! Unions, District Councils and State Councils from the States of California, Oregon and Washington.  
As indicated in the matter supplied to the subcommittee, from the General Office, we found that the main | points of  
difference existing between the branches of our membership on the West Coast were:  
(1) Aninterpretation of what constitutes the “girder capping the piles.”  
(2) Whatclassification of our membership shall apply in the placing and erection of false work.  
Additional clarification of what work properly comes under the classification of Pile Driver would help in clanfying the  
issues involved between both branches of our Brotherhood on the west coast:  
(1) In the construction of waterfront and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bujk heads,  
jetties, and similar structures, the pile driver should continue to apply, up to and including  
the decking thereof.  
(2) Onall pile driving and caisson work on both land and water, Pile Driver classifications should apply.  
(83) Inthe construction of wooden bridges over land or over water, when composed of heavy timber,  
ihe Pile Driver classification should apply.  
(4) Inthe construction of conerctc or steel bridges over land, the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the  
driving of the piles and/or caisson work including the forms required for the capping of the piles or  
caisson. The “capping of the piles” is herein interpreted as being that concrete, wood or other material  
resting on top of the piles, where driving or placed and does not include any further form work ahove the  
capping. In many instances, it has heen found that the capping is called “the girder.” The above shall  
apply on such concrete or steel bridges constructed over land, highways, railroads, overpasses, and  
include cloverleais, interchanges, etc.  
   
   
In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply up to  
and including all of the form work to the top of the column, piers, or abutments supporting the steel and/  
or any other superstructure.  
In the erection of false-work, when necessary for the support of work under the Pile Driver classification,  
then such false work shall fail within their classification. False work neecssary for the support of work  
under the Carpenter classification, with the exception that where pile driving or power equipment is  
used for heavy timber false work, then such work shall come under the Pile Driver classification. This  
would include all rigging, signaling, and tagging incidental to the placing of the heavy timher.  
In the construction of open-cut sewers, the Pile Driver Classification shall apply on all piling ineluding  
wood, steel or concrete sheet piling, all bracing timer and form work incidental to the construction  
thereof.  
In concluding this report the General Executive Board believes that the defining of the words “girder  
capping the piles” herein outlined will tend to solve much of the misunderstanding that has existed  
between the two classifications of our membership on the West Coast. All of the above shall be effective  
only in the West Coast where the controversy occurred.  
Fraternally yours,

July 17, 1955  
Mr. M.A. Hutcheson, General President  
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Carpenters Building,  
222 East Michigan Street indianapolis, Indiana  
Dear Mr, Hutcheson:  
The Northern California Chapter and the Central California Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America,  
Inc. and the Pile Driving Contractors Association are parties to the Pile Driving Agreement with Local No. 34 of the Pile  
Drivers, Bridge, Wharf and Dock Builders Union covering the 46 Counties of Northern California. The A.G.C. Chapters  
are also parties to two Master Agreements covering Carpenters in the same geographic area. In order to perpetuate the  
fine relationships which have been built up over the years between our organizations, representing the contractors and  
the Pile Driver and Carpenter organizations in Northern California, it is strongly felt that there is a definite need for  
clarification of your letter of May 9, 1955, containing the findings of the Genera] Executive Board of the United  
Brotherhood concerning the controversy between the Carpenters and Pile Drivers’ classifications on the West Coast.  
Specifically, clarification is desired on the following five points covered in the above-mentioned letter:  
I. What did you intend to constitute a “bridge over water” within the meaning of paragraph five (5) of your letter  
dated May 9, 1955?  
(a) For example. near Petaluma, California, two parallel concrete highway structures were constructed  
under a single contract over U.S. Highway 101, the railroad tracks of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad  
and Petaluma Creek. The overall length of the structures were erected in three sections. The first  
section, which was approximately 360 feet long, was constructed over the highway and the railroad  
tracks and terminated at a coffer-dam and piers at the south bank of the creek. The second section,  
which was approximately 415 feet long, extended from a highway fill across agriculture land to a coffer-  
dam and piers ai the north bank of the creek. The third section, which was approximately 115 feet long,  
consisted of 16 pre-cast 75-ton concrete girders extending over Petaluma Creck which were put in place  
by a floating derrick.  
Would you have intended that the 115-foot section spanning the creek, which constitutes less than 1/8 of  
the entire structure, would make the entire structure a “bridge over water?”  
Or would the term “bridge over water” be limited to the section which actually spanned the creek?  
(b). For another example, near King City, California, a concrete structure is being constructed across the  
Salinas River. During the dry season, which will cover the entire construction period, the river bed is  
crossed by which carries heavy truck traffic.  
Would you intend this structure to be a “bridge over water?”  
   
(c) Did you intend the term “bridge over water” to include a structure being constructed over a dry bypass  
c ALIFORN iA which is designed to carry water only during flood conditions, which occur only once in several years?  
### ASSOCIATED oo  
GENERAL {d) Did youintend a structure over a ravine or other depression which carries water, if at all, only during the  
CONTRACTORS spring run off and outside of the construction period?  
### OF CALIFORNIA  
   
   
(e) Did you intend the term “bridge over water” to include a structure over a man-made canal or aqueduet?  
Under paragraph six (6) of your letter dated May 9, 1955, did you intend the falsework necessary for the  
support of the deck of a concrete or steel bridge over water to carry the Carpenter classification, except where  
pile driving or power cquipment is used for heavy timber falsework?  
Did you intend the term “pile driving or power equipment,” as used in paragraph six (6) of your Ictter, to mean  
pile driver, derrick or similar power equipment, which is the terminology that has been used in our Pile Driving  
Agreement for many years?  
Do forms constructed on the ground out of 2" x 4" and 2” x 6” lumber and 5/8” plywood constitute “heavy timber  
falsework,” within the meaning of paragraph six (6) of your letter. merely for the reason that, when assembicd,  
they must be put into place by power equipment?  
Does paragraph seven (7) of your letter refer only to work within the recognized jurisdiction of the Pile Drivers  
Union?  
The foregoing examples and questions are typical of the problems which arise in applying your letter of May 9. 1955, to  
construction projects in this area. Projects very similar to those given as examples under question | above are soon to  
be advertised for bids. As you are aware, it is important to the contractors that they clearly understand your letter, since  
if there is any misunderstanding, as to particular work, those contractors who interpret your letter as placing the work  
under the Pite Driver classification will lose out in bidding for such work, while the contractor who obtains the work  
upon the assumption that it comes under the Carpenter classification will suffer serious loss if he has to perform the  
work under the Pile Driver classification. You are the only one who can settle these problems, since on matters of this  
sort our Pile Driving Agreement provides that the parties will recognize formal rulings of the International President of  
the United Brotherhood.

### CLARIFICATION OF REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE OF GENERAL EXECUTIVE BOARD ON CARPENTER-PILE  
### DRIVER MATTER ON WEST COAST  
November 11, 1955  
Dear Sir and Brother:  
At your request the sub-committee, consisting of Board Members Rajoppi, Chandler, and Johnson, considered the  
requests of the Northern and Central Chapter of the Association General Contractors of America, Inc.. dated July 17,  
1955, for clarification of certain portions of the findings of the General Executive Board on the controversy between  
Carpenters and Pile Drivers in the West Coast area as contained in your communication dated May 13, 1955, and  
forwarded to all Loca! Unions, District and State Councils in the States of California, Oregon and Washington.  
The sub-committee has drawn up clarifications to the five questions contained in the contractors’ request. Some of these  
questions have various sub-divisions and the clarifications will follow cach question or subdivision.  
Question of the Association General Contractors refers to paragraph (5) of the findings of the General Executive  
Board of May 13, 1955.  
Clarification: On “bridge over the water” the columns or abutments in water and at the water's edge, or the  
first column or abutment on land adjacent to water's edge, shall come under the Pile Driver classification.  
Question 1(b) refers to rivers that are dry in season.  
Clarification: Still considered a “bridge over water” and covered by clarification of paragraph (5) in answer to  
question 1{a).  
Question I {c) refers to “bridge over water” being constructed over a dry by-pass designed to carry floor waters.  
Clarification: The answer is Yes. Similar to clarification of question 1{b) and is considered a “bridge over  
water.”  
Question 1 (d) refers to structures over ravines or depressions which carry water during spring runoff.  
Clarification: The answer is Yes. Same as answer to question I(b) and is considered as a “bridge over water”  
and as qualified in clarification of question 1(a).  
Question | (e) refers to “bridge over water” and also man-made canal or aqueduct.  
Clarification: Same answer as in 1(a), 1{b), f(c), and 1(d).  
All clarifications of paragraph 5 of findings of the General Executive Board of May 13, 1955, and referring to “concrete  
or steel bridges over water” is based upon piles being driven, caissons sunk or cofferdains erected by Pile Drivers under  
Pile Driver classification on such concrete or steel bridge foundations.  
Question 2 refers to Paragraph (6) of the findings of the General Executive Board.  
Clarification: The answer is Yes. Falsework necessary for the support of the decking of a concrete or steel  
bridge over water shall come under the Carpenters classification. Falsework for such decking is under the  
Carpenter classification excepting where pile driving or power equipment is used.  
   
   
Question 3 refers to pile driving or power equipment.  
Clarification: The sub-committee feels that the words “pile driving or power equipment” are in themselves  
completely explanatory and feels no further definition is required fur anyone acquainted with the construction  
industry.  
Question 4 refers to forms constructed on the ground out of 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 lumber and 5/8 plywood.  
Clarification: The sub-commiticc does not interpret “forms” to be “heavy timber falsework” within the meaning  
of paragraph (6). Ifany dimension forms are fabricated on the ground for work coming under the Carpenters  
classification, then such forms can he put in place by power equipment under the Carpenter classification.  
Forms coming under the Pile Driver classification as outlined in the findings of the General Executive Board  
shall be installed or placed under such Pile Driver classification. If heavy timber falsework, consisting of  
support for forms. installed under Carpenter classification and pile driving or power equipment is used, then  
such installation of “heavy timber falsework’” shall be done under the Pile Driver classification as plainly stated  
in paragraph (6) of the General Executive Board’s findings.  
Question 5 refers to paragraph (7) of the General Executive Board’s findings and refers to the construction of opencut  
sewers.  
Clarification: The sub-committee of the General Executive Board feels that paragraph (7) is so plainly worded  
without any limitations that anybody familiar with the construction industry can clearly understand this  
paragraph without any interpretations being required.  
The above clarifications requested by the Associated General Contractors organizations in the West Coast area are  
recommended to the General Executive Board by the sub-committee, who feels that many of these requests could be  
settled by discussions between the contractors and our membership affected in the West Coast area. It would be  
impossible to answer the myriad of questions that may be asked for interpretation of any finding, contract, or agree-  
ment and your sub-committee feels that the industry as a whole in the West Coast area should make a genuine effort to  
work out equitable solutions of further questions that may arise on the findings of the General Executive Board in this  
subject matter, as contained in the letter addressed to all Local Unions, District and State Councils in the States of  
California, Oregon and Washington and signed by you as General President under date of May 13, 1955.  
Respectfully submitted,

Re: Carpenter-Pile Driver matter in West Coast area  
December 12, 1967  
Dear Sir and Brother:  
In complying with vour request, the Sub-Committee of the General Executive Board, appointed by you to review the 1955  
General Executive Board Decision on West Coast Carpenter-Pile Driver matter, have met several times to consider the  
new problems that have arisen since the 1955 Board Decision.  
Your Sub-Committee held two days of hearings at the Del Webb Town House in San Francisco, California, on Mareh 21  
and March 22, 1967, at which sixty-three Officers and Business Representatives of our subordinate Locals and District  
and State Councils testified on the subject matter. In addition, twelve representatives of various Contractors Associa-  
tions met with your Sub-Committee and presented their points of view on several issues relative to new methods and  
techniques developed in the years since the original 1955 decision. The transcript of the hearings consisted of  
hundred pages and the General Office is in possession of a copy of same.  
The hearings brought out that the principal items of work where there were different opinions and interpretations  
amongst our membership, and also between the employers and our membership, mainly consisted of the following:  
(A) Dry Aqueduct or canal structures  
(B} Building Foundations  
(C) Tank Foundations  
(D} Base foundations for Machinery, Equipment and Stanchions  
(E} Theerection of falsework, including metal tubular or “tinker toy” materia] used in falsework.  
Your Committee, after careful review of the transcript of the March 21 and March 22, 1967, hearings, finds it necessary  
to further clarify intentions of the General Executive Board decision on May, 1955, and to modify where necessary  
consistent with the evidence presented to the Subcommittee at this March, 1967, hearing, in order to guide our West  
Coast membership in their jurisdictional differences on work issues and to assist our Employers in the correct and  
harmonious operations of their projects.  
The work jurisdiction of our Carpenters and Pile Driving branches of our Brotherhood on the West Coast shall be as  
follows:  
A. (1) In the construction of waterfront and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bulkheads, jetties  
and similar structures, the Pile Driver classification shall continue to apply, up to and including the decking  
thereof.  
(2) On all pile driving and caisson work, on both land and water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply.  
(3) In the construction of heavy timber, wooden bridges, whether over land or over water, the Pile Driver  
classification shall apply.  
   
  
(4) In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over land, highways, railroads, overpasses, cloverleafs,  
interchanges, or bridges over man-made canals, aqueducts, spillways and man-made water retaining areas,  
the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the driving of piles, caissons and “drilled-inplace” piling. The  
fabrication and erection of the forms for capping of piles, caissons or “drilled-in-place” piling shall come under  
the Pile Driver classification. This shall include the placing of wooden or stec] capping or any substitute thereof.  
Any other form work above the cap. pertaining to the construction operations herein noted above. shall be  
performed under the carpenters classifications. This shall afso include bridges over man-made canals, aque-  
ducts, spillways and man-made water retaining areas, if constructed prior to water being released or turned  
into the area.  
(5) In the construction of concrete or steel bridges over water, the fabrication and erection of the form work for  
the pier or piers in the water area, and the pier or abutment on land, nearest to the water's edge, shall be under  
the Pile Driver classification. This shall include the fabrication and erection of the form work to the top of the  
pier, column and abutment supporting the steel and/or any other super structure.  
The fabrication and erection of forms for the piers, columns or abutments for the approaches to the first pier  
or abutment on water's edge. shall be under the Carpenters classification. This shall apply also on a bridge  
over an area where the flow of water has been temporarily diverted.  
Building Poundations  
All form work required on building foundations shall be under the Carpenters classification, irrespective of the  
use of piles or caissons. °  
Capping of piles or form work on Tank Foundations  
The capping of piles and form work in connection therewith, where there is no other carpenter form work  
involved above the capping or floor base of tank, shall be under the Pile Driver classification. Where further  
carpenter work is required above the capping or tank base, then the Carpenter classification shall apply on  
entire operation, including the forms fer ptle capping and/or tank base.  
Base Foundations for Machinery, Equipinent and Stanchionus  
The fabrication and erection of all forms of machinery. bases, equipment or stanchions shall be under the  
Carpenters classification. °
