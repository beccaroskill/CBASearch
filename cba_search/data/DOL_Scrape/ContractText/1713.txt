versa, but must make the change at the beginning of the work week and maintain such shift for at  
least one week. At no time will a crew work a combination of eight (8) and ten (10) hour days

and such first shift groups of employees who are relieved by groups of employees on a second  
shift, and on a three shift operation those groups of employees who relieve the groups of  
employees on a second shift, shall be construed as working multiple shifts. The intent of this  
clause shall be construed so as to recognize that a "reliever group” and a "relief group" does not  
necessarily mean "man for man" relief.

The agreements went into effect June 1 and will run until May 31, 2003, according to association and union  
representatives.  
An AGC representative July 13 said the Laborers agreement provides $1.25 per hour in wage and benefit  
increases over three years (25 cents, 50 cents, and 50 cents), the Carpenters agreement provides $1.95  
(65 cents each year), and the separate agreements with the Cement Masons, Operating Engineers, and  
Teamsters each provide increases of $1.50 per hour over three years (50 cents each year).  
The initial 25 cent increases in the Laborers-AGC agreement went entirely to the health-weifare  
contribution to bring that rate to $4.76 from $4.51, according to a union source. Other hourly rates carried  
over at: $18.44 building wage and $19.50 heavy highway wage; $1.50 pension; 25 cents apprenticeship  
ee and 5 cents to the industry fund. Second- and third-year increases are reported as  
unallocated.  
The initial 50 cent per hour increases in both the Cement Masons and Operating Engineers agreements  
was allocated as 25 cents to wages and 25 cents to health-welfare. The initial 50 cents in the IBT  
agreements was allocated as 31 cents to wages and 19 cents to pension, according to AGC.  
Contractual Increases for Carpenters  
Although the association reported the Carpenters increase as $1.95 over term, a union source said July 13  
that AGC and the Carpenters settled on $2 more per hour over three years with successive annual  
increases of 70 cents, 65 cents (unallocated), and 65 cents (unallocated).  
The initial 70 cent per hour increase was allocated as 60 cents to wages and 10 cents to the  
apprenticeship fund. The initial 60 cent wage increase brought the journeyworker rate for the Spokane  
area and Idaho to $22.16 from $21.50 and for the Columbia River Valley area around Hanford to $22.83  
from $22.23. The 10 cent increase in the contribution to the apprenticeship fund brought the rate to 45  
cents from 35 cents, the union source said.  
Other fringe benefit contribution rates carried over at $2.75 per hour for health-welfare and $2.50 per hour  
for pensions. > |
