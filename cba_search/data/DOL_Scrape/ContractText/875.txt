monies remaining due from the Employer to the Subcontractor who is liable for wages or fringe  
benefit contributions.  
Prior to implementation of this paragraph, the Union or Trust Fund will make a good faith

### APPENDIX "W G"  
### DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION  
### AND DETECTION  
The parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the  
construction industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs.  
Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to  
maintain a drug and alcohol free work environment, individual employers may require applicants  
or employees to undergo drug testing. The parties agree that if a testing program is implemented  
by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and  
Management:  
(a) It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics,  
or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer's job  
premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed undér the applicable  
agreement.  
(b) All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug test at the direction of  
the Employer, but not later than five (5) days after commencement of work, at a facility agreed  
upon by the Employer and the Union. The cutoff levels for both the initial test and the  
confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health and Human  
Services. The facility where the sample is tested will be approved by the Federal Department of  
93  
Health and Human Services. The Employer agrees to pay each applicant or employee who takes  
and passes the drug test for all the time it takes'to undergo the drug test up to a maximum of two  
(2) hours travel time plus lab time. If an employee fails the drug test and has time coming to him  
or her, the employer may withhold the cost of the drug test from the final check.  
Employers may use an oral fluid test or urine screen, solely as a type of pre-employment  
screening process. Testing procedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the  
products’ manufacturing specifications (“Avitar ORAL screen” or Branan Medical Corp.  
“Oratect”). Any “non-negative” test results shall be designated as inconclusive. Employers  
may seek a urine test at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing  
procedure set forth in this collective bargaining agreement to confirm results.  
(c) Applicants not passing the drug test will not be placed on the Employer's payroll or  
receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug test will be removed from the  
Employers payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug test.  
(d) The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs and alcohol where  
the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing  
his/her ‘ob. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one (1) of whom may be a  
Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors  
will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take  
94  
@-  
a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable  
presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.  
(e) An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be tested  
for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the accident  
resulted from drug usage.  
(f) There will be no individual random drug testing by the signatory |  
(g) It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of  
prescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.  
(th) A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and  
confirmation test. The initial test will be an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassa Technique (E M I  
T). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test a confirmation test must  
be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or applicant. The confirmation test  
will be by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G C/M 8S). The cutoff levels for both the  
initial test and confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of Health  
and Human Services. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in  
secured long term frozen storage for a minimum of one (1) year. Collection and transportation of  
each sample must be done in accordance with the procedures mandated by the Federal  
Department of Health and Human Services.  
(i) Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a rehabilitation  
program at the employee's expense. When such program has been successfully completed, the  
95  
Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work for which the  
employee is qualified, exists, he or she shal! be reinstated.  
(j ) Any dispute which arises under this drug and alcohol policy shall be submitted to  
the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.  
(k) In the event an individual Employer is required, as a condition of contract award, to  
abide by the terms and conditions of an owner's drug and alcohol policy, the Employer will notify  
the interested Unions in writing prior to implementing such policy.  
(1) The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an  
employee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful  
by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the  
remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to  
replace the affected provision.  
(m) The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all  
claims, demands, suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's application of the  
Substance Abuse Program.  
(n) The Employers will be allowed to conduct periodic jobsite drug testing on  
construction projects until completion of work under the following circumstances:  
(1) The entire jobsite must be tested including all employees of the Employer.  
96  
(2) Prior to start of periodic jobsite testing the Employer will notify the Union in  
writing.  
(3) Analysis shall be conducted by a Federal Department of Health and Human  
Services certified lab.  
(4) The parties agree to investigate the possibility of industry-wide pre-hire and  
random drug testing. Should this plan be enacted, the Employers will contribute  
up to .02¢ per hour for same.  
(0) This policy will become effective July 1, 2001.

### 20. CLARIFICATION OF CARPENTER PILE DRIVER WORK  
This Agreement incorporates by reference the letters dated May 19, 1955 and February 18, 1970 from M. A. Hutcheson, General  
President, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, , a8 well as the questions submitted by Contractors on July 17, 1955  
requesting clarification of the May 9, 1955 letter and the answers submitted by subcommittee of the General Executive Board of the United  
Brotherhood of Carpenters.  
### CLARIFICATION OF CARPENTER  
### PILE DRIVER WORK  
(Letter, dated May 9, 1955, from Mr. M. A. Hutcheson, General President, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of  
America.)  
[ am herewith submitting the findings of the Genera! Executive Board on the controversy between Carpenters and Pile Drivers  
classifications in the West Coast area.  
The Subcommittee convened Wednesday, July 15, 1954, and Thursday, July 16, 1954, in the Empire Room of the Sir Francis Drake  
Hotel, San Francisco, California. Testimony was received from forty-seven (47) witnesses representing Local Unions, District Councils, and  
State Councils from the states of California, Oregon and Washington.  
As indicated in the matter supplied to the Subcommittee from the General Office, we found that the main points of difference existing  
between the branches of our membership on the West Coast were:  
(1) An interpretation of what constitutes the "girder capping the piles."  
(2) What classification of our membership shail apply in the placing and erection of false work.  
Additional clarification of what work properly comes under the classification of Pile Driver would help in clarifying the issues  
involved between both branches of our Brotherhood on the West Coast:  
(1) In the construction of waterfront and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bulkheads, jetties, and similar  
structures, the pile driver classification should continue to apply, up to and including the decking thereof.  
(2) On alt pile driving and caisson work on both land and water, the Pile Driver classification should apply.  
(3) In the construction of wooden bridges whether over land or over water, when composed of heavy timber, the Pile Driver  
classification should apply. |  
(4) In the construction of concrete or stee! bridges over land, the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the driving of piles  
and/or caisson work including the forms required for the capping of the piles or caissons immediately top of the piles or  
caissons. The “capping of the piles” is herein interpreted as being that concrete, wood, or other material resting on the top  
of the piles where driven or placed and does not include any further form work above the capping.  
103  
7 ln ge eRe  
@  
@  
In many instances it has been found that the capping is called “the girder.” The above shall apply on such concrete or steel bridges constructed  
over land, highways, railroads, overpasses and include cloverieafs, interchanges, etc.  
(5) In the construction of concrete or stee! bridges over water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply up to and including all  
of the form work to the top of the column, piers, or abutments supporting the steel and/or any other superstructures.  
(6) In the erection of false work, when necessary for the support of work under the Pile Driver classification, then such false  
work shall fall within their classification. False work necessary for the support of work under the Carpenter classification  
shall be done within such Carpenter classification, with the exception that where pile driving or power equipment is used  
for heavy timber false work, then such work shall come under the Pile Driver classification. This would include all  
rigging, signaling and tagging incidental to the placing of the heavy timber.  
(7) In the construction of open-cut sewers, the Pile Driver classification shall apply on all piling including wood, steel or  
concrete sheet piling, all bracing timber and form work incidental to the construction thereof. In concluding this report,  
the General Executive Board believes that the defining of the words "girder capping the piles” herein outlined will tend to  
solve much of the misunderstanding that has existed between the two (2) classifications of our membership on the West  
Coast. All of the above shall be effective only in the West Coast area where the controversy occurred,  
Signed M. A. Hutcheson  
General President  
(Questions submitted by Contractors on July 17, 1955, requesting clarification of Mr. Hutcheson's letter of May 9, 1955, and Answers submitted  
by subcommittee of the General Executive Board, United Brotherhood of Carpenters.)  
Q. 1: What did you intend to constitute a "bridge over water" within the meaning of Paragraph (5) of your letter?  
{a) For example, two (2) parallel concrete highway structures were constructed under a single contract over U.S.  
Highway 101, the railroad tacks of the Northwestem Pacific Railroad and Petalurna Creek. The overall length of the structures was  
approximately 900 feet. The structures were erected in three (3) sections. The first section, which was approximately 360 feet long, was  
constructed over the highway and the railroad tracks and terminated at a coffer-dam and piers at the south bank of the creek. The second  
section, which was approximately 415 feet long, extended from a highway fill across agricultural land to a cofferdam and piers at the north bank  
of the creek. The third section, which was approximately 115 feet long, consisted of 16 precast, 75 ton concrete girders extending over Petaluma  
Creek which were put in place by a floating derrick.  
Would you have intended that the 115 feet section spanning the creek, which constitutes less than 1/8th of the entire structure, would make the  
entire structure a “bridge over water?"  
Or would the term "bridge over water" be limited to the section which actually spanned the creek?  
A: On “bridge over water" the columns or abutments in water and at the water's edge or the first column or abutment on land  
adjacent to water's edge, shall come under the Pile Driver classification.  
a  
¢.  
Q. 2: (b) For another example, a concrete structure was constructed across the Salinas River. During the dry season, covering the  
entire construction period, the river bed was crossed by a road which carried heavy truck traffic. Would you intend this structure to be a "bridge  
over water?"  
A: Still considered a “bridge over water” and covered by classification of Paragraph (5) in answer to question 1 (a).  
Q. 3: (c) Did you intend the term “bridge over water" to include a structure being constructed over a dry bypass which is designed  
to carry water only during flood conditions, which occur only once in several years?  
A: The answer is yes. Similar to clarification of question 1 (b) and is considered a “bridge over water."  
Q. 4: (d)} Did you intend the term "bridge over water” to include a structure over a ravine or other depression which carries water, if  
at all, only during the spring runoff and outside of the construction period?  
A: The answer is yes. Same as answer to question 1 (b) and is considered as a “bridge over water" as qualified in clarification of  
question | (a).  
Q. 5: (e) Did you intend the “bridge over water” to include a structure over a man-made canal or aqueduct?  
A: Same answer as in 1 (a), 1 (b), | (c) and 1 (d). Ail clarifications of paragraph 5 of findings of the General Executive Board of May  
13, 1955, and referring to "concrete or steel bridges over water" is based upon piles being driven, caissons sunk or cofferdams erected by Pile  
Drivers under Pile Driver classification on such concrete or steel bridge foundations.  
Q. 6: Under Paragraph (6) of your letter dated May 9, 1955, did you intend the false work necessary for the support of the deck of a  
concrete or steel bridge over water to carry the Carpenter classification, except while pile driving or power equipment is used for heavy timber  
false work?  
104  
A: The answer is yes. False work necessary for the support of the decking of a concrete or steel bridge over water shal} come under the  
Carpenter classification. False work for such decking is under the Carpenter classification excepting where pile driving or power equipment ts  
used.  
Q.7: Did you intend the term "pile driving or power equipment,” as used in Paragraph (6) of your letter, to mean pile driver, derrick or  
similar power equipment?  
A: The Subcommittee feels that the words "pile driving or power equipment” are in themselves completely explanatory and feels that no  
further definition is required for anyone acquainted with the construction industry.  
Q. 8: Do forms constructed on the ground out of 2"x4" and 2" x 6" lumber and 5/8” plywood constitute "heavy timber false work," within  
the meaning of Paragraph (6) of your fetter, merely for the reason that, when assembied, they must be put in place by power equipment?  
A: The Subcommittee does not interpret “forms” to be “heavy timber false work" within the meaning of Paragraph (6). If any dimension  
forms are fabricated on the ground for work coming under the Carpenter classification, then such forms can be put in place by power equipment  
under the Carpenter classification. Forms coming under the Pile Driver classification as outlined in the findings of the General Executive Board  
shall be installed or placed under such Pile Driver classification. If heavy timber false work, consisting of supports for forms, installed under  
Carpenter classification and pile driving or power equipment.is used, then such installation of “heavy timber false work" shall be done under the  
Pile Driver classification as plainly stated in Paragraph (6) of the General Executive finding.  
Q. 9: Does Paragraph (7) of your letter refer only to work within the recognized jurisdiction of the Pile Drivers Union?  
A: The Subcommittee of the General Executive Board feels that Paragraph (7) is so plainly worded without any limitations that anybody  
familiar with the construction industry can clearly understand this paragraph without any interpretations being required. (Letter, dated  
December 12, 1967, to Mr. M. A. Hutcheson, General President United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.)  
Re: Carpenter-Piie Driver matter in West Coast area.  
In complying with your request, the Subcommittee of the General Executive Board, appointed by you to review the 1955 General Executive  
Board Decision on West Coast Carpenter-Pile Driver matter, have met several times to consider the new problems that have arisen since the  
1955 Board decision.  
Your Subcommittee held two (2) days of hearings at the Del Web Town House in San Francisco, California, on March 21 and March  
22, 1967, at which sixty-three (63) Officers and Business Representatives of our subordinate Locals and District and State Councils testified on  
the subject matter. In addition, twelve (12) representatives of various Contractors Associations met with your subcommittee and presented their  
points of view on several issues relative to new methods and techniques developed in the years since the original 1955 decision. The transcript  
of the hearings consisted of several hundred pages and the General Office is in possession of a copy of same.  
The hearings brought out that the principal items of work where there were different opinions and interpretations amongst our  
membership, and also between the Employers and our membership, mainly consisted of the following:  
(A) Dry Aqueduct or Canal Structures  
¢=)) Building Foundations  
(C) Tank Foundations  
(D)} Base Foundations for Machinery, Equipment and Stanchions  
(E) The Erection of False work, including Metal Tubular or "Tinker Toy” Material used as false work.  
Your Committee, after careful review of the transcript of the March 21 and March 22, 1967, hearings, finds it necessary to further  
clarify the intentions of the General Executive Board decision of May 1955, and to modify where necessary consistent with the evidence  
presented to the Subcommittee at this March 1967 hearing, in order to guide our West Coast membership in their jurisdictional differences on  
work issues and to assist our employees in the correct and harmonious operations of their projects.  
The work jurisdiction of our Carpenters and Pile Driving branches for our Brotherhood on the West Coast shall be as follows:  
A. (1) In the construction of water front and marine facilities, such as docks, piers, wharves, bulkheads, jetties and  
similar structures, the Pile Driver classification shall continue to apply, up to and including the decking thereof.  
A. {2) On all pile driving and caisson work, on both land and water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply.  
A. (3) in the construction of heavy timber, wooden,  
bridges, whether over land or over water, the Pile Driver classification shall apply.  
A. (4) In the construction of concrete or stee! bridges  
over land, highways, railroads, overpasses, cloverleafs, interchanges, or bridges over man-made canals, aqueducts, spillways and man-made  
water retaining areas, the Pile Driver classification shall apply to the driving of the piles, caissons and “drilled-in-place" piling. The fabrication  
and erection of the forms for the capping of piles, caissons, or "drilled-in-place” piling shal! come under the Pile Driver classification. This shall

as  
  
include the placing of wooden or steel capping or any substitute thereof.  
Any other form work above the cap, pertaining to the construction operations herein noted above, shall be performed under the

(Letter dated February 18, 1970, from Mr. M. A. Hutcheson, General President, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of  
America.)  
With further reference to communication distributed December 12, 1967, in the form of Special Report of General Executive Board  
Subcommittee relative to the Carpenter-Pile Driver matter in the West Coast area the following interpretation is submitted.  
Because of repeated requests for clarification of the above-mentioned circular letter, specifically, Item Paragraph E: “The erection of  
false work, including metal tubular for ‘tinker toy’ material used as false work." The following is forwarded for your information and guidance.  
As indicated above, it became necessary for the Committee to clarify the intent of this report which was developed from the special  
hearings conducted in San Francisco on March 21-22, 1967. Therefore, the following is the Committee's interpretation and clarification of  
Paragraph E dealing with the erection of false work.  
"The erection of false work necessary for the support of work under the Pile Driver classification comes under their classification.  
False work necessary for the support of the work under the Carpenter classification shall be governed by their classification, except on a project  
where pile driving or power equipment is used.”  
"The rigging, signaling, tagging and other incidental work shall be under the classification for whom the work is designated by this paragraph.”  
106  
   
Clarification  
It is intended by this interpretation to eliminate controversy and to insure the continuity of operations in work of this nature.  
By insertion of the word or it should not be interpreted that the Committee has changed its original intent concerning this  
controversy. The rigging of heavy timber false work and metal tubular (tinker toy) materials shall be performed under the Pile Driver  
classification when such materials are placed by power. It is intended by this clarification to mean that the Carpenters may perform the rigging  
of false work, including metal tubular (tinker toy) materials as false work under the following circumstances.  
"For the purpose of continuity of operation and to eliminate the necessity of a change in crews because Pile Drivers are not presently  
employed on the site by the responsible Contractor at the time of such rigging, or provided that such rigging by power is intermittent with that  
work which is, or would normally be performed by the Carpenter classification."  
Therefore, the communication dated December 12, 1967, shall be herein arnended and in full force and effect and all parties shail be  
governed accordingly.
