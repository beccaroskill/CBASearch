job. This combination of factors is recognized as giving a  
potentially damaging effect on the American construction industry

well being of everyone at the jobsite.

shall be proof of acknowledgement. Company agrees to provide a

declared invalid, it is further agreed that the Parties hereto  
shall meet within a period of sixty (60) days to redraft a new  
section or portion thereof, which shall be valid and which shall  
replace that section or portion thereof declared invalid. In the

prevailing wage requirements.
