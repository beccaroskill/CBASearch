Purpose:

the District Council No, 21 “JOB ORGANIZATION  
PROGRAM” for the purpose of providing subsidies on specific  
jobs in order to enable contractors who are signatory to this  
Agreement to bid more competitively on certain projects in the  
marketplace. To implement the Jobs Organization Program  
(“JOP”), the EMLOYER and District Council No. 21 further  
agree as follows:  
Trust Fund:

Program Trust Fund.”

Organization Program and shall not be liable for such charges in  
excess of the assets in the Fund.

The EMPLOYER making application must be signatory to  
District Council 21°s Collective Bargaining Agreement and  
utilize members of said bargaining unit. EMPLOYERS signed  
to project Agreements are not eligible to apply for JOP  
subsidies.  
The EMPLOYER making application must not be delinquent in  
any fringe benefit reporting and contribution obligations at the  
time of application and at the start of the approved project or  
shall have reached an appropriate Agreement, satisfactory to the  
Trustees, in resolution of any outstanding delinquencies.  
Only the District Council shall have the authority to approve a  
subsidy with respect to a project.  
Subsidized hours granted under the Jobs Organization Program  
will only apply to members of District Council No. 21 and then  
only to the EMPLOYEES that are based in that zone. These  
subsidies will not apply and/or be used for change order work  
but only to the original contract.  
Only the hours worked on an approved JOP project will be  
subsidized and then only up to the amount approved by the  
District Council.  
The EMPLOYER will report the start of a JOP project. There  
will be a job steward placed and appointed by the District  
Council at the start of any JOP project. When the project  
requires more than five (5) workers, 50% of the additional  
workers starting with the sixth, will be assigned by the District  
Council from the “out of work register”, qualifications  
prevailing.  
JOP subsidies shall not be unreasonably denied by the District  
Council. The District Council shall respond to any JOP  
application within five (5) working days. To obtain the  
pinpointing subsidy, the EMPLOYER must notify District  
Council 21 that the EMPLOYER has been awarded the relevant  
contract within thirty (30) days after the pinpointing subsidy  
application is approved by District Council 21. An EMPLOYER  
can request a thirty (30) day extension of time to provide notice  
of the contract award and said extension will be_automatically  
approved. For good cause shown, an EMPLOYER can request  
an additional extension of time to provide notice of the contract  
award. If the EMPLOYER fails to notify District Council 21  
that the EMPLOYER has been awarded the relevant contract  
within the prescribed time, including any approved extensions of  
time, the relevant pinpointing subsidy will be automatically  
terminated.

14.5  
14.6  
more than once in any given year, said EMPLOYER will not be  
eligible for JOP subsidies for a period of up to one year. A third  
finding of abuse will suspend said EMPLOYER’S use of JOP  
subsidies for the remaining term of the Agreement.

adopting additional rules and regulations not inconsistent with or  
in conflict with the foregoing.
