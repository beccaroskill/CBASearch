### ARTICLE 6  
### GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION  
Any matter of dispute that may arise between the Employer and an employee regarding  
an alleged violation of an expressed provision of this Agreement shall be handled in  
accordance with the following procedure:  
Step 1. An employee, with or without a Union steward present, shall discuss the  
complaint or problem orally with his/her supervisor within two (2) workdays following its  
occurrence in an effort to resolve the problem in an informal manner.  
Step 2. Within five (5) workdays after the discussion in Step 1, or if no decision has  
been made, the employee may then present the grievance in writing to his/her  
supervisor. The grievance shall state the nature of the grievance, shall note the specific  
clause or clauses allegedly violated, and shall list the facts and witnesses as they know  
them to be at that time. The supervisor shall respond in writing within five (5) workdays.  
Step 3. Within five (5) workdays after the decision in Step 2, or if no timely decision has  
been made, the employee may then present the written grievance to the Mayor, who  
shall respond within five (5) workdays. Grievances involving discipline or discharge will  
start at this step.  
Step 4. If not resolved at Step 3, the grievance may be submitted to arbitration within  
ten (10) workdays after the decision in Step 3, or if no decision has been made, said  
grievance may be submitted to arbitration by submitting written notice to the Mayor.  
Such notice shall specify the article(s) and section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have  
been violated. The parties shall promptly meet to attempt to agree on an arbitrator. If  
they are unable to agree, the Union will request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation  
2  
   
Service or the Public Employment Relations Board to submit to the parties a list of  
seven (7) arbitrators, from which list the parties shall select one (1) arbitrator.  
party may reject one list and request a different list. The rejecting party will pay any  
costs associated with obtaining the different list. Such selection shall be by agreement,  
if possible; otherwise, by the parties alternately eliminating names from the list, with the  
Union having the first strike.  
All grievances must be taken up promptly and awards and settlements thereof shall in  
no case be made retroactive beyond the date on which the grievance was first  
presented in the grievance procedure. If a grievance is not presented within the time  
limits specified in this Article, it shall be considered waived. If a grievance is not  
appealed to the next Step within the specified time limits, it shall be considered settled  
on the basis of the Employer's last answer. If a grievance at Step 1 or Step 2 is not  
timely answered by the Employer, it may automatically be referred to the next Step.  
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties. Each  
party shall pay its own cost of preparation and presentation for arbitration. The |  
arbitrator shall have no power to change, alter, ignore, nullify, detract from or add to the  
provisions of this Agreement. The parties are precluded from presenting any facts or  
witnesses to the arbitrator that were not presented at an earlier step in the grievance  
procedure. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties.  
All grievance and arbitration meetings under this Article are to be held in private and are  
not open to the public.  
The time limits at any step in the grievance and arbitration procedure may be extended  
on a specific case basis, upon mutual agreement between the Union and the Employer.  
If the employee files any claim or complaint in any forum other than under the grievance  
procedure of this Agreement, then the Employer shall not be required to process the  
same claim or set of facts through the grievance procedure.  
### ARTICLE 7  
### SENIORITY  
Seniority means an employee's length of full-time continuous service with the Employer  
since their last date of hire.  
All new employees shall serve a probationary period of six (6) months. They may be  
terminated for any reason during the probationary period without recourse to the  
grievance procedure. Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the  
employee will be placed on the seniority list and his/her seniority will be determined  
from their date of hire.  
An employee shall lose her/his seniority and the employment relationship shall be  
broken and terminated as follows:  
(a) Employee quits.  
(b) Employee is discharged.  
(c) Employee is absent from work without notice to the Employer.  
(d) Failure to report for work at the end of a leave of absence.  
(e) Failure to report to work within five (5) workdays after being notified to return to  
work following layoff, when notice of recall is sent by certified mail to employee's  
last known address, according to Employer records.  
(f) Employee is off work for any reason for twelve (12) months or the length of the  
employee's seniority, whichever is shorter.  
(g) Employee retires. If a former employee returns from retirement within one (1)  
year, the break in service shall be removed from their record and the employee's  
seniority shall be restored minus the period of time off the payroll.  
It is the employee's responsibility to keep the Employer informed of their current  
address and phone number.  
### ARTICLE 8  
### LAYOFF AND RECALL  
In the event the work force is to be reduced, the Employer agrees to provide affected  
employees as much advance notice as is administratively practical, but in no case will  
employees be laid off without at least ten (10) workdays written notice. Probationary  
employees in the affected job classification shall be terminated prior to any regular full-  
time or regular part-time employees being laid off. In the event that a layoff is still  
necessary following the termination of all probationary employees in the affected job  
class, all regular part-time employees shall next be laid off in their order of job class  
seniority, with the least senior being the first laid off. In the event that layoff is still  
4  
   
necessary, the regular full-time employee with the least seniority in the job classification  
affected shall be the first laid off, provided the employee retained can perform the work  
available.  
A regular employee laid off shall have his/her name on the recall list for a period of one  
year following the date of the layoff, during which period no vacancy in the job  
classification affected by the layoff may be filled by a new hire until all former employees  
on the recall list have been offered recall. On recall from layoff, former full-time  
employees who were laid off will be returned to work in the reverse order in which they  
were laid off, if they are qualified to perform the work available, as determined by the  
Employer. Former part-time employees shall be recalled following the recall of all  
former full-time employees. Probationary employees have no layoff or recall rights.  
Employees to be recalled after being laid off shall be notified five (5) days in advance in  
writing by notice sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last address  
shown on the employee's record. Former employees so notified must report for work no  
later than five (5) workdays following receipt of the recall notice. Failure to return shall  
result in the former employee being removed from the recall list.  
### ARTICLE 9  
### LEAVE  
Vacation Leave. Regular full-time employees shall accrue paid vacation leave as  
follows: |  
After one (1) year of full-time continuous service, two (2) weeks  
After five (5) years of full-time continuous service, three (3) weeks  
After fifteen (15) years of full-time continuous service, four (4) weeks  
After twenty-five (25) years of full-time continuous service, five (5) weeks  
After thirty (30) years of full-time continuous service, six (6) weeks  
Regular part-time employees shall accrue paid vacation leave on a pro rata basis.  
The scheduling of vacation leave is dependent upon the judgment and discretion of the  
Employer. In emergency situations, the Employer may require the rescheduling of  
approved vacation leave when, in his/her judgment, it is necessary. The determination  
of what constitutes an emergency rests with the Employer. Should an employee suffer  
monetary loss due to such rescheduling, the Employer shall reimburse the employee for  
such loss, e.g., non-refundable deposits or transportation rebooking fees. In order to be  
reimbursed, the employee shall provide the Employer with proof of such loss and that  
such deposits or purchases were made after the vacation was approved by the  
Employer.  
Upon resignation or termination, an employee shall be paid for all unused vacation left  
at the time of termination.  
Vacation pay will be at the employee's normal pay for the day or week for which he/she  
would have been regularly scheduled to work.  
5  
   
   
During the first anniversary year of employment, an employee is not eligible to earn paid  
vacation leave. During subsequent anniversary employment years, regular full-time and  
regular part-time employees shall earn vacation time based upon straight time hours  
worked. |  
Employees will be allowed to carry over up to one years' accrued vacation.  
In the event that a holiday falls on a scheduled vacation day, the holiday will not be  
counted as a vacation day.  
Sick Leave. Regular full-time employees shall accrue paid sick leave at the rate of  
eight (8) hours per month, up to a maximum of nine hundred-sixty (960) hours. Regular  
part-time employees shall accrue paid sick leave on a pro rata basis.  
Sick leave will be paid when the employee is unable to work due to a personal illness or  
injury. Sick leave may be used for medical, dental and optical appointments when  
those appointments cannot be made during non-work time. Sick leave shall be granted  
in a minimum of one (1) hour increments.  
Accrued sick leave, not to exceed forty (40) hours per fiscal year, may also be used to  
provide care and necessary attention to an ill or injured family member. Family member  
in this instance is defined to be a spouse, a dependent child, a parent, or a relative  
living in the employee's household.  
A medical doctor's written verification of illness or injury may be required by the  
Employer for substantiation of an illness or injury. The Employer will notify the  
employee prior to returning to work that a written verification is required.  
Sick leave may be used to make up the difference between Workers' Compensation  
and full pay. Sick leave will not be granted if an employee is injured while gainfully  
employed by a different employer.  
Holiday Leave. Regular full-time employees are eligible for the following paid holidays  
each year: New Year's Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor  
Day, Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving Day, day after Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve  
Day, Christmas Day, and two (2) floating holidays. Regular part-time employees shall  
be paid pro rata for these holidays based on the number of hours they would normally  
have been scheduled to work, if any, had the day not been a holiday.  
Regular full-time and regular part-time employees shall be paid for each of the holidays  
set forth in this Article occurring during the period in which they are in paid status. An  
employee required to work on a recognized paid holiday shall be granted compensatory  
time off or cash, as provided for in the Overtime article, at the rate of time and one-half  
(1 1/2) off for all hours worked. Holiday pay will be at the employee's normal pay for the  
day on which he/she would have been scheduled to work.  
To be eligible for holiday pay, an employee must have worked the last full scheduled  
workday immediately before and the first full scheduled workday immediately after each  
holiday, unless prior approval has been given for the employee to be on paid leave. An  
employee on layoff or unpaid leave is not eligible for holiday pay.  
Paid holidays falling on Sunday will be observed on Monday. Paid holidays falling on  
Saturday will be observed on Friday.  
Funeral Leave. In the event of the death of a regular full-time or regular part-time  
employee's spouse, child (step), parent (step), brother (step), sister (step), spouse's  
parent (step), brother (step), sister (step), sibling’s spouse, child's spouse,  
grandparents, and grandchildren, said employee may be granted up to five (5) days  
leave of absence with pay for attendance at the funeral and other related activities. One  
(1) day will be allowed for the funeral of an aunt or uncle and one-half (1/2) day for  
service as a pallbearer for persons other than listed above.  
Military Leave. A full-time employee may be granted a military leave of absence with  
pay for a period up to thirty (30) days as prescribed by Section 29A.28 of the Code of  
lowa. The Employer will pay the difference between the military pay and what the  
employee would have received if working. Proof of the military pay received shall be  
submitted upon return to work.  
The Employer recognizes an employee's re-employment rights upon return from military  
leave in accordance with the applicable federal and state laws.  
Jury Duty Leave. An employee required to serve as a juror shall receive his/her  
regular wages. In order to receive payment for such duty, the employee must submit  
certification of service and assign all payments received to the Employer. When  
released from duty during work hours, the employee will report to work immediately  
unless two (2) hours or less are left in the workday.  
Leave Without Pay. The City Administrator may approve unpaid leaves of absence for  
regular employees who request time off from work and who have no paid leave time  
available. The City, in establishing policies related to leaves of absence, reserves the  
sole right to determine if an employee will be granted leave, unless the granting of such  
leave is mandated by law or by collective bargaining agreement.  
As soon as an employee becomes aware of the need to request an unpaid leave, a  
request must be submitted in writing to the supervisor, setting forth the reason for the  
leave, the date on which it is requested to begin and the date on which it is requested to  
end.  
Unpaid leave may be granted for a maximum of twelve (12) months, and may be  
approved for use all at once or on an intermittent basis. If used intermittently, the leave  
must be in increments of no less than four (4) hours. An employee must use all  
available vacation leave before being granted unpaid leave. If sick leave is applicable,  
that must be exhausted, as well.  
   
While on approved unpaid leave, benefits and seniority will not accrue, except that during  
the first ninety (90) days of approved unpaid leave the City will continue to make its  
contribution to employee insurance plans so long as the employee continues, during that  
period, to pay the share, if any. Thereafter, if the employee wishes to continue  
insurance coverage and if doing so is allowed by the carrier, he/she will be responsible for  
both the City’s and the employee’s share of premiums. Premiums must be paid directly to  
the City Clerk. Arrangements for the time of payment must be made with the City Clerk  
prior to the employee going on leave.  
lf approved, leaves of absence will be granted for specific periods of time. If an  
employee is unable to return to work at the end of the authorized leave period, an  
extension must be requested by the same procedure as the original request. Absent an  
approved extension of leave, if an employee fails to return to work on the date originally  
approved, he/she will be considered to have voluntarily resigned employment with the  
City.  
### ARTICLE 10  
### HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME  
The purpose of this Article is to define the normal hours of work, and shall not be  
construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or days of work per week.  
Determination of days worked, as well as daily and weekly hours of work, shall be made  
by the Employer. The Employer will give employees two (2) weeks notice before  
making a work schedule change. The normal workweek shall consist of forty (40)  
hours. An employee shall not be scheduled to work more than two weekends a month.  
During an employee's normal shift, the Employer will grant thirty (30) minutes unpaid  
time for lunch and two (2) fifteen (15) minute paid rest periods. The time for the lunch  
and rest periods will be determined by the Employer.

working on their scheduled day with other employees who are receiving premium pay,  
the regularly scheduled employee shall receive premium pay. Overtime shall not be  
paid more than once for the same hours worked. The Employer shall not adjust an  
employee's normal days worked or hours worked per day to avoid paying overtime.  
Overtime shall be compensated in cash or compensatory time at the employee's  
discretion provided, however, an employee may only accumulate up to one hundred-  
forty (140) hours of compensatory time. The compensatory time accumulation period  
shall be November 1 through October 31. On October 31, all unused accrued  
compensatory time shall be paid out, except that an employee may elect to carry  
forward up to forty (40) hours of compensatory time into the next accumulation period.  
Overtime will be computed to the nearest half-hour.  
Time on paid leave will be considered work time for the purpose of determining  
overtime.  
   
Water Weekends. An employee schedule to work any water weekend rotation will be  
allowed 30 days to take off comp-time hours accrued for working the weekend rotation.  
Call Back. An employee who is called back to work for any reason or called in to work  
prior to the normal starting time, other than due to the employee's negligence, shall be  
compensated a minimum of two (2) hours unless such call back is two (2) hours or less  
prior to his/her shift, in which case the employee will be paid for actual hours worked at  
the appropriate rate. This will be granted as compensatory time or cash as provided  
above. Call back does not apply when an employee is directed to work beyond his/her  
regular shift.  
### ARTICLE 11
