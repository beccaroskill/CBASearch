### Il}. PURPOSE OF POLICY  
A The Individual Employer and the Union are commmilted to providing a safe and productive work environment for

2. Tomaintain our work force at its maximum effectiveness; and  
3. Toprovide confidential referral to the Addiction Recovery Program (“ARP”) and to provide confiden-  
tial treatment to those Employees who recognize they have a substance abuse problem and volun-  
tarily seek treatment for it.  
B. In order to achieve these purposes, it is our primary goai to identify those Employees and refer them  
to professional counseling, and treatment before job performance has become a disciplinary problem. Employ-  
ees are urged to use the services available through ARP. ARP will assist them and refer them to the appropriate  
treatment program.

Standards are not complied with shalt not be considered for any purpose under this Policy.  
Laboratories. All laboratories which perform tests under this Policy shall be SAMHSA certified.  
Testing Procedures and Protocols, All] SAMHSA standards for testing standards and protocols shall be followed.  
All specimens which are determined to be positive by the SAMHSA approved sereening test shall be subject to a  
SAMHSA certified confirmatory test (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry).  
Second Test. The laboratory shali save a sufficient portion of each specimen in a manner approved by SAMHSA so that  
an Employee may have a second test performed. Immediately after the specimen is collected, it will be labeled and then  
initialed by the Employee and a witness. If the sample must be collected at a site other than the drug and/or alcohol  
testing laboratory, the specimen sha!l then be placed in a transportation container. The container shall be sealed in the  
Empioyee’s presence and the &mployee shall be asked to initial or sign the container. The container shall be sent to the  
designated testing laboratory on that day or the earliest business day by the fastest available method. Any Employee  
whose specimen is tested positive and who challenges a test result may have the second portion of the sampie tested at  
his/her expense and at a laboratory agreed upon by the Employee and the MROso long as that laboratory is SAMHSA  
certified and has been or ts approved by the parties and the Employee requests the second test within seventy-two (72)

test, this Sectton will be revised to include those substances. The faboratory will report positive test results to the MRO.  
The MRO will verify whether the test is positive or negative. The MRO shall report to the Individual Employer whether
