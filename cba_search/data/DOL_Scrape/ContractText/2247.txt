### AGREEMENT  
THIS AGREEMENT made this 20th day of December, 1998, by and  
between ADAMS SUPER FOOD STORE (hereinafter referred to as the  
### "Employer"), and the UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS  
INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL #464A, AFL-CIO (hereinafter referred  
to as the "Union"), for and on behalf of its members now employed  
and who may be hereafter employed by the Employer and who, in  
this Agreement, shall be designated as "employees".  
### RECOGNITION - ARTICLE 1.  
### The Employer hereby recognizes the UNITED FOOD AND  
### COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION, LOCAL #464A, AFFILIATED WITH THE AFL-  
CIO, as the exclusive representative of its meat, poultry, fish,  
appetizer and delicatessen department employees, both full-time  
and part-time, in the present and future stores of the Employer  
located within the present and future jurisdictional area of the  
said Local Union within the States of New Jersey and New York.  
### REPRESENTATION - ARTICLE 2.  
It is further agreed that the accredited official of the  
Union will constitute the Union representative in all  
negotiations between the Employer and the Union.  
### EMPLOYMENT - ARTICLE 3.  
The Employer, on requiring additional or new help will  
secure the same from the Employment Office of the Union  
providing, however, such individuals qualify. The Union agrees  
that its Employment Office will not discriminate against non-  
union applicants. All new employees will secure a work card from  
the Union Office or from a Union official prior to commencing  
work.  
### UNION SHOP - ARTICLE 4.  
A. All employees covered by this Agreement shall, as a  
condition of employment become members of the Union on or after  
the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such  
employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is  
the later, and shall thereafter maintain their membership in the  
Union in good standing.  
B. Any employee who is expelled or suspended from the  
Union because of non-payment of initiation fees and dues  
(including such other obligations to the Union, failure to pay  
which would make an employee subject to discharge under the  
   
Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947) shall be subject to  
dismissal after notification in writing to the Employer by the  
Union provided, however, that the employee may have a reasonable  
time within which to make such payments of initiation fees or  
dues, the failure of payment of which has caused the expulsion or  
suspension.  
### DEDUCTION - ARTICLE 5.  
The Employer will deduct weekly from each employee dues and  
initiation fees that may be due the Union, provided the employee  
has authorized the deduction in writing. The deductions will  
start with the first (lst) week following thirty (30) days of  
employment and each succeeding week thereafter. Such deductions  
will be forwarded monthly to the Secretary-Treasurer, together  
with a list setting forth the name and social security number of  
each employee and the amount of money remitted on his or her  
behalf.  
### RIGHT TO VISIT STORES - ARTICLE 6.  
It is mutually agreed that the authorized representatives of  
the Union have the right to visit the Employer's stores at any  
time to check working conditions, examine payrolls and otherwise  
insure proper compliance with this contract. The authorized  
representatives of the Union will make a good faith effort to  
notify the Store Manager or his designee of his presence prior to  
beginning his visit to the store.

A. The Employer recognizes the principles of seniority and  
shall be governed by these principles in the matters of layoffs  
and recalls as provided in Paragraph E below.  
B. Seniority is defined as the employee's continuous  
length of employment with the Employer. An employee's seniority  
shall be considered broken in the event of any of the following:  
The employee quits or resigns.  
The employee is discharged for cause.  
The employee's rights to recall have expired.  
The employee fails to return to work in accordance  
with the terms of leave of absence without prior approval by the  
Employer.  
  
C. The Employer shall furnish the Union quarterly with a  
seniority list containing the names, store identifications,  
social security number, job classifications, dates of hire, dates  
of birth and rates of pay of all its employees subject to this  
Agreement. In addition, the Employer will supply bi-weekly the  
names, job titles, locations and pay of all new employees and all  
terminations.  
D. Full-time employees will not be laid off before part-  
time employees in the same classification within a mutually  
agreed upon geographical area, provided such full-time employees  
are available on a part-time basis for the hours required to be  
worked within the classification. It is not the Employer's  
intent to replace the full-time work force with a part-time work  
force, nor is it the intent of the Union to eliminate the part-  
time work force.  
E. Employees shall be laid off within classification only  
after one (1) week's notice in writing to the Union and the  
employee; however, in the event that unusual circumstances beyond  
the control of the Employer, including but not limited to  
emergencies or acts of God, consumer boycotts and leafletting,  
reduce the need for employees on a_= short-term basis, the  
foregoing notice provision shall be reduced from one (1) week to  
eight (8) hours. All laid off employees will retain rights of  
recall for one (1) year. No new employee shall be hired until  
all laid off employees have been recalled. Notice of any recall  
will be by certified mail sent to the home of the employee with a  
copy to the Union. The employee must return to work within seven  
(7) days of receipt of letter or forfeit all rights to recall.  
All recalls will be on a seniority basis. The provisions of this  
subsection E shall be applicable only after six (6) months of  
continuous service with the Employer.  
F. An employee absent because of illness (including  
maternity) or accident, including worker's compensation, shall  
retain seniority rights for eighteen (18) months. The provisions  
of this subsection F shall be applicable only after six (6)  
months of continuous service with the Employer. Absences of  
sixty (60) days or less shall not adversely affect wage  
progressions, personal holidays or sick leave entitlements. The  
Employer may require physical examinations by a Medical Doctor.  
Such examinations will be solely at the expense of the Employer.  
G. Full-time employees with one (1) year or more of  
continuous service who are laid off through no fault of their own  
shall be given preference for part-time employment and guaranteed  
a minimum of sixteen (16) hours and a maximum of twenty-nine (29)  
hours of work per week by classification at his or her full-time  
hourly rate of pay.  
   
H. In a store where a full-time employee is laid off, no  
part-time employee shall be hired in the store within the same  
classification where the layoff took place until such time as the  
employee last laid off shall be returned to full employment,  
unless the employee's rights of recall has expired, or unless the  
last laid off full-time employee has declined such part-time  
employment as is made available by the Employer.  
i. Employees of acquired stores who are hired and retained  
after the completion of their probationary period shall have  
seniority for layoff purposes only among themselves in the  
acquired stores, but not over other employees employed by the  
Employer prior to any such acquisition.

with the Employer which could lead to discipline. Use of  
discipline records is limited to three (3) years prior to the

Agreement.  
G. Any employee who shall, at the discretion of the  
arbitrator be required to testify at or attend any hearings or  
arbitration, mediation or settlement of any question of  
violations of this Agreement shall not suffer any loss in wages  
by reason thereof.  
H. Any and all rights applicable to an employee shall be  
asserted, discussed and adjusted solely and exclusively by the
