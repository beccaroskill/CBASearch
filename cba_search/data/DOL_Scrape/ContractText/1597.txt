for work performed on the contractor's job, provided that written demand is  
sent to the subcontractor, with a copy to the contractor, and payment has not

subcontractor. iii) As used in this Agreement: Subcontracting is the performance

subcontractor is one who performs subcontracting, and the term includes a  
subcontractor of a subcontractor.

notify the Union of his intent to do so at least 48 hours before the start of  
his work on those specific projects.
