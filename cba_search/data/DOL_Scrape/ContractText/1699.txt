If the above subcontractor is found in non  
compliance, the matter will be referred to the  
Disputes Board (see Settlement of Disputes).

### SETTLING DISPUTES. Differences or dis-  
putes which cannot be resolved by the parties  
concerning the interpretation or application of  
any provisions of this Agreement shall be sub-

rence of the event or knowledge of the condition  
giving rise to the grievance. A continuing event  
or condition shall give rise to a grievance only on  
the first day it occurs and there shal]] be no con-

numbers of Management Representatives and  
7  
   
Labor Representatives will meet regularly to  
settle any and all disputes or problems affecting  
this Agreement, the parties hereto, and to avoid  
work stoppages, strikes or other problems  
affecting productivity. The State Joint  
Committee shall have no power to add to,  
delete, or modify any provisions of this  
Agreement, All decisions of the Joint  
Committee shall be final and binding.  
Decisions of the Joint Committee will be  
drafted at the conclusion of the meeting, signed  
by members of the Committee, and distributed  
to both parties at that time.  
If either party, after signing above docu-  
ments, refuses to abide by the decision of the  
Joint Committee, economic action may be taken  
by the other party.  
Should the Joint Committee as established  
be unable to reach a decision in the matter  
because of a deadlock (lack of majority), then  
the matter may go to final and binding arbitra-  
tion as provided in the following manner:  
They shall ask the Federa} Mediation and  
Conciliation Service for a list of five (5) names  
from which the aggrieved party strike the  
first name, ete. until the Arbitrator is selected.  
The Arbitrator selected shall render his deci-  
sion within thirty (30) days after hearing the  
case. The time may be extended by mutual  
agreement between the parties. The decision of  
the Arbitrator shall be fina! and binding on the  
signatories to this Agreement who are parties to  
the disputes; provided, however, that the  
Arbitrator shall have ne power to add to, delete,  
or modify any provisions of this Agreement. The  
Employer and the Union will share equally all  
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator.

immediately prior to the raising of the question  
to be decided under this Article shall remain  
unchanged until final decision has been reached  
hereunder.

B, Work in Two Wage Zones - When work  
covered by this Agreement is in two wage zones  
(point of load to point of dump) the driver shall  
be paid an hourly wage based on the average of  
the two zones. (i.e. —if Area 4 has a wage of $10

Direct Deposit Memorandum of  
Understanding  
This memorandum clarifies the understand-  
ing between the AGC of Minnesota and the  
Minnesota Construction Conference of  
Teamsters with regard to direct deposit of  
employee’s paycheck. Direct deposit was  
proposed by the AGC and agreed to by the  
Teamsters in the 2005 highway-heavy negotia-  
tions. The dispute is whether direct deposit is  
mandatory for the employer. The AGC says it is  
not and the Teamsters say it is.  
This dispute will be settled at a future date.  
Due to time restraints it is not feasible to settle  
this dispute in a timely manner. Until this  
dispute is settled, direct deposit will not be  
mandatory on the employer.  
### ARTICLE XXII  
### FRINGE BENEFITS. The Employer agrees  
to contnbute every month, not later than the  
15th day of the following month, hereinafter  
called the “due date” such sums for Pensions and  
13  
Health and Welfare, as may be designated in  
### CLASSIFICATIONS AND WAGES an hour for  
each hour worked by all Employees covered by  
this Agreement. The Fund shall be known sepa-  
rately as the Teamsters’ Pension Fund and the  
Teamsters’ Health and Welfare Fund and collec-  
tively as the Minnesota Teamsters’ Fringe  
Benefit Fund under separate Trust Agreements,  
copies of which the Employer will receive and to  
which the Employer is automatically bound. The  
fund’s Trustees shal] equally represent the  
Union and the Employer.  
1. Contributions to be paid on one check with  
all other fringes to an administrative agency  
with a local office.  
2. Reporting forms and instructions stan-  
dardized with other basic trades.  
3. Contributions paid on an hourly basis on  
all hours worked and not to be pyramided.  
Example: If hourly wage is $3.00 plus 10 cents  
fringe, time and one-half overtime rate — $4.50  
plus 10 cents fringe and double time overtime  
rate — $6.00 plus 10 cents fringe. On shift work,  
contributions paid on the same proportionately  
hourly basis as hours worked to hours paid.  
4. Any Insurance Carrier, Administrator,  
Consultant, Actuary, Fiduciary Agent which  
may be used shall be selected by competitive  
bidding upon invitation by Trustees.  
5. There shall be no requirement that  
Employees sent to work outside the scope of  
this Agreement be paid fringes, nor shall the  
Employer be required to duplicate fringe  
contributions.  
6. Collections: (a) Delinquency: An Employer  
shall be considered “delinquent” for a particular  
14  
work month if its required report and contribu-  
tion for that month are not received in the office  
of the Fund Administrator, postmarked on or  
before the 20th day of the following month (the  
“due date”), irrespective of whether such delin-  
quency is willful or otherwise; provided, that an  
Employer shall not be considered delinquent for  
such month if it shall prove by clear and con-  
vincing evidence satisfactory to the Trustees  
that its report and payment were in fact posted  
on or before the due date and were lost in the  
mails through no fault of its own. For the pur-  
pose of determining the hours to be reported for  
a particular work month, the Employer may  
report either on the basis of the hours worked  
each day occurring in that month or on the  
basis of all hours worked through the last day of  
the last pay period ending within that month,  
provided that the reporting basis selected by  
the Employer is consistently followed:  
(b} Liquidated damages and interest: If an  
Employer becomes delinquent for a particular  
work month (as provided in (a) above), such  
Employer shall also be required to pay, as liqui-  
dated damages and not as a penalty an amount  
equal to 10% of the contributions otherwise due  
for such work month, it being understood and  
acknowledged by the parties that actual dam-  
ages are extremely difficult or impossible to  
ascertain and that the amount so fixed as liqui-  
dated damages is reasonable. In addition to liq-  
uidated damages, contributions delinquent for  
more than two months shall bear interest at the  
rate of 8% per annum, calculated for the applic-  
able due date to the date of payment.  
(c) Bonding: If an Employer becomes delin-  
16  
quent for a particular work month (as provided  
in (a) above as to any or all of the Trust Funds,  
and if the report and the full payment due for  
such work month (including liquidated dam-  
ages) are not actually received in the office of  
the Fund Administrator on or before the 20th  
day of the month following the applicable due  
date, such Employer shall (in addition to paying  
the full amount due) be required to post in the  
office of the Fund Administrator a cash or sure-  
ty bond in form satisfactory to the Trustees in a  
face amount of $25,000, issued by a duly  
licensed surety company. Such Bond shall cover  
all the Trust Funds and assure payment of all  
sums called for by this Agreement in the event  
of the Employer’s subsequent delinquency as to  
any or all of the Trust Funds, and which shall be  
kept in force and maintained in the full face  
amount for a period of not less than twelve (12)  
consecutive calendar months during which such  
Employer has complied fully with the terms  
and provisions of this Article.  
(d) Underpayment. An Employer who, after  
having filed a report for a particular work  
month, is found not to have reported and paid  
the full amount of contributions due for such  
month, shall be required to pay 10% liquidat-  
ed damages on the total amount of the under-  
payment, and if such underpayment is more  
than two months overdue, the Employer shall  
also pay interest thereon at the rate of 8% per  
annum calculated from the applicable due  
date. At the election of the Trustees, such  
Employer may also be required to post a bond  
in the form contemplated by clause (c) hereof  
and in a face amount at least equal to the total  
16  
amount of contributions due for the four most  
recent work months completed prior to the  
date on which such underpayment was dis-  
covered by the Trustees.  
(e) Auditing procedures: The Trustees shall  
have the right at any time and from time to  
time upon notice to the Employer, to cause an
