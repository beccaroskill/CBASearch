The purpose of this Section 50 is to preserve and protect the work opportunities that will be available to  
employees covered by this Agreement at the jobsite or job yard.  
The terms and conditions of this Agreement, insofar as it effects the Employer and the individual employer, shall  
apply equally to any subcontractor of any tier under the control of, or working under oral or written contract  
with such employer on any work covered by this Agreement to be performed at the jobsite or job yard.  
and said subcontractor with respect to such work be considered as an individual employer covered by this  
Agreement.  
If an individual employer shall work herein defined, the work will be subcontracted to a subcon-  
tractor siguatory to the appropriate Agreement with the Union. Such subcontract shail state that such  
subcontractor is or agrees to become signatory to an appropriate Agreement with the Union and will comply  
with all the terms and provisions of said Agreement the payments of wages, Trust Fund contributions  
and fringe benefit payments. A copy of the subcontract and signature shall be furnished to the Union upon  
request.  
The term “subcontractor” means any person, corporation or other entity, other than an employee covered by this  
Agreement, who agrees, orally or in writing, to perform for, or on behalf of the individual employer, any part or  
portion of the work covered by this Agreement. The subcontractor shall be properly licensed as required by the  
California State Contractors License Law.  
The individual employer will give written notice to the NCCRC and/or Millwrights Local 102, (see Appendix B,  
Section 15) as the case may be, of any subcontract involving the performance of work covered by this Agreement  
within five (5) days of entering such subcontract and/or prior to commencement of work by the subcontractor,  
unless such netice is prevented by emergency conditions, and shall specify the name and address ef the  
subcontractor.  
ba. If thereafter the subcontractor becomes delinquent in the payment of any wages, Trust Fund contribu-  
tions, or fringe benefit payments, then the NCCRC, Local Union or the Trust Fund office shall give prompt  
   
~]  
8.  
notice of the delinquency, confirmed in writing, to the individual employer and to the subcontractor. The notice  
shall specify the name and amounts, if known, of the delinquency.  
5b. Said notification by the NCCRC, Local Union or the Trust Fund office shall be provided within twenty (20)  
days of publication of the Delinquency list provided by the Trust Funds or if in the ease of failure to pay wages

only the amount of any such delinquency by such subcontractor occurring within ninety (90) days prior to the  
receipt of said notice from the Union, and said individual employer may withhold the amount claimed to be  
delinquent out of the sums due and owing by the individual employer to such subcontractor.  
bc. Notwithstanding the provision set forth above, if the subcontractor is found in violation of the hiring  
provisions of this Agreement, pursuant to the provision of Section 51 (Grievance Procedure), and the Union is  
unable to collect from the subcontractor the damages determined to be owing for such violation, the individual  
employer shall then be liable for the payment of such damages. The total of this liability, as it would apply to  
the individual employer, shall be no more than five (5) days’ violation or the total of the subcontractor’s retention  
being held by the individual employer, whichever amount is greater.  
If the individual employer fails to give written notiec as required in this Section 50, he shall, until notice is  
received, assume liability for any violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at that particular  
jobsite or job yard, as may he determined by the Grievance Procedure. [f the subcontractor is signatory or  
otherwise bound to an Agreement with the Union. the individual employer shal) be liable only for delinquencies  
as Set forth in subsection 5a of this Section 50 for work on that jobsite or job yard. If the subcontractor is not

ment on that jobsite or job yard.

employer will require that any subcontractor of the individual employer specified in the demand will, ifhe has  
not already done so, post a surety bond in an amount not to exceed $75,000.00 to cover payments of wages,  
Trust Fund contributions and fringe benefit payments specified in this Agreement. Failure of the individual  
employer to comply with this Section within two (2) days of demand will make the individual employer liable for  
the delinquencies of the subcontractor occurring on the individual specific job. (The amount of the  
bonds specified in this subsection in no way affects the amount specified for bonding purposes elsewhere in this  
Agreement).  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or this Section 50, on any residential construction, all  
work covered by this Agreement shall be performed by the individual employer or prime carpentry contractor,
