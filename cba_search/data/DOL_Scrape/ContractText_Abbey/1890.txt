a. When a surplus condition exists (defined at the job title level within a company-defined entity when the Company determines there are more people on a job title in an entity than are needed to perform the work of that particular job title in the entity) the Company shall (i) notify the Union; (ii) identify the impacted job title, the company-defined entity and the number of surplus employees in the job title and (iii) inform the Union as to whether the Company intends to layoff bargaining unit employees to relieve that surplus.
When the Company has jobs available to offer to surplused employees and therefore notifies the Union that it does not intend to layoff bargaining unit employees, the Company will proceed as follows:
(C)	(1) For the remaining life of the current Contract (April 4, 2009), the
Company will offer an Enhanced Voluntary Severance Plan1 (EVSP) to incumbents in the impacted job title within the company-defined entity.

(3)	If a surplus still exists at the job title level within a company-
defined entity following the offer of the EVSP, the Company will notify the Union of its intent to initiate an Involuntary Re-Deployment Process to move “surplused” employees2 to available jobs3 for which they are qualified. The notification will include a listing of surplused employees arranged in seniority order. The date of this notification will serve as the start date of an 8-week Involuntary Re-Deployment Process.
(C)	(4) For the remaining life of the current Contract (April 4, 2009), the
Company and the Union will jointly sponsor Pre-Test Training Workshops to be offered to surplused employees. The Company will arrange for the bargaining unit employees, who are designated by the Union as trainers for this workshop, to be released from their normal duties to conduct the workshops. The Company will continue to pay these employees their basic wages. The Union will “train the trainers” and provide the training facilities and associated supplies and equipment needed to conduct these workshops. The Union and the Company will encourage surplused employees to avail themselves of the Pre-Test Training Workshops and once scheduled for a workshop, to fully utilize the services provided to prepare themselves and to take the required test(s) administered by the Transfer Bureau.

(1)	Re-deployed employees will not have any priority consideration in the Transfer Bureau, and any transfer requests will be processed in the normal manner by the Transfer Bureau, except in the following circumstance: If as a result of accepting a Guaranteed Job Offer, the surplused employee is placed into a job title specifically created by the Company to meet the Guaranteed Job Offer commitment, the employee will receive “priority placement” preference in the Transfer Bureau for the next available position for which the surplused employee applies and is qualified and which is at or below the maximum wage rate of the surplused title the employee left. An employee who transfers from a job title specifically created by the Company to meet the Guaranteed Job Offer commitment will not be allowed to retreat back to that title.
(m)	If a re-deployed employee subsequently transfers to another position, all of the normal Transfer Bureau rules will apply to any subsequent transfer or transfer request (e.g., must meet residency requirements of the new position).
(n) All employees re-deployed under the Involuntary Re-Deployment Process will have two additional transfer requests automatically placed in the Available File7: 1.) Original title, same location; 2.) Original job title, any location. Residency time requirement on their new title will be waived and these automatic requests will be in addition to the contractual agreement of ten. Automatic requests will remain in the Available File until the employee returns to their former title or is advanced to a level higher than their former title.

(2)	Employees declared surplus (not yet placed).
(3)	Employees in the MIT Program.
(4)	Normal transfer requests.
(p)	Fulfillment of either of the automatic transfer requests will remove the employee from the Available File. This will have no effect on any other transfer requests the employee has on file in the Transfer Bureau. If the employee had fulfilled all residency requirements prior to re-deployment, no new residency requirements will be required for a subsequent transfer. If the employee had not met residency requirements prior to re-deployment, the employee will be required to complete any remaining residency requirement. The time spent in any job(s) between the date of re-deployment and the date of recall from re-deployment will be counted for the purposes of meeting residency requirements.
(q)	The effect of declining an automatic transfer request will be as follows:
(1)	Original title - Original Location:
Employee is removed from the Available File. If his/her pay is above the maximum for the present title, it will be reduced directly to that maximum.
(2)	Original title - Any Location:
Employee will be removed from the Available File for any locations to which they refuse an automatic transfer. They will remain in the available file for all other statewide locations.
When the Company has an insufficient number of jobs available to offer to surplused employees and notifies the Union that it does intend to layoff bargaining unit employees, the Company will proceed as follows:
12
BASIC CONTRACT
b.	The Company and the Union shall meet and jointly agree upon the definition of the groups (herein after referred to as “pools”) within which layoffs are to be effected should it be necessary to introduce layoffs. At a minimum, pools will be defined as an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Job Group within an entity. Should the Company elect to combine EEO Job Groups across the Company for purposes of establishing layoff “pools”, the Company may retain up to ten percent (10%) of the employees slated for layoff in the “pool” based on criteria such as special skills or licenses.
c.	In order to relieve the surplus, the Company shall first implement a voluntary exit incentive program, which will encompass either the payment provisions delineated in paragraph five (5) of this Article or a replacement negotiated voluntary termination program, within the impacted entity “pool(s)” or on a wider basis if the Company deems that it is appropriate. The voluntary exit incentive program will remain available to impacted employees for a minimum of fifteen (15) days.
d.	If, at the conclusion of the voluntary exit incentive program, further force adjustments are deemed necessary by the Company, the Company shall provide the Union with formal written notification as to (i) the existence of a surplus condition by title and entity; (ii) its intent to implement a voluntary re-deployment process to relieve that surplus and (iii) its intent to introduce layoffs no earlier than thirty (30) days from the date of notification should voluntary re-deployment efforts fail to relieve the surplus condition.
e.	The Company will initiate a voluntary re-deployment process to last a minimum of fifteen (15) days. This process will be available to all incumbents in surplused Titles. This process will make open positions8 available to qualified employees identified for surplus on a seniority basis. Employees accepting positions in this voluntary re-deployment process will not have “retreat” rights to their original title. The Company will terminate any Temporary employees or Contract Labor performing the work of bargaining unit employees in the impacted “pool”.
g.	The Company and the Union are committed to jointly explore all possible alternatives to layoff prior to the Company initiating layoffs. To that end, as soon as can be mutually arranged after the issuance of the formal written notification, the Company and the Union shall convene a joint committee of representatives to explore all alternatives to achieve the underlying cost reductions associated with the planned layoff. These options may include, but are not limited to changes to wage rates, benefit provisions and in work rules, changes in compensation practices relative to overtime and differential payments, changes in reimbursement practices or implementation of furloughing and/or part-timing work scheduling arrangements. This committee shall not formulate policy or arrive at
8 “Open Positions”: any positions available in the Transfer Bureau will be closed to normal Transfer Bureau candidates in order to be made available to either the Voluntary Re-deployment process or to employees designated for layoff.
13
BASIC CONTRACT
binding decisions or agreements, but rather shall be charged with the responsibility to develop recommendations to the Company and Union bargaining representatives during the notification period.
h.	In the event there still remains the need to initiate layoffs, the Company will do so in accordance with the formal written notification referenced in paragraph (f). The Company will terminate contract labor and Temporary employees performing services that employees designated for layoff are qualified to perform and that can be performed at comparable costs.
i.	Based upon the “pools’ agreed upon in paragraph (b) above, surplused titles will be grouped with other titles in the same EEO Job Group and all incumbents on titles within the “pool” will be arranged in seniority order. The Company, if appropriate, will identify employees to be retained and then in inverse seniority order within the “pool” designate employees for layoff to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus condition. Within each “pool” more junior employees in the surplus titles will be offered, in seniority order, the positions of the most junior (non-retained) employees slated for layoff from the “pool”. Employees selecting positions of more junior employees in the “pool” must meet Basic Qualifications of the position selected. If the position selected is at a lower rate of pay than that of the employee’s current position, the employee’s pay will be reduced to the new rate at the time of transfer; however, the employee will continue to receive a supplemental partial payment of their severance pay (“Transition Pay”), to maintain their former rate of pay, for a period of time equivalent to the number of weeks called for in the layoff payment table based upon their (C) completed years of net credited service. Residency time requirements on the new title for employees selecting positions in this process will be waived until the employee transfers to a subsequent position. Employees selecting positions in this process will have “buyback” rights9 to their original title should a vacancy arise in that title within the Company-defined entity' from which they were originally declared surplus.
9
“Buyback Rights” - All employees surplused in the “layoff” process and who “bump” into a position which has been designated for layoff will have two additional transfer requests automatically placed in the Available File : 1.) Original title, same location; 2.) Original job title, any location. Residency time requirement on their new title will be waived and these automatic requests will be in addition to the contractual agreement of ten. Automatic requests will remain in the Available File until the employee returns to their former title or is advanced to a level higher than their former title. Fulfillment of either of the automatic transfer requests will remove the employee from the Available File. This will have no effect on any other transfer requests the employee has on file in the Transfer Bureau. The effect of declining an automatic transfer request will be as follows:
(1) Original title - Original Location:
Employee is removed from the Available File.
(2) Original title - Any Location:
Employee will be removed from the Available File for any locations to which they refuse an automatic transfer. They will remain in the available file for all other statewide locations.
14
BASIC CONTRACT
j.	Employees electing not to select a position of a more junior employee in the “pool”, may alternatively accept the provisions of the voluntary exit incentive program in effect at the time. If, at the conclusion of the above steps, further force adjustments are deemed necessary by the Company, the employees designated for layoff will be given a last voluntary
(C) opportunity to select from available open positions10 or accept the provisions of the voluntary exit incentive program in effect at the time. The Company will then initiate layoffs for all remaining identified employees.
2.	In the event of an emergency or unusual peak work load conditions, the Company will attempt to utilize employees laid off under the provision of this article before engaging other contingency labor sources. Employees laid off by SNET will be given preferential consideration for engagement as a Temporary employee if they are so registered.
(a)	Temporary needs in titles and entities which have been subject to layoff shall be filled as follows:
(1)	The Company shall contact former employees who have “recall” rights (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Article) to that title and entity, in seniority order, in order to offer them the temporary assignment (regardless of prior application status).
(2)	All provisions of the Temporary employee classification will be applicable; except, wage rates for these employees will be equivalent to the going rate for regular employees holding that title and contractual work rules applicable to these employees will be consistent with those applicable to regular employees holding that title.
(3)	Acceptance of a Temporary assignment will have not impact on “recall” rights or any previous severance payments.
(b)	Temporary needs in titles and entities which have not been subject to layoff shall be filled as follows:
(1)	Preference shall be given to laid off employees who have applied for Temporary employment. All provisions of the Temporary employee classification would apply to these employees, should they accept the assignment; such acceptance will have no impact on “recall” rights or any previous severance payments.
(2)	Select from remaining Temporary applicants.
10 “Open Positions": any positions available in the Transfer Bureau will be closed to normal Transfer Bureau candidates in order to be made available to either the Voluntary Re-deployment process or to employees designated for layoff.
15
BASIC CONTRACT
3.	If a vacancy should arise in a title (or successor titles) and organizational unit which has experienced layoffs, the Company will offer employment in order of seniority to employees who have been laid off from that title (or successor titles) and organizational unit, before initiating the Transfer Plan (Policies and Procedures, Part I). These “recall rights” will remain in effect for laid off employees provided that:
(a)	Each such employee’s service at the time of layoff exceeds one (1) year and
(b)	The period of layoff does not exceed:
-	two years for employees with less than six (6) years of seniority net credited service at the time of layoff, or
-	four years for employees with six (6) or more years of seniority net credited service at the time of layoff, and
(c)	Such employee is still qualified to perform the duties of the available work and
(d)	Such employee keeps the Company informed of the address at which the employee can be reached and reports for duty within four (4) weeks after notification of re-employment by registered mail.
An employee who declines an offer of employment to their former title (or successor titles) and organizational unit (at a location 50 miles or less from their former work location) will no longer have “recall rights” to their former title (or successor titles) and organizational unit.
4.	Seniority, for the purpose of this article, shall be based on seniority net credited service as defined in General 1.14 (b).
5.	Layoff Payments
(a) Except as otherwise specified below a regular employee with one or more years of continuous service since the latest date of engagement or reengagement who is laid off under the provisions of this article, shall receive a payment for each completed year of seniority net credited service as defined in General 1.14 (b). as follows:

(b)	The employee’s basic weekly wage plus any fixed differential shall be used as the basis for computing the amount of the layoff payment.
17
BASIC CONTRACT
(c)	A regular part time employee whose employment is terminated pursuant to this article shall receive a layoff payment as provided in (a) above, except that pay for each week shall be based on the employee's average basic weekly wage during the highest four (4) weeks during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the week before the layoff.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
(C) MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT CONCERNING EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES AND TRADITIONAL TELECOM WORK
Evolving Technologies and Traditional Telecom Work: FTTP, VoIP, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies)
Much of the work related to the evolving technologies of the telecommunications industry are extensions of traditional telephone work or copper cable switched technology. The new technologies referred to here are Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), WiFi and other data services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Traditional telephone work has been installation, maintenance, network construction & surveillance, repair, customer premise work, billing, operator services, sales and service, customer service, and technical support. Since the work supporting the new technologies is functionally related to the work required in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the new work will be performed by workers covered by the collective bargaining agreements.
Fiber to the Premise (FTTP)
Both parties recognize that most FTTP work today is done under the core contracts. The parties agree that all non-management FTTP work which falls into the comparable categories of traditional telephone work now performed on the switched network including construction, repair, customer service, billing, sales, technical support, terminations, splicing and testing will be performed under the core contracts. Construction work that is similar to work that is currently done in the circuit network will continue to be performed as it is under the core contracts. For example, the parties recognize that trenching is work that is traditionally contracted.
Fiber to the premise shall be CWA bargaining unit work as described below. The assignment of fiber to the premise work shall be made just as it is for the copper switched network today. As the network evolves to a packet-switched fiber network, the core bargaining unit will continue to perform the type of work that was previously bargaining unit work in the circuit switched network.
CWA shall be recognized for construction, splicing, testing, terminations of fiber to premise/neighborhood or node work and all associated equipment required to make fiber operational. Aerial drops to the premise shall be CWA-represented work. All other service drops in the fiber network shall be done as they are in the circuit-switched network. When the customer premise work is performed by SBC, SBC CWA employees will do it under the core contracts or DataComm contracts. If in the view of the Company, the nature of some of the customer premise work and interacting with the customer and the required set of skills to perform that work require a different craft title, the parties agree to meet to bargain an appropriate rate.
39
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
This includes testing, splicing and termination at the interface device as well as installing associated equipment to make the fiber functional as communications cable at the premise.
WiFi
Currently, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) consists of DSL (and highspeed internet) lines installed by SBC CWA-represented employees from and including the central office to the customer premise termination including the interface device or protector. Terminal equipment is installed on the customer premise. As the WiFi business grows, SBC expects to expand the work performed by SBC employees. If SBC performs the customer premise work, SBC will utilize core or DataComm employees for CPE installations. Outside the SBC footprint, SBC may use contractors to perform this work. Within the SBC footprint contractors may be used on a temporary basis under unusual circumstances. SBC and the Union will discuss at the President's Council the best way to meet service and installation commitments and grow the Business. These SBC non-management employees shall be represented by CWA or eligible for card check recognition. All DSL customer service work associated with WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) shall be done by CWA-represented employees.
VoIP
To the extent that routers and servers go into the network owned by SBC, SBC shall assign that work to the CWA bargaining unit since they perform related work in the circuit world. VoIP is an evolution of the PSTN and comparable work performed today by CWA-represented employees shall be performed for VoIP technology. VoIP work in the network and at the premises will be performed under the DataComm contracts. As the work transitions from the circuit switched network, the current core technicians will transition with the work. The Company will make training available to enable their transition.
Customer Service
Tier 1 DSL customer service work is best performed bundled with other SBC services. CWA-represented employees will perform this work as well as all customer service work for all SBC services. This work shall include billing, selling and servicing. This includes Tier II customer service work. Currently, EchoStar employees will deal with TV and satellite service quality issues and other technical support issues.
The Union and SBC share similar views about utilizing SBC service reps to interface with the customer. CWA-represented employees shall do all customer service work of SBC products.
SBC-represented employees shall sell DSL (and other high-speed internet services), VoIP, long distance, and video and service SBC customer accounts which include these services.
40
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
The parties will discuss expanding outbound telemarketing jobs within the bargaining unit at the President's Council.
It is understood that the Company will continue to use sales agents and multiple sales channels, e.g., Radio Shack, Best Buy.
Global Services/DataComm
Global Services/Datacomm work done today by bargaining unit employees will continue per applicable CBA. SBC will not remove work from existing CWA bargaining units to non-represented worksites, centers, or contractors.
No bargaining unit employees currently performing Datacomm associated work as defined in the FCC OI&M order shall be laid-off.
SBC concurs that card check applies to non-management employees performing work within Global Services/Datacomm including Premier Care, Customer Care Centers, and Dedicated Support & Services.
Where there are mixed units of non-represented and represented DataComm employees, SBC shall be neutral in any accretion petition filed by the Union at the NLRB provided SBC concurs as to which bargaining agreement will be applicable to any accreted employees.
Tier 1 and 2 Customer Contact/Technical Support
Technical support work today is contracted work through Accenture. At the conclusion of the contract (without extension) SBC prefers that its employees perform this work. In order to facilitate moving this work to SBC employees, in 2006 SBC shall perform cost studies to determine the potential wage, benefits, and procedures to perform this work by SBC employees. It is the mutual goal of the parties to have this work performed by CWA represented employees. This will be discussed at the President’s Council. CWA represented employees shall do all Tier II customer contact/technical support work.
Buried Service Wire
In order for SBC to compete in buried service wire, it is in both parties’ interest to negotiate and reach an agreement which will make this business a success.
The Company and the Union agree that they will meet for the purposes of negotiating a nationwide collective bargaining agreement.
In the event the parties are unable to reach final agreement on any element of the collective bargaining agreement stated above, the disputed issues will be submitted to the Presidents Council for resolution. The Council, at its discretion, may submit the issues to a neutral third party for mediation.
Any and all Buried Service Wire work currently performed in any of the core bargaining units will continue to be performed by that unit under the terms and conditions of the relevant collective bargaining agreement.
41
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
Video
Any and all video work currently performed in any of the CWA bargaining units will continue to be performed by that unit under the terms and conditions of the relevant collective bargaining Agreement.
It is in both parties’ interest to negotiate and reach an agreement which will make this business a success. The parties recognize that this is a competitive business and that a competitive cost structure will be required to succeed.
SBC shall recognize the Union as the exclusive representative for all nonmanagement employees performing work associated with video provided the work is performed at an overall cost structure that is competitive.
Work required to be done by other companies through present or future partnerships or alliances with SBC will also continue to be done by such other companies if required by contract. Such work will transition to CWA-represented employees if permissible and the President’s Council shall review its progress.
Sunset Provision
This agreement supplemental agreement shall terminate at 11:59 PM on April 4, 2009.
Dispute Resolution on Jobs of the Future
If there is no mutual resolution of any dispute at the President’s Council, CWA shall have the right to enforce the terms of this agreement through any lawful means (other than the grievance or arbitration process), including, but not limited to recourse to the National Labor Relations Board, recourse to any court of competent jurisdiction, or a combination of any such actions.

CWA Local 1298 3055 Dixwell Avenue Hamden, CT 06518
Dear Dennis and Paul:
In making decisions regarding contracting of work consistently performed by bargaining unit employees, it is management’s objective to consider carefully the interests of both customers and employees along with all other considerations essential to the management of the business. For various reasons including but limited to law, regulations, changing industry structure, economic and business conditions, it is not possible to make specific commitments on contracting out work elements of the business.
You can be assured, it continues to be our general policy that traditional telephone work consistently performed by bargaining unit employees will not be contracted out if it will currently and directly cause layoffs or part-timing of employees. In this context, you can also be assured that the company will make every effort, consistent with the needs of the business, to use bargaining unit employees, rather than outside contractors, to perform bargaining unit telecommunications work expected to be of extended duration, including telecommunications work requiring application of new technologies.
However, prior notice of the decision to contract out such work will be provided in those cases in which it is anticipated that the contracting out is not of an occasional nature. As a part of such notice, information regarding the purpose, scope and expected duration of the work will be discussed along widt the reasons for the decision. At that time, the union will be given a full opportunity to discuss their views and review the impact that the decision may have on their members regarding such things as the availability of overtime. In addition, the company will update the union on the progress of the work and any circumstances that might require modification to the original plans and also, provide a semiannual report outlining the number of contract people currently employed in the above work functions.
We will agree that should disagreements arise out of the use of contract labor that by mutual agreement the parties may submit such disagreement for discussion to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, with the intent of reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution. Should this process fail in reaching an agreement, binding arbitration, in accordance with Article XXI of the Labor Contract, can be requested by either party.
Sincerely,
William H. Porter

AGREEMENT REGARDING MOVEMENT OF WORK FROM SNET (CONNECTICUT)
i1
Preamble
Since the merger in 1998 with SBC, the number of regular full time CWA workers at SNET has grown by 10.3% or more than 600 employees. This significant increase is the result of a business strategy focused on revenue growth and the ability to invest in resources to fuel that growth.
The Connecticut marketplace continues to present many opportunities for our business, and the Company remains committed to making the investments in Connecticut to capitalize on these opportunities. Key to the Company’s ability to make these investments is the ability to operate in an efficient manner, taking full advantage of the unique'strengths which exist in various parts of the thirteen state SBC wireline territory. While the Company remains committed to growth, it must retain the ability to organize its operations in the most efficient manner possible.
While the Company cannot make a commitment that no jobs will move from Connecticut, the Company will commit to meeting with the CWA in advance of any movement of jobs from Connecticut which result in an employee surplus. The purpose of the meeting would be to discuss the Company’s rationale for the move and to allow the Union to give input regarding the Company’s plans.

(a)	Currently employed and classified on the SNET payroll system as a regular full-time or part-time employee;
(b)	Currently employed as a Temporary employee (full or part-time);
(c)	On vacation or other approved absence with or without pay, or
(d)	Absent on account of illness or injury under either the Employees’ Benefit Plan or other approved basis.

1.03 Reserved for Future Use.
1.04 Part-Time Employee
A part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled to work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group working the same normal daily tour.
GENERAL
CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
1.	Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a part-time employee in Customer Service Centers, Bell Phone Booths (Kiosks), DM/DR (Direct Marketing/Direct Response) Centers and any equivalent retail sales or service centers operation, and any employee who is transferred to or employed by any new unregulated subsidiary or affiliated entity shall be paid at the equivalent basic hourly rate for a comparable full-time employee working a normal daily tour in the same job title, classification, and work group. Payment to a part-time employee for hours worked in excess of an equivalent normal daily tour or work week for a comparable full-time employee shall be at the applicable overtime rate for a comparable full-time employee based on such part-time employee’s basic hourly rate. Any regular employee who is on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and continuously thereafter, and who works part-time on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to be paid on the same basis as was applicable to such a part-time employee on December 31,1980.
2.	The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” which shall be determined prospectively by dividing the employee’s total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6, rounded to a “part-time equivalent work week” classification of 16).
3.	The “part-time equivalent work week” classification of each part-time employee shall be reviewed by the Company no less often than every six (6) months on April 1 and October 1 of each year and adjusted on a prospective basis, if appropriate. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked per month during the preceding six (6) month period. Any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
4.	For employees, who are hired on or after January 1, 1981, and who work as regular part-time employees, payments to a regular part-time employee for sickness benefits, accident benefits, or death benefits under the “SNET Pension Plan” and “Sickness and Accident Benefit Plan”, vacations, holidays, anticipated illness leave, sickness absence (not under the “Sickness and Accident Benefit Plan”), or termination allowance (or its equivalent) shall be pro-rated based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group. A part-time employee shall not be paid for absence due to sickness (not under the “Sickness and Accident Benefit Plan”) unless such absence due to sickness occurs on a
67
day bf the week on which the employee is normally scheduled to work. Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 19.80,and continuously thereafter, and who work part-time on or after January 1, 198) shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items, except holidays, listed above on the same basis as was applicable to a part-time employee on December 31, 1980. (For holiday pay treatment see Departmental Section 4.)
5.	Employees who are hired on or after January 1, 1981, and prior to April 1, 1995, and who work as part-time employees shall, if otherwise eligible to participate under the terms of such plans, be eligible for coverage under the Medical Plan, Dental Plan, and Vision Plan, as follows:
(a)	Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is sixteen (16) hours or less shall be eligible by enrollment and payment of 100% of the premiums for such coverage;
(b)	Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is seventeen (17) through twenty-four (24) hours shall be eligible by enrollment and payment of 50% of the premiums for such coverage;
I (c) Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is twenty-five (25) or more hours shall be eligible for such coverage on the । same basis as a regular full-time employee;
1	(d) Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as i of December 31,1980, and continuously thereafter shall continue to be eligible for such coverage on the same basis as a regular full-time employee regardless of classification.
6.	Effective March 31, 1995, employees hired or re-hired on or after that datejwho work part-time and less than 30 hours per week will be eligible for a percentage of the Company contribution for full time employees hired or rehired on or after March 31,1995. The amount of the Company contribution will vary based on actual hours, and calculated on a retrospective basis using a six month's average during a calendar year. For individuals on an approved, unpaid Leave of Absence (L.O.A.) the contribution level will be determined based on the six (6) months worked prior to the effective date of the L.O.A. The Company contribution will be towards the cost of individual coverage for medical, dental, and vision benefits. Individuals will be offered the opportunity to purchase coverage for eligible Class 1 dependents at group rates.

When a case warrants an extension of the trial period the employee and the Union shall be notified of such action. Individuals shall be released at any time during the trial period if found to be lacking in the proper qualifications.
3.02 (Reserved for Future Use)
3.03	(Reserved for Future Use)
3.04 Temporary Assignment to a Higher Maximum Wage Rate
Employees who are temporarily assigned to work for a full work day or longer on a title carrying a higher maximum wage rate shall be paid at the higher rate for the period of the assignment in accordance with General 3.11. All overtime hours will be paid at the appropriate overtime wage rate for their regular title.
3.05 Establishment of Wage Progression Schedules
Wage progression schedules shall be established for the various occupations which indicate the periods of time between each wage increase consideration and the amounts of the increases for regular full-time employees who are making the usual and satisfactory improvement in job performance.
3.06 Application of Wage Progression Schedules
(a)	General - The wage increases indicated in the wage progression schedules shall not be automatic, but the Company shall give consideration at the specified periods as to whether or not employees have merited increases.
GENERAL
(b)	Regular Full and Part-time Employees - Wage progression schedules are designed primarily for wage treatment for regular full-time employees but shall be used in determining wage treatment for regular and part-time employees eligible to such treatment by applying the provisions for bi-weekly starting rates, maxima, and amount of wage increases proportionately, e.g., an inexperienced employee engaged to work half-time, starts at one-half the minimum starting rate, and receives at the end of the first consideration period, one-half the weekly increase specified on the schedule at the end of this period. This employee progresses to one-half the maximum. On certain schedules increases are on an hourly basis and in such cases the same increase in rate per hour applies to part and full-time employees.
3.07 Awarding Increases
(a)	At such times and in such amounts as are indicated on the wage schedules, the Company shall increase the rates of pay of regular employees who progressively acquire additional job knowledge and demonstrate improved ability to perform work until the maximum for the occupation is attained.
(b)	Employees who demonstrate unusual and outstanding progress in their occupation shall receive an increase earlier than indicated in the schedule or in an amount larger than indicated, or both. In such cases, the length of the next consideration period shall be the period indicated in the schedule for the new wage level.
Note: See 3.11 for increases in connection with advancements.
3.08 Deferring Increases
(a)	When a continuous period of absence results from a sickness or accident, leave of absence or temporary layoff, the consideration period shall be extended as follows:
Number of Months in	Consideration Period
Consideration Period	Will Be Extended
Up to 6 Inclusive	By Time Lost Less One Month
In such cases, the extended period shall be shortened if the improvement in job performance by the employee has been greater than usual during that period.
(b)	When an employee’s performance or conduct does not warrant giving an increase in accordance with the consideration period indicated in the schedule, the increase shall be withheld and the employee shall be informed in advance of the reasons therefor. The increase shall be given as soon as the employee has adequately demonstrated consistently satisfactory improvement. In such cases, the length of the next consideration period shall be the period indicated on the schedule for that wage level. This period shall be shortened if the improvement in job performance by the employee has been greater than usual during that period.
77
GENERAL
(c)	When an employee with seniority service of two years or less has not merited a wage increase for two full consecutive consideration periods, the employee shall then either be transferred to other work for which qualified, if available, or dismissed after final notice has been given.
(d)	When an employee with more than two years of seniority service does not develop the ability to meet completely the requirements of an occupation but performs work assigned well enough to be retained, wage treatment appropriate to performance shall be granted but the employee shall not receive the maximum wage. If qualified to progress in other work, the employee shall be transferred if an opportunity becomes available.
3.0	9 Wage Reduction Other Than Transfer
The basic wage rate of an employee shall be subject to reduction for unsatisfactory performance of duty, unsatisfactory personal conduct or action which can be proven to be detrimental to the interests of the Company.
3.10	Transfer To An Occupation Having the Same Wage Maximum (See paragraph 3.13 for transfer due to disability)
(a) All regular employees transferred to other occupations having the same wage maximum shall be placed on the new wage schedule at the wage rate paid when transferred with full credit for the number of months at that rate.
3.11	Advancement to an Occupation Having a Higher Wage Maximum
(a)	All employees who are advanced to an occupation having a higher maximum will receive a promotional increase. The method of determining this increase will normally be in accordance with the following procedure:
(1)	Determine where the employee’s current pay falls on the wage progression guide of the job to which they are being advanced. The promotional increase is the amount shown as the next full step on the wage guide but not to exceed the maximum of the new job.
(b)	An employee may be accorded additional treatment to the above, depending upon the circumstances of the individual case.
78
GENERAL
3.12	Transfer To An Occupation Having A Lower Wage Maximum (See paragraph 3.13 for transfer due to disability)
(a)	For Reasons Other Than A Surplus Condition - When any employee is transferred to an occupation having a lower maximum for any reason other than a surplus condition, the case shall be treated on its merits and an appropriate adjustment may be made after a careful appraisal of the individual’s value in the new position.
(b)	Due To A Surplus Condition - When it is necessary because of a surplus condition to transfer an employee to another occupation, the Company will endeavor to make the transfer to an occupation with a maximum which is not below the employee’s basic wage rate. Where this can be done there shall be no reduction in the employee’s basic wage rate but the employee’s progress on the new wage schedule shall be appropriate to experience and value in the new occupation. When an employee is transferred to an occupation with a wage maximum lower than the employee’s basic wage rate, adjustments shall be made as follows:
(1)	Less Than 10 Years of Seniority Service - If the employee’s basic wage rate does not exceed the new wage maximum by more than the amount of the last step on the new wage schedule, a reduction to the new wage maximum shall be made four weeks after the transfer. However, if the employee’s basic wage rate exceeds the new wage maximum by more than the amount of the last step on the new wage schedule, the employee’s rate shall be reduced by the amount of this step four weeks after the transfer and thereafter by a like amount at the end of each six months until it coincides with the new wage maximum. Even though the last reduction to be made is less than the full step, it shall not be made until six months following the date of the previous reduction.
t
(2)	10 or More Years of Seniority Service - There will be no reduction in pay for an employee with ten (10) years or more of seniority net credited service for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the effective date of such downgrade. Thereafter adjustments shall be in accordance with (b)(1) above.
3.13	Transfers For Reasons of Disability
(a)	When it is necessary because of physical disability as indicated by medical authority to transfer any employee to another occupation, the Company will endeavor to make the transfer to an occupation with a maximum which is not below the employee’s basic wage rate.

If the employee returns to work and is absent again due to a disabling medical condition - whether related or not to a previous disabling medical condition -during the first 26 weeks after returning to work, the employee will be eligible only for the period of disability benefits remaining under the original 52 week period.
(c)	Illness Other Benefits (1OB)
Payments may be available for medically-required time off duty associated with a part-time return to work following an absence due to extended illness of at least three months duration. If approved, 1OB payments may be payable for time not worked based on the employee’s eligibility for full or half pay disability benefits. Such disability payments will be counted towards usage of 52 weeks of Sickness and Accident Disability Benefit payments.
(d)	Special Sickness Disability Benefits
Payments may be available when it is anticipated that a full-time employee will be totally disabled in the near future (such as for scheduled surgery or delivery of a baby) and must work on a part-time basis because of a temporary and partial disability. If approved, special sickness disability benefit payments may be payable for time not worked based on the employee’s eligibility for full or half pay disability benefits.

Forty hours or thirty-seven and one-half as appropriate, divided normally into five tours for any five days of the week, shall constitute a basic work week for these forces. However, in order to secure adequate coverage over the entire week to safeguard the service under normal conditions, it is necessary to arrange the hours of work for certain occupations in fixed basic work weeks covering more than five days of the week, but such basic work weeks shall not be for more than forty, or thirty-seven and one-half hours, as appropriate, nor shall any tour of such basic work weeks be for less than four or three and one-half hours respectively.
(b)	Scheduling and Assigning Basic Work Weeks
(1)	Cable Splicing, Equipment and Switching Systems Forces - In order that the necessity of adequate coverage may be met as uniformly as possible in all cases, basic work weeks are established for all equipment, switching systems and cable splicing forces, based on the requirements of the business.
Equipment and switching systems force basic work weeks vary with exchanges and are set up on charts, Form 1969, showing the days of the week and the hours of the day comprising each basic work week to be applied in each exchange. Basic work weeks for cable splicing forces are set up on a chart, Form 2022.
135
(2)	For equipment and switching systems forces the local supervisor shall designate the basic work week to be worked. For cable splicing forces the immediate splicing supervisor shall designate the basic work weeks to be worked. Twice each year the supervisors responsible shall prepare a schedule of basic work weeks assignments for the ensuing six months for each labor group under their direction. In the preparation of schedules and the assignment of basic work weeks to employees, careful consideration shall be given to individual preference which is consistent with work requirements and agreeable to the employee group involved, as well as to the following:
(a)	The provision of coverage as required, including Saturdays, Sundays, Company-recognized holidays and vacations without resorting to overtime.
(b)	The provision of a sufficient force to care for peak workloads with a minimum of overtime.
(c)	Work Schedules
(C)	(1) Basic work week schedules will be developed by each work
group utilizing historical and forecasted data to determine coverage requirements.

Voluntary trick study teams may be used to develop the work schedule to meet the coverage requirements that have been determined by management. Historical and forecasted data will be made available to the Vice Presidents Plant-CWA Local 1298 as soon as practical.
(a)	For each six (6) month period, employees in the work group will select, by seniority, a fixed work schedule, which may include Alternative Work Schedules (AWS), or they will be assigned to a fixed work week schedule by inverse seniority; or
(b)	The majority of the employees in the work group will decide on one of the following two (2) coverage options:

Policies and Procedures
Part 1
TRANSFER PLAN
TRANSFER PLAN
I.	General
A.	This Transfer Plan specifies procedures to be followed in the handling of bargaining unit advancements, laterals and downgrades to jobs in the same or different departments within the Company and its subsidiaries. An advancement is considered to be a move to another bargaining unit job title with a higher maximum basic rate of pay than the employee's present job. A lateral move is a move to the same job atle in a new location or a different job title with the same maximum basic rate of pt /. A downgrade is a move to another job with a lower maximum basic rate of pay.
B.	Em iloyees shall be informed of all bargaining unit jobs within the Company, the quali: cations required for these jobs, and how to request and process transfers.
C.	1. All employees may make requests for consideration to any bargaining unit job i: any location provided they have met minimum residency* on their present title and location and have not been moved at their own request. The maximun number of requests on file by any employee is ten (10).
2.	Employees will be permitted to submit Transfer Requests for a specific title in a < efined geographical area or statewide basis. Each such request will count as one ret uest, not multiple requests. However, if any employee is the successful candidate for a vacancy on that title and refuses the opportunity, then that geographical area or statewide request is removed for that title in accordance with Paragraph V.A.3. Further, no request for that title at any specific location will be accepted in accordance with the provisions in V.A.3.
3.	Title to title location changes may be requested prior to fulfilling the residency requirement. The minimum length of time on location is twelve (12) months for a sixteen (16) month residency requirement, and fourteen (14) months for a twerty-eight (28) month residency requirement. For purposes of this section only, movement between the title Service Representative (BO 1245) and the title Service Representative - Spanish Center (BO 1271) shall be considered as “title to title” locaiion changes and shall be subject to the residency provisions of this paragraph.
* Residency is sixteen (16) or twenty-eight (28) months depending on Job Classification in Appendix A.
4.	Upgrade request(s) on file will be considered after six (6) months for employees who have met the residency requirement for that title and subsequently changed location title to title. New requests will be considered after 12 months.
230
TRANSFER PLAN
D.	There shall be a 1-week “posting” of open vacancies for all Company-defined entities, except for SNET Cellular, Inc., in the Transfer Bureau process. This “posting” period will allow additional bargaining unit employees to submit transfer requests for open jobs before candidate lists are drawn by the Transfer Bureau to fill the vacancies. The “posting” period will run from Wednesday to Wednesday on a weekly basis. Key process elements of this “posting” process will be as follows:
1.	On Wednesday of each week (late afternoon) the Transfer Bureau will “post” the job vacancies received over the previous seven days (since the prior Wednesday) on a dial-in, toll-free, Job Posting number.
2.	Jobs will be “posted” for one calendar week - until noon of the following Wednesday.
3.	Employees may call in to the dial-in, toll-free, Job Posting number during the week and may submit transfer requests, through supervision, for “posted” open positions.
4.	Employee transfer requests for “posted” jobs will be accepted by the Transfer Bureau up until noon on Wednesday.
5.	Each Wednesday evening the Transfer Bureau will draw candidate lists for all of the vacancies “posted” for the prior week. The candidate lists will be comprised of transfer requests already on file and employee transfer requests for “posted” jobs submitted by Noon of that day (Wednesday).
6.	The dial-in, toll-free, Job Posting number replaces the current job listing and fax works.
7.	Responsibility to stay current on “posted” jobs will rest with the employee (there will be no other postings of these vacancies).
8.	Transfer requests submitted for “posted jobs” will be counted towards the contractual limit of ten that the employee may have “active” in the Transfer Bureau at any one time.
9.	Employees will be responsible for securing supervisory approval for Transfer requests submitted for “posted jobs”.
10.	If supervisory approval is not available during the mandated timeframes, the employee may directly submit the Transfer Request form (F. 1904) to the Transfer Bureau and must provide his or her supervisor with a copy of the submitted Transfer Request form. The Transfer Bureau will accept these “unsigned” Transfer requests from employees, subject to verification of supervisory approval of the requests via receipt of supervisor-signed form. All other normal Transfer Bureau rules will remain in place (e.g., residency, seniority, qualifications, selection procedures, etc.).

PROCEDURES FOR REINSTATING EMPLOYEES RETURNING FROM MILITARY OR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE LEAVES
I.	Company Policy
As has been previously stated, the Company intends to live up to and beyond the spirit of legislation covering the reinstatement of employees returning from the service. It expects to reinstate, after honorable discharge, all employees who want to return to the Company and who are able to resume their old jobs or similar work, regardless of their length of service before induction.
Provisions will be made to expedite adjustments to the job, including retraining, and special arrangements for physical readjustment. In line with Company policy, consideration will be given so far as practicable to the value of usable military or Public Health Service experience in determining future treatment and placement. Each returned employee is entitled after reinstatement to benefits under the Benefit Plans in accordance with credited service under the terms of the Memorandum Relating to Reinstatement.
An interdepartmental committee will coordinate the general procedures involved in reinstatement.
Detailed procedures covering the return of employees will be developed by the various departments.
II.	Planning for the Return of Employees by Departments
Through the use of the forecasts of business, planned construction, and force requirements, plans will be developed and kept current by the departments for the placement of employees returning from military or Public Health Service, and for reassignment of those active employees affected by the return of veterans.
III.	Reinstatement
A.	Initial Contact
It is expected that returning employees will contact their supervisor upon their release from the services. The opportunity should be provided for a welcome by the employees' ranking departmental supervisor in the locality and by fellow employees. Supervisors should take the initiative, if necessary, to get in touch with employees, when it is known that they have been discharged from military or Public Health Service.
246
MILITARY/PUB. HEALTH SVC.
B.	Physical Examination
Physical examinations will be required of all employees returning from military or Public Health Service leaves of absence in order to insure that they may be assigned properly. The appointment for the physical examination should be made through the Medical Office at the time employees apply for reinstatement.
C.	The Reinstatement Interview
The reinstatement interview will be carried out 1) to secure pertinent information from the employee, and 2) to inform the employee of the general policies and plans of the Company as well as specific information in regard to reinstatement.
1.	Information to be secured - such as:
Date employee wishes to return to work
General physical condition
2.	Information to be discussed with the employee - such as:
General policy in regard to reinstatement
Employee's status upon reinstatement Review of Company payroll allotment plans, income tax, etc.
3.	Method of Conducting the Interview
The interview should be conducted in an unhurried atmosphere so that the employee will have the opportunity to tell of past experience and express plans for the future. In some cases the interview may be completed at one meeting with the employee but often it may require more than one.
4.	Time of Reinstatement
Whenever possible, the date of return to work should be planned to suit the wishes of the employee. If this should be prior to the receipt of a report from the physical examination, the employee should be given a temporary assignment. If there is any question in the supervisor's mind as to the assignment, the case should be discussed with the departmental personnel representative who will check, as necessary, with the Medical Department.
D.	Job Placement
1.	All placements should be made in conformance with the policy of the Company as stated in the Memorandum Relating to Reinstatement.
247
MILITARY/PUB. HEALTH SVC.
2.	The objectives in placement will be best accomplished through careful attention to such factors as (a) the individual's past experience, (b) experience in military or Public Health Service, (c) the force requirements of the business, (d) Selective Service Act requirements, (e) interest and abilities, (f) physical condition.
3.	In the event a circumstance arises in which there is no immediate suitable job for an employee, the case should be referred for further consideration through the lines of organization.
E.	Particular Consideration of Disabled Employees
1.	Treatment of totally incapacitated employees
In accordance with the Memorandum Relating to Reinstatement, Section IV, Treatment Under the Benefit Plans, employees totally incapacitated and unable to work may be eligible to sickness benefits under the terms of the Sickness and Accident Disability Plan. Supervisors will aid those who return unable to work due to injury or illness through recognizing the circumstances promptly and initiating action under the Sickness and Accident Disability Plan, through careful placement and training upon their recovery and return to the job, and through a personal interest in their progress.
2.	Placement of partially disabled employees
It is recognized that some employees may return partially disabled and unable to perform the duties of the job which they left. In this event, the objective will be to place these employees in a job which they can adequately perform and which is not hazardous to themselves or fellow employees.
3.	Training of partially disabled employees
In some instances of partial disability, special training should be planned on the job or through Company facilities. In other instances training may be most advantageously secured through the government's facilities or those of public agencies. Each case will present different circumstances and will require individual analysis and treatment.
4.	Follow-up of partially disabled employees
A plan for a "follow-up" in such cases should be designed to check the suitability of the placement from the viewpoint of the employee's health and safety, interest in and success on the job, and possibilities for progress.
248
MILITARY/PUB. HEALTH SVC.
F.	Records
1.	Central Military or Public Health Service records
A central record of the military or Public Health Service and experience of our employees will be established and maintained in the Personnel Relations Department, to be available to all departments as a complete record of military or Public Health Service information, and to serve as a history of the experience of our employees in World War 11, Korea and Vietnam and a record of their treatment on their return.
2.	Military Service Record Card, Form 605
The Military Service Record Card, Form 605, should contain such information as the employee's status at the time of entry into military or Public Health Service, etc.
IV.	Training or Returning Employees
A.	Reinduction
Reinduction of employees should be planned in order that they will be able to bridge the gap in Company affairs between their departure and return. Typical information should include a short history of Company experience during the war, a review of organization and personnel changes, the experience of other employees during the war, and an opportunity to meet and talk with personnel in the locality.
B.	Job Training
In addition to regular Company training courses for employees assigned to new jobs, refresher courses should be designed for employees who return to the same job after a long absence.
C.	Specialized training for handicapped employees
Specialized training may be necessary and should be arranged in some cases involving the adjustment to handicaps.
V.	Follow-Up
All supervisors should be alert to observe the returned employee's adjustment to the work situation as well as civilian life. If difficulty is being experienced by the employee in making an adjustment, an analysis of the facts in the situation by the supervisor will be helpful in determining how best to aid the employee.
249
MILITARY/PUB. HEALTH SVC.
VI	Clearing House of Information
Assistance should be offered to returning employees concerning such matters as government insurance, educational benefits, etc. The Personnel Relations Department will set up a clearing house of such information which will be available through the Personnel Coordinator. Contacts with government agencies generally should be made through the Personnel Relations Department.
