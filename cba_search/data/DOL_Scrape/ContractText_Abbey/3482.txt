ARTICLE 4-TERM OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.
(a)	This Agreement shall become effective on July 1, 2009, or such later date as it receives full acceptance by the Parties, and expires June 30, 2011, except where specifically stated otherwise in the Agreement.

Section 2.	This Agreement shall not be opened during the term of this Agreement except by mutual agreement of the Parties, by proper use of Article 7-Separability, or as otherwise specified in this Agreement.
ARTICLE 5-COMPLETE AGREEMENT/PAST PRACTICES
Section 1.	Complete Agreement. Pursuant to their statutory obligations to bargain in good faith, the Employer and the Union have met in full and free discussion concerning matters in “employment relations” as defined by ORS 243.650(7). This Contract incorporates the sole and complete agreement between the Employer and the Union resulting from these negotiations. The Union agrees that the Employer has no further obligation during the term of this Agreement to bargain wages, hours, or working conditions except as specified below. The Employer agrees that during the term of this Agreement it may not unilaterally change employee wages or hours. “Working conditions” established by a specific provision of this Agreement may not be unilaterally changed. Other “working conditions” not covered by this Agreement may only be changed pursuant to the restrictions and procedures in Section 2.
Section 2.	Past Practices.
(a)	The Parties recognize the Employer’s full right to direct the work force and to issue work orders and rules and that these rights are diminished only by the law and this Agreement, including arbitrator’s awards which may evolve pursuant to this Agreement, or for temporary employees, decisions resulting from dispute resolution procedures which may evolve pursuant to this Agreement.
(b)
(1)	The Employer may change or issue new work practices or rules covering permissive subjects of bargaining, including issuing administrative rules over issues which are nonnegotiable and are not in conflict with or otherwise addressed in a specific provision of this Agreement. The Employer agrees to bargain over any proposed changes in “working conditions” or their impact which are mandatory subjects of bargaining.
(2)	If the Employer believes the change is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the Parties shall meet within ten (10) days of the Union's request to meet. One (1) Union Steward from the affected Agency will be allowed to use Agency time without loss of pay or benefits to participate in these negotiations. The Employer will not be liable for any overtime, premium pay, travel reimbursement, or mileage for the Union Steward. If the Union Steward is a temporary employee, while employed, the temporary employee would be unscheduled.
(3)	The Union may file an unfair labor practice complaint with the Employment Relations Board if the Employer refuses to bargain. If the Board rules that the change is a permissive or prohibited subject of bargaining, the Union shall withdraw its demand to bargain. If the Board determines the change is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the Parties shall meet to negotiate this subject change.
(4)	Notwithstanding ORS 243.698, if after ninety (90) days of bargaining, the Parties do not reach agreement, either Party may exercise its right to utilize the dispute resolution procedures under the PECBA, including the strike-permitted employees' right to strike (notwithstanding Article 8 of this Agreement), or, for strike-prohibited employees, the right to submit the matter to binding arbitration. Nothing precludes the
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
2
Parties from requesting mediation within the ninety (90) day period.
ARTICLE 6-LEGISLATIVE ACTION
Section 1.	Provisions of this Agreement not requiring legislative funding or statutory changes before they can be put into effect shall be implemented on the effective date of this Agreement or the date otherwise specified in this Agreement. Necessary bills for implementation of the other provisions shall be submitted promptly by the Department of Administrative Services to the Legislative Assembly and both Parties shall jointly recommend passage of the funding and statutory changes.
Section 2.	Should the Legislature not be in session at the time agreement is reached, the funding provisions of this Agreement shall be promptly submitted to the Emergency Board by the Department of Administrative Services and both Parties shall jointly recommend passage.
Section 3.	Should the Legislature not be in session at the time agreement is reached, all other legislation necessary for the implementation of this Agreement shall be submitted to the next session (whether regular or special) of the Legislative Assembly.
ARTICLE 7-SEPARABILITY
In the event that any provision of this Agreement is at any time declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, declared invalid by final Employment Relations Board (ERB) order, made illegal through enactment of federal or state law or through government regulations having the full force and effect of law, such action shall not invalidate the entire Agreement, it being the express intent of the Parties hereto that all other provisions not invalidated shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidated provision shall be subject to renegotiation by the Parties within a reasonable period of time from such request.
ARTICLE 8--NO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT
The Employer agrees that during the term of this Agreement, the Employer shall not cause or permit any lockout of employees from their work. In the event an employee is unable to perform his/her assigned duties because equipment or facilities are not available due to a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown by any other employees, such inability to provide work shall not be deemed a lockout.
During the term of this Agreement, the Union shall neither cause nor counsel the members of the bargaining unit to strike, walk out, slowdown, or commit other acts of work stoppage.
Upon notification confirmed in writing by the Department or Agency to the Union that certain bargaining unit employees covered by this Agreement are engaging in strike activity in violation of this Article, the Union shall, upon receipt of a mailing list, advise such striking employees in writing with a copy to the Department of Administrative Services and the affected Department and Agency, to return to work immediately. Such notification by the Union shall not constitute an admission that it has caused or counseled such strike activity. The notification by the Union to employees covered by this Agreement shall be made at the request of the Department of Administrative Services.
ARTICLE 9-MANAGEMENT’S RIGHTS
Except as may be specifically modified by the terms of this Agreement, the Employer shall retain all rights of management in the direction of their work force. Rights of management shall include, but not be limited to, the right to:
(a)	Direct employees.
(b)	Hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees.
(c)	Suspend, discharge, or take other proper disciplinary action against employees.
(d)	Reassign employees.
(e)	Relieve employees from duty because of lack of work or other reasons.
(f)	Schedule work.
(g)	Determine methods, means, and personnel by which operations are to be conducted.
ARTICLE 10—UNION RIGHTS
Section 1.	Riqhts/Obliqations.
(a)	The Union and the Employer agree that there must be mutual respect for the rights and obligations of the Union and the Employer and the representatives of each.
(b)	Employees covered by the Agreement are at all times entitled to act through a Union representative in taking any grievance action or following any alternate procedure under this Agreement.
(c)	Once a bargaining unit member files a grievance, the employee shall not be required to discuss the subject matter of the grievance without the presence of the Union representative if the employee elects to be represented by the Union.
Section 2.	The provisions of this Article and Articles 10.1 through 10.5 cover temporary employees. However, pay status provisions of this Article and Articles 10.1 through 10.5 shall not apply to temporary employees; instead temporary employees will be unscheduled rather than being in pay status or on paid or unpaid leaves for authorized activities. Such activities shall attempt to be scheduled during the temporary employee Steward’s nonwork hours.
Section 3.	Union Organizer Visitations. Union Organizers, with approval from a responsible manager, shall be allowed reasonable contact with bargaining unit members on Agency facilities. The purpose of these visits will be to meet with Union Stewards, with employees, or management regarding any actions or procedures under this Contract, including but not limited to, employee grievances per Article 21-Grievance and Arbitration Procedure. The Union Organizer will have the right to contact any represented employee in their workplace, as long as it does not interfere with the normal flow of work (e.g., lunch hour, break, before and after workshifts). The Union agrees to provide the Agency and the Department of Administrative Services Labor Relations Unit with a list of authorized representatives.
Section 4.	Building Use. Agency facilities may be used for Union activities according to current building use policies, so long as the facility is available and proper scheduling has been arranged.
Section 5.
(a)	Bulletin Boards. The Agency shall allow the use of reasonable bulletin board space for communicating with employees. Union material shall not be displayed
3
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
in the work area except in the designated bulletin board space.
(b)	E-Mail Messaging System. Union representatives and SEIU-represented employees may use an Agency’s e-mail messaging system to communicate about Union business provided that all of the following conditions are followed:
(1)	Use shall not contain false, unlawful, offensive or derogatory statements against any person, organization or group of persons. Statements shall not contain profanity, vulgarity, sexual content, character slurs, threats or threats of violence. The content of the e-mail shall not contain rude or hostile references to race, marital status, age, gender, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, national origin, health or disability.
(2)	Except as modified by this Article, an Agency shall have the right to control its e-mail system, its uses or information.
(3)	The Agency reserves the right to trace, review, audit, access, intercept, recover or monitor use of its e-mail system without notice.
(4)	Use of the e-mail system will not adversely affect the use of or hinder the performance of an Agency’s computer system for Agency business.
(5)	E-mail messages sent simultaneously to more than five (5) people shall be no more than approximately one (1) page and in plain or rich text format. Such group e-mails shall not include attachments or contain graphics (except for the Union logo). Recipients of such group e-mails shall not use the “Reply AH” function.
(6)	E-mail usage shall comply with Agency policies applicable to all users such as protection of confidential information and security of equipment.
(7)	The Agency will not incur any additional costs for e-mail usage including printing.
(8)	The Union will hold the Employer and Agency harmless against any lawsuits, claims, complaints or other legal or administrative actions where action is taken against the Union or its agents (including Union staff, Union officers and Stewards) regarding any communications or effect of any communications that are a direct result of use of e-mail under this Article.
(9)	Such e-mail communications shall only be between SEIU-represented employees and managers, within their respective Agency, and the Union. However, for purposes of negotiations, bargaining team members may communicate across Agencies. Additionally, DAS recognized joint multi-Agency Labor-Management Committee members and the Union’s Board of Directors may communicate across Agencies. The Union shall provide the names of its Board of Directors to DAS.
(10)	Use of Agency’s e-mail system shall be on employee’s non-work time.
(11)	E-mail communication may include links to the Union website, which may be accessed on non-work time.
(12)	Nothing shall prohibit an employee from forwarding an e-mail message to his/her home computer.
(13)	E-mail shall not be used to lobby, solicit, recruit, persuade for or against any political candidate, ballot measure, legislative bill or law, or to initiate or
coordinate strikes, walkouts, work stoppages, or activities that violate the Contract.

ARTICLE 13—CONTRACTING-OUT
Section 1.	The Union recognizes that the Employer has the management right, during the term of this Agreement, to decide to contract out work performed by bargaining unit members.

2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
10
contracting-out the work in question. The Employer agrees to notify the Union within one (1) week of its decision to conduct a formal feasibility study, indicating the job classifications and work areas affected. The Employer shall provide the Union with no less than thirty (30) days notice that it intends to request bids or proposals to contract out bargaining unit work where the decision would result in displacement of bargaining unit members. During this thirty (30) day period, the Employer shall not request any bids or proposals and the Union shall have the opportunity to submit an alternate proposal. The notification by the Employer to the Union of the results of the feasibility study will include all pertinent information upon which the Employer based its decision to contract out the work including, but not limited to, the total cost savings the Employer anticipates.
Feasibility studies will not be required when: (1) an emergency situation exists as defined in ORS 279A.010(1 )(f), and (2) either the work in question cannot be done by available bargaining unit employees or necessary equipment is not readily available.
Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Employer from continually analyzing its operation for the purpose of identifying cost-saving opportunities.
Section 2.	If the Union’s proposal would result in providing quality and savings equal to or greater than that identified in the management plan, the Parties will agree in writing to implement the Union proposal.
Section 3.	Should any full-time bargaining unit member become displaced as a result of contracting-out, the Employer and the Union shall meet to discuss the effect on bargaining unit members. The Employer’s obligation to discuss the effect of such contracting does not obligate it to secure the agreement of the Union or to exhaust the dispute resolution procedure of ORS 243.712, 243.722, or 243.742, concerning the decision or the impact.
“Displaced” as used in this Article means when the work an employee is performing is contracted to another entity outside state government and the employee is removed from his/her job.
Section 4.	Once an Agency makes a decision to contract out, it will either:
(a)	Require the contractor to hire employees displaced by the contract at the same rate of pay for a minimum of six (6) months subject only to “just cause” terminations. In this instance, the State will continue to provide each such employee with six (6) months of health and dental insurance coverage through the Public Employee Benefits Board, if continuation ofcoverage under the Bargaining Unit Benefits Board is allowed by law and pertinent rules of eligibility. Pursuant to Article 70, Sections 10 through 12, an eligible employee shall be placed on the Agency layoff list and may, at the employee’s discretion, be placed on a secondary recall list for a period of two (2) years; or
(b)	Place employees displaced by a contract elsewhere in state government in the following order of priority: within the Agency, within the department, or within state service generally. Salaries of employees placed in lower classifications will be red-circled. To the extent this Article conflicts with Article 45—Filling of Vacancies, this Article shall prevail.
(c)	An employee may exercise all applicable rights under Article 70--Layoff, including prioritizing options (1), (2), (3) or (4), as described in Article 70 Section 2, if the
employee finds option (a) or (b), as selected by the Employer, is unsatisfactory. The employee must select his/her Article 70 Section 2 options within five (5) calendar days pursuant to notification of (a) or (b) above.
Section 5.	The following provisions govern the administration of the requirement under this Article to conduct feasibility studies in cases of contracting-out and will supplement the provisions included in the contract as well as the Parties’ June 10, 1998 unfair labor practice settlement involving the Department of Transportation: (a) The Employer agrees to notify Agency heads, personnel	managers	and	purchasing	and/or
contracting staff of SEIU Local 503, OPEU-represented Agencies	concerning	their	obligations when
contracting-out work performed by bargaining unit employees. Key items include that all state Agencies will conduct a feasibility study in instances of contracting-out work performed by bargaining unit employees, whether or not such contracting-out will result in displacement of bargaining unit employees. And, as specified below, certain information will be provided to SEIU Local 503, OPEU as a part of the feasibility study Agencies are required to complete.
(b)	The Employer will provide the individuals identified in Section 5(a) above with the form in Appendix H for their use in conducting feasibility studies pursuant to Article 13. Agencies will use this form in completing feasibility studies pursuant to Article 13. However, Agencies may develop and use other forms appropriate to the work being contracted, provided that there is no substantive change to the information to be reported pursuant to Article 13 as contained in Sections F-K of Appendix H.
(c)	The Parties agree that SEIU Local 503, OPEU-represented Agencies will send directly to SEIU Local 503, OPEU’s Executive Director all future notices of intent to conduct a feasibility study under Article 13, and any related feasibility studies.

Psychologist Examiners, Board of Radiologic Technology, Board of Massage Therapists, Occupational Therapy Licensing Board, Board of Examiners for Speech Pathology & Audiology, Board of Naturopathic Medicine, Education, Water Resources, Library, Treasury, Commission for the Blind, Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), Special Schools, State Fair, State Scholarship, Department of Administrative Services, Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB), Oregon Health Licensing Agency, Oregon Housing & Community Services (OHCS). Section 2. The Union agrees, as a prior condition to the release of employees from work, to notify the Employer in writing of its members designated as representatives for negotiations.
(a)	Central Table. The Employer agrees to grant leave with pay for up to eight (8) employees, except for temporary employees, at a central bargaining table to represent the Union for actual negotiating table time including caucuses, negotiation work sessions, and a reasonable number of membership meetings relating to negotiations. However, there shall be no more than one (1) employee representative from each Agency, except for Agencies which have two thousand, five-hundred (2,500) or more bargaining unit members which may have up to two (2) representatives, provided they are not from a single work location. Negotiations at the Central Table will take place during normal business hours.
(b)	Coalition Tables. Coalition negotiations will take place after normal business hours. For Coalition negotiations, the Employer agrees to unschedule, or grant paid time as outlined below, for up to a total of twenty-four (24) employees designated as employee bargaining team representatives, except temporary employees, but no more than eight (8) employees per coalition table. The designated employee bargaining team representative will be granted up to twenty-four (24) non-cumulative hours each month of paid time for up to one-hundred and fifty (150) calendar days for attendance at negotiations, including travel time, provided coalition bargaining sessions and/or travel time occur during an employee's regular work schedule. However, the one-hundred and fifty (150) calendar days will begin no later than February 15 or the closest business day thereto. The inclusion of paid time will not result in the employee receiving greater benefit than the employee would have received had the employee not attended the bargaining session. Should it become necessary for the Employer to replace or unschedule an employee scheduled for swing or graveyard shift so as to permit that employee to participate in collective bargaining negotiations, the Union agrees alternatively as follows:
(1)	Six (6) workdays notice shall be given by the Union to the Employer so as to allow the Employer to avoid payment of penalty pay for the schedule change of the replacement employee; or
(2)	If the Union does not give notice prescribed in (1) above, the Union shall reimburse the Employer for the penalty pay paid to the replacing employee.
Section 3.	The Employer is not responsible for travel, per diem, overtime, or other benefits beyond that which the employee would have received had the employee not attended bargaining sessions.
Section 4.	Subject in each case to prior approval by the Agency, the Employer further agrees to grant leave without pay to additional employees determined necessary by the Union to attend negotiating sessions.
Section 5.	Ratification. It is understood that all tentative agreements at the table are subject to ratification by both Parties.

Section 5.	Grievances shall be processed as follows:
TIME TO FILE: Thirty (30) calendar days for initial filing	
PLACE TO FILE	TYPE OF GRIEVANCE
AGENCY HEAD (Step 2)	•	Article 20-Discipline/Discharge •	Article 22-Discrimination •	Article 81-Reclass Down •	Article 21, Section 4 -Group Grievances involving multiple supervisors in one Agency •	Family Medical Leave (FMLA/OFLA)
DAS, LABOR RELATIONS UNIT (LRU) (Step 3)	• Article 21, Section 4-Group Grievances involving multiple Agencies
MANAGEMENT/ EXECUTIVE SERVICE SUPERVISOR (Step 1)	• All other grievances/contract violations
See Appendix F for detailed table on grievance filing.
Step 1. The grievant(s), with or without Union representation, shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, file the grievance except as otherwise noted to his/her management/executive service supervisor*. Upon request of either Party, the Parties will meet to discuss the grievance. The supervisor shall respond in writing to the grievant(s) within fifteen (15) calendar days from the receipt of the grievance. In all cases, the grievant and his/her management/executive service supervisor will attempt to meet within the thirty (30) calendar day filing period in an attempt to resolve the grievance at the lowest possible level of management. Failure to meet will not invalidate the grievance.
All Step 1 grievance settlements are non-precedential and shall not be cited by either Party or their agents or members in any arbitration or fact-finding proceedings now or in the future. Step 1 grievance settlements shall be reduced to writing and signed by the grievant and management/ executive service supervisor. Actions taken pursuant to Step 1 settlement agreements shall not be deemed to establish or change practices under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including but not limited to Article 5, or ORS Chapter 243, and shall not give rise to any bargaining or other consequential obligations.
*	ln ODOT (Highway), this is the District Maintenance Supervisor; in OPRD, this is the District Park Manager; or, in either case, the equivalent Program Manager; and in Forestry, this is the District Forester or Program Director. In the State-owned Airports Branch of ODOA, this is the State Airports Manager. In the Statewide Services Branch of ODOA, this is the Agency Head. In ODFW, grievances filed at Step 1 are to be filed with the Division Administrator
or Regional Manager, whichever is appropriate for that work unit.
Step 2. When the response at Step 1 does not resolve the grievance, the grievance must be filed by the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Step 1 response is due or received. The appeal shall be filed in writing to the Agency Head or his/her designee, who shall respond in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days (thirty (30) calendar days for discipline) after receipt of the Step 2 appeal. Upon request of either Party, the Parties will meet to discuss the grievance.
‘Agency Head” as used in this Section shall normally mean the appointed or elected executive head of the Agency, except as follows:
•	Health-Related Licensing Boards—Chief Administrative Officer
•	DHS Institutions—Institution or Facility Superintendent
•	ODOT—Chief of Human Resources or designee
•	OPRD—Parks Director or designee
•	Forestry—State Forester or designee
•	ODFW—Agency Director or designee
Step 3. Failing to settle the grievance in accordance with Step 2, the appeal, if pursued, must be filed by the Union and received by the Labor Relations Unit of the Department of Administrative Services within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Step 2 response is due or received. The Labor Relations Unit shall respond in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the Step 3 appeal. At this step the Parties agree that a face-to-face meeting (or the equivalent by phone) will occur between the Union and Labor Relations Unit. If the Union wishes to pursue a grievance involving only temporary employees beyond Step 3, the issue must first be submitted to grievance mediation. The request to initiate mediation shall be submitted by the Union to the Labor Relations Unit within fifteen (15) days of the Step 3 response.
Step 4. Grievances which are not satisfactorily resolved at Step 3 may be appealed to arbitration. If the Union intends to appeal to arbitration, the appeal must be received by the Labor Relations Unit of the Department of Administrative Services within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Step 3 response was due or received. If the Union has filed a notice of intent to arbitrate a grievance but has not requested selection of an arbitrator within two (2) months of such notice, LRU may require that an arbitrator be selected and a hearing date agreed upon. In this situation, a letter from the Union requesting an arbitrator shall be sent within fifteen (15) days of such request by LRU or the grievance will be deemed withdrawn.
Section 6.	Arbitration Selection and Authority.
(a)	Arbitrations between the Parties shall be presented to one of the following arbitrators:
1.	Gary L. Axon

Section 6.	Leadwork Differential.
(a)	Leadwork differential shall be defined as a differential for employees who have been formally assigned by their supervisor in writing, “leadwork" duties for ten (10) consecutive calendar days or longer provided the leadwork or team leader duties are not included in the classification specification for the employee’s position. Leadwork is where, on a recurring daily basis, the employee has been directed to perform substantially all of the following functions: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish
21
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance to standards; and provide informal assessment of workers’ performance to the supervisor.
(b)	The differential shall be five percent (5%) beginning from the first day the duties were formally assigned in writing for the full period of the assignment.
(c)	Leadwork differential shall not be computed at the rate of time and one-half (1 16) for the time worked in an overtime or holiday work situation, or to effect a “pyramiding" of work out-of-classification payments. However, leadwork differential shall be included in calculation of the overtime rate of pay.
(d)	Leadwork differential shall not apply for voluntary training and development purposes which are mutually agreed to in writing between the supervisor and the employee.
(e)	If an employee believes that he/she is performing the duties that meet the criteria in Subsection (a), leadworker, but the duties have not been formally assigned in writing, the employee may notify the Agency Head in writing. The Agency will review the duties within fifteen (15) calendar days of the notification. If the Agency determines that leadwork duties were in fact assigned and are appropriate, the leadwork differential will be effective beginning with the day the employee notified the Agency Head of the issue.
If the Agency determines that the leadwork duties were in fact assigned but should not be continued, the Agency may remove the duties during the fifteen (15) day review period with no penalty.
If the Agency concludes that the duties are not leadwork, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the employee's notification to the Agency Head.
Section 7.	Leadwork Differential. Employment Department.
(a)	Leadwork differential will be paid to employees who are formally assigned in writing to perform leadwork provided the leadwork or team leader duties are not included in the classification specification for the employee’s position. Leadwork is where an employee has been formally assigned to do substantially all of the following: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance to standards; and provide informal assessment of workers’ performance to the supervisor.
(b)	The differential shall be five percent (5%) beginning from the first day the duties were formally assigned in writing.
(c)	If an employee receives more than one (1) differential (except overtime as mandated by the FLSA), the differentials will be calculated on the base so that no “pyramiding” occurs (i.e., if an employee is receiving the leadworker differential and an out-of-classification differential, the two (2) differentials would be calculated separately and then added on to the base pay).
(d)	Leadwork differential shall not apply for voluntary training and development purposes which are mutually
agreed to in writing between the supervisor and the employee.
(e)	If an employee believes that he/she is performing the duties of a leadworker but the duties have not been formally assigned in writing, he/she may submit the matter for resolution as per the dispute resolution process, or through the grievance procedure (as for example, classification review, work out-of-class).
Section 8.	Leadwork Differential. ODOT Highway Division, TMS1, TMS2 and Transportation Operations Specialist.
(a)	Leadwork differential shall be defined as a differential for employees who have been formally assigned by their supervisor "leadwork" duties for five (5) days or longer in a calendar month; or five (5) consecutive calendar days or longer that span the end of one (1) month and the beginning of the next month. In no case shall days be counted twice to meet the leadwork pay qualification.
(b)	Leadwork is where, on a recurring daily basis, while performing essentially the same duties as the workers led, the employee has been directed to perform substantially all of the following functions: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance of standards and provide informal assessment of workers’ performance to the supervisor.
Section 9.	Leadwork Differential. State Library.
(a)	Team Coordinator differential shall be defined as a differential for employees who have been formally assigned in writing “team coordinator” responsibilities for a specific team on a recurring daily basis, for a designated length of time that extends beyond ten (10) consecutive calendar days.
(b)	Team Coordinator responsibilities shall include substantially the following roles: monitor team progress in meeting performance goals; coordinate team workflow to accomplish the work efficiently; coordinate team development processes; identify, plan, and approve training; assist in hiring of new team members, orient new employees; review team member timesheets; give feedback to team members concerning work procedures; and serve as communication liaison between the team and management.
(c)	The Team Coordinator differential shall be five percent (5%) beginning from the first day the duties were formally assigned in writing for the full period of the assignment.
(d)	If an employee receives more than one (1) differential (except overtime as mandated by the FLSA), the differentials will be calculated on the base so that no “pyramiding” occurs (i.e., if an employee is receiving the Team Coordinator differential and an out-of-classification differential, the two (2) differentials would be calculated separately and then added on to the base pay).
Section 10,	Work Out-of-Classification.
(a)	When an employee is assigned for a limited period to perform the duties of a position at a higher level classification for more than ten (10) consecutive calendar days, the employee shall be paid five percent
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
22
(5%) above the employee's base rate of pay or the first step of the higher salary range, whichever is greater.
When assignments are made to work out-ofclassification for more than ten (10) consecutive calendar days, the employee shall be compensated for all hours worked beginning from the first day of the assignment for the full period of the assignment.
When an employee is assigned to work out-of-classification pending approval of a reclassification upward, the employee will be paid at the next higher rate of pay or first step of the higher salary range, whichever is greater.
(b)	An employee performing duties out-of-classification for training or developmental purposes shall be informed in writing of the purpose and length of the assignment during which there shall be no extra pay for the work. A copy of the notice shall be placed in the employee’s file.
(c)	An employee who is underfilling a position shall be informed in writing that he/she is an underfill, the reasons for the underfill, and the requirements necessary for the employee to qualify for reclassification to the allocated level. Upon gaining regular status and meeting the requirements for the allocated level of the position, the employee shall be reclassified.
(d)	Assignments of work out-of-classification shall not be made in a manner which will subvert or circumvent the administration of this Article.
Section 11.	Work Out-of-Classification. ODOT.
(a)	Transportation Maintenance Specialists. In addition to any entitlement to work out-of-classification pay pursuant to Section 10 of this Article, Transportation Maintenance Specialist 1’s who perform snow removal and sanding for more than twenty (20) hours in a workweek, shall be paid at what would be the next higher salary step.
(b)	Self-Managed Crews. Where the Agency utilizes selfmanaged work crews, crew members, including positional leaders, may not be entitled to work out-of-classification payments at the supervisory level unless they assume a majority of duties specific to that classification.
(See Letters of Agreement in Appendix A.)

such equipment will receive a differential of five dollars ($5.00) per hour or any fraction thereof, for actual diving time.
ARTICLE 27-SALARY INCREASE
For purposes of contract administration, see Letter of Agreement that affects employees who have Salary Eligibility Dates and who are not at the top step of their pay ranges.
Section 1. Public Employees Retirement System (“PERS”) Members. For purposes of this Section 1, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on August 28, 2003 and who is eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Retirement Contributions. On behalf of employees, the State will continue to “pick up” the six percent (6%) employee contribution, payable pursuant to the law. The Parties acknowledge that various challenges have been filed that contest the lawfulness, including the constitutionality, of various aspects of PERS reform legislation enacted by the 2003 Legislative Assembly, including Chapters 67 (HB 2003) and 68 (HB 2004) of Oregon Laws 2003 (“PERS Litigation”). Nothing in this agreement shall constitute a waiver of any Party's rights, claims or defenses with respect to the PERS Litigation. Section 2. Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan Pension Program Members. For purposes of this Section 2, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on or after August 29, 2003 and who is not eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 733.
Contributions to Individual Account Programs. As of the date that an employee becomes a member of the Individual Account Program established by Section 29 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, and pursuant to Section 3 of that same Chapter, the State will pay an amount equal to six percent (6%) of the employee’s monthly salary, not to be deducted from the salary, as the employee’s contribution to the employee's account in that program. The full amount of the contributions paid by the Employer on behalf of employees, pursuant to the Agreement shall be considered as “salary" within the meaning of ORS 238.005(20) for purposes of computing an employee member’s “final average salary” within the meaning or ORS 238.005(8), but shall not be considered to be “salary” for the purposes of determining the amount of employee contributions required to be contributed pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Section 3.	Effects of Changes in Law (other than PERS Litigation). In the event that the State’s payment of a six percent (6%) employee contribution under Section 1 or under Section 2, as applicable, must be discontinued due to a change in law, valid ballot measure, constitutional amendment, or a final, non-appealable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction (other than in the PERS Litigation), the State shall increase by six percent (6%) the base salary rates for each classification in the salary schedules in lieu of the six percent (6%) pick-up. This transition shall be done in a manner to assure continuous payment of either the six percent (6%) contribution or a six percent (6%) salary increase.
For the reasons indicated above, or by mutual agreement, if the State ceases paying the applicable six
23
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
percent (6%) pickup and instead provides a salary increase for eligible bargaining unit employees during the term of the Agreement, and bargaining unit employees are able, under then-existing law, to make their own six percent (6%) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program account, as applicable, such employees’ contributions shall be treated as “pre-tax” contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Section 414(h)(2).
Section 4.	Compensation Plan for Non-Strikeable Unit.
The Parties agree to maintain a separate wage compensation plan for SEIU Local 503, OPEU-represented employees in the non-strikeable unit, including employees at Oregon State Hospital in positions designated as security, with the representation code of OXN or OXS. (See Appendix D.)

ARTICLE 29-SALARY ADMINISTRATION
For purposes of contract administration, see Letter of Agreement that affects employees who have Salary Eligibility Dates and who are not at the top step of their pay ranges.
Section 1, Pay.
(a)	Pay for employees in the bargaining unit shall be in accordance with the Compensation Plan adopted by the Department of Administrative Services and approved by the Governor as modified by this Agreement. No changes shall be made in the Compensation Plan which affect SEIU Local 503, OPEU bargaining unit employees unless the Parties to this Agreement have negotiated the changes and reached agreement on what changes will be made. This is not intended to prevent mechanical changes or other minor changes necessary to administer the Compensation Plan.
(b)	All employees shall be paid no later than the first day of the month. However, employees who begin work after payroll cutoff will be paid in the subsequent midmonth payroll for time worked in the affected pay period. When a payday occurs on Monday through Friday, payroll checks shall be released to employees on that day. When payday falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, employee paychecks shall be made available after 8:00 a.m. on the last working day of the month. When an employee is not scheduled to work on the payday, the paycheck may be released prior to payday if the paycheck is available and the employee has completed the “Request for Release of Payroll Check" Form AD20. However, the employee may not cash or deposit the check prior to the normal release time. Any violation of this provision may be cause for disciplinary action. All checks released early under this Article shall be accompanied by written notice from the Employer as to the normal release time and date for that employee and a statement that early cashing or depositing of the check may be cause for disciplinary action. However, this shall not apply to appropriate mid-month payroll. The release day for December paychecks dated January 1 shall be the first working day in January to avoid the risk of December’s paychecks being included in the prior year’s earnings for tax purposes.
(c)	Employees shall be paid no less than the minimum rate of pay for their classification upon appointment to a position in state service. An entrance salary rate may exceed the minimum rate when the Appointing Authority believes it is in the best interest of the State to do so.
(d)	Release of sixty percent (60%) of an employee’s earned gross wages prior to the employee’s designated payday shall be authorized subject to approval of the Appointing Authority, in emergency
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
24
cases upon receipt of a written request from the employee that describes the emergency. An emergency situation shall be defined as an unusual, unforeseen event or condition that requires immediate financial attention by an employee. Emergencies include but are not limited to the following circumstances:
1.	Death in family
2.	Major car repair
3.	Theft of funds
4.	Automobile accident (loss of vehicle use)
5.	Accident or sickness
6.	Destruction or major damage to home
7.	New employee lack of funds (maximum-one (1) draw)
8.	Moving due to transfer or promotion.
Section 2.	Submission of Salary Increases.
Recommendations for salary increases must be made to be effective on the first day of the month and must be submitted prior to the proposed effective date. However, retroactive six (6) month and annual salary increases to correct errors or oversights and retroactive payments resulting from grievance settlements shall be authorized. The proposed effective date for retroactive six (6) month and annual salary increases must be the first day of the month no more than twelve (12) months prior to the time of submitting the correcting recommendation.
Section 3.	Performance Increase. Salary administration shall be based upon a performance-based system. Employees shall be granted an annual performance pay increase on their eligibility date if the employee is not at the top of the salary range of their classification, and provided the employee’s performance has not been deficient. Employees who do not receive an annual performance pay increase shall receive timely notice of deficient performance or conduct during the evaluation period. Employees shall receive a notice related to the deficiencies as they are noted prior to the completion of the performance evaluation period. “Timely” shall be a reasonable amount of time, taking into consideration the specific alleged deficient performance. Such notice shall provide the employee with adequate opportunity to correct the problem prior to the end of the evaluation period.
Employees shall be eligible for performance increases at the first of the month following the intervals of:
(a)	Annual periods after the initial date of hire until the employee has reached the top step in his/her salary range. However, should an employee be promoted during the first year of service with the Employer, the employee shall not receive this increase, but shall be eligible for increases in Section 3(b).
(b)	The first six (6) months after promotion and annual periods thereafter until the employee has reached the top step in his/her salary range.
Performance-based pay shall use the following criteria:
(1)	Classification specifications developed and promulgated by the Employer.
(2)	An individual position description reduced to writing.
(3)	Written memoranda including letters of instruction, when necessary. Work plans where used will not be accepted as a substitute for notice of deficiency.
(4)	Disciplinary action.
The above criteria shall be the primary factors upon which an employee’s performance is judged and upon
which annual performance pay decisions are determined. Section 4, Salary on Demotion. Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range that has a salary rate the same as the previous salary step, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at that step in the lower range.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a salary range which does not have corresponding salary steps with the employee's previous salary but is within the new salary range, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the employee’s next eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one (1) full step within the new salary range plus that amount that their current salary rate is below the next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.
Whenever employees demote to a job classification in a lower range, but their previous salary is above the highest step for that range, the employee shall be paid at the highest step in the new salary range.
This Section shall not apply to demotions resulting from official disciplinary actions.
Section 5.	Salary on Promotion.
(a)	An employee shall be given no less than an increase to the next higher rate in the new salary range effective on the date of promotion.
If an employee is demoted or removed during trial service as a result of a promotion, his/her salary shall be reduced to the former step, and the previous salary eligibility date shall be restored.
If the employee’s salary eligibility date occurs during the promotional trial service period, upon reinstatement to the previous class, the salary eligibility date prior to promotion will be recognized.
(b)	Salary on Recall from Demotion in Lieu of Layoff. Upon recall to his/her former classification, an employee demoted in lieu of layoff shall retain his/her previous salary eligibility date and, as of the date of recall, be restored at the salary the employee would have been eligible for had a demotion not occurred, unless the employee is denied the increase as a disciplinary action.
Section 6.	Salary on Lateral Transfer. An employee’s salary shall remain the same, except where the Appointing Authority or designee determines that exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate, when transferring from one (1) position to another which has the same salary range.
Section 7.	Effect of Break-In-Service. When an employee separates from state service and subsequently returns to state service, except as a temporary employee, the employee's salary eligibility date shall be determined by the Agency as follows:
(a)	Return from Recall List. The employee’s previous salary eligibility date, adjusted by the amount of breakin-service, shall be restored.
(b)	Return from Reemployment. The employee's previous salary eligibility date, adjusted by the amount of break-in-service, shall represent the earliest salary eligibility date following return. However, the salary eligibility date may be established as the first of the month in any future month up to twelve (12) months from the date of reemployment.
25
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
Section 8.	Rate of Pay on Appointment from Layoff List. When an individual is appointed from a layoff list to a position in the same classification in which the person was previously employed, the person shall be paid at the same salary step at which such employee was being paid at the time of layoff. The salary eligibility date of an individual who is appointed from a layoff list shall be determined in accordance with Section 7.
Section 9.
(a)	Rate of Pay on Return to State Service by Reemployment. When a former employee is appointed from reemployment to a position in the same classification in which he/she was previously employed or in a related classification with the same salary range, he/she may be paid at or below the step at which he/she was being paid at the time of his/her termination. If a person is reemployed in a position in a classification with a lower salary range than that of his/her previous position, he/she may be paid at any step in the lower salary range not exceeding the rate he/she was being paid in the higher classification, except where exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate. The salary eligibility date of a former employee who is appointed from reemployment shall be determined in accordance with Section 7.
(b)	Rate of Pay on Reemployment Without a Break-In-Service.
(1)	When a current employee is returning from demotion to a position in the same classification in which he/she was previously employed or in a related classification with the same salary range, the employee shall be restored at the salary step the employee would have been eligible for had a demotion not occurred, not to exceed the top step.
(2)	When a person is reemployed in a position in a classification with a lower salary range than that of his/her previous position as referenced in Subsection (b)(1), the employee may be paid at any step in that lower salary range not to exceed the top step or the rate he/she would have received pursuant to Subsection (b)(1). However, if an employee’s current rate of pay is below the top step of the lower classification’s salary range, she/he retains that rate unless the employee is eligible to receive a higher rate pursuant to Subsection (b)(1) or (b)(4) not to exceed the top step.
(3)	In both instances, the former salary eligibility date (SED) is restored unless the SED is changed in compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement (e.g., Article 61, Leave Without Pay).
(4)	Pay of a higher rate, not to exceed the top step, may be granted subject to exceptional circumstances, upon approval of the appointing authority.
Section 10.	Recoupment of Wage and Benefit Overpayments.
(a)	In the event that an employee receives wages or benefits from the Agency to which the employee is not entitled, regardless of whether the employee knew or should have known of the overpayment, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment which will include information supporting that an overpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid.
(b)	The Agency shall be limited in using the payroll deduction process to a maximum period of three (3) years before the notification. An employee who disagrees with the Agency’s determination that an overpayment has been made to the employee may grieve the determination through the grievance procedure.
(c)	For purposes of recovering overpayments of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, notice will be provided on the employee paystub.
(d)	For purposes of recovering overpayments of more than fifty dollars ($50.00) by payroll deduction, the following shall apply:
(1)	The employee and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty (30) calendar days following written notification.
(2)	If there is no mutual agreement at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Agency shall implement the repayment schedule stated in Subsection (d)(3) below.
(3)	If the overpayment amount to be repaid is more than five percent (5%) of the employee’s regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly amounts not exceeding five percent (5%) of the employee’s regular base salary. If an overpayment is less than five percent (5%) of the employee's regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in a lump sum deduction from the employee’s paycheck. If an employee leaves Agency service before the Agency fully recovers the overpayment, the remaining amount may be deducted from the employee's final check(s).
(4)	Subsections (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this Section shall not apply to payroll adjustments necessitated by a discrepancy between actual hours of paid time versus hours projected for payroll purposes from one pay period to another. For example, if an employee utilizes leave without pay near the end of a month but is paid for such time because such leave without pay was not anticipated at the payroll cutoff date for that month, the employee’s pay and benefit entitlements may be adjusted on the following month’s paycheck.
However, under limited conditions (listed below) an exception to lump sum recoupment of wage overpayments greater than five percent (5%), as a result of leave without pay, shall apply. In these cases, an employee may request a repayment schedule not to exceed three (3) months:
(A)	When entries are made by a person authorized by the Agency to complete a timesheet on behalf of an absent employee which results in overpayment.
(B)	When entries on the timesheet made by an employee were correct, but the timesheet data was incorrectly input by the Agency which results in an overpayment.
(5)	The Article does not waive the Agency’s right to pursue other legal procedures and processes to recoup an overpayment made to an employee at any time.

Section 1.	Employer Contribution.
(a)	An Employer contribution for health and dental benefits will only be made for each active employee who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month and who is eligible for medical insurance coyerage.
(b)	It is understood that the administrative intent of this Article is that the Employer contribution is made for individuals who are participants in the medical insurance coverages. Participation will mean that eligible less-than-full-time employees who drop out of coverage will be considered to participate. Additionally, employees who elect to opt out of coverage for a cash incentive will be considered to participate.
Section 2.	Full-Time Employees.
(a)	An Employer contribution shall be made for full-time employees who have at least eighty (80) paid regular

hours in a month.
Effective January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, the Employer shall make a contribution sufficient to cover the premium costs for the PEBB health, dental and basic life benefits chosen by each eligible full-time employee who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month.
For plan year January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010, the Employer will increase its monthly contributions by up to five percent (5%) of the actual monthly composite resulting for plan year 2009.
For plan year January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the Employer will increase its monthly contributions by up to five percent (5%) of the actual monthly composite resulting for plan year 2010.
If in either or both of the plan years described above, the premium increase is greater than five percent (5%), the Parties shall jointly petition the Public Employees Benefit Board to use reserve funding to pay for premium increases in excess of five percent (5%) up to a maximum often percent (10%) in each year.
(b)	The Parties agree to jointly petition the PEBB to continue to do as follows: Employees who live in counties where the PEBB considers there to be an insufficient number of preferred primary care providers within the PPO network will receive the same level of benefits when they use a non-preferred primary care provider as they would using a preferred primary care provider.
Section 3.	Less-Than-Full-Time Employees.
(a)	For less-than-full-time employees (including part-time, seasonal, and intermittent employees), who have at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in the month, the Employer shall contribute a prorated amount of the contribution for full-time employees. This prorated contribution shall be based on the ratio of paid regular hours to full-time hours to the nearest full percent, except that less-than-full-time employees who have at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month shall receive no less than one-half (%) of the contribution for full-time employees.
(b)	The following administrative procedures shall be used for the calculation of Employer health plan contributions for less-than-full-time employees, under this Section.
(1)	“Regular hours” means all hours of work or paid leave except overtime hours, i.e., those above eight (8) hours in a day or forty (40) hours in a week. Thus, “regular hours” shall include additional non-overtime hours worked above an employee’s regular work schedule.
(2)	The formulas to be used for calculating the Employer’s prorated health plan contribution shall be those provided in Article 30-Payroll Computation Procedures.
(3)	In the event that a less-than-full-time employee, who is regularly scheduled to work half-time or more, fails to maintain at least half-time paid regular hours because of the effect of prorated holiday time or other paid or unpaid time off, he/she shall be allowed to use available vacation or comp time to maintain his/her eligibility for benefits and the Employer’s contribution for such benefits.
Section 4.	Coordination of Benefits. The Public Employee Benefits Board (PEBB) may adopt any of the effect-on-benefit alternatives described in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) 1985 model acts and regulations, or any subsequent alternatives promulgated by the NAIC.
Section 5.	Administration. Agencies will continue to pay employee insurance premiums directly to the appropriate insurance carriers and remit balances either to the employees’ flex benefit account or to PEBB, as directed by PEBB.
Section 6.	The State ceases to have a proprietary interest in its own contributions to the benefit plan premium when it pays such funds to the carrier or to persons who have an irrevocable duty to transfer such payments to the carriers when due.

ARTICLE 32-OVERTIME
Section 1. Definition of Time Worked. All time for which an employee is compensated at the regular straight time rate of pay, except on-call time and penalty payment(s) (Articles 34 and 40) but including holiday time off, compensatory time off, and other paid leave, shall be counted as time worked. Holidays which fall on an employee’s scheduled day off shall not count as time worked toward computation of overtime. (See Letter of Agreement regarding sick leave exclusion in Appendix A.) Section 2. Overtime Work Definition. Overtime for employees working a regular work schedule is time worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per workweek. Overtime for employees working an alternate work schedule is time in excess of the daily scheduled shift or forty (40) hours per workweek. Overtime for employees working a flexible work schedule is time in excess of the agreed upon hours each day or time in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek. Time worked beyond regular schedules by employees scheduled for less than eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per workweek is additional straight time worked rather than overtime until the hours worked exceed eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per workweek. In a split shift, the time an employee works in a day after twelve (12) hours from the time the employee initially reports for work is overtime. For purposes of this Article, time worked includes telephone calls made to an employee or by an employee after his/her workshift for work-related purposes.
Paid sick leave shall not be counted as time worked for the purposes of overtime calculation, except that paid sick leave used shall be counted toward overtime calculation if the employee is mandated to work on a regularly scheduled day off.
Notwithstanding the foregoing eligibility criteria, in cases where the application of reporting time changes or a “penalty” payment is appropriate, the rate of compensation shall be the straight time hourly rate of pay.
Section 3.	Compensation. All employees shall be compensated for overtime at the rates set out in Section 4. No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide for compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half (1 %), or to effect a “pyramiding” of overtime and penalty payments.

•	6214 Institution RN
•	6255 Nurse Practitioner
(See Letter of Agreement regarding procedure for determining overtime exempt or non-exempt status in Appendix A.) Such time and one-half (1 14) compensation shall be in the form of cash or compensatory time, pursuant to Articles 32.1-32.5.
In Agencies where there is no contractual limitation on the accumulation of compensatory time the Employer may:
(1)	schedule unilaterally up to forty (40) hours of unused compensatory time per employee per fiscal year, after prior notice of at least five (5) working days to the affected employees; and/or
(2)	pay off in cash some or all of an employee's unused compensatory time once per fiscal year.
(b)	Straight Time Eligible Positions. Employees in positions, except as identified in Section 4 above, which have been determined to be executive, administrative, or professional as defined by the FLSA and ORS 653.269(5)(a) shall receive time off for authorized time worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week at the rate of one (1) hour off for one (1) hour of overtime worked subject to limitations of Articles 32.1-32.5. (See Letter of Agreement in Appendix A.)
This time off shall be utilized within the fiscal year earned or shall be lost, except when the scheduling has been extended by the Agency or as otherwise specified below. At ninety (90) days prior to loss of such compensatory time, employees shall be notified that they must use or lose the hours. Time earned in the last ninety (90) days may, at the discretion of management, be carried forward into the next fiscal year. However, such carry forward may not increase the total compensatory time that may be accrued in that year. If time off requests are denied for use of accrued leave before the year ends, these accrued hours will be paid in cash upon forfeiture. Employees will take all necessary steps to request use of compensatory time during the fiscal year.
(c)	No overtime is to be worked without the prior authorization of management.
Section 5.	Schedule Change. When a change of work schedule is requested by an employee and approved by the Agency, all forms of penalty pay shall be waived by the employee. When a change of work schedule is requested by an employee and approved by the Agency, overtime compensation for that workday, but not for work over forty (40) hours per week, associated with the changed schedule shall be waived.
Section 6.	Record. A record of all overtime worked shall be maintained by the Agency.

Section 3.	Compensation. All non-exempt employees shall be compensated for overtime at time and one-half (1 Vz) of their regular hourly rate. No overtime is to be worked without the prior authorization of management.
Section 4,	No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half (1 '/z), or to effect a “pyramiding” of overtime and penalty payments.

ARTICLE 32.1-OVERTIME (Human Services Coalition) Section 1. Distribution of Overtime. Overtime shall be distributed as equally as feasible among qualified employees customarily performing the kind of work required, and currently assigned to the work unit in which the overtime is to be worked. Overtime will be assigned to volunteers according to seniority, the most senior having priority. If there are not sufficient volunteers to meet the Agency’s needs, mandatory overtime will be assigned according to inverse seniority. Seniority and volunteers notwithstanding, special qualifications or case handling continuity will be given first consideration in the assignment of overtime.
Section 2. Notice of Overtime. The Agency shall give as much notice as possible of overtime to be worked. No overtime is to be worked without the prior authorization of management except in emergent situations necessary to effect Agency services.
Section 3, Payment of Overtime. Payment of overtime shall be included in the payroll paid on the first of the month following the pay period in which overtime is worked if the overtime is reported prior to the payroll cut-off date. All eligible employees who work overtime shall be compensated for authorized overtime, either in the form of cash or compensatory time off to be determined by the employee. In the event budgetary or staffing limitations exist, in fact, and the Agency so notifies the employee in writing of the fact, with a copy to the Union, the Agency may designate the form of overtime compensation. Compensatory time accrued by employee choice may accumulate to a maximum of one-hundred twenty (120) hours. Compensatory time may be paid off quarterly at the option of the Employer.
Section 4.	Overtime Break. When an employee is required to work overtime two (2) or more hours beyond the end of the shift, he/she, at the employee’s discretion, may take a fifteen (15) minute paid break before beginning the overtime shift.
Section 5.	Subject to the operating requirements of the Agency, the employee may take accrued compensatory time off for overtime earned following approval by his/her supervisor. If the Agency is unable to schedule time off, the Agency shall pay cash for the balance of the unused compensatory time. If two (2) or more employees request the same time off, and the matter cannot be resolved by agreement of the employees concerned, the employee having the greatest length of continuous service with the Agency shall be granted time off. This option shall only be

(2)	When a transfer of a specific employee is necessary for training, deficient performance, discipline, or because of special qualifications, management shall inform the employee in writing of the reason for the transfer ten (10) days in advance.

employee may request in advance, in cases of illness, to use other paid leave. The Employer may grant such requests and may require that the employee provide verification from an attending physician of such continuous and extended illness. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.
Section 4.	Restoration of Sick Leave Credit Employees who have been separated from state service and return to a position (except as temporary employees) within two (2) years shall have unused sick leave credits accrued during previous employment restored.
Section 5.	Transfer of Accruals. An employee shall have all of his/her accrued sick leave credits transferred when the employee is transferred to a different state Agency.
Section 6.	Workers’ Compensation Payment. Sick leave resulting from a condition incurred on the job and also covered by Workers’ Compensation, shall, if elected to be used by the employee, be used to equal the difference between the Workers’ Compensation for lost time and the employee’s regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued sick leave. Should an employee who has exhausted earned sick leave elect to use accrued leave during a period in which Workers' Compensation is being received, the salary paid for such period shall be equal to the difference between the Workers’ Compensation for lost time and the employee’s regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued leave.
No employee shall be required to utilize leave while receiving time loss benefits.
Section 7, Assumption of Sick Leave. Whenever an Agency of the State assumes control over the functions of a local government Agency within the State of Oregon, such state Agency may assume the unused sick leave that was accrued by an employee of the local government Agency during employment therewith, provided the employee accepts an appointment, without a break-in-service, to that Agency. Should the monthly sick leave accrual rate of the local government Agency be greater than that of the state Agency, the maximum amount of sick leave assumable by the state Agency shall be computed on the basis of the following formula:
Monthly Accrual Rate of State Agency Monthly Accrual Rate of Local Agency
Sick Leave	Maximum
x Balance of Local = Sick Leave Agency	Assumable
Should the monthly sick leave accrual rate of the local government Agency be less than that of the state Agency, the maximum amount of sick leave assumable by the state Agency shall be the amount of unused sick leave accrued during employment with the local government Agency.
Section 8.	Hardship Leave.
These provisions shall apply for the purpose of allowing employees to donate accrued vacation leaves and compensatory time for use by eligible recipients as sick leave. Agencies will allow employees to make donations of accumulated compensatory time or vacation leave, not to exceed the hours necessary to cover for the qualifying absence as provided in paragraph (d), to a coworker in that Agency or different Agency. To donate to a specific employee in a different Agency, the employee (donor) must submit a written request to his/her appointing
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
56
authority/designee. Such donation is subject to approval by both the donor’s and recipient’s appointing authority/designee. For purposes of this Agreement, hardship leave donations will be administered under the following stipulations and the terms of this Agreement shall be strictly enforced with no exceptions.
(a)	The recipient and donor must be regular employees.
(b)	The Employer shall not assume any tax liabilities that would otherwise accrue to the employee.
(c)	Use of donated leave shall be consistent with those provisions found under Article 56, Section 2.
(d)	Applications for hardship leave shall be in writing and sent to the Agency’s Personnel Section and accompanied by the treating physician/practitioner’s written statement certifying that the illness or injury will continue for at least fifteen (15) days following donee’s projected exhausting of the accumulated leave and the total leave is at least thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of absence in combination of paid and unpaid leave. Donated leave may be used intermittently for the same event after the employee has satisfied the eligibility requirements to receive donated leave.
(e)	Donations shall be credited at the recipient’s current regular hourly rate of pay. Donations shall be used to reimburse the Agency for insurance contributions made pursuant to Article 31, unless health insurance payments are mandated under the Family Medical Leave Act.
(f)	Accumulated leave includes but is not limited to sick, vacation, personal, and compensatory leave accruals.
(g)	Employees otherwise eligible for or receiving workers’ compensation, or on parental leave will not be considered eligible to receive donations under this agreement.
Section 9.	Oregon Family and Medical Leave Act (OFLA) and Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Paid leave is to be used in conjunction with the FMLA or OFLA consistent with the leave provisions of this Article and other leave provisions of this Agreement. As long as the employee's compensatory time balance does not exceed forty (40) hours, an employee may retain up to forty (40) hours of vacation leave for use upon returning to work as long as the combined total of compensatory time and vacation hours do not exceed forty (40) hours. Designation to retain the leave shall be made in writing within five (5) business days of the beginning of the qualifying leave. In no instance shall an Agency restore leave or recoup pay as the result of such designation. Once the designation has been made and approved and the employee is on leave without pay status, that status will continue for the duration of the leave. Such employees are not eligible to receive hardship leave donations.
For purposes of applicability of the FMLA and OFLA, administration of the state and federal regulations includes: (a) The “FMLA and OFLA year” is considered to be a twelve (12) month period rolling backward for each employee.
(b)	The Employer’s determination of FMLA or OFLA eligibility may require medical certification that the leave is needed due to a FMLA or OFLA qualifying condition of the employee or that of a member of the family. At an Agency’s expense, a second opinion may be requested.
For employees covered by the FMLA/OFLA, the Employer can request certification earlier when
permitted by FMLA/OFLA.
Where there is a conflict between FMLA and OFLA, the more generous provisions will apply.
(c)	Any grievance alleging a violation of FMLA or OFLA will be submitted in writing within thirty (30) days of the date the grievant or the Union knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of the alleged grievance, directly to the Agency Head or designee. The Agency Head shall respond within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the grievance. All unresolved grievances may be submitted by the grievant or the Union to BOLI or the Department of Labor, whichever is appropriate.

ARTICLE 56.1C-SICK LEAVE
(Employment Department)
All employees of the Employment Department will be allowed to transfer accumulated vacation leave to a coworker who has exhausted all accumulated leaves.
Eligibility to receive and use donated leave will be the same as that used for Sick Leave under Article 56-Utilization of Sick Leave with Pay, Section 2.
The vacation leave hours donated will be converted to sick leave for use by the receiving employee. The hours of leave donated will be converted into an hourly rate and then applied to the donee’s account at their hourly rate, e.g., an employee who earns twenty dollars ($20.00) per hour by donating one (1) day of leave to an employee who earns ten dollars ($10.00) an hour will have donated two (2) days of sick leave to the donee employee. The reverse also applies; if an employee earning ten dollars ($10.00) per hour donates one (1) day of leave to an employee earning twenty dollars ($20.00) per hour, one-half (%) day of leave will be transferred to the donee employee.
The Labor-Management Committee will monitor leave use.

Section 15.	Military Donated Leave. The Parties acknowledge that the State of Oregon administers a donated leave program to supplement military wages.

(d)	An employee notified of a pending layoff shall have one (1) opportunity to prioritize the following options and communicate such choice(s) in writing to the Agency within seven (7) calendar days from the date the employee is notified in writing. If the date the employee’s response is due falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the employee will provide his/her choice to the Agency on the next business day. However, this seven (7) day notice will not be required if the employee is involved in a meeting to make such choice as long as seniority has been posted prior to this seven (7) day notice as specified in Section 2(a).
(1)	The employee may displace the employee in the Agency with the lowest seniority in the same classification for which he/she is qualified in the same geographic area in the Agency where the layoff occurs.
(2)	If no positions are accessible under option one (1), the employee may displace the employee in the Agency with the lowest seniority in the same geographic area in any classification with the same salary range in which the employee previously held regular status, including any predecessor classification; or, if this choice is not available to the employee, the employee may move into vacant positions in classifications with the same salary range that the Agency intends to fill in the same geographic area.
(3)	The employee may identify and prioritize up to three (3) classifications in lower salary ranges for which he/she is qualified within the Agency and same geographic area. The employee may demote to the lowest seniority position in one of the identified classifications considered in the order listed by the employee, pursuant to this Section. Employees who elect to demote shall be placed on any geographic area layoff list of his/her choice within the Agency for the classification from which he/she demoted.
(4)	The employee may elect to be laid off. An employee who elects to be laid off shall be placed on any geographic area layoff list of his/her choice within the Agency for the classification from which he/she was laid off.
The options provided by Subsections 2(d)(1), (2) and (3) above shall apply to regular status (i.e., nonlimited duration) employees displacing limited duration employees only when the limited duration positions are expected to continue for at least ninety (90) days beyond the time of layoff.
For purposes of bumping under Section 2(d)(1), (2) and (3), a vacant position that management intends to fill is considered to have the least seniority.
(e)	To be qualified for the options under Section 2(d)(1), (2) and (3), the employee must meet the minimum qualifications for the position’s classification and must be capable of performing the specific requirements of the position within a reasonable period of time. A reasonable period of time is defined as approximately thirty (30) calendar days. If an employee meets the minimum qualifications but is not capable of performing the specific requirements of the lowest seniority position, he/she may displace or demote to the next lowest seniority position in the classification, provided that the incumbent in the next lowest position has a lower seniority than the employee displacing or demoting.
(f)	When exercising an option under Section 2(d)(1), (2)
and (3), an employee shall only be eligible to displace another employee with lower seniority.
(g)	When an employee is laid off because of being separated from state service per Section 2(d)(4) of this Article, moving expenses will be paid once by the Agency. In other words, moving expenses will be reimbursed only when that employee has in fact, left State service and is called back from the layoff list to a geographic area other than the one in which he/she was laid off. Moving expenses will not be paid by the Agency for any other moves associated with displacement, demotion, or return from a layoff list.
(h)	Limited Duration Appointments—Workload Reasons. Eligible employees, as defined in Article 51 Section 2, shall have their seniority calculated within a geographic area and may bump limited duration or permanent employees based on their seniority within the following separate categories:

(2)	part-time status.
(i)	Limited Duration	Appointments—Non-Workload
Reasons. Eligible employees, as defined in Article 51, Section 1, whose limited duration appointment that exceeds two (2) years shall have their seniority calculated within a geographic area. These employees shall be placed on the Agency recall list for the affected geographic area when the limited duration appointment ends. These employees will not be eligible to bump any employees, but shall be placed on the affected agency layoff recall list for the class they held as a limited duration employee.
(j)	An initial trial service employee cannot displace any regular status employee (see Section 5 for more on treatment of trial service employees).
(k)	Job Share Positions.
(1)	Individuals filling a job-sharing position which totals a full-time equivalent at the time of calculation of seniority shall be considered as one (1) full-time equivalent or, if either Party chooses, as part-time employees.
(2)	If the employees in a job-share position choose to be treated as a full-time employee, seniority for the position shall be determined by averaging the two (2) individuals’ Layoff Service Date. -
(3)	If either employee in a job-share position chooses to be treated as a part-time employee, seniority for each employee will use individual Layoff Service Date.
If only one (1) person is filling a job-share position, he/she shall be considered as a full-time equivalent.
(I)	If an employee is overfilling or underfilling a position, the employee will be considered in the position classification for the purposes of this Article. If an overfill employee is displaced, demoted in lieu of layoff or is laid off, the employee shall retain his/her overfill status upon return to his/her classification.
(m)	Any employee displaced by another employee exercising options under Section 2(d)(1), (2) and (3) may also exercise any option available under Section 2(d).
Section 3.	For purposes of this Article, the term “Agency” does not include employees represented by other unions. There will be no cross-bumping between unions. If, however, the Employer and/or the Agency permits another union to cross-bump into SEIU Local 503, OPEU positions,
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
66
such rights shall be extended to SEIU Local 503, OPEU bargaining unit members also. There shall not be crossbumping between the Management Service and the bargaining unit.
In instances where there is more than one (1) classification in the same salary range affected by a concurrent layoff, employees in the multiple classifications will have their layoff option selection notices processed by seniority (state service) within the salary range as opposed to classification. However, should two (2) or more employees continue to have equal seniority it will be decided in accordance with Section 4(d).
In instances where the first round of layoffs have been completed and a vacancy which the Agency intends to fill occurs prior to the initiation of a second round of layoffs, employees who are on an Agency geographic area layoff list may have priority rights to such vacancy in accordance with the Filling of Vacancies Articles.
Section 4.	Seniority.
(a)	Seniority Definition. Seniority is the Layoff Service Date which is the date the employee began state service (except as a temporary appointee) as adjusted for break(s)-in-service.
(See Letter of Agreement in Appendix A).
(b)	Break-In-Service. A break-in-service is a separation or interruption of employment without pay of more than two (2) years. If an employee has a break-in-service that does not exceed two (2) years, he/she shall be given credit for the time worked prior to the break-in-service. Seniority will also be adjusted for leaves without pay in excess of one (1) year.
(c)	Seniority Frozen. When an Agency intends to initiate a layoff, the Agency will notify the Union in writing that all seniority will be frozen from the date of notice for a period not to exceed three (3) months. However, during the period when seniority is frozen, the employee will continue to accumulate time towards seniority for purposes of future computations. The three (3) month freeze may be extended by mutual written agreement of the Union and the Agency.
(d)	Equal Seniority. If it is found that two (2) or more employees in the Agency in which the layoff is to be made have equal seniority, then the greatest length of continuous service in the Agency shall be used. If ties between employees still exist, the order of layoff shall be determined by the Agency in such manner as to conserve for the State the services of the most qualified employee.
Section 5.	Any trial service employee who is laid off or demoted in lieu of layoff shall not be placed on the Agency layoff list, but shall be restored to the eligible list from which certification was made if the eligible list is still active. Restoration of the list shall be for the remaining period of eligibility that existed at the time of appointment from the list.
Section 6.	Regular and eligible limited duration employees laid off or demoted in lieu of layoff shall be placed on the reemployment list for the classification in which they were laid off.
Section 7.	Regular status seasonal employees laid off prior to the end of the season shall be placed in order of seniority on the Agency layoff list for seasonal reappointment and shall be limited so as to encompass only those seasonal employees in a classification who are employed at that specific geographic location and the
Agency where the reduction occurs. The eligibility for such seasonal employees shall be canceled at the end of each season. At the completion of a season, all seasonal employees shall be terminated without regard to seniority.

If an employee (permanent or limited duration) is certified from a layoff list and is offered a permanent position in a different geographic area from which he/she demoted or was laid off, he/she shall have one (1) right of refusal.

(f)	If a limited duration appointment is necessary in any geographic area and is expected to last longer than ninety (90) days, and there is a layoff list for that classification in the geographic area, employees on the layoff list shall first be offered the limited duration appointment prior to hiring any other limited duration employee.

(e)	Except as specifically modified above, intermittent employees shall have all the rights and privileges of seasonal employees.
ARTICLE 71.1C-SEASONAL POSITIONS
(Employment Department)
Section 1.	Workload for the Employment Department is directly related to the economy of the State; therefore, workload peaks occur that are beyond the control of the Agency. Positions that are to respond to workload peaks, are designated as seasonal positions. This Agreement is
subject to Legislatively approved position authority.
Section 2.	Seasonal employees will complete trial service after having served 1,040 hours.
Section 3.	A person appointed to a seasonal position during the term of this Agreement shall be informed in writing at the time of appointment that the position has been designated as a seasonal position and that the employee may expect to work only when work is available. A person who is appointed to a seasonal position may be scheduled for work at the discretion of the supervisor when the workload for the position so justifies without any penalty pay provision for short notice.
Section 4.	The unscheduling of an employee appointed to a seasonal position shall not be considered a layoff. Whenever possible, a seasonal employee shall be given ten (10) calendar days notice of scheduling and unscheduling of work. When such notice cannot be given, such employees may be scheduled without advance notice. The Agency shall not use unscheduling of work as a method of unofficially disciplining or discharging seasonal employees.
Section 5.	Seasonal employees will be scheduled and unscheduled for work in seniority order by work unit.
Section 6.	Seasonal full-time employees shall accrue all rights and benefits accrued by full-time permanent employees during their employment season. Seasonal part-time employees shall accrue all rights and benefits accrued by permanent part-time employees during their employment season, except as otherwise modified by this Agreement.
Section 7.	Employment status conveyed to outside interests (such as lending institutions) by management will reflect duration of employment rather than status of employment.
ARTICLE 71.5N-SEASONAL EMPLOYEES (Revenue) Section 1. Intent. The purpose of this Article is to clarify what seasonal employees may expect when called to work by Revenue. Nothing in this Article guarantees an eight (8) hour workday. However, the Agency agrees to make the following efforts to match available work with the number of employees called in.
Section 2. Procedure.
(a)	At the beginning of the season, employees will be called back to work in seniority order. When offering a position, the Employer will inform the employee of the number of hours each area/unit worked the previous year. Employees will have the right to turn down a position or start date once.
(b)	Once seasonal employees are called in, if it becomes necessary to release employees due to lack of work, the Agency will offer suitable work where available, in other areas/units, on the basis of seniority. Seasonal employees will be unscheduled prior to releasing or reducing the hours of permanent part-time employees.
(c)	When it becomes necessary to release some seasonal employees due to lack of work, but not all seasonal employees, the Agency will first ask for volunteers. If there are not enough volunteers, the employees will be released in reverse seniority order. In instances where there may be excess volunteers, unscheduling will occur based on seniority within the area/unit. In cases where employees are notified not to report to work prior to their normal reporting time, the Agency will not be required to ask for volunteers. Instead, employees
73
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
will be unscheduled in reverse seniority order.
(d)	In instances where a seasonal employee has insufficient vacation or compensatory time to cover the period the employee is released, the Agency agrees to continue the employee’s eligibility for purposes of insurance. Employees must exhaust available vacation and compensatory time to be eligible for this benefit. This provision will not apply in an instance where an employee is offered suitable work and turns it down. This provision applies only to those seasonal employees who would have, but for being unscheduled, reached the eighty (80) hour threshold.
ARTICLE 73.5A-ACADEMIC YEAR (OSD Only)
Section 1.	The Agency may designate positions as academic year, when the employment term of such positions conforms generally to the school or academic year. Such designation shall not preclude the extension of employment, either full- or part-time, into the period between two (2) school or academic years.
Section 2.	Employees in positions designated as academic year may utilize accrued leave in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement.
Section 3.	Summer employment, when available, will be offered to qualified employees in academic year positions according to layoff service date. Summer employment will be offered to such qualified employees as soon as it is determined by management to go forward with the summer work assignment in question. Employees working during the period between two (2) school or academic years will be paid according to the classification of the work being performed. If the employee’s current salary rate is within the salary range of the classification of work being performed, the employee's salary rate will not change. If the employee’s current salary rate is below the salary range of the classification of work being performed, the employee will be paid at Step 1 of the salary range of the classification of work being performed. If the employee's current salary rate is above the salary range of the classification of work being performed, the employee will be paid at the top step of the salary range of the classification of work being performed.
Section 4.	The State agrees to pay PEBB medical/dental insurance Employer contributions during the summer months for all employees in full-time academic year positions who are eligible for PEBB insurance coverage.
For eligible employees in part-time academic year positions, the Employer contributions for June, July, and August will be prorated based on May hours worked. For eligible employees in part-time academic year positions, additional employee contributions, if required, for June, July, and August will be prorated based on May hours worked and will be deducted from May paychecks. An employee may choose, however, not to have summer PEBB coverage by submitting written notice to this effect, to the payroll office prior to May 20 for that academic year.
ARTICLE 74-TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION OF EMPLOYMENT-LACK OF WORK
Section 1,	Any temporary interruption of employment because of lack of work or unexpected or unusual reasons which does not exceed fifteen (15) days, shall not be considered a layoff if, at termination of such conditions, employees are to be returned to employment. Such interruptions of employment shall be by work unit and
recorded and reported as leave without pay. Under no circumstances shall this Article be used to remedy shortage of funds.
Section 2.	An employee who is affected by a temporary interruption of employment shall be allowed to use any form of paid leave including vacation, compensatory time off, or personal leave provided the leave has been accrued. Such employee shall continue to accrue all benefits during this period. This Section shall only apply to FLSA-exempt employees where the interruption is for one (1) or more full workweek(s).
Section 3.	For periods longer than fifteen (15) days, the Appointing Authority shall follow the procedures described in Article 70-Layoff. In instances where temporary interruption of employment is an established practice that the Agency used in connection with cyclical or scheduled shortage of work for more than fifteen (15) days, such practice may continue. Provided, however, that when such periods are for longer than fifteen (15) days, the Appointing Authority shall use seniority of employees by classification in the affected work unit in determining employees to be placed on leave without pay. The Appointing Authority will determine the work unit in each instance. If all such employees available for work cannot be returned to their positions, seniority shall be used to determine the order of recall.
ARTICLE 80-CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATIONS
Section 1.	The Employer shall notify the Union of intended classification studies.
Section 2.	The Union may recommend classification studies be conducted by the Labor Relations Unit, indicating the reasons for the need of such studies. The Labor Relations Unit shall reply, setting a preliminary date for completion of the study or explaining the reasons for a decision not to conduct such a study within ninety (90) days of receipt of the request.
Section 3.
(a)	Whenever a change in classification specifications or a new classification is proposed, it is agreed that the Labor Relations Unit shall submit the classification specification changes to the Union to provide it an opportunity to review and comment on the specifications. If the changes of the specifications substantially revise the specifications, the Parties shall negotiate the salary range for the newly revised specification.
(b)	When the Union requests a classification study, negotiations for salary ranges for new classifications shall commence no later than ninety (90) days following the Employer’s written notification to the Union of the finalization of the class specification.
(c)	Proposals for the salary rate and effective date for changes in classification specifications may be submitted throughout the term of this Agreement. If the Parties are able to reach agreement, the new classification will be implemented. Any classes on which salary is not agreed can be submitted with overall proposals for a successor Agreement.

Article 81-reclassification upward, RECLASSIFICATION DOWNWARD, AND REALLOCATION
For purposes of contract administration, see Letter of Agreement that affects employees who have Salary Eligibility Dates and who are not at the top step of their pay ranges.
Section 1.	Reclassification must be based on findings that the purpose of the job is consistent with the concept of the proposed classification and that the class specification for the proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authority, and responsibilities of the position. As used herein:
(a)	The purpose of the job shall be determined by the statement of purpose and assigned duties of the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency;
(b)	The concept of the proposed classification shall be determined by the general description and distinguishing features of its class specification; and
(c)	The overall duties, authority and responsibilities of the position shall be determined by the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency.
Section 2.	Reclassification Up.
(a)	Reclassification upward is a change in classification of a position by raising it to a higher classification. Employees may seek reclassification to any non-supervisory or non-managerial classification in the Executive Branch (DAS) of government whether or not the classification is included in Appendix B of this Agreement provided that:
(1)	the classification exists in the unrepresented compensation plan or in multiple bargaining units’ compensation plans, and
(2)	the classification is not specific to another Agency.
In the event that the proposed new classification is not in the bargaining unit, the classification shall be added to the SEIU Local 503, OPEU compensation plan at the Employer-proposed salary range. However, if the Employer-proposed range is lower than the classification salary range in another DAS compensation plan, the Parties will negotiate the salary range.
(b)	Employees may request reclassification by submitting a written explanation of the request, a Human Resource Services Division Position Description Form signed by the supervisor and employee, and all other relevant evidence for the proposed reclassification to the Agency Appointing Authority. Within sixty (60) days, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, the Agency shall review the merits of the request based on the final position description signed by the Appointing Authority. The Union shall be entitled during the sixty (60) day review period and prior to issuance of the Agency decision to meet with the Agency or to present further written arguments in support of the request. The Agency will notify the employee of its decision and provide a copy of the final position description signed by the Appointing Authority. Should the duties of the position support the proposed reclassification, the Agency shall make a determination whether to seek legislative approval for reclassification or remove selected duties within one-hundred twenty (120) days,
however, this time period may be extended upon mutual agreement of the Parties.
(c)	If approved by the Legislative Review Agency or the Department of Administrative Services, the effective date shall be the first of the month following the month in which the reclassification request was received by the Agency. The employee will receive a lump sum payment for the difference between the current salary rate, including work out-of-class pay if any and the proposed salary rate, for the time period beginning the first of the month following the month in which the reclassification request was received by the Agency to the effective date.
(d)	Rate of pay upon upward reclassification shall be given no less than the first step of the new salary range. If the old salary range rate of pay is equal to or higher than the first step of the new salary range, the employee shall receive a salary increase no less than an increase to the next higher step in the new salary range. At the discretion of management, the salary eligibility date may, in either case, remain the same or be established twelve (12) months thereafter.
If the reclassification upward is approved, the Agency may cease paying work out-of-classification pay or adjust the effective date of the reclassification to avoid overpayment of any work out-of-classification pay received by the employee.
(e)	If a reclassification request does not receive legislative approval or the Agency removes selected duties to be consistent with its current classification, the employee will receive a lump sum payment for the difference between the current salary rate, including work out-ofclass pay if any and the proposed salary rate, for the time period beginning the first of the month following the month in which the reclassification request was received by the Agency to the date the duties were removed.
Section 3.	Reclassification Down.
(a)	Reclassification downward is a change in the classification of a position by reducing it to a lower classification.
(b)	The Agency shall, sixty (60) calendar days in advance of a reclassification downward of any position, notify the employee in writing of the action, including the specific reasons, and the HRSD Position Description used for the action, which shall be signed by the Appointing Authority.
(c)	If an employee is reclassified downward and his/her rate of pay is above the maximum of the new classification, his/her rate of pay will remain the same until a rate in the salary range of the new classification exceeds it, at which time the employee's salary shall be adjusted to that step.
If the employee’s rate of pay is the same as a salary step in the new classification, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at the same rate in the lower range.
If the employee’s rate of pay is within the new salary range but not at a corresponding salary step, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the employee’s next eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one (1) full step within the new salary range plus that amount that his/her current salary rate is below the
75
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest step in the new salary range.
(d)	Employees who are reclassified downward for non-disciplinary reasons shall be given the same recall rights as employees demoted in lieu of layoff pursuant to Article 70 of this Agreement for reemployment to the classification from which they were reclassified downward.
Section 4.	Reclassification Equal or Lateral.
(a)	Reclassification equal or lateral is a change in an employee’s job classification from one classification to another with the same salary range base number.
(b)	Rate of pay upon equal or lateral reclassification shall be given no less than the first step of the new salary range.
(c)	If the employee’s rate of pay is the same as a salary step in the new classification, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at that rate in the new classification until the next salary eligibility date.
(d)	If the employee’s rate of pay is within the new salary range but not at a corresponding salary step, the employee’s salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the employee’s next eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one (1) full step within the new salary range pay scale plus that amount the current salary rate is below the next higher rate in the salary range pay scale. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.
(e)	If an employee’s previous salary is above the maximum of the new classification, his/her rate of pay will remain the same until a rate in the salary range of the new classification exceeds it, at which time the employee’s salary range shall be adjusted to that step.
Section 5.	Reclassification Appeals.
(a)	Filing.
Reclass Upward. A decision of the Agency to deny a reclassification request may be appealed in writing by the Union to DAS Labor Relations for further review within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Union of the Agency’s decision. Such appeal shall include copies of the documents originally provided to the Agency Appointing Authority, including, the written explanation, the position description signed by the Appointing Authority, and all other relevant evidence for the proposed reclassification. No new evidence or information will be considered by the Committee.
Reclass Down. Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the employee receives notice that the Agency will reclassify his/her position downward, he/she may grieve this action by filing a grievance at the Agency Head level in the grievance procedure, providing a written explanation of the request and all relevant evidence demonstrating why the reclass is in conflict with Article 81, Section 1. The Agency Head shall respond in writing in accordance with the appropriate time limits contained in the Agency grievance procedure. A decision of the Agency to deny a grievance under this Article may be appealed in writing by the Union to DAS Labor Relations for further review within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Union of the Agency’s decision. Such appeal shall include copies of the documents originally provided to the Agency, including the written explanation of the
request and all relevant evidence. No new evidence or information will be considered by the Committee.
(b)	Once appealed to DAS Labor Relations, the matter shall be considered by the Employer designee (or the alternate) and the Union designee (or the alternate) who shall form the Committee charged with the responsibility to consider appeals pursuant to this Article and make decisions which maintain the integrity of the classification system by correctly applying the classification specifications. Each designee (and each alternate) shall have experience making classification decisions.
Should the Union designee or the Union alternate be a bargaining unit member, to participate in the process, that employee shall be granted reasonable paid release time during their scheduled workday or a mutually-agreed alternate work schedule. Further, where the Union designee or the Union alternate is a bargaining unit member and the Employer believes the time required by the process presents a hardship for the employing Agency, the Employer may require the Union to designate a qualified replacement for the Committee. Either Party may discontinue this part of the appeals process upon two (2) weeks notice to the other.
The designees will attempt to resolve the matter by jointly determining whether the current or proposed class more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authorities, and responsibilities of the position using the criteria specified in Article 81, Section 1. In this process each of the designees may identify one (1) alternate class that he/she determines most accurately depicts the purpose of the job and overall assigned duties. If an alternate class is identified, both the Union and DAS Labor Relations shall be notified. If the Parties concur on the alternate class, that shall end the appeal. The Committee will send a written initial decision to the Agency and Union within sixty (60) days from receipt, which will include the reasons for its decision. The Agency or the Union may ask the Committee to reconsider its decision by sending a written reconsideration request which must be based on incorrect or incomplete information in the initial decision. Additional or new evidence/information will not be considered by the Committee. The reconsideration request must be received by DAS Labor Relations within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision. If there is no timely request for reconsideration, the Committee's decision will be final and binding. A copy of the reconsideration request will be provided to the other party, who will have the opportunity to provide a written rebuttal to the reconsideration request, which must be received by DAS Labor Relations within fifteen (15) calendar days from date of receipt. The Committee will reconsider its initial decision and issue a final decision within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of receipt by DAS Labor Relations of the reconsideration request. In the event the Committee concludes that the proposed or alternate class is more appropriate, management retains the right to modify the work assignment on a timely basis to make it consistent with the Agency’s allocation.
(c)	The Committee may extend, up to thirty (30) days, the time to issue its decision to the Union through
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
76
notification to the Parties. The Committee may request an additional extension of time to issue its decision to the Union, which, if agreed to, must be stipulated in writing with copy to DAS Labor Relations and shall become part of the grievance record.-
(d)	If these efforts do not result in resolution of the matter within sixty (60) days of the appeal to DAS Labor Relations, or from the extension, then the Union may request final and binding arbitration under this clause of the Agreement by a written notice to DAS Labor Relations within the next forty-five (45) calendar day period. Except as specified in this Section, arbitration shall proceed as indicated in Article 21-Grievance and Arbitration.
Each Party may go forward with only one (1) class. Each Party may choose to take to arbitration either the current class, class appealed to, or an alternate class identified by a committee member.
The Parties will agree upon a permanent appointment of one (1) arbitrator to hear grievances arising from this Article. This arbitrator shall have special qualifications to hear these matters; however, each side retains the right to initiate a change in that assignment upon notice to the other side. The change in the assigned arbitrator shall be effective for any case not yet scheduled for arbitration.
The arbitrator shall allow the decision of the Agency to stand unless he/she concludes that the proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authority, and responsibilities using the criteria specified in Section 1.
In the event the arbitrator finds in favor of the proposed or alternate classification, management retains the right to, on a timely basis, adjust duties consistent with its current classification.
Section 6.	An incumbent employee who appealed his/her classification allocation to a final decision through the classification appeals boards as part of the new class system implementation which was effective April 1, 1990, or who has appealed a reclass decision to final decision through the Committee or through an arbitration since that date, shall not be eligible to either submit a new reclassification review request or to be reclassified downward by management, unless a change of assigned duties has occurred since that decision or a revised classification has been adopted.
Section 7.	An employee’s classification status change from a Management Service classification to a represented classification may correctly occur through reclassification where it is found that there has been a significant change of position duties, authority, and responsibilities, and as a consequence, the class specification for the proposed classification more accurately depicts the assigned duties, authority, responsibility, and distinguishing characteristics of the position.
Section 8.	Reallocation Appeal Process for New Classes. Employees in positions allocated to a new classification, who dispute their placement in a new classification can appeal their placement using the following process:
(a)	An appeal may be filed by an individual employee or a Steward or a Union Organizer on behalf of the employee, to the Agency Human Resource Office within thirty (30) calendar days of written notification by the Agency of placement into the new classification.
Employees sharing the same or substantially similar position descriptions or employees the Agency agrees to treat as a group may file an appeal as a group. The initial filing should describe the individual or group, including the names of affected members, identify the proposed new classification placement, and the new classification placement believed to be correct by the affected employees. The appeal must include the signed position descriptions used for allocation. In the event that the old classifications are to be abolished, correct placement cannot be back to the prior classification. Using the criteria in Section 1, the Agency shall conduct a review of the allocation. This decision shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal and provided to the affected employees in writing and with a summary of the classification analysis.
(b)	If denied, the Union may appeal the Agency’s decision in writing to DAS Labor Relations within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written denial. The appeals will be considered by designees of the Parties using the process set forth in Section 5(b), with the addition of two (2) resource persons, one (1) designated by each Party, to provide technical expertise within the specific series. Appeals shall be decided in order of receipt by DAS Labor Relations. Decisions shall be rendered by the designees no later than sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the appeal by the Committee.
(c)	The Committee may extend, up to thirty (30) days, the time to issue its decision to the Union through notification to the Parties. The Committee may request an additional extension of time to issue its decision to the Union, which, if agreed to, must be stipulated in writing with copy to DAS Labor Relations and shall become part of the grievance record.
(d)	The decisions of the designees shall be binding on the Parties. However, Agencies may elect to remove duties consistent with this Article or at any point during the process.
(e)	If the appeals Committee cannot make a decision, the matter may be appealed to arbitration per Section 4(c) of this Article.
(f)	The effective date for pay changes shall be the same as that negotiated for implementation of the new classification.
(g)	Appeals of all filled positions will occur first. Where a position is vacated during the appeals process, the Union may continue the appeal provided no changes in duties are anticipated.
ARTICLE 85-POSITION DESCRIPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
Section 1,	Position Descriptions. Individual position descriptions shall be reduced to writing and delineate the duties currently assigned to an employee’s position. A dated copy of the position description shall be given to the employee upon assuming the position and when the position description is amended. The individual position description shall be subject to at least an annual review with the employee. Nothing contained herein shall compromise the right or the responsibility of the Agency to assign work consistent with the classification specification.
Section 2.	Performance Evaluations. The rater shall discuss the performance evaluation with the employee.
77
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
The employee shall have the opportunity to provide his/her comments to be attached to the performance evaluation. The employee shall sign the evaluation and that signature shall only indicate that the employee has read the evaluation. A copy shall be provided the employee at this time. If there are any changes or recommendations to be made in the evaluation after the rater has discussed it with the employee, the evaluation shall be returned to the rater for discussion with the employee before these changes are made. The employee shall have the opportunity to comment on these changes. The employee shall sign the new evaluation and that signature shall only indicate that the employee has read the evaluation. A copy shall be provided the employee at this time.
All written comments provided by the employee within sixty (60) days of the evaluation shall be attached to the performance evaluation. Performance evaluations are not grievable nor arbitrable under this Agreement nor shall they be used for purposes of disciplinary action, layoff, and annual eligibility date performance pay increases.
If an employee receives less than a satisfactory evaluation, the Employer agrees to meet with the employee within thirty (30) days of the evaluation to review, in detail, the alleged deficiencies.
Section 3.	Seasonal Employees. Seasonal employees still on trial service should refer to Article 71, Sections 2 and 3 regarding salary increases.
Section 4.	Denial of Performance Increase. The Agency shall give notification in writing of withholding of performance increases to all employees at least fifteen (15) days prior to the employee's eligibility date. When the performance increase is to be withheld, the reasons therefore shall be given in writing and will be subject to “just cause” standards. Any grievances for denial of annual performance pay increases will be processed under Article 20. If an annual increase is not granted on the eligibility date, the employee's eligibility date is retained no longer than eleven (11) months beyond the eligibility date. If the increase is subsequently granted within eleven (11) months, it shall be effective on the first of the following month and shall not be retroactive.
(For administration of performance increases, see Article 29.)
ARTICLE 86.1-WORKLOAD PRIORITIZATION (Human Services Coalition)
Any employee may request assistance from his/her immediate supervisor in establishing or adjusting priorities in order to carry out his/her work assignment. The supervisor will take into account variables that impact the difficulty of assignments to the employee. The employee may request to have the response provided orally or in writing and the immediate supervisor will respond accordingly in a timely manner, unless such request is deemed to be inappropriate or excessive.
ARTICLE 90-WQRK SCHEDULES
Section 1.	A work schedule is defined as the time of day and the days of the week the employee is assigned to work. A regular work schedule is a work schedule with the same starting and stopping time on five/eight (5/8) hour days. A flexible work schedule is a work schedule which varies the number of hours worked on a daily basis, but not necessarily each day, or a work schedule in which starting
and stopping times vary on a daily basis, but not necessarily each day, but which does not exceed forty (40) hours in a workweek and is agreed upon in advance by the employee and the supervisor. An alternate work schedule is anything other than a regular work schedule or a flexible work schedule.
Provided, however, nothing in this Section is intended to prohibit management from changing an employee’s flexible work schedule without an employee's consent where such a change is needed in the regular course of business and where the employee has been initially hired by management, or initially placed on a flexible work schedule, with the express understanding that the person hired or the employee so placed on a flexible work schedule is expected to work a flexible work schedule as a condition of his/her employment.
Section 2.	An employee may request in writing to work any work schedule as defined in Section 1, or any alternate work schedule. No employee requests will be arbitrarily denied or rescinded.
Section 3.	Except as may be specifically stated in Articles 90.1-90.5 or Section 2, the workweek is defined as the fixed and regularly recurring period of one-hundred sixtyeight (168) hours during seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods and the workday is the twenty-four (24) hour period commencing at the start of the employee’s assigned shift and shall remain fixed at that period for the whole of the workweek, except for flexible work schedules.
ARTICLE 90T—WORK SCHEDULES
(Temporary Employees)
Section 1.	A work schedule is defined as the time of day and the days of the week the employee is assigned to work. Management retains the right to modify work schedules.
Section 2.	A workweek is defined as the fixed and regularly recurring period of one-hundred-sixty-eight (168) hours during seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods. The employee will be notified in writing when the workweek begins and ends.
Section 3.	For work schedules of six (6) hours or more there shall be an established unpaid meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes midway in each workday. Employees who are not relieved from their work assignment and are required to remain in their work areas shall have such time counted as hours worked.
Section 4.	A paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes in duration for an employee on a five/eight (5/8) work schedule or twenty (20) minutes in duration for an employee on a four/ten (4/10) work schedule should be taken about midway through each four (4) or five (5) hour work period, as appropriate, Employees may be required to remain in the area and/or respond to emergencies during a rest period. If an employee cannot be relieved for a rest period, that employee shall be allowed to take a break in the work area or near the work area without interruption except for emergencies. Under no circumstances will unused rest periods be accumulated and used to reduce work time.
ARTICLE 90.1 C—WORK SCHEDULES
(Employment Department)
Section 1. Workweek. The workweek shall begin at 12:01 a.m. Monday and end at 12:00 midnight the following Sunday.
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
78
' Section 2. Alternate Work Schedules.
An employee may apply in writing for authorization to work an alternative schedule, for example four/ten (4/10) hour days. The employee's application must show that the following criteria can still be met before his/her application can be approved:
(a)	That his/her requested alternative (example four/ten (4/10)) schedule will not interfere with his/her ability and availability to perform the job;
(b)	That the operational needs of the Agency are met;
(c)	That the needs of the public are adequately served; and,
(d)	That a forty (40) hour workweek is maintained.
If, in fact, these criteria are met, the Agency shall grant the employee the agreed-upon alternative work schedule.
Requests for alternative work schedules shall be considered in order of application. If more than one (1) employee makes application for an alternative schedule on the same day and both requests cannot be accommodated, preference shall be given to the employee with the most seniority in the Agency if possible.
If at any time any of the above criteria cease to be met, the Agency may rescind its approval of an employee’s alternative schedule.
Section 3.	An employee may be allowed to work a flexible work schedule upon written approval of his/her request. No employee will be arbitrarily denied a flexible work schedule. Special consideration may be given to an employee who demonstrates an unusual hardship.
Section 4,	Meal Period. Employees shall be granted a meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than one (1) hour unless mutually agreed otherwise. Meal periods shall be scheduled at approximately the mid-period of the workday.
Section 5.	Rest Periods. A paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes in duration for an employee on a five/eight (5/8) work schedule or twenty (20) minutes in duration for an employee on a four/ten (4/10) work schedule should be taken about midway through each four (4) or five (5) hour work period, as appropriate.

situations in which four/tens (4/1 Os) would be most appropriate.
(i)	This Section shall not apply to Motor Carrier Enforcement Officer, Transportation Maintenance, and DMV employees. Shift assignments may consider seniority, subject to the requirements of the Agency to have qualified employees on all shifts. Should it be necessary to assign a more senior employee to a shift which he/she does not prefer, such assignment shall last for one (1) season and the vacancy on that shift shall then be rotated among all other senior employees to assure equitable distribution of the undesirable shift among all senior employees, provided there are other senior employees on the crew.

Such requests shall not be considered as schedule changes.
Section 4.	Lunch Periods.
(a)	A lunch period shall be scheduled as nearly as possible to the middle of the daily workshift. Adjustment to scheduled lunch period may be made subject to operational needs of the Agency or by mutual agreement between the employee and immediate excluded supervisor. DMV offices shall make reasonable effort to maintain scheduled lunch periods which shall be posted at least one (1) week in advance.

Section 1.	Subject to the operating requirements of the Agency, bargaining unit employees shall be placed on regular, alternate, or flexible work schedules as defined in this Agreement (see Article 90, Work Schedules). Employees placed on regular work schedules shall be scheduled for five (5) consecutive workdays and two (2) consecutive days off within the workweek. Exceptions to the days off provision above shall occur only when they would seriously hamper operations of the Agency. Employees who work alternate schedules of four/ten (4/10) hour days shall be scheduled for three (3) consecutive
days off within the workweek. Exceptions to the days off provision above shall occur only when (1) this would seriously hamper operations of the Agency, or (2) when requested by the employee and approved by Agency management.
Section 2.	An employee may request in writing to work any alternate or flexible work schedule defined in this Agreement (see Article 90, Work Schedules and, for applicable Agencies, Section 14, below). No employee requests will be arbitrarily denied or rescinded. In reaching its decision, the Agency will consider whether the employee’s request meets all of the following criteria: (a) That the operational needs of the Agency are met;
(b)	That the requested work schedule will not interfere with his/her ability and availability to perform the job;
(c)	That the needs of the public are adequately served; and
(d)	That a forty (40) hour workweek is maintained.
The Agency may also consider other relevant criteria, including, but not limited to, employee use of carpooling or mass transit.
The Agency will provide a response to an employee request to work an alternate or flexible work schedule, including the reason(s) for a denial, within a reasonable period of time. Requests for alternate and flexible work schedules will be considered in order of application. If more than one (1) employee makes application for such a schedule on the same day and both requests cannot be accommodated, preference shall be given to the employee with the most seniority in the Agency, if possible.
Section 3.	The workweek shall begin at 12:01 a.m., Monday and end at 12:00 midnight the following Sunday. This workweek shall remain fixed during the term of this Agreement regardless of an employee’s scheduled hours of work. Workweeks for employees on work schedules “F” and “M” are governed by Section 14(e) below.
Section 4.	Consistent with the operating requirements of the Agency, an employee shall be granted a meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than one (1) hour, unless mutually agreed otherwise.

Meal periods will not be changed without reasonable notice.
Section 5.	All employees shall be granted a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes in every four (4) hours working time or major fraction thereof, except in cases of alternate work schedules, in which case rest periods shall be twenty (20) minutes.

Rest periods for employees on work schedules “F" and “M" are governed by Section 14(g) below.
Section 6. In order to account for a full forty (40) hours in a workweek in which there is a holiday, the employee may use appropriate accrued leave or compensatory time, or with supervisory approval may revert to a regular or a flexible work schedule.
Section 7.	Department of Administrative Services. When the Agency chooses to make a shift reassignment, all employees in the affected classification will be notified by publication in the manner provided for in Article 45.5E-Filling of Vacancies, Section (b), and be given an opportunity to designate their shift preference. The
85
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
reassignment will be made based on each employee's level of skill, the requirements of the reassignment, and the operating needs of the Agency. If more employees request the shift reassignment than there are reassignments available, and are, in the judgment of the Agency, equally well qualified for the reassignment and equally meet the operating needs of the Agency, the employee with the most seniority will be given the reassignment. The Agency shall not exercise its judgment in an arbitrary manner.
Section 8.	Department of Agriculture, Measurement Standards Division.
(a)	Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Agreement, the Agency shall develop a form which employees will be required to submit when requesting a flexible work schedule.

The office will be notified as soon as possible of requests for exceptions. All Inspectors will notify the Salem office upon conclusion of the workweek.
(e)	Flexible work schedules shall be agreed upon when working with fellow employees. Where agreement cannot be reached, the employees will work regular 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedules.

Cleanup time for equipment shall be considered as part of the employee’s workday.
Section 12.	Revenue. The purpose of this Section is to clarify what permanent part-time employees working in the Administrative Services Division may expect when a lack of work situation arises. When it becomes necessary to release some permanent part-time employees due to lack of work, but not all permanent part-time employees, the Employer will first ask for volunteers. If there are not enough volunteers, the employees will be released in reverse seniority order. In instances where there may be excess volunteers, unscheduling will occur based on seniority. Seasonal employees will be unscheduled prior to releasing or reducing the hours of permanent part-time employees. This Section is intended to apply only within the unit. Nothing in this Section guarantees an eight (8) hour workday.
Section 13.	Education (including OSD, DCCWD). Reassignment of Hours of Work or Days Off.
(a)	When a reassignment of hours of work or days off, or both, is to be made within a given instructional unit, section, or department, the employees in the unit or department shall have the right to request their choice of assignment. The candidate with the greatest length of service within the Agency will be given his/her choice unless there exists a substantial and clearly evident superiority in the qualifications and experience of another candidate. Before an employee other than the candidate with the greatest length of service is given first choice, the candidate with the greatest length of service will be informed in writing and in detail, of those qualifications possessed by the employee chosen, and will be provided with a complete explanation of the reasons for selecting the other employee.
(b)	When an employee would be scheduled to work a shift alone, however, the above provisions may be temporarily waived to provide for the safety and wellbeing of students.

If needed, the employee may use accrued leave or compensatory time, or the employee may request adjustment of his/her work schedule to account for a full forty (40) hours in the workweek. Such adjustment shall be considered additional straight time worked rather than daily overtime hours. When the compensable holiday, or portion thereof, falls on the employee’s scheduled day off, the employee and supervisor will mutually agree on an alternative and commensurate time off within the workweek period.
(g)	Employees on a work schedule “F” or “M” shall be granted two (2) fifteen (15) minute rest breaks on each nine (9) hour workday. Rest breaks will be taken so far as practicable in the middle of the working period and considered as time worked for pay purposes.

ARTICLE 107—JOB PROTECTION FOR ON-THE-JOB ILLNESS OR INJURY
Section 1.	The State and the Union agree to jointly work to reduce the incidence of on-the-job injuries through health and safety programs and to reduce the unemployment and costs associated with on-the-job injuries through a combination of light-duty assignments, worksite modification programs, and expanded • return-to-work opportunities.
Each state Agency agrees to meet annually with select representatives from the Union on paid time to review the frequency and type of on-the-job injuries sustained in the Agency, status of worksite modification requests, and to mutually develop training programs to reduce the incidence of work-related injuries. Ultimate decisions on training programs and costs are the prerogative of management. However, the State commits to provide existing resources to develop and staff such programs.
Section 2.	An employee who has sustained a compensable injury or illness shall be reinstated to his/her former employment or employment of the employee’s choice within the Agency, which the Agency has determined is available and suitable upon demand for such reinstatement, provided that the employee is not disabled from performing the duties of such employment. If a position is not available and suitable within the Agency, the employee will be provided employment in another Agency, provided a vacant position exists where the returning worker meets the minimum qualifications and special requirements and the position is intended to be filled.
Any worker, whether covered by this Agreement at the time of injury or not, will be eligible for placement into Agencies covered herein after all filling of vacancies provisions of this Agreement have been completed. Temporary reassignments across bargaining unit lines will not impact representation status.

98
Section 3.	Certification of a duly licensed physician that the physician approved the employee’s return to his/her regular employment shall be prima facie evidence that the employee should be able to perform such duties.
Section 4.	Upon request of the Agency, an employee shall furnish a certificate as defined in Section 3, concerning his/her condition and expectation for a date of return to active employment. Any employee who has been released for return to active employment must immediately, but no later than the seventh (7th) calendar day following the date the worker is notified by the insurer or self-insured employer by certified mail that the worker’s attending physician has released the worker for employment, notify his/her supervisor, personnel officer, or someone in management who has authority to act on this demand, of his/her status and that he/she is available to return to work. Extenuating circumstances may extend the requirement for timely notice. An employee who fails to provide timely notice of his/her status shall be considered to have voluntarily terminated his/her employment.
Employees released by their physician for light or limited duty are eligible for modified work consistent with the physician’s certification of the worker’s capabilities, the Agency's ability to construct duties and availability of work. However, to be eligible for possible light duty or modified work, the employee must, where reasonable to do so, keep in regular contact with the Employer beginning with the day following the injury or illness. This assignment of work is temporary and is established through discussions with the physician as to the prognosis of when the employee will be able to return to his/her full range of duties.
Since duties will be tailored based on a physician's statement of types of light or limited duties the injured employee can do, these duties may overlap various state classifications and may change the essential duties performed by other employees who will suffer no economic detriment due to these temporary work changes. All reasonable efforts will be made to avoid disruption to existing staff, e.g., filling usable vacancies prior to altering the duties of incumbents.
This is a temporary, modified return-to-work plan, to be reviewed every thirty (30) days and may be terminated when warranted by physicians’ statements or light duty is no longer required or can no longer be made available. The return of injured workers shall be exempt from Article 45. Concerning the injured worker, light duty assignments can be made without regard to the requirements of Article 26, Section 10, and Articles 80, 81, 85, and 90, and including all coalition language within these Articles, except where specific work assignments have been designated for return of injured workers.
Although duties of non-injured staff may be temporarily (not to exceed six (6) months) changed, such change may not give rise to a claim under the Articles listed above. However, days off and shifts of permanent full-time employees shall not be affected by this program.
Section 5.	The Employer will cooperate with the Workers' Compensation Program in the modification of work or work stations in order to accommodate employees permanently disabled as a result of a work-related injury or illness.
Section 6.	When an employee is injured on the job and suffers time loss greater than fifteen (15) days, the Employer shall refer the employee to appropriate sources for explanation of his/her rights and obligations related to medical, retirement, and Workers' Compensation benefits.
A letter to the employee’s last address of record shall constitute proper referral.
Section 7.	All reassignments under this Article will be made in a manner to keep the injured employee at or near his/her official place of employment. No reassignments under this Article will require such employee to travel more than thirty-five (35) miles or the distance of his/her regular commute, whichever is greater.
ARTICLE 108—VIDEO DISPLAY TERMINALS
Section 1.	Whenever any new piece of VDT equipment is purchased from outside of State government, the Agency will follow the Department of Consumer & Business Services guidelines on VDTs as they pertain to that piece of equipment. When an Agency buys used equipment, then it will make every effort to comply with Department of Consumer & Business Services guidelines. If it is not able to do so, then any Union Steward, upon identification and submission of a VDT safety practice problem, may request and shall be scheduled to meet with the appropriate management representative to review the specific safety concerns.
Glare screens will be provided upon request. The Employer will provide safe operation instructions when new equipment is installed. VDTs will be cleaned and inspected as needed to ensure proper operation.
Section 2.	The Agency will inform employees if it is using computer monitoring. Notice will include what is being monitored and its intended use.
Section 3.	The Agency will not use subliminal software.
Section 4.	The Employer and the Union agree that employees who are assigned full-time to continuously operate video display terminals (VDT) or cathode ray tubes (CRT) can be more productive if provided short periods of assignment to other duties throughout the workshift. Subject to operational needs, managers will arrange other work assignments so as to provide ten (10) minutes of relief for each hour worked at a VDT or CRT.
Section 5.	Upon request, employees who operate a VDT or CRT shall be provided available wrist rests for trial usage. If the wrist rest is determined to be beneficial a permanent wrist rest will be assigned to the station.

Upon notification, the Union may exercise its rights pursuant to Article 5 of this agreement as it applies to changes in Agency rule or policy implementing Governor’s executive orders or state or federal laws regarding criminal records check requirements.
Section 2.	Position Descriptions and Recruitment Announcements. If a criminal records check is required for a position, such requirement shall be included in the recruitment announcement.

APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
LETTER OF AGREEMENT 02.00-99-01
Article 2-Recoqnition
Procedure for Exclusion of Filled Bargaining Unit Positions Based on Supervisory, Managerial or Confidential Status
This Letter of Agreement is entered into between the Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit (DAS, LRU), on behalf of the State of Oregon (Employer), and the SEIU Local 503, OPEU (Union) as it pertains to the exclusion of filled bargaining unit positions based on supervisory, managerial or confidential status, under Article 2-Recognition of their 2009-2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The Employer and the Union agree as follows:
1.	DAS, LRU shall provide the Union with no less than twenty (20) days written notice of its intent to exclude a filled bargaining unit position based on supervisory, managerial or confidential status. DAS, LRU agrees not to change the position’s designation from represented to management service during this twenty (20) day period.
2.	Should the Union decide to contest the proposed exclusion, it shall serve DAS, LRU with written notice of its intent to contest the exclusion within twenty (20) days of its receipt of the notice of intent to exclude. Should such notice be given by the Union, DAS, LRU will forego implementing the change in designation for an additional forty (40) days, beyond the initial twenty (20) day period. The purpose of this forty (40) day period is to allow the Union time to investigate whether it has grounds to contest the proposed change in status. If the Union decides to pursue challenging an exclusion, it must file with the Employment Relations Board (ERB) prior to the end of this forty (40) day period. In such event, DAS, LRU agrees to forego implementing the change in designation until the matter is resolved by way of ERB decision, settlement, or other manner.
3.	If DAS, LRU does not receive timely notice from the Union indicating its intent to contest the exclusion during the initial twenty (20) day period or if the Union does not file with the ERB during the subsequent forty (40) day period, DAS, LRU may proceed to change the position’s designation, and the Union agrees not to contest the excluded status of this position during the remainder of this contract term, unless the position’s duties should materially change such that the exclusion is no longer warranted.
4.	For purposes of this Agreement, written notice may occur by personal delivery, fax or mail (postmark) within the time frames cited above.
LETTER OF AGREEMENT 02.3B-03-75 Article 2.3B--Recoqnition Temporary Employees (State Fair)
This Agreement is between the State of Oregon, acting through its Department of Administrative Services (Employer) on behalf of the Oregon State Fair and Exposition Center (Agency) and the SEIU Local 503, OPEU (Union).
The purpose of this Agreement is to clarify the bargaining unit status of Agency temporary employees.
1.	Temporary employees who are hired to work for the Agency during any of the period of time from and including June 15 to and including September 30 (Fair time) will be excluded from the Union’s bargaining unit.
2.	Temporary employees who are hired to work for the Agency prior to or after Fair time will be included in the Union’s bargaining unit if they otherwise fall within the bargaining unit description set forth in Article 2.
3.	Temporary employees who are hired to work for the Agency during Fair time and who continue to work for the Agency as temporary employees after Fair time, shall be included in the Union's bargaining unit if they otherwise fall within the bargaining unit description set forth in Article 2, but only for the period that they continue to work beyond Fair time. For example, a temporary employee (who otherwise falls within the Article 2 bargaining unit description) hired by the Agency on August 1 who continues to work as a State Fair temporary employee after September 30, will be included in the Union’s bargaining unit only from the day following September 30.
4.	Temporary employees who are hired to work for the Agency prior to Fair time (who fall within the Article 2 bargaining unit description) would continue to maintain their status as bargaining unit members, even though they continue to work during Fair time. For example, a temporary employee (who falls within the Article 2 bargaining unit description) hired by the Agency prior to June 15, who continues to work as a temporary employee through Fair time, would be included in the Union’s bargaining unit during that whole period of time.
LETTER OF AGREEMENT 10.1-05-119
Article 10.1-Union Rights
Clarification of Intent Concerning DDS Understanding & Workload Adjustment (DHS)
Clarification:
The above referenced Sections are part of a Central Article describing activities performed during the Steward’s regular work schedule, subject to advance notice to the Steward’s immediate supervisor. The permitted activities will be granted unless such activities would interfere with the work the Steward is expected to perform. In instances where there is interference with the work, the immediate supervisor shall, within the next workday, arrange an alternate, mutually satisfactory time for the requested activity. Such activities do not warrant any workload adjustment.
Although not specifically mentioned in Article 10, it is intended that in instances where a Steward (acting in his/her official capacity) participates in activities other than those described in Sections 11 and 12 which are initiated and/or requested by management, such Steward may request a workload adjustment. Such adjustments will be granted assuming there is documentation to support the Steward’s claim that the time involved in such activities during the month is more than de minimus. An example of such activity would be participation on a Labor-Management Committee which is a mutual benefit to both management and labor.
This clarification is not intended to supersede Coalition specific Article 10 provisions.
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
110
APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
DPS Understanding:
Despite the above clarification, DDS management is willing to consider individual Steward requests for adjustment to existing work production standards where such Stewards submit a monthly activity report of work time spent on activities outlined in paragraph #1 and/or #2 above and which demonstrates that the time involved was other than de minimus. Such workload adjustment is limited to DDS Stewards in the Disability Analyst Classification series due to their high production standards. For example, if a Steward’s monthly activity report demonstrates that five percent (5%) of the Steward’s time had been spent on official Union activities, management could decide to adjust the Steward's work production standards up to a maximum of five percent (5%). A determination of de minimus will be based on the time involved being up to two (2) hours per week.
The Union agrees that the consideration described in the previous paragraph will not establish a past practice for other than DDS Disability Analyst Stewards nor can it be referenced in any other forum.
Lastly, this understanding will replace any and all previous understandings within DDS.

Article 21.1C--Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
Alternate Dispute Resolution (Employment)
This Agreement is entered into between the Department of Administrative Services (Employer), on behalf of the Employment Department (Agency), and the SEIU Local 503, OPEU (Union).
Objective: To enhance previous Letters of Agreement that committed the Employment Department to an alternate dispute resolution process and improve utilization of mediation to resolve issues at the lowest possible level. Participation in the process does not waive the employee’s rights under the contract to grieve.
1.	When an issue needing resolution arises, the employee, supervisor, and/or other affected Parties will attempt to meet in an attempt to resolve the issue at the lowest possible level. If the issue is an alleged contract violation, this meeting will occur within the thirty (30) day grievance filing period.
2.	If the issue is resolved, this settlement will be summarized and kept in the section. If it was an alleged contract violation, mediated resolutions shall be non-precedential and shall not be cited by either Party or their agents or members in any arbitration or fact-finding proceedings.
3.	If the issue is not resolved through a meeting, resolution may be sought through:
(a)	the local Labor-Management Committee; or
(b)	mediation. Mediation is voluntary on part of all participants. The conclusion of mediation can be initiated by either Party or the mediator.
If mediation of an alleged contract violation is requested within the thirty (30) day filing period, the timelines for filing the grievance are automatically held in abeyance. If mediation does not result in resolution of an alleged contract violation, the employee may file a grievance with the Agency Head as Step 2 of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) calendar days of the conclusion of mediation.
If the request for mediation is submitted by the employee at any time in any step after a grievance is filed, the grievance timelines are automatically held in abeyance. If resolution is not achieved through mediation, the employee may file a grievance at the step following the last completed step of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) calendar days of the conclusion of mediation. Mediation panels will consist of one (1) mediator from the Agency’s Office of Human Resources and one (1) mediator represented by SEIU.
To request mediation, all affected Parties must sign a completed Mediation Request Form and submit to the SEIU Local 471 President or Agency’s Office of Human Resources Manager. The President and Office of Human

APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
Resources Manager shall assign a mediation panel within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the request is received. The Parties will have thirty (30) calendar days to resolve the issue. This timeline can be extended by mutual agreement. Mediation sessions will be conducted on Agency time.
To ensure that the terms of the settlement are achieved and to hold managers accountable for settlements being met, copies of mediated settlements shall be given to the Parties, and the supervisor’s manager where the issue arose. A copy will also be sent to the Office of Human Resources for statistical purposes and placed into a confidential mediation file. The mediated settlement will not . become part of the employee’s official personnel file.
Mediation sessions and any settlements reached in these sessions will be confidential. Stewards may review mediation settlements in the Office of Human Resources in the course of representing an employee in a grievance matter.
The mediation process will not be applicable to the following circumstances:
1)	issues already mediated, unless both Parties agree that the fundamental issue is not resolved;
2)	the issue is being addressed outside the Agency (i.e., BOLI, ERB, workers compensation or court);
3)	non-workplace disputes;
4)	disciplinary actions;
5)	letters of expectation; and,
6)	performance appraisals.
The Agency and Union will make quarterly reports to the Worksite Committee on the mediation program.
(c)	the grievance process. The first meeting would serve as the first step and the grievance would be sent to the Agency Head as Step 2. The employee and supervisor will submit a letter of explanation for proceeding directly to Step 2 of the grievance process without requesting mediation. The timelines in the Contract apply.
Implementation Procedures:
The President and Office of Human Resources Manager shall, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the successor Agreement becomes effective, meet to:
1.	Update and implement an Agency communications plan.
2.	Review and update the current procedure for assigning mediation panels. There will be a review of the current mediator list.
3.	Update the training plan for mediators, if such a plan is needed.
4.	Review the quarterly reporting process and update it, if needed. Quarterly reports may include, but not be limited to the number of mediations, the subject matter mediated, the number of agreements and any program issues that are being addressed.
The above work will be completed within sixty (60) calendar days from the first meeting.

Article 32.2C--Overtime
Overtime Selection: CNA Volunteers (OSH)
This Letter of Agreement is entered into between the SEIU Local 503, OPEU and the State of Oregon by and through the Labor Relations Unit of the Department of Administrative Services, on behalf of the Oregon State Hospital. The Parties agree to the following pilot protocol for the assignment and equalization of overtime opportunity. For purposes of this process, the Portland campus will be considered as one (1) program. For purposes of this process, the float pool employees are assigned to a program area and available for overtime.
1.	To implement Article 32.2C,E,G, Section 3, and equalize voluntary overtime as equitably as feasible, in the program, the opportunity for voluntary overtime shifts will be offered in the following order:
(a)	to qualified employees assigned to work in the program where the overtime occurs;
(b)	if no volunteer is assigned from within the program, the opportunity will be offered as overtime to qualified employees outside the program area.
Each overtime opportunity offered or worked will count as one (1) unit for purposes of equalization, regardless of the amount of time actually offered or worked. Voluntary overtime will be equalized as equitably as feasible within two (2) week time periods. Overtime units from the previous two (2) week period will be used to determine equalization for each scheduling period. The purpose of this Letter is to clarify the definition of volunteers outside the program.
2.	Volunteers outside the program must meet the following criteria:
(a)	The employee must hold either a non-encumbered CNA or LPN;
(b)	The employee must be current in all unit mandatory training;
(c)	The employee must hold a position at Salary Range 20S or below;
(d)	The employee must have successfully completed program orientation or worked an overtime on the program within the past ninety (90) days; and
(e)	Acceptance of the overtime assignment will not interfere with the employee’s regular work schedule.
It is understood that OSH is not responsible for providing employees with hours so they may qualify for recertification as a CNA or LPN.
Qualified employees who sign up for a voluntary overtime opportunity are expected to work the hours. If an emergency occurs, the qualified employee must notify the appropriate supervisor as soon as practical. Except as specifically modified by this Agreement, nothing requires or abridges management’s right to assign or re-assign individuals or groups of qualified employees to regular or overtime shifts where they are needed.
Prior to implementation of any mandate, the Institution will exhaust all other options, including on-site volunteers, and a call list of qualified employees. These lists will exclude employees on vacation, sick leave or compensatory time.
3.	For purposes of mandatory overtime, there shall be one (1) list for each shift per program; one (1) for day shift, swing shift and night shift. This list shall be comprised of all employees assigned to work each shift in each program. This list shall include regular duty employees, float pool, and any other sub program assigned to work in an established program.
Mandatory overtime shall be assigned on a rotating basis from on-shift qualified employees in the program where the overtime occurs. If it is necessary to mandate an employee, the Agency will first offer the opportunity to the qualified employees on the program mandate list. If an employee on the program mandate list volunteers, their name will be moved to the bottom of the mandate list. The employee will have the choice of either working the mandated overtime on their own ward/work unit or on the ward/work unit where the overtime is needed.
Except in an emergency involving public health and safety, employees may not be mandated to work overtime on a day immediately preceding a regularly scheduled day off or an approved vacation of one (1) week or more, or once per fiscal year for vacations of less than one (1) week. Only the Superintendent or his/her designee can determine if an emergency involving public health and safety exists. If an employee is bypassed, he/she shall remain on the top of the list for the next mandatory overtime.

After the maximum sixty (60) hours of compensatory time have been accrued, a FLSA non-exempt employee who works authorized overtime directly related to the conduct of the Hunter Survey shall be eligible for time and one-half (1 %) pay rather than compensatory time off for working overtime in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.
2.	Notwithstanding Article 32.3, Section 4(b) of the Master Agreement, a FLSA exempt employee who works authorized overtime directly related to the conduct of the Hunter Survey shall be eligible for one (1) hour of straight time pay, or compensatory time off up to a maximum accrual of sixty (60) hours of compensatory time during the entire period of the Survey season, for every one (1) hour of overtime in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.

3.	FLSA non-exempt and exempt employees who are assigned to work authorized overtime in connection to their regularly assigned duties shall be compensated pursuant to Article 32, Section 4 and Article 32.3, Section 5(c) of the Master Agreement.
4.	The opportunity for the overtime will be on an equitable basis and will be available to all regular status and full-time trial service employees at all locations where the Bridge software is available, subject to staffing needs and advance supervisor approval. Prior to the beginning of the annual hunt survey season, the Agency will
provide notification of a ten (10) workday application window via e-mail to the ODFW All Staff distribution list. During this ten (10) workday application window, employees must apply as directed to be considered to participate in survey work, consistent with the requirements per #5 of this Agreement. A random system will be used to assign employees from this pool of interested employees. Employees who apply after the ten (10) workday application window has closed will have their name added to the bottom of the list in the order received. Staffing assignments for late season surveys (e.g., damage hunts, spring bear hunts, etc.) will be made by re-randomizing the existing list of names, including those names added to the list after the initial ten (10) workday application window, and employees will be assigned dependent on the specific staffing needs forthat survey segment.
5.	To participate in the surveys, employees must have advance authorization from their supervisor and must commit to working at least three (3) days a week from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. and a minimum of twenty-five (25) work hours to the survey project. The number of employees assigned any given week will be dependent on staffing needs as determined by management. Employees are not authorized to conduct survey calls during periods of assigned on-call, nor during a workweek when they are observing a furlough. Employees are not entitled to a break while conducting survey calls between 5:00 p.m to 8:30 p.m., nor are employees authorized to use the internet for personal use during this time period. Employees conducting calls will be monitored to ensure effective and productive calling practices, and will be removed from the list for the duration of the survey season covered by this Letter of Agreement, if there is evidence of abuses of that privilege. Employees who wish to participate must have advance authorization from their supervisor.
6.	This Agreement shall become effective upon the date of the last signature below and shall automatically expire on the last day of the 2009-2010 Hunter Survey Season, approximately June 30, 2010.
7.	This Agreement shall not establish a precedent in any current or future negotiations between the Parties.

The purpose of this Agreement is to provide employees who have attained regular status in an SEIU-represented position and who, in the past, would have entered into job rotation agreements with the Legislative Branch, the ability to be reemployed by their former agency into their former classification in which they held regular status.
The Parties agree that Article 45 and all agency-specific coalition language found in Articles 45.1 through 45.5 does not apply to the reemployment of an Executive Branch employee who was employed by the Legislative Branch and then requests reemployment with the former Executive Branch Agency. Specifically, the Agency layoff list does not take precedence over this reemployment, and agencies are not required to comply with any agency-specific language regarding posting of vacancies.
The Parties further agree that the time worked for the Legislative Branch is considered state service for purposes of seniority.
This Agreement is effective until the expiration of the 2009-2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, and may be extended by mutual agreement.

APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
Services in calculating employee Layoff Service Dates following reorganization and not wanting to unnecessarily upset current employees, the Parties agree to the following understanding concerning Articles 70-Layoff and 70.1M-Geographic Area for Layoff (DHS Non-lnstitutions):
The Parties agree that the Department will not have to calculate and post Layoff Service Dates for employees in classifications affected by layoff as long as a vacancy exists (which management intends to fill) in the affected classification within the designated area of layoff. This is predicated on a vacant position, which DHS Non-lnstitutions intends to fill, always being considered as the “least senior” position in any classification. In instances where a vacancy does not exist within the affected employee’s designated area of layoff (immediate worksite/building or current District), the Department agrees to calculate and post Layoff Service Dates in accordance with Article 70, Section 2(a) provisions.
Implementation of this understanding will be on a trial basis for the duration of the 2009-2011 Contract term.
LETTER OF AGREEMENT 70.1 M-07-151
Article 70.1M--Layoff
Designation of Classification for Layoff (DHS)
This Letter of Agreement is entered into between the Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit (Employer), on behalf of the Department of Human Services (DHS) and SEIU Local 503, OPEU (Union).
The purpose of this Agreement is to clarify the classification to be utilized during the DHS Layoff scheduled for 1-17-06 in instances where an affected employee has a new or revised class allocation appeal or reclassification appeal pending final resolution at the time seniority credits are frozen on or about 11-1-05. The intent of the Parties is to identify the Article 70 and related sub Article provisions as having a priority over the Article 81 provisions when both processes are occurring simultaneously.
Specifically, it is agreed that:
1.	Classification for layoff purposes is the employee's classification of record on the date the seniority list is frozen.
2.	Classification changes (reallocations, reclassifications) approved for implementation after the seniority list is frozen, but before the layoff effective date, will not be implemented until the day after the layoff date at the earliest and shall not be arbitrarily delayed.
3.	Both the incumbent and bumping in employee cannot equally benefit from a successful change in Admin or Trades Study allocation change, whether requested by the Agency or employee appeal (e.g., both be reallocated, both have recall rights to the higher class, etc.).
(a)	Bumped out employees should benefit from reallocation for pay purposes up to the layoff date and be eligible for recall back to the reallocated class.
(b)	Bumping in employees should receive benefit for pay purposes beginning the effective date of landing in the new class until or unless management removes the higher level duties. Recall rights should be to the employee's former classification, rather than to the newly designated class for
the bumped into position.
4.	Both the incumbent and bumping in employee cannot equally benefit from a successful Agency requested reclassification or employee initiated classification appeal.
(a)	Bumped out employees should benefit from reclassification for pay purposes up to the layoff date.
(b)	Bumping in employees should receive benefit for pay purposes beginning the effective date of landing in the new class until or unless management removes the higher level duties. Recall rights should be to the employee’s former classification, rather than to the newly designated class for the bumped into position.
5.	Pay will be reconciled, as appropriate, for employees laid off or bumped out of positions affected by a successful reallocation or reclassification.
6.	This Letter of Agreement is intended to be precedent setting.
7.	This Letter of Agreement will continue for the duration of the 2009-2011 Contract term.

The Parties agree to the following:
Section 1.	Application.
This Agreement covers all regular status SEIU Local 503, OPEU-represented Agency employees whose position description or assigned fire duties requires an Incident Command System (ICS) certification with an associated fitness level.
Section 2.	Work Capacity Testing.
The Agency will utilize Work Capacity Tests (WCT) consisting of three (3) separate identified fitness levels in order to ensure that Agency employees assigned fire related duties in an ICS position with an identified fitness level meet the standard fitness level for their respective ICS position. The fitness level for each position shall be identified and shall be included in position descriptions no later than January 1, 2006, and shall identify the duties assigned which justify the fitness level. Employees will not be allowed to participate in a test more arduous than their ICS certification fitness level requires.
Work Capacity Testing is divided into three (3) separate levels of testing, depending on the fitness level associated with individual ICS positions as follows:
•	Arduous: this Pack Test consists of completing a three (3) mile hike with a forty-five (45) pound pack over level terrain in forty-five (45) minutes or less.
•	Moderate: this Field Test consists of completing a two (2) mile hike with a twenty-five (25) pound pack over level terrain in thirty (30) minutes or less.
•	Light: this Walk Test consists of completing a one (1) mile
hike over level terrain with no weight in sixteen (16) minutes or less.
Section 3.	Pre-Test Medical Screenings.
The Agency will utilize a two (2) step risk screening process for all employees required to take a WCT. Both screenings must be completed prior to taking any level of WCT. The purpose of the two (2) step risk screening process will be to ensure that Agency employees can take the WCT or that they can perform their assigned fire duties without taking the test. Pre-test screenings will be provided to the employee at no cost, unless the employee chooses to use their own medical provider.
Cardiovascular Risk Assessment: This first assessment will be utilized to determine employee’s level of cardiovascular risk, if any, and will be the first step in preparation for the second screening. This first step of the screening will consist of the following four components:
•	blood glucose level identification;
•	cholesterol level identification;
•	blood pressure measure; and,
•	body mass index calculation.
Health Screening Questionnaire: This will be the second step of the pre-test medical screening and will utilize employee information gathered from the previous Risk Assessment. Employee responses to this questionnaire will be masked (hidden) from any reviewer, preventing medical information from being seen by the reviewer. Employee specific health related information will be kept completely confidential throughout this process.
Pre-test medical screenings and WCT will be conducted on employee paid time.
Section 4,	Test Administrators.
Test Administrators will inform employees of the results of the Health Screening Questionnaire. Test Administrators will be certified as Test Administrators.
Section 5.	Medical Release.
Medical certification from a licensed physician of the employee's ability to take the WCT will be required when:
•	The pre-test medical screening indicates the employee should not take the WCT without physician approval; or,
•	The employee knows they have a medical condition that would require physician approval to take the test.
Medical certification from a licensed physician of the employee's ability to perform their assigned fire duties will be required when:
•	The employee fails the WCT after their second attempt; or,
•	The Employer has observed that the employee has difficulty
performing their assigned fire duties.
Section 6.	Test Administration.
Test Administrators are responsible for the collection of the Health Screening Questionnaire prior to allowing employees to test. Test Administrators are responsible for ensuring that while any employee testing occurs a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) is present at the test site and has defibrillation capability on site. Section 7. Costs.
(a)	The pre-test medical screenings and WCT will be provided by the Department of Forestry at no cost to employees required to take the test.
(b)	Releases obtained from licensed physicians as described in Section 5 will not be provided by the Department of Forestry. Any costs associated with those releases will be the responsibility of the employee.
Section 8. Conditioning Program.
The Employer shall develop a recommended WCT conditioning program in conjunction with Work Capacity Testing, as a component of the Statewide Safety Committee mission. The conditioning program will be completed no later than December 31, 2005. This conditioning

program will be made available to all DOF employees free of charge. Section 9. Alternatives for Permanent Employees.
(a)	Employees whose terms and conditions of hire did not include passing the WCT, who made a good faith effort to pass the WCT and are unable to pass the WCT, and are unable to obtain a medical release to perform their assigned duties shall be assigned alternate work consistent with their fitness level for the duration of the fire season.
(b)	Employees whose terms and conditions of employment did include the WCT, who made a good faith effort to pass the WCT and are unable to do so, and are unable to obtain a medical release to perform their assigned tasks, may be provided suitable work, if available, consistent with their fitness level, for the duration of the fire season.
Section 10.	Alternatives for Seasonal Employees.
Employees who made a good faith effort to pass the WCT, and are unable to do so, or are unable to secure a medical release to perform their assigned work will be recalled and, based on a review of their position description, provided suitable work, provided such work is available for the duration of the fire season. Alternatively, at the employee’s choice, he/she may elect not to be recalled in which case he/she shall have his/her name returned to the recall list for the following season.
If, in the following season, the employee is again unable to pass the WCT or secure a medical release to perform their assigned work, and they were assigned suitable and available work in the prior season, he/she shall have his/her name returned to the recall list for the following season.
Following the fire season in which they have not been employed by DOF, if the employee is unable to pass the WCT or secure a medical release to perform their assigned work, they will be deemed to have resigned.
Section 11.	Statistics.
DOF will maintain statistics during the course of this LOA period to include the following items of information:
(a)	Employment status of those taking the WCT, i.e., seasonal or permanent by area;
(b)	Numbers of persons who take the WCT, those who pass and those who fail by employment status;
(c)	Number unable to take the WCT by employment status; and,
(d)	Number of persons provided alternative work and the type of alternate work performed by employment status and area.
Between January and April 2008, the Parties will meet to review the statistics for the previous two (2) seasons.
Section 12.	Effective Date.
This Letter of Agreement continues until June 30, 2011, unless extended or eliminated by mutual agreement of the Parties.

2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oregon CBA
134
APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
Employees who are mandated to take a greater number of mandatory unpaid time off than closure days, based on Section 1, will take the remaining mandatory unpaid time off as float days consistent with Section 5 below.
5.	Floating Mandatory Unpaid Time Off
(a)	For agencies or programs designated by the Employer as non-closures (see list provided by the Employer on 6/22/09), employees will have their choice of days off, subject to operating needs. In the event that an agency receives additional positions from the 09-11 Legislature, the Employer will notify the Union of those positions that are subject to float days.
(b)	Employees subject to floating mandatory unpaid time off will submit a mandatory unpaid time off request form to their supervisors at least thirty (30) days prior to the start of each quarter and supervisors will respond no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the start of each quarter.
(c)	Mandatory unpaid time off requests for the same days will be determined pursuant to the specific provisions contained in Article 66.1 - 66.5 and related Agency provisions.
(d)	In an effort to ensure that the scheduling of time off is distributed throughout the term of this Agreement, mandatory unpaid time off will be scheduled on a quarterly basis unless there is mutual agreement between an employee and his or her supervisor to schedule more days in some quarters and fewer in others, but in no case no more than two (2) days (sixteen (16) hours) in a month.
(e)	If the mandatory unpaid time off is not scheduled or taken within the applicable quarter, then management reserves the right to ensure the mandatory unpaid time off is rescheduled and taken within the same quarter, if possible, or next quarter, (except for the last quarter in the biennium, during which management may reschedule such time during the same quarter).
(f)	The Agency shall not incur any penalty or overtime payment for adjustments to employees’ schedules not to exceed a thirty-two (32)-hour workweek.
6.	No employee will be required to use mandatory unpaid time off on a holiday. An employee is not precluded from requesting to use mandatory unpaid time off on a holiday pursuant to the above provisions.
7.	Unless required by law, no employee shall be authorized to substitute any other types of unpaid absences or paid leave to replace mandatory unpaid time off.
8.	If a closure day is scheduled on a day in which an employee is scheduled to work more or less than an eight (8)-hour workday, the employee, with supervisory approval, will adjust his or her schedule in a manner which is consistent with the practice that is used during a week in which there is a holiday. In either case, the employee’s schedule will not exceed a thirty-two (32)-hour workweek. The Agency shall not incur any penalty or overtime payment for adjusting the employee’s schedule.
9.	An employee shall not work on a date designated as mandatory unpaid time off. However, in emergency situations based on operational needs, the Agency head or designee may require the employee to work. Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Employer shall pay any appropriate call-in or penalty pay for requiring an employee to work on a scheduled day off. If the Employer requires an employee to work on a date designated as mandatory unpaid time off, the employee will have his or her choice of an alternate day, subject to the operating needs and the provisions of Section 5. A mandatory unpaid time off day, if canceled, may not be rescheduled more than once.
10.	A regularly scheduled sixteen (16)-hour shift worker will be allowed to work eight (8) hours of the shift scheduled on a mandatory unpaid time off day.
11.	Should a designated closure date fall on the employee’s regularly scheduled day off, subject to Agency approval, the employee shall take the mandatory unpaid time off on an alternate workday.
(a)	If the alternate time is not scheduled or taken within the applicable quarter, then management reserves the right to ensure the mandatory unpaid time off is rescheduled and taken within the same quarter, or next quarter (except for the last quarter in the biennium, during which management may reschedule such time during the same quarter).
(b)	The Agency shall not incur any penalty or overtime payment for adjustments to employees’ schedules not to exceed a thirty-two (32)-hour workweek.
12.	Mandatory unpaid time off will not count as a break-in-service for purposes of seniority or employee salary eligibility date.
13.	Mandatory unpaid time off shall not add to the length of an employee’s trial service period.
14.	Deductions from the pay of a FLSA-exempt employee, for absences due to a budget required mandatory unpaid time off, shall not disqualify the employee from being paid on a salary basis except in the workweek in which the mandatory unpaid time off occurs and for which the employee’s pay is accordingly reduced.
15.	If a FLSA-exempt employee is permitted to work in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek in which the employee takes mandatory unpaid time off, then such employee shall be eligible for pay at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2x) for hours in excess of forty (40) hours that workweek.
16.	For payroll purposes, mandatory unpaid time off shall be assigned a specific payroll code(s).
LETTER OF AGREEMENT 00.00-09-193 Mandatory Unpaid Time Off Clarifications For Implementation
The Letter of Agreement is between the State of Oregon, acting through its Department of Administrative Services (DAS) (Employer) and the SEIU Local 503, OPEU (Union). The parties agree to the following clarifications for implementation of the mandatory unpaid time off Letter of Agreement #00.00-09-189.
135
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
1.	For purposes of a guideline, the tiered obligation for floating mandatory unpaid time off days has been equally split between the fiscal years in the biennium.
Tier	Sept. 2009 -June 2010	July 2010- June 2011
1. $2450 and below	5	5
2. $2451 - $3100	6	6
3. $3101 and above	7	7
2.	Requests for Floating Mandatory Unpaid Time Off Days for September through December 2009.
Since the requirement to submit requests for floating mandatory unpaid time off days cannot be submitted thirty (30) days prior to the start of the quarter, the following will apply for such requests for September 2009 and the October-December 2009 quarter. Any time through October 15, 2009, employees may request to take up to two (2) float mandatory unpaid time off days in each month in this quarter. The supervisor will have up to fifteen (15) days to respond to the employee’s request for the mandatory unpaid time off day.
3.	Scheduling Floating Mandatory Unpaid Time Off for Newly-Hired, Reemployed, Recalled and Transferred Employees.
At the time of an employment offer letter, the employee shall be given the dates in the current and/or next quarter that have been designated as floating mandatory unpaid time off days.
4.	Seasonal Employee - Calculation of Mandatory Unpaid Time Off Obligation.
Full-time seasonal employee’s mandatory unpaid time off days obligation shall be determined by using the following formula as a guideline:
(MS-TM) « TO
Formula Description:
MS = Estimated number of months the seasonal employee will work during the period in which mandatory unpaid time off must be taken.
TM = Total number of months during the 2009-2011 biennium during which mandatory unpaid time off must be taken (which is twenty-two (22) months).
TO = Total number of mandatory unpaid time off days required for the biennium for the salary tier for the employee.
Example: The employee's seasons include the months of May through October 2010 and May through October 2011. The seasonal employee is expected to work both seasons. However, since the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement begins September 1, 2009 and ends on June 30, 2011, only September and October 2009, May through October 2010, and May and June in 2011 count for determining the mandatory unpaid time off obligation. Consequently, there are nine (9) months of the employee's seasons in the biennium that count. The seasonal employee is in the top salary tier which has a maximum of fourteen (14) mandatory unpaid time off days. The calculation is the following:
(MS - TM) = (9 months + 22 months) = .409
TO = 14 days
(9-22) x 14 = 5.73 days
Rounding to nearest whole number = 6 mandatory unpaid time off days (8 hours each).
Part-time seasonal employee's mandatory unpaid time off obligation is prorated based on the scheduled hours for the part-time seasonal employee in the month. The same formula is used for part-time employees to calculate the number of days they are obligated to take. The mandatory unpaid time off obligation shall be prorated using the following formula as a guideline:
(SSH/FTH) x 8 = MH
Formula Description:
SSH = The scheduled hours in a month for the part-time seasonal employee.
FTH = The number of full-time hours in a month.
8 = The number of hours in a full-time mandatory unpaid time off day obligation.
MH = The number of mandatory unpaid time off hours required for a mandatory unpaid time off day for the part-time seasonal employee.
Example: Using the facts in the example used for full-time calculation (six (6) mandatory unpaid time off days), but adding that the part-time seasonal is scheduled to work three-quarter (3/4) time for the month. Three-quarter (3/4) time is equivalent to one-hundred thirty (130) hours (i.e., three-quarters (3/4) of the one-hundred seventy-three and thirty-three one-hundredths (173.33) full-time hours in a month). The calculation is:
(130 hours / 173.33 hours) x 8 = 6 hours
The three-quarter (3/4) time employee would take three-quarters (3/4) of a workday (i.e., six (6) hours) off for a mandatory unpaid time off day scheduled for the month.
Seasonal employees employed multiple seasons and/or by multiple agencies, will be dealt with on an Agency-by-Agency basis to determine the number of mandatory unpaid time off days.
5.	Demotions, Promotion, Reclassification Resulting in a Change in Salary Tier for Mandatory Unpaid Time Off.
The effective date for a change in salary tier and a change in the mandatory unpaid time off obligation of an employee will be the effective date of the personnel action. However, if the effective date is after the fifteenth (15th) of the last month in a quarter, the change will be effective the following quarter.
6.	Unpaid Leaves (Including FMLA/OFLA, Military Leave, Workers Comp, Leave Without Pay) During Closures.
For employees observing mandatory unpaid closure days, if an employee is on leave without pay when a mandatory unpaid time off closure day occurs, the employee will not be required to make up the missed mandatory unpaid time off day.
2009-2011 SEIU Local 503, OPEU/State of Oreson CBA
136
APPENDIX A - LETTERS OF AGREEMENT
7.	Unpaid Leaves (Including FMLA/OFLA, Military Leave, Workers Comp, Leave Without Pay) and Float Day Observance.
For employees observing mandatory unpaid float days, if an employee’s scheduled mandatory unpaid time off day occurs when the employee is on leave without pay, the employee will be required to take or schedule the mandatory unpaid float day, unless the employee is on leave without pay for the entire calendar month.
If an employee returns to work the fifteenth (15th) day or before in the last month of a calendar quarter, the employee shall schedule and take the mandatory unpaid float day in that quarter, or, with approval, may schedule one (1) mandatory unpaid float day in the following quarter.
8.	Employees Returning to Work from Unpaid Leave Without Pay in the Last Month of a Calendar Quarter.
If an employee returns to work from Leave Without Pay after the fifteenth (15th) day in the last month of a calendar quarter, the employee will not be required to take the floating mandatory unpaid time off for that quarter.
9.	Scheduling of Vacation and Mandatory Unpaid Time Off.
In Agencies where vacation schedules or comp time off must be requested in advance and the advance requests cover periods of time beyond the quarterly scheduling of mandatory unpaid time off days, the prescheduled vacation or comp time off shall take precedence over scheduling of mandatory unpaid time off days. However, the quarterly scheduling of unpaid time off shall take precedence over short term vacation or comp time off requests.
Once mandatory unpaid time off has been scheduled, requests for vacation may be denied for operational reasons and cannot cause a rescheduling of mandatory unpaid time off days of other employees.
Employees may schedule a mandatory unpaid time off day as part of their vacation request, (e.g., an employee may request a week’s vacation that includes a mandatory unpaid time off day). Also, if an employee requests and is approved for vacation in the future, at the time of submitting his/her quarterly mandatory unpaid time off request form, for the quarter in which the vacation is approved, the employee may request to substitute mandatory unpaid time off for pending vacation time. However, in no case shall an employee take more than two (2) mandatory unpaid time off days in a month. If seniority is used as a tiebreaker or to bump a preapproved vacation, there shall be no substitution with mandatory unpaid time off days.
10.	Scheduling of Pre-Approved Paid Sick Leave and Mandatory Unpaid Time Off.
Employees who have pre-scheduled, paid sick leave (e.g., elective surgery, maternity leave, etc) may substitute a mandatory unpaid time off day for the pre-approved paid sick leave. The request to substitute is made at the time of submitting his/her quarterly mandatory unpaid time off request form for the quarter in which the sick leave is approved. However, in no case shall an employee take more than two (2) mandatory unpaid time off days in a month.
11.	Employees Called In to Work on a Mandatory Unpaid Time Off Day Off.
In the event an employee is called in to work on a date designated as a mandatory unpaid time off day due to operational needs, the employee and supervisor shall arrange to take the remainder of the mandatory unpaid time off at a mutually agreeable time. The remaining mandatory unpaid time off, with approval from the supervisor, may be taken during the employee’s workweek, as long as the workweek does not exceed thirty-two (32) hours, or at another time. If the remaining hours of mandatory unpaid time off to be made up are less than an employee’s full scheduled workday, the employee may either split a workday (mandatory unpaid hours plus regular work hours) to make a full work shift or make alternate arrangements for the remainder of the shift, including but not limited to using appropriate accrued leave. If the remaining portion of the mandatory unpaid time off is not mutually scheduled or taken within the applicable quarter, then management reserves the right to ensure the remaining portion of the mandatory unpaid time off day is rescheduled and/or taken no later than the following quarter.
12.	Adjusting the Mandatory Unpaid Time Off Day Off Obligation for Employees Hired After September 1, 2009.
Employees hired after September 1, 2009, will have their mandatory unpaid time off obligation adjusted for the time remaining to June 30, 2011. The following table identifies the obligation remaining for new hires by calendar quarter.
13.	Changing Closure or Float Days for Operational Needs (SEIU).
If an Agency or group of employees within a program identifies specific operational needs for a program to change from observing closures rather than float days, or vice versa, or change from observing a specific scheduled closure date, the employees or Agency may submit a request to the Union and DAS Labor Relations to consider a change. Requests must be submitted prior to October 1, 2009. The Union and DAS will review requests and must mutually agree that the issue is appropriate for the Agency and Union representatives to discuss during a set period. Agreements to modify the Letter of Agreement must be mutually agreed to between DAS and the Union.
14.	Non-Emergency Changes to Employees Observing Fixed Closure Days
The Letter of Agreement does not preclude schedule changes pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Employees who are attending or presenting at conferences or traveling on closure days may convert the closure day to a float day for that quarter.
For Board and Commission meetings scheduled on a closure day, that closure day may be converted into a float day.

NOTES:
1 Employees who retire or otherwise separate from the State prior to the end of the biennium are required to schedule and take the number of mandatory unpaid time off days identified for their separation date prior to separating. The mandatory unpaid time off days must be scheduled quarterly, unless an alternate plan is agreed upon between the employee and supervisor, to ensure the obligation is completed prior to separation.
2 Break points for separation dates are based either on closure dates or the end of a month (typically the day before a retirement effective date).
3 An employee hired after June 15, 2010 will not be required to take the float mandatory unpaid time off day for that FY. However, the obligation shall be taken in the subsequent fiscal year.
