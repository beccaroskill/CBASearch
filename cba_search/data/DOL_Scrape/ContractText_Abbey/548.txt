discharged during this probationary period. Seniority shall mean length of continuous service in the Meijer combination store operation of the Employer and upon completion of the probationary period shall be dated from the first day worked. Seniority shall be applied according to the terms of the agreement.
Section 2 Seniority shall be of two types, full-time and part-time. Full-time seniority shall be convertible to part-time. Part-time seniority shall not be lost by transfer to full-time work. In no case will part-time employees accumulate seniority over full-time employees. If two or more employees have the same full-time seniority dates, part-time seniority will determine who is more senior. When two or more employees have the same part-time seniority date, the most senior employees will be determined by the lowest last four digits of their social security number.
Section 3 A regular employee’s seniority shall be broken if he quits, if he is discharged for cause, if he fails to report for work for three (3) consecutive work days without notifying the Employer, or if an employee is laid off continuously for twelve (12) months or his length of service, whichever is less. A regular employee’s seniority shall be considered broken if he fails to report for work while on layoff within seven (7) calendar days after being notified to report unless extended by mutual agreement.
Section 4 Where there are open jobs for permanent full-time vacancies, the Employer will survey part-time employees within the department and classification in that facility where the opening exists, who have designated, in writing, their desire for full-time work. The most senior part-time employee indicating in writing a desire for the job in that department and classification will receive the job, provided such employee possesses the necessary level of skill and ability and is fully available for full-time work. The foregoing shall not apply to change in assignments within a job classification. These full-time openings may be based on structuring full-time shifts consisting of afternoon and/or evening and/or early morning schedules. It is understood that these full-time openings will include Friday, Saturday and Sunday work in most cases. Employees receiving full-time jobs under this Section will remain on such shift assignment until the Employer determines a permanent full-time opening exists on an alternate shift. Once this determination is made, the full-time employees will be surveyed in line of seniority by department and classification for the opening. Lateral bids will be allowed at the discretion of the employer provided such employee possesses the reasonable ability and is capable of performing the job.
In the event there is no interest within the department, classification in that facility, the job will be posted for seven (7) calendar days in that facility and the most senior employee bidding within that unit and lines area where the full-time opening exists (hardlines, fashion area, foods, service) will receive the job.

Employees awarded jobs under this provision shall be given a ninety (90) day break-in period to familiarize himself with the job duties by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level. If, for justifiable reasons, the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level during this break-in period, the employee shall be returned to his original job, providing he has the seniority.
Section 5 When management determines there is a part-time opening as a Cashier or Grocery Clerk, consideration will be given to the most senior active part-time employee in the highest classification that has signified their interest in writing within the last six (6) months from the time of the opening, and has one (1) year of seniority.
Employees awarded jobs under this provision shall move to the rate in the new classification closest to their existing rate. They shall be given a sixty (60) day break-in period to familiarize himself with the job duties by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level. If, for justifiable reasons, the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level, the employee shall be returned to his original job providing he has the seniority.
Section 6 When a part-time employee works sixteen (16) consecutive weeks in one (1) department in any single unit an average of thirty-six (36) hours per week, excluding holiday weeks, for those sixteen (16) weeks, he shall be reclassified as full-time status with full-time seniority for scheduling, layoff and job bidding purposes. Hours credited are those hours actually worked. Hours worked in replacement of an employee on Worker’s Compensation, disability leave, or personal maternity leave, or hours on the posted schedule that are worked in replacement of another employee and/or hours worked during October 1 through December 31, will not be considered in computing the thirty-six (36) hour average or counted as part of the sixteen (16) consecutive week period specified above.
When a full-time employee works sixteen (16) consecutive weeks and averages less than thirty-two (32) hours per week for those sixteen (16) weeks, he may be reclassified as part-time for scheduling, layoff and job bidding purposes dating back to the beginning of the sixteen (16) week period. Hours credited are those hours actually worked.
Full-time jobs created under this provision will result in full-time shifts consisting of afternoon and/or evening and/or early morning schedules. It is understood that these full-time openings will include Friday, Saturday, and Sunday work in most cases. Employees receiving full-time jobs under this section will remain on such shift assignment until the Employer determines a permanent full-time opening exists on days. Once this
determination is made the full-time employees on afternoon and/or	^g^y!M p»*hmjv

Following notification of layoff, employees with seniority may exercise their seniority in the following manner.
Full-time employees with more than one (1) year of seniority must:
a.	Accept part-time hours within their department and classification and shall maintain a full-time status for a twelve (12) week period. At the end of this twelve (12) week period, the full-time employee shall be reclassified as a permanent part-time employee, or
b.	Bump the least senior employee within his classification and facility in his expanded department, or
c.	Bump the least senior employee within his department, classification and status in another store, or

b. Accept a layoff to the street.
Any full-time or part-time employee who works in a department where there is a lower classification, the employee who is being laid off initially will have the option of bumping the least senior employee in the next lower classification in their status and department If this option is taken, the employee will receive the rate commensurate with their seniority in the lower classification.

1.	Grocery and Produce
2.	Hardlines
3.	Fashion area
4.	Bakery, Ice Cream & Cafeteria
5.	Specialty Food Service Areas	(except Meat Service Area)
6.	All other departments will be treated as individual departments

Section 2 Recall Once a decision is made to take a layoff to the street, the employee must await recall to their original classification, status, department and facility. The original classification, department, status and facility is defined as that job the employee held when first affected by layoff. The Employer will recall in line of seniority by classification, status, department and facility.
Employees recalled as provided in this section, will be required to report for work within the time limits specified in Article VII, Section 3, unless extended by agreement between the employee and the Employer.

time employees in each department and classification a minimum of forty (40) hours per scheduled work week. The guarantee of this provision excludes holiday weeks. In cases where the application of this percentage results in a fraction, such fraction will not apply.
The forty (40) hour week will be worked in five (5) days of eight (8) hour shifts or four (4) days of ten (10) hour shifts. In holiday weeks, employees will be scheduled four (4) days of eight (8) hours shifts, or three (3) days of ten (10) hour shifts. In the event the Employer schedules employees ten (10) hour work days, these schedules will be offered to volunteers in line of seniority by department, classification and job assignment grouping. The foregoing is not to be construed as a forty (40) hour guarantee.
(b)	Employees must be available for Friday, Saturday and Sunday work. The parties agree to support a flexible rotation concept for weekend scheduling of employees within their department, classification and job assignment as business conditions permit.
(c)	There shall be no mandatory split shifts.
(d)	The posted straight time hours of full-time employees will be maximized up to forty (40) hours per week (32 hours during a holiday week) excluding holiday hours with one (1) day off per week.

(f)	Part-time employees shall be scheduled in line of seniority for the largest block of hours on a scheduled day, within their department, classification and job assignment, such that senior part-time employees' weekly scheduled hours shall exceed or equal the weekly scheduled hours of junior part-time employees on a weekly basis within their classification, department and job assignment. An employee's scheduling limitations may affect the Company's ability to give that employee equal or more hours than less senior employees. Full-time and part-time employees will be scheduled by job assignment grouping ( i.e., cash office, guest service desk, lanes, u-scan, lottery/tobacco, service coordinator, lead cashier, receiving clerk, order writer, trailer unloader, central salvage and paperwork processor) and classification. In the event the work schedule is not believed to be in conformance with an employee’s seniority and the other provisions of this Article, the employee must notify the manager within twenty-four (24) hours of the posting of the schedule so that adjustments can be made if needed. In the event the employee fails to bring the matter
attention within twenty-four (24) hours of the posting of the schedule, the schedule will be deemed~acceptable and not subject to the grievance'protge^i^. ]]^3(0>“[]

(g)	The Employer will recognize seniority for preferential daily work shifts, (i.e. if there are starting times with the same number of consecutive hours, but one (1) starting time is earlier in the day, the more senior employee will be given the earliest start time) by department. The obligation to maximize hours at the end of the week shall be the first consideration in case of conflicts and the Employer retains the right to designate the starting times of each employee's work day.
(h)	The employees referenced in Article IX, Section 2(f) will be scheduled according to the operational requirements of the job assignment, Such employees will not be displaced from their schedule so long as they remain on this assignment.
(i)	The Employer will provide as much notice as possible to employees in the event they are required to work past their scheduled shift.
Section 3	The Employer reserves the right to create new or expand and/or reduce the structure of departments for scheduling purposes as business conditions warrant.
Section 4	If additional hours which are not on the posted schedules become necessary, these additional hours will be offered in line of seniority within department, classification and job assignment, first to available full-time employees who are offered less than forty (40) hours. After this obligation, in line of seniority within department, classification and job assignment, to part-time employees not scheduled to work that day who are available for such work.
To be eligible for such additional hours, part-time employees must certify in writing their availability for additional hours on a daily basis and submit their written availability for additional hours to their manager's office by 3:00 p.m. on Saturday.
It is understood that such additional hours must consist of at least the minimum call-in guarantee to be offered to employees not scheduled to work that day.
It is understood that employees must be qualified to do the work to be offered any such additional hours. In no case will the Employer be obligated to offer additional hours to an employee which would cause that employee to have overtime.
Section 5 Any full-time employee not scheduled forty (40) hours per week may claim hours from part-time employees within the same department and classification such that the claim does not reduce the part-time employee below his weekly or daily guarantee of hours, although the full-time employee may claim a whole daily shift or the total weekly schedule reducing the part-time employee to zero (0) hours for the day or week. No claiming of hours will be allowed that could cause weekly overtime as	paivnwv

Section 12 All employees are to receive one and one-half (1%) the regular hourly rate for all hours actually worked over forty (40) hours in any one week.
Full-time employees required to stay past their scheduled shift shall not be involuntarily reduced in hours to avoid overtime (over 40). This provision shall not apply in the case of meetings.
Section 13 Premium Hours The Employer will survey full-time and part-time employees on a quarterly basis for purposes of indicating their desire for holiday work. Such work, when needed, will be scheduled in line of seniority by classification within each department first to employees that indicated, in writing, a desire to work on holidays.
It is understood that if a sufficient number of employees are not available on the basis of the survey, the Employer may require employees to work, in inverse order of seniority.
Holidays For work performed on a holiday as defined in this Agreement, all employees will receive one and one-half (17) times their basic hourly rate for hours actually worked on the holiday.
Section 14 Any minimum hour requirements expressed in the sections of this Article shall not apply in circumstances beyond the control of the Employer, such as illness, injury, fire, flood, civil disturbance, power and equipment failure, or acts of God. If an employee is notified not to report before he leaves home, the Employer shall not be required to pay call-in pay. Same applies if the Employer attempts to notify employees by last phone number or address on the Employer's records and it is incorrect due to a change not recorded by the employee.
Section 15 Employees shall perform any work which a manager may direct with the understanding that when an employee is assigned a job with a lesser rate, he will be entitled to his regular rate of pay unless he has been assigned to a lower rated job and desires to retain such job rather than accept layoff. If an employee is assigned to a higher rated job for a period of fifteen (15) minutes or more, he will receive the next higher rate from his existing rate in that higher classification for the time worked in that higher classification that day.
Section 16 The Employer will not be obligated to pay an employee premium pay and/or time and one-half (1 %) if the same work can be done at straight time.
Receiving department employees may unload and sort merchandise from all trailers delivered to the store, and when assigned, will receive their regular rate of pay and will not result in the displacement of grocery employees. The Company may designate Receiving Department employees to be the Receiving Clerk(s) for	p3iv!1!JJV

Each step represents a six-month increment for wage progression.
Upon ratification, all employees will receive a minimum 30-cent increase. The employee’s new hourly rate will be determined by adding 30-cents to their current hourly rate. If that rate (current rate + 30-cents) is not in the new wage schedule for their classification, the employee will move to the next higher rate for that classification within the new wage schedule. In no case will an employee receive less than 30-cents.
If contract changes result in an increase in rate, the six (6) month automatic increase will not be reset.
It is understood that for payroll purposes, all contract rate adjustments for time in classification called for in the Agreement will occur on the following week's pay period if an adjustment falls on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
The Employer may hire and/or advance employees at a rate faster than shown in the wage schedules. However, an employee’s rate will not exceed the top rate negotiated for the employee's classification.
An employee who transfers to a higher classification shall receive the next higher rate from their existing rate in the new classification. After this rate adjustment, the employee will progress within the new classification after completion of the proper additional time interval in the new classification.
In the Bakery Department, employee’s formerly in Job #T18 shall be reclassified as Job #T22.

M. Effective April 1, 2003, the benefit coverage available under the CMP100 or the CMP300 (including Prescription Drug coverage), the Dental/Optical Plan, and the required weekly pre-tax contribution rates for health coverage are set forth in subsections II.IM 1 through 7.

Plan and Prescription Drug coverage elected will be the difference between the Employer funded amount, as described in subsection 11 .IMI (a and b) above, and the total cost of the coverage elected. Therefore, if the Alternative Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage is more costly than the Employer's Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage (per (a) or (b) above), then the employee weekly contribution will be greater for this option. However, if the Alternative Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage is less costly than the Employer’s Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage (per (a) or (b) above), then the employee weekly contribution will be less for this option.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, it is the policy of the Employer that any employee participating in a Medical Plan offered by the Employer shall contribute on a weekly basis to the cost of the coverage of the plan elected. Therefore, for employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the employee contribution for alternative medical plans shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount the employee is required to contribute for participation in the CMP100 (with prescription drug coverage). For employees hired on or after April 1, 2003, the employee contribution for alternative medical plans shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount the employee is required to contribute for participation in the CMP300 (with prescription drug coverage).
The Employer’s methodology used to establish the cost of coverage under the CMP 100 and the CMP300 the Employer’s contribution to the cost of coverage under an Alternative Medical Plan will be in compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations as described in COBRA, ERISA, IRC, and the HCFA regulations. Although these Federal requirements were written for specific purposes, there exists a common requirement, either stated or implied, that the “applicable premium” will be equal to a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing that coverage.
These are the legal obligations of the Employer and these requirements provide sufficient assurance that the established cost of the CMP100 or the CMP300 and the Employer’s contribution to an Alternative Medical Plan has been determined reasonably. Each year the Employer establishes costs for each coverage category within the CMP 100 and the CMP300 and the Basic Medical Plan for setting COBRA rates and for bargaining with Alternative Medical Plans (such as HMOs). The Employer will provide the Union with this cost information as early in the year as is practical after these costs have been established, In addition, the Employer will provide the Union with Health Plan enrollment information on a quarterly basis.

6.	Reasonable and Available Expense Allowance:
All health plans under subsection 11.1M will only consider the reasonable and available charge for any service or supply as the maximum expense allowance to be considered under any coverage formulas or benefit determinations. The reasonable and available expense allowance is the allowable charge for covered services and supplies as determined by the Plan Administrator to be:
a reasonable charge on the basis of other charges being made for the same service or supply in the same conununity, and
an available charge for the service or supply in the same community.
Expenses in excess of the allowable charge are not covered under the plans.
7.	Non-Duplication Coordination of Benefits:
Services that are not covered under an HMO because they were obtained through non-participating providers will not be coordinated with the benefits under the CMP100, the CMP300, or the Dental/Optical Plan.
The CMP100 / CMP300 and Dental/Optical Plan will coordinate benefits with other health plans, including any provided by the Employer, on a nonduplication of benefits basis. This means that when this plan is secondary, it will only pay for a covered expense up to the allowable amount that it would have paid if it had been primary, minus whatever the primary plan paid for the same covered expense.
N. A more complete description of the health benefit coverage available under each health plan is described in the Summary Plan Description or the Certificate of Coverage available to employees. This includes information on coverage requirements, claim procedures, limitations and exclusions and coordination of benefits. Each health plan will be administered according to the specific terms and conditions of the plans, and in case of any questions regarding	piW!llJJV
eligibility, the terms and conditions of the Plan Documents will govern.

I.	The benefit will begin seven (7) calendar days after the first scheduled working day lost because of disability due to a covered accident or illness. No benefits will be paid unless and until the Employer receives the employee’s application completed by the attending physician on the form supplied by the Employer and information sufficient for the Employer to determine that a disability exists. This application must substantiate the disability and state the date the employee first came under the physician’s care for the disability period. In order to be eligible for any benefits, this application must be delivered to the Employer no later than thirty (30) days after the disability began, unless it was not reasonably possible to do so and the application was delivered as soon as reasonably possible. No benefits will be paid for the period prior to the time the disability began and the employee came under the care and treatment of the physician for the disability.
J.	The Employer reserves the right to require additional reports from the attending physician to substantiate that appropriate care and treatment are being rendered by the physician and in an appropriate specialty. The disability must be supported by current objective medical evidence. The course of treatment must be appropriate for the disability. In absence of continuing proof of disability, the Employer may suspend benefits. If continuing proof of disability is received within 30 days of the suspension date, benefits will be reinstated without lapse. If continuing proof of disability is not received within 30 days of the suspension date, benefits will be reinstated as of the date such proof is received by the Employer. The Employer also reserves the right to have the employee examined by a physician of the Employer’s choice to confirm the disability is supported by objective medical evidence and that the course of treatment is appropriate. The Employer can in its sole discretion determine that a disability exists based on all medical information obtained.
K.	The Employer reserves the right to offer favored work within medical restrictions if an employee is unable to return to regular job duties. If the employee refuses the work offered, Short Term Disability benefits will cease.
L.	Periods of disability not separated by two (2) continuous weeks of full employment at regular duties are considered as one (1) period of disability.
M.	During a week in which an employee qualifies for Short Term Disability benefits and also works part of the same week, the employee shall receive the appropriate hourly rate for such hours worked. In any week, an employee may collect a maximum of five (5) days of compensation whether worked or treated as disability pay under this section. This five (5) day maximum can be composed of any combination of benefit pay and scheduled work.

P.	These benefits will be provided in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of the actual Plan Document, and in case of any questions regarding payment or eligibility, the terms and conditions of the Plan Document will govern.
11.4	PENSION
A.	The Employer will cover eligible employees under the Meijer Hourly Pension Plan according to the provisions set forth in this Section 11.4, subject to the terms and conditions of this Defined Benefit Pension Plan. No matter respecting this Pension Plan shall be subject to the grievance procedure of this Policy.
Eligible full-time and part-time Food employees in the bargaining unit, in job numbers T07 (100007), T14 (IOOOOA), T16 (10000B), and T17 (100007), hired prior to April 1, 2003, will continue participation in the Plan as described below, with benefits earned based on the Food Schedule defined in subsection 11.4F below.
Effective January 1, 2003, all other regular full time and part time employees in the bargaining unit (not described in subsection 11.4A above), hired prior to April 1,2003, will also be eligible to participate in this Pension Plan as follows. Service prior to January 1, 2003 will be applied to the participation requirement described in subsection 11.4B below and the vested service requirement described in subsection 11.4C below. However, benefit service as described in subsection 11.4D below, will only be earned on and after January 1, 2003, with benefits earned based on the General Merchandise Schedule defined in subsection 11.4G.
B.	An eligible employee becomes a participant in the Plan on the first February 1 or August 1 after attaining age 21 and completing an eligibility computation period during which the employee has at least 1,000 hours of service. The initial eligibility computation period is the first twelve (12) months of employment. The subsequent eligibility computation period is each calendar year beginning after the employee’s date of employment.
C. Employees will be vested in the Pension Plan on the completion of five years of vested service. However, pension benefits can be paid if the participant retires after attaining “normal retirement age” as described in subsection 11.4E below, even if the vested service requirement is never met. Benefits payable under this Plan are a function of benefit service and the applicable benefit dollar levels in effect as described in subsections 11.4F and 11.4G below.
One year of vested service will be credited for each calendar year in which the
employee has at least 1,000 hours of service. If a participant has less than 1,000
hours of service in a calendar year, the participant shall not be credited with any
vested service for the calendar year. The calendar year for the purpose of this Plan is defined as the payroll year, and in the calculation of hours for benefit service and^ a f jv vested service credit shall include each hour for which an empiSJg>e%^3i8ycfiInnlg!M p31*!1M

The lump sum distribution is payable as soon as administratively feasible on or after the first of the month following application.
I.	Benefits summarized in subsections 11.4A through H will be provided in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of the Plan, and in case of any question regarding benefit payment or eligibility, the terms and conditions of the plan documents will govern.
J.	All employees described in subsection 11.4A will also be eligible to participate in the 401 (k) Plan described in Section 11.5.

11.5	401 (k) SAVINGS PLAN
A.	The Employer will maintain the Meijer Savings Plus Plan III, which is a defined contribution type of retirement plan known as a 401 (K) Plan. A 401 (k) Plan permits a participant to defer part of the participant’s pay and have the Employer contribute the amount of the pay deferral to the plan instead of paying it to the participant in his paychecks. Additionally, the Employer will make “matching” contributions to the Plan based on the amount of a participant’s pay deferral contributions for eligible participating employees as described in subsection 11.502 below.
B.	Each participant in the Plan will have accounts in his or her name. All participants’ accounts are invested together in certain investment funds. The amount of a participant’s benefits from the plan is based upon the amountmodtapartroipantls* p3i*hwv

4.	A participant will always be vested in his pay deferral contributions and investment earnings on his pay deferral account.

A participant will be 25% vested after completing two years of vesting service, 50% vested after 3 years of vesting service, 75% vested after 4 years of vesting service and 100% vested after 5 years of vesting service. The participant will receive credit for one year of vesting service for each plan year during which the participant has at least 1,000 hours of service.

Section 4.	Personal Maternity Leave. Pregnant employees will have the option of taking a personal maternity leave of absence rather than a disability leave. If the employee decides to take a personal maternity leave, the employee may take such leave at any time during the pregnancy. If such a leave is taken, the employee will remain on leave until her pregnancy has terminated and may remain on leave up to ninety (90) days after her termination of pregnancy.
Employees may request additional personal leave time. The granting of such additional time will take into account the medical condition of the employee and her infant and the business conditions of the Employer. If the Employer grants additional time, there will be a maximum of thirty (30) days granted.
Employees deciding to take the personal maternity leave will receive up to thirty (30) days of Weekly Indemnity Benefits according to the employee's available and unused benefit days upon commencing the leave. This is only payable if the employee is eligible to receive Short Term Disability Benefits under Section 11.3.
Section 5.	Non-Work Related Disability Leave Leaves of absence shall be granted for up to one (1) year for employees who become unable to work because of non-work related illness or injury. This leave shall become effective the first full day off work due to the illness or injury. The illness or injury must be verified by a physician certifying the disability is supported by current objective medical evidence. The course of treatment must be appropriate for the disability. The Employer however, reserves the right to have the employee examined by a physician of its choice to confirm the illness or injury.
In the event the employee is medically unable to return to work and resume his regular job duties on the date the leave is due to expire, up to a six (6) month extension will be granted at ninety (90) day intervals if the employee's physician submits verification for such extension indicating a time the employee will be able to return to work and assume his regular job duties during the extension period. Additional extensions may be granted by the Employer beyond the six (6) month extension period. The Employer reserves the right to have the employee examined by a physician of its choice to confirm the need for the extension.
Failure of the employee to return to work within the one (1) year period of leave or such later date as is specified within the extension period shall result in termination.
Seniority shall accrue during non-work related disability leaves except as limited in
Article 12.7.

Favored work will be offered to both the employees on work related disability leaves and employees on non-work related disability leave, where such work exists, as determined by the Employer. The favored work will be such that an employee can retain and accrue seniority and receive contractual benefits as defined in Article XI. During the period of such favored work assignment, the employee can maintain his Union membership. Compensation for favored work for employees on work related disability leave shall be subject to applicable Workers Compensation Law. Compensation for favored work for employees on non-work related disability leave shall be based on the partial disability benefit provided under Section 11.3, Weekly Indemnity Benefits, if eligible.
Favored work under this Section will not be subject to any posting, bidding or assignment procedures. However, layoff procedures shall apply when there is a layoff that affects that work assignment and employees returned to work under this provision will not be used to displace other employees. Placement of employees on favored work shall be consistent with their seniority when retained within their regular classification or department. Employees assigned favored work outside their regular job classification will be assigned hours based upon departmental needs and times as required by business conditions. When employees are assigned favored work outside their job classification, their seniority will not take precedence over the regular classification of associates permanently assigned to the department.
When employees are released from their medical restrictions, they will be considered as returning from disability leave and treated accordingly.
Section 11.	Family and Medical Leave Employees who are eligible for a leave of absence pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, will be granted such leave according to the actual terms and conditions defined in the Act.

However, such leave would not be a qualified leave under the Act and such employees would not be eligible to receive the specific entitlement provided by the Act. The administration of these leaves would be consistent with the provisions contained in Sections 12.5 through 12.10.
Employees who are eligible for leave under the Act for the purpose of providing care for a family member as described below, who have applied for and have been determined to qualify for leave, will be granted a family care leave. Family care leave is for the purpose of providing care for:
1.	The employee's newborn child.
2.	A child recently placed with the employee for adoption or foster care.
3.	The employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition.
Employees who are eligible and approved for family care leave will be entitled to the benefits and rights provided under the Act. Such employees will also be subject to the employee responsibilities and requirements contained in the Act. In those cases where employees have satisfied such obligations, the entitlement provided by the Act will be available during a family care leave.
Employees who are not eligible for leave, do not qualify for family care leave or have exhausted the leave time available under the Act will not be granted a family care leave. In such cases, the employee may apply for a personal leave as described in Section 12.1. However, such leave would not be a qualified leave under the Act and such employees would not be eligible to receive the specific entitlement provided by the Act. The administration of such leaves would be consistent with the provisions contained in Section 12.1.
In all cases of approved leave of absence which are qualified as covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act, such leaves will be administered according to the actual terms and conditions of the Act. Exceptions to the requirements or limitations provided by the Act will only occur pursuant to the Employer's specific agreement within this Agreement or in writing outside of this Agreement and only when such exceptions will result in more favorable treatment of employees than the Act requires.
Section 12 Educational Leave An educational leave of absence may be granted to employees at the discretion of management for the purpose of attending college or specialized training approved for job related purposes.

UFCW Local 911 wants you to know about your
Right to Representation:
WEINGARTEN RULES
As a UFCW Local 911 member, you have the right to steward representation during investigatory interviews with management or representatives of management such as security IF the interview could lead to DISCIPLINE. An investigatory interview occurs when management, through a supervisor or other representative, questions you to obtain information which COULD BE USED AS A BASIS FOR DISCIPLINE AGAINST YOU. The following steps insure that ycur right is preserved:
1)	YOU must make a clear request for union representation before or during the investigatory interview. YOU must ask for representation - the right is not automatic.
2)	If management, through its supervisor or other representative, refuses the request of union representation in an investigatory interview YOU may refuse to proceed without union representation. IF THE EMPLOYER DENIES YOU THE RIGHT YOU SHOULD STAY IN THE ROOM BUT REMAIN SILENT.
3)	If the employer denies union representation, you have a right to refuse to answer whether orally or in written form. You should not make any statement.
4)	DO NOT WAIVE THIS RIGHT. If you do so, any statement you make can be used against you.
