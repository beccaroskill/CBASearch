COMMISSION
The employer will upon conclusion of the 2006 negotiations, review all areas currently compensated on draw vs commission to determine if the sales volume is at a level necessary to support this compensation plan.
Areas that are not currently producing sufficient volume to support draw vs commission in the employers opinion, will be converted to the base plus commission or the base hourly rate pay plan until such time as sales increase to the level necessary to support draw vs commission.
In addition, the Company will institute a tiered incentive commission plan in Draw VS Commission areas in 2006. Once employees reach a defined net sales volume during a fiscal year, their commission rate will be raised to a higher commission level which will remain in effect until the end of the fiscal year. At the beginning of the next fiscal year, the commission rate will revert to the normal commission rate. Part Time and Fu I Time employees will have differing volume plateaus and volume plateaus will be prorated for 2006 based upon date of implementation. The premium commission rate and volume plateaus will be determined by the Company and reviewed with the union.

| Credit Solicitation
Effective upon ratification of this agreement, the Company will discontinue quarterly discipline for credit solicitation and tlie current requirement of 13 accounts per quarter will be discontinued.
The Company and the Union acknowledge the importance of credit solicitation as an important component of a Sales Associate ’s job and furthermore, that there is a performance expectation that employees attempt to solicit new credit accounts.
As such, Credit Solicitation will be an important component on the employees seasonal and annual performance evaluation. In the event that an employee has unacceptable performance in credit solicitation, the necessity for performance counseling/disciptine will be cons dered within the context of their overall performance evaluation, with appropriate standards that recognize not only meets expectations performance, but recognizes exceptional performance as well.
New credit criteria for Seasonal and Annual performance review purposes will be developed for the 2006 performance year. This reduced criteria will be utilized for performance evaluations during this current year,
While the Seasonal and Annual performance process is the appropriate vehicle to determine overall performance of the Associate, not attempting to solicit credit is, at the same time, not appropriate either,
Those employees who are currently on discipline based upon the current requirement of 13 per quarter will have their discipline removed from their records, with the exception of those who have n >t opened an average of three per quarter or an equivalent cumulative period since discipline was first administered.
Performance counseling outside of the Mid-year rnd Annual Review process will be on an exception basis only, and reserved for those employees with an average quarterly solicitation that averages zero or less than one per month.
