Appendix A
Longevity Increment Eligibility Rules
The following rules shall govern the eligibility of employees for the longevity increments provided for in Article III, Section 9 of the 2002-2005 Motor Vehicle Operators Agreement:
1.	Only sen-ice in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service, except that for other than full time per annum Employees only a continuous year of service in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service. A continuous year of service shall be a full year of service without a break of more than 31 days. Where the regular and customary work year for a title is less than a twelve month year, such as a school year, such regular and customary year shall be credited as a continuous year of service counting towards the 15 years of service. If the normal work year for an Employee is less than the regular and customary work year for the Employee's title, it shall be counted as a continuous year of service if the Employee has customarily worked that length work year and the applicable agency verifies that information.
2.	Service in pay status prior to any breaks in service of more than one year shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. Where an Employee has less than seven years of continuous service in pay status, breaks in service of less than one year shall be aggregated. Where breaks in service aggregate to more than one year they shall be treated as a break in service of more than one year and the service prior to such breaks and the aggregated breaks shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. No break used to disqualify service shall be used more than once.
3.	The following time in which an Employee is not in pay status shall not constitute a break in service as specified in paragraph 2 above:
a.	Time on a leave approved by the proper authority which is consistent with the Rules and Regulations of the New York City Personnel Director or the appropriate personnel authority of a covered organization.
b.	Time prior to a reinstatement.
c.	Time on a preferred list pursuant to Civil Service Law Sections 80 and 81 or any similar contractual provision.
d.	Time not in pay status of 31 days or less.
Notwithstanding the above, such time as specified in subsections a, b and c above shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service.
4.	Once an Employee has completed the 15 years of "City" service in pay status and is eligible to receive the $800 longevity increment, the S800 shall become part of the Employee's base rate for all purposes except as provided in paragraph 5 below.
5.	The $800 longevity increment shall not become pensionable until fifteen months after the employee begins to receive such $800 increment. Fifteen months after the Employee begins to receive the $800 longevity increment, such $800 longevity increment shall become pensionable and as part of the Employee's base rate, the $800 longevity increment shall be subject to the general increases provided in Article III, Section 4a of this Agreement.
Appendix B
The following rules shall govern the eligibility of Employees for the Recurring Increment Payment (“RIP”)
provided for in Article III, Section 11 of the 2002-2005 Motor Vehicle Operators Agreement.
1.	Only service in pay status shall be used to calculate the qualifying years of service. A continuous year of service shall be a full year of service without a break of more than 31 days. Where the regular and customary work year for a title is less than a twelve month year, such as a school year, such regular and customary year shall be credited as a continuous year of service counting towards the qualifying years of service. If the normal work year for an Employee is less than the regular and customary work year for the Employee’s title, it shall be counted as a continuous year of service if the Employee has customarily worked that length work year and the applicable agency verifies that information.
2.	Part-time Employees shall be ineligible to receive RIPs, but prior part-time service shall be credited to full-time Employees on a pro rata basis, provided all other terms and conditions set forth herein are met.
a.	An Employee must have regularly worked at least one half the regular hours of full time Employees in the same title or if no full-time equivalent title exists then at least 17 1/2 hours for white collar positions or 20 hours for blue collar positions.
b.	Such part time service shall be prorated by dividing the number of hours worked per week by a part-time Employee by the number of hours worked per week by a full-time Employee in the same title. If no full-time equivalent title exists then the divisor shall be 35 hours for white collar positions or 40 hours for blue collar positions.
3.	Service in pay status prior to a break in service of more than one year shall not be used to calculate the qualifying years of service.
4.	The following time in which an Employee is not in pay status shall not constitute a break in service, but such time shall not be used to calculate the qualifying years of service.
a.	time on a leave approved by the proper authority which is consistent with the Personnel Rules and Regulations of the City of New York or the appropriate personnel authority of a covered organization.
b.	time prior to a reinstatement.
c.	time on a preferred or recall list, and
d.	Time not in pay status of 31 days or less.
5.	RIPS shall be considered a salary adjustment for the purposes of Article III, Section 1 (d) of this Agreement and the maximum salary of an eligible title shall not constitute a bar to the payment thereof.
6.	Once an Employee has qualified for a RIP and is receiving it, the RIP shall become part of the Employee’s base rate and included in calculating all salary based payments, except as provided in paragraph 7 below. Any future negotiated general increases shall be applied to RIPs.
7.	A RIP shall not become pensionable until two years after the Employee begins to receive such RIP.

Appendix C
AS set forth in Section 5 of the 2002 District Council 37 Memorandum of Economic Agreement, (“2002 DC 37 MEA”) the parties agree to establish the “Joint Labor Management Committee on Productivity Initiatives” (“Committee”).
Composition of the Committee
The Committee shall comprise representatives designated by: the Deputy Mayor for Operations, the Law Department, the Office of Labor Relations, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Operations, and District Council 37.
Goals and Objectives
The Committee shall work to identify efficiencies in the administration and delivery of governmental services which shall in turn be utilized to provide additional compensation to employees. This agreement expresses the joint labor and management commitment to associate improved City service and performance with appropriate compensation for the workforce.
The goal of the Committee’s work shall be to identify, review, recommend and develop initiatives that generate workplace savings, maximize the potential of the City workforce and ensure the provision of essential services while at the same time improving compensation for the City workforce. To that end, the parties will seek to identify quantifiable savings while at the same time maintaining or improving City services.
The Committee shall make all reasonable efforts to issue a report or reports on or about October 1, 2004 which propose initiatives representing meaningful, quantifiable, recurring savings to the City and which generate funding to be utilized to compensate employees. Upon completion and acceptance of all committee members of the report, an additional one percent (1 %) increase shall be paid to employees covered by this agreement.
The parties agree to meet and negotiate the application of any additional savings above 1 % generated by the programs developed by the Committee.
Areas for Consideration
The Committee’s study may encompass such matters, including, but not limited to, absence control, contracting in, workers compensation and other efficiencies.
1.	Sick leave usage. The Committee will seek to design a program to examine baseline data as to sick leave usage as a benchmark for comparison. The goal will be to reduce employee sick leave usage on an ongoing basis as a productivity enhancement.
2.	Contracting-in. The Committee shall identify areas wherein City services are now being outsourced with the goal of providing those services by City employees with a cost savings to the City.
3.	Workers Compensation Cost Containment Task Force. The Committee shall create a special task force, requesting such assistance of cost containment experts as necessary, with the goal of developing reforms that emphasize effective treatments and speed the return to work; that explore the manner in
which treatment services are provided; that set specific standards of evaluation and treatment; and that serve to root out fraudulent claims.
4.	Such other areas as the Committee may mutually agree.
Implementation of Savings
The initiatives and programs developed pursuant to this Committee must be unanimously agreed upon. In the event there is a dispute as to the amount of savings generated by an initiative or the implementation of a program, or the savings generated by a program are not paid pursuant to this agreement, a party may file for final and binding arbitration pursuant to Section 12(a) of the 2002 DC 37 MEA.
Appendix D
For those employees hired between July 15, 1996 through March 31,2000, upon completion of four (4) years of active or qualified inactive service, an employee in active pay status appointed pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 5(b) of the 1995 MCMEA shall receive a one-time lump sum payment calculated by taking the difference between the “hiring rate” received by the employee and the indicated minimum for the applicable title set forth in the applicable Successor Separate Unit Agreement that was in effect on the one year anniversary of the employee’s original date of appointment to their title. Such one-time lump sum payment shall be equivalent to the difference between the annual salary rate the employee would have actually earned during the employee’s second year of service had the higher salary rate been in effect and the annual salary rate they did earn.
“Qualified inactive service” is defined for the purposes of this agreement to include the following employees:
1.	those who are on preferred or recall lists; or
2.	those who are on an approved leave.
“Approved leave” is further defined to include:
a.	matemity/childcare leave
b.	military leave

d.	unpaid leave for union business pursuant to Executive Order 75
e.	unpaid leave pending workers’ compensation determination
f.	unpaid leave while on workers’ compensation option 2
g.	approved unpaid time off due to illness or exhaustion of paid sick leave
h.	approved unpaid time off due to family illness
i.	other pre-approved leaves without pay
