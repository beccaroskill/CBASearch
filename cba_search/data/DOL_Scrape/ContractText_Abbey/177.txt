1)	The death of his/her spouse.
2)	Termination of his/her spouse’s employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or reduction in his/her spouse’s hours of employment.

The employee or a family member has the responsibility to inform the Coming Benefits Network within 60 days of a divorce or a child losing dependent status under the Coming Incorporated Hourly Health Benefit Plans.
When the Coming Benefits Network is notified that one of these events has happened, they will in turn notify you that you have the right to choose continuation coverage.

SCHEDULE D
DENTAL ASSISTANCE PLAN ACTIVE EMPLOYEES
A new full-time employee shall be eligible for coverage following the completion of ninety (90) days of cumulative active service.
The Dental Assistance Plan was discontinued effective December 31, 2002 and in its place, employees will be given a choice of two new dental plans effective January 1,2003:
The Comprehensive Dental Plan and The Preventive Dental Plan. Both dental insurance plans will base payments on reasonable and customary charges for covered services and will mirror the Salaried plans. Plan details are provided in the Summary Plan Description.
Contribution Rates - Employee contribution rates will be established each year by the Company based on experience ratings and will be the same as for the Salaried employees, available on a four-tier basis.
Two-year Election - Employees who enroll in a dental plan must stay in that plan for two plan years.
Predetermination of Benefits
If it is expected that dental expenses will be more than $100, the employee should ask for a predetermination of benefits by submitting a completed claim form, indicating the cost of the work to be done. The Dental Claim Office will send a benefits allowable statement, telling the employee what the Plan will pay.
It is strongly recommended that the employee utilize this predetermination feature since he/she will find it an advantage to review the planned course of treatment with the dentist in the light of available benefits. This will enable the employee to determine the extent of the outofpocket expenses before treatment begins.
62
Alternate Benefits
Very often there are several ways to treat a particular dental problem. In determining the amount of benefits payable, ti e Dental Claim Office under the guidance of professional consulta nts, will give consideration to alternate procedures, services or courses of treatment to accomplish a satisfactory result. Benefits may be based on a less costly procedure if the results meet accepted standards of dental practice. The employee is still free to choose the more costly treatment, but he/she will be responsible for charges be/ond the benefit for the less costly procedure.
Coordination of Benefits (COB)
Standard COB Provisions will apply.
Deductible
The deductible is a fiscal year deductible per covered individual. (Under dental plans the expenses which go to make up the deductible are the benefits that otherwise would h ive been payable under the Plan.) When one member of a family ha; satisfied the individual deductible, the deductible for the rest of the family shall be limited in combination to the total family deduct ble. The plan year will be from January 1 through December 31 for purposes of the deductible.
Limitations and Conditions
Standard Dental Plan limitations shall apply.
