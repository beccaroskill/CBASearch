In furtherance of these ends, the Company and Union jointly and mutually declare it to be their purpose and intention to carry out in good faith the provisions of this agreement

ARTICLE 2
SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
The term “employee” or “employees” as and wherever used in this Agreement shall include those employees of the Company including any expansions to the existing workforce at its plant located in Gramercy, Louisiana, as follows; all production and maintenance employees, but excluding executives, administrative and professional employees, office and clerical employees, guards, full-time first aid and safety employees, foremen and any other supervisory employees with the authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline or otherwise effect changes in the status of employees or effectively recommend such action.
Bargaining Unit Work
When Management establishes a new or changed job in a plant so that duties involving a significant amount of production or maintenance work, or both, which is performed on a job within the bargaining unit (or, in the case of new work, would be performed on such a job) are combined with duties not normally performed on a job within the bargaining unit, the resulting job in the plant shall be considered as within the bargaining unit. This provision shall not be construed as enlarging or diminishing whatever rights exist in respect of withdrawal of nonbargaining unit duties from a job in the bargaining unit, provided that where non-bargaining unit duties are placed in a job in the bargaining unit under this provision, such duties may be withdrawn at any time. Management shall, on request, furnish to the Union reasonable information to permit determination of questions of compliance with this provision.
Should any problems arise which might be subject to such a clause if it were in the contract, it may, after being processed through the grievance procedure, be referred by either party to a discussion between representatives of the Company's Human Resources Department and representatives of the Union’s International Office. In the event such discussion does not resolve any such problem, either party to such discussion may refer it to the next contract negotiation for solution. This shall not, however, deprive the Union of the right to submit such matter to arbitration under the terms of the Labor Agreement.
It is agreed that no letters of agreement dated and signed before the Effective Date of this Agreement will be valid for any purpose, except those letters identified in Exhibit 1. Any letter agreements entered into after the Effective Date of this Agreement must be signed by the Human Resource Manager and an International Representative in order to be valid.

ARTICLE 3
RECOGNITION AND UNION SECURITY
A.	The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency for its employees for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours, or other conditions of employment. The provisions of this Agreement constitute the sole procedure for the processing and settlement of any claim by an employee or the Union of a violation by the Company of this Agreement. As the representative of the employees, the Union may process grievances through the grievance procedure, including arbitration, in accordance with this Agreement or adjust or settle the same.
B.	All employees shall become members of the Union or in States where that cannot be required, pay fees and dues (as set forth below) on the ninety-first (91st) calendar day after going to work or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later, and thereafter pays fees and dues as required by law. Each employee covered by this Agreement who fails to acquire or maintain membership in the Union shall be required as a condition of employment beginning on the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, to pay to the Union each month a fair share fee as a contribution toward the representation by the Union of the bargaining unit. The fair share fee for the first month shall be in an amount equal to the Union's regular and usual initiation fee and monthly dues, and for each month thereafter in an amount equal to the regular and usual monthly dues. For the purposes of this Section, an employee shall not be deemed to have lost his membership in the Union in good standing until the International Treasurer of the Union shall have determined that the membership of such employee in the Union is not in good standing and shall have given the Company a notice in writing of that fact.
The parties recognized the mutual desirability of establishing a coordinated program of orientation for new employees at the time of hire or in the course of pre-employment processing.
Accordingly, during the term of this Agreement, the headquarters of the International Union will develop an appropriate education program of not more than two hours' duration designed for presentation by representative designated by the Union in facilities provided by the Company at various locations. The Union will consult with the Company in the development and implementation of the program. It is further understood that the local parties will coordinate the Union orientation sessions as to content and timing with the Company orientation program at each location. All materials, papers, texts, visual aids and other educational or informational aids for the Union orientation program will be furnished by the Union at its expense. Any other costs incidental to the program shall be paid by the Company.
C.	All employees who are hired by the Company after the date of execution of this Agreement shall be reported promptly to the Union by the Company, but in no case will reporting be delayed beyond thirty (30) days.

D.	The first ninety (90) days of actual work shall be deemed a probationary period and during such probationary period an employee may be laid off, or terminated at the discretion of the Company. Probationary employees continued in the service of the Company subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day of actual work after the first day worked shall receive full seniority credit from the date of first day worked. If an employee is laid off; or terminated during his probationary period and is rehired within one (1) year thereafter, the days worked prior to such transfer, layoff; or termination shall be added to the days worked after rehire in determining the completion of his probationary period. If, however, such an employee is rehired within two weeks of his last transfer, layoff, or termination from employment at the plant, his seniority date will be the date of hire for his prior employment.
E.	The Company will furnish a list of bargaining unit employees upon request. For each employee included in the list and for whom the Company has received a written assignment, not irrevocable for a period of more than one (1) year or beyond the termination date of this Agreement, whichever occurs sooner, executed by the employee concerned authorizing the Company so to do, the Company shall deduct dues on a per pay basis using the earnings of each pay as the base including if so indicated on such lists, the initiation fee due the Union, as designated to the Company by the International Treasurer of the Union. The amount of such deductions and the conditions applying thereto shall continue as specified herein above, except as changes may be required to provide for continued conformance with applicable provisions of the Constitution of the International Union. All amounts deducted by the Company from the pay of any employee hereunder shall be remitted by the Company to the “International Treasurer, United Steelworkers, Post Office Box 951667, Cleveland, Ohio 44193.” The Company will check off dues from a lump sum vacation payment made to an employee for the appropriate number of months covered by such payment for which dues are not otherwise checked off.
F.	The Union hereby indemnifies the Company and holds it harmless against any and all suits, claims, demands and liabilities that shall arise out of or by reason of any action that shall be taken by the Company for the purpose of complying with the foregoing provisions of this Article, or in reliance on any list or certificate which shall have been furnished to the Company under any of such provisions.
G.	Authority of Local Union Officials
1.	No local officials (Union or Company) may make any agreement which modifies or contravenes the terms of the Labor Agreement unless it is approved by the USW International Representative and the Human Resources Manager.
2.	Therefore, unless the International Union is specifically enumerated as having sole Union authority, and except as stated in 1. above, local Union officials may make agreements with the local Company officials relative to matters arising under the Labor Agreement, letters and/or memoranda of understanding and such agreements are valid and binding upon both parties.

H.	So that we may maintain close liaison to provide mutual attention to the administration and application of the Labor Agreement, New Day Aluminum LLC and the Union will establish a joint committee which will meet quarterly for the purposes of exchanging information and views on business issues and of reviewing the state of the business. A representative of
New Day Aluminum LLC owners will attend at least annually.

1.	USW-PAC
The Company agrees that it will check off and transmit to the Treasurer of the USW PAC all contributions to the USW Political Action Fund from the earnings of those employees who voluntarily authorize such contributions on forms provided for that purpose by the USW PAC. The amount and timing of such check off deductions and the transmittal of such voluntary contributions shall be as specified in such forms and in conformance with any applicable state or federal statute.

The Union shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Company for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(1)	Described on the basis of facts as they exist; and
(2)	Assigned a Labor Grade by the agreement of the parties.

The decision of the company to disqualify an employee or determine that an employee is not qualified to hold a job may be subject to the grievance procedure.
f)	The number of trade or craft employees and the number of employees on other repair and maintenance jobs shall be determined by the Company. Displaced trade or craft employees may be placed on other jobs, and shall be paid the applicable standard rate for the job.
g)	The Company reserves the right to implement a multi-craft classification, subject to C.2, supra.
2.	Assigned Maintenance Jobs
It is recognized and understood that: (1) the inherent nature of assigned maintenance work is such that the requirements of the job as to training, skill, responsibility effort and working conditions may vary from day to day; and (2) to achieve maximum productivity, employees are called upon to perform varying duties in discharging the responsibilities of their assignments. These duties may include tasks related to, or incidental to, the maintenance assignment and necessary for the completion of the assignment, but not requiring specialized skill or training, even though the work may be the function of another classification. Therefore, it is agreed that:

E.	Apprenticeship and/or On-the-Job Training Programs for Trade, Craft, Assigned Maintenance Jobs
The Company and the Union agree that apprenticeship programs and/or on-the-job training programs for trade, craft, and assigned maintenance jobs shall be established where it is practicable to do so. Trainees will be employed where there is an identifiable and foreseeable need. Apprenticeship programs which may be established shall be in conformity with the Federal Apprenticeship Standards. Upon request, representatives of the Company and the Union will meet to discuss and work out details regarding such programs.
To assist in this regard, the parties have agreed to “Guidelines Relating to the Establishment of Apprenticeship and/or On-the-Job Training Programs for Trade, Craft and Assigned Maintenance Jobs”, (See Appendix C). Training programs may vary and, therefore, should be established and maintained in accordance with the Guidelines and plant needs and work requirements. Each such training program must contain an equal employment opportunity statement which insures that initial hire into the pool of present employees, and the selection of trainees from the pool, shall be made on a completely nondiscriminatory basis. Training programs should provide that trainee vacancies will be filled consistent with present seniority practices. Any tests or examination procedures utilized in determining eligibility for trainee vacancies should be directly related to the duty and performance requirements of the particular job involved. Proposed training programs should be reviewed with the appropriate representatives of the Federal and/or State Apprentice and Training Bureaus for possible approval and/or registration and sent to the designated representatives of the Company and the International Union for review prior to implementation. If representatives of the Company and the Union Committee cannot reach agreement on local training programs, the matter may be referred to the respective chairmen of the Company and the Union Negotiating Committees who will designate representatives to resolve the matter.
Notwithstanding the fact that a training program may be in effect, the Company will continue to fill Trade, Craft, or Assigned Maintenance jobs from the outside where qualified employees are not available.
F.	Corrections of Errors
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article, errors in application of rates of pay shall be corrected.
G.	Pay
Pay shall be by direct deposit to a financial institution account designated by the employee. For those employees unable to access on line their payroll information, the Company will provide an arrangement for them to be able to do so.

with the hourly rate only in the calculation of pay for hours worked (including overtime hours) and allowed time in accordance with Article 7.H.
For the purposes of this provision the work week shall in all cases commence on Monday.
ARTICLE 6
HOURS OF WORK
A.	This Article is intended to define the normal hours of work and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week, or of days of work per week. This Article shall not be considered as any basis for the calculation of overtime.
B.	The normal work day shall be either (1) eight (8) consecutive hours of work followed by sixteen (16) hours of rest in a consecutive twenty-four (24) hour period, or (2) twelve (12) consecutive hours of work as set forth in Appendix “D” 12-Hour Continuous Shift Operations, excepting that recognized rest and relief period shall be deemed to be time worked.
C.	The Company will exercise its efforts in good faith, subject to the requirements of efficient operations, to the end that employees will be scheduled on a basis of a normal work week of five (5) consecutive work days followed by a rest period of forty-eight (48) consecutive hours.
D.	16 Hours of Work Limit
It is the Company policy to confine hours of work to 16 hours within a 24-hour period.
It is understood that the only deviation from this policy could occur in the event of a major emergency beyond the control of the Company, such as a hurricane.
It is further understood that is the responsibility of the employee to notify the supervisor soliciting overtime that he or she has already worked 16 hours within a 24-hour period. Failure to advise the solicitor accordingly will relieve the Company of any bypass liability.
E.	Should it be necessary, in the interest of efficient operations, to establish schedules departing from the normal work week, the Company and the Chairman of the Grievance Committee, at the request of either, shall confer, together with the Department Grievance man of the department affected, to determine whether, based upon the facts of the situation, mutually satisfactory modified schedules can be arranged, but the final right to arrange working schedules rests with the Company, in order to avoid adversely affecting the operation of the plant.
F.	Determination of the starting time of the daily and weekly work schedules shall be made by the Company after discussion with the Grievance man for the department affected, and

such schedules may be changed by the Company from time to time to suit varying conditions of the business; provided, however, that indiscriminate changes shall not be made in such schedules. All schedule changes shall be posted not later than 3:00 p.m. on Thursday proceeding the week they become effective.
Schedule Change Penalty
In applying the following items to schedule changes made by the Company after 3:00 p.m. Thursday, any required payment to the employee shall be limited to only one of the three provisions. Further, it is agreed that this payment shall be in accordance with the provision which generates the greater payment.
1.	Schedules may be changed at any time provided, however, that any changes made subsequent to Thursday of the week preceding the week in which the change is to be effective shall be explained at the earliest practicable time to the appropriate Union representative of the employee affected. Provided further that changes in schedules shall not be made after Thursday of the week prior to the work week affected except for breakdowns or reasons beyond the control of the local Management. Should changes be made in schedules contrary to the above so that an employee does not work on a day that he has previously scheduled to work he shall be paid four (4) hours’ pay at his standard hourly rate.
2.	In the event an employee's schedule is changed, and he is required to work on what otherwise would have been his sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) consecutive day in the work week had his schedule not been changed, the employee shall be paid the appropriate overtime rates for such day or days, provided he worked all of his scheduled shifts in that work week. The provisions of this paragraph G. shall not apply if the employee is notified of the schedule change prior to 3:00 p.m. on Thursday of the preceding week.
3.	If the Company changes an employee’s schedule during a workweek in cases where it is for the convenience of the Company, such employee shall be notified at the earliest practicable time. Such an employee shall be guaranteed the same number of hours of work during that week he would have received had he not been changed, provided he did not lose hours of work from some other cause; i.e., illness, absenteeism, etc.
Promotions, demotions, reductions in force, and transfers at the employee's requests are not considered to be for the convenience of the Company.
In recognition of the difficulties imposed upon the Company through failure of employees to comply with working schedules, an employee reporting late for or absenting himself from work without just cause may be disciplined by the Company, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Any such discipline shall be issued to the employee within fourteen (14) calendar days, excluding vacation days or other scheduled days on which the employee is absent, unless otherwise agreed locally. Employees shall,

wherever possible, give prior notice to the Company whenever they either report late or absent themselves from work.
I.	Lunch Scheduling
Arrangements will be made so that employees can eat lunch reasonably close to the middle of the shift. Every effort will be made to apply this policy consistently. Deviations will occur only under unusual or abnormal circumstances.
It was agreed that the Maintenance Departments will eliminate the 10-minute morning break and, at the same time, extend the lunch break, from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. In the afternoon, employees will not be transported for the break period, rather the employees will break in a lunchroom or other suitable facility in the area where they are working. However, if employee(s) are performing work in a location where there is no suitable facility, that employee(s) will be provided transportation to a suitable facility.
J.	Shift Schedules and the number of employees working and assigned for each shift shall be determined by the Company. Any material change to a shift schedule, absent an emergency, will be preceded by 30-day notice to the Union.
ARTICLE 7
OVERTIME AND ALLOWED TIME
A.	Purpose
This Article is intended to provide the basis for calculation of, and payment for, overtime and allowed time and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week, or days of work per week.
B.	Definition of Terms
1.	“Week” as used in this Article shall mean and consist of the seven-day period beginning at 12:01 A.M. Monday, or at the shift changing hour nearest that time.
2.	“Overtime Rates” as used in this Article shall mean the rates for the overtime hours worked as provided in Section C of this Article.
C.	Conditions Under Which Overtime Rates Shall Be Paid
1.	Except as provided in Paragraph 2, immediately following, overtime rates shall be paid for:
a)	Hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours within the twenty-four (24) hour period commencing with the time an employee begins work, except that a tardy employee’s work day shall begin at the time it would have begun had he not been tardy. However, for the purpose of determining

hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours under this sub-section, an employee shall be considered to have commenced work on time if he is no more than two (2) hours late, provided he shall only be paid for hours actually worked.
b)	Hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.
c)	Hours worked on the sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) consecutive days worked
in the week; provided, however, that partial days worked shall for the purpose of this Paragraph be considered as days actually worked only if the failure to complete the day's work shall be due to the fault of the Company or an injury to the employee compensable under Workers' Compensation or when the employee receives allowed time under Subsection H.2. or Subsection H.3. of this Article.
d)	Hours worked on Sunday, except that time and one-half will be paid for time worked on Sundays.
e)	For Split Shift overtime pay, hours worked on scheduled off days will be paid as sixth (6th) day for their first scheduled day off and as seventh (7th) day for the second scheduled day off, provided that all scheduled hours are worked within the week.
2.	The Company will endeavor in good faith to make an equitable distribution of overtime, but this provision shall not be deemed to guarantee equal distribution of overtime, since it is not intended to preclude the Company from maximum utilization of competent or skilled workers in the interest of efficiency and economy.
3.	Overtime payments shall not be duplicated for the same hours worked under any of the terms of this Agreement and, to the extent that hours are compensated for at overtime rates under one provision, they shall not be counted as hours worked in determining overtime under the same or any other provisions; provided, however, that when a holiday occurs on any day for which overtime would not otherwise be paid the hours worked on such holiday shall be counted as hours worked in determining overtime under the provisions of Subsection C.1. of this Article.
4.	The overtime rate to be paid employees shall be one and one-half (1&1/2) times the regular rate of pay for the occupation on which the overtime hours are worked except seventh (7th) consecutive day work shall be double time.
5.	Employees who perform work on scheduled days off during any calendar week shall be paid at the overtime rate for all such time actually worked, provided that an employee who fails to work all scheduled shifts during a calendar week shall not be eligible for the overtime rate for the number of hours worked on a day off equal to the number of scheduled hours he failed to work during such week. However, hours worked for which overtime payments are paid under this Subsection of Article 7.C.4. shall not be considered as “hours worked” for the

purposes of computing any other overtime payments except for hours worked on the sixth (6th) and/or seventh (7th) consecutive days worked in the calendar week. This Article 7.C.4. shall become inoperative in the event the “normal work week”, as set forth in Article 6, should be reduced to less than five (5) days by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
If an employee works at least six hours on a shift, the day on which the shift was worked shall be counted as a day worked for the sixth and seventh consecutive day overtime purposes.
6.	Employees who are called out to work on the graveyard shift (11-7) and work a minimum of five (5) hours have the option of working their regular scheduled day shift. They must personally contact their immediate supervisor or the Plant Guard if the work is completed prior to 7 AM regarding their decision.
If this practice creates undue hardship on the Company’s ability to run the operations, the parties will meet to resolve any problems.
D.	Union Business
1.	Time lost from work by local union representatives on plant related union business except for a work stoppage of any type shall be considered as time worked during the workday or week for the purpose of calculating overtime.
2.	Charging Overtime For Union Business
PURPOSE: To set forth the understanding reached by the parties regarding the charging of overtime of employees who decline available overtime to attend a union meeting or function.
Employees who decline available overtime for the purpose of attending a union meeting or function shall not be charged for such overtime.
It is expressly understood that the foregoing understanding on overtime charging is in no way intended to preclude the Company from requiring employees to work overtime consistent with the provisions of local overtime agreements, letters of understanding, etc.
E.	Overtime Bypass
When the local overtime distribution system indicates that a particular employee should have been offered an overtime assignment, and that the employee was bypassed for that assignment, he will be given the opportunity to work at an overtime assignment on a day of his choosing within 30 days of bringing the bypass to the attention of the Company.

F.	Call-out Sheet - Description of Work
Supervisors will write on the call-out sheet a brief description of the job(s) that the employee was called out to perform. This brief description will only be written on the call-out sheet for the employee(s) who accepted the call-out.
G.	Craft Overtime Solicitation
The following agreement outlines the manner in which overtime will be solicited for the Maintenance crafts:
1.	Overtime will be offered by job(s) when specific jobs are needed for overtime assignment. In the case of a unit failure or shutdown; i.e., boiler, gas turbine, etc., where the overtime to be worked involves a multiplicity of jobs, overtime will be solicited on a unit basis.
2.	The Company and Union agree that the ability to effectively cover plant emergencies and essential needs, beyond the Company’s current rights to assign work and force overtime, are critical. Therefore, necessary overtime will be offered to those who have volunteered for overtime, by hours. Those who have volunteered for overtime must accept any overtime offered, unless such overtime puts the employee outside of the maximum number of hours that can be worked pursuant to Article 6 (D) or would result in a direct conflict with their normal work schedule. The Company and Union will work together to manage the overtime volunteer/solicitation process in a manner that ensures that required coverages are met. In the event the process described herein proves ineffective in providing the necessary coverage, the parties agree to discuss and implement a system of assigned coverage.
3.	Management will determine job priority and will determine the order of job solicitation.
4.	Employees may be pulled off any assignment during the shift if Management deems it necessary. Job priorities and assignments may change during a given shift and may even change between the time the employees are solicited and the time work begins. It is understood that employees who accept overtime assignments on a given shift will work the overtime needed on that shift, even though priorities and jobs change.
5.	An employee working one job on an overtime basis may be required to work additional jobs following completion of the first job; i.e., holdover employees may be required to work the balance of the overtime shift.
6.	Maintenance employees may be held over for job continuity purposes for a maximum of 2 hours.
7.	Continuation of an employee’s shift does not constitute forced overtime.

8.	Employees will not be allowed to choose overtime job(s). Each employee will be offered an assignment as his/her turn comes up, and once assigned, the Company will continue down the list as necessary. When the list is exhausted, the Company may force under the guidelines of the agreement concerning forcing. In any event, no employee must be offered more than one overtime opportunity for a holdover shift, regardless of the number of overtime jobs available. Employees who volunteer for overtime assignments must accept any assignment when offered.
H.	Conditions Pertaining to Allowed Time
1.	Employees who are regularly scheduled and who do report for work on time shall be paid, in the event no work for which they were scheduled is available, for their regularly scheduled daily hours of work (a minimum of eight (8)) at the rate in effect for the occupation for which they were scheduled. The employees so scheduled may be assigned to substitute work for which they may be qualified in lieu of their being released, and shall be paid at the rate in effect for the substitute work or for which they reported for work, whichever is the higher. Should employees refuse such assignment, they shall not receive the allowed time pay.
The phrase “when the employee receives allowed time under Subsection H.2. or H.3. of this Article,” means that if allowed time is paid under Subsections H.l. or H.3. on a particular day, that day is counted in determining sixth and seventh consecutive days worked in the workweek. All allowed time payment, including payment on the sixth and seventh consecutive days worked in the workweek, would be at the straight time rate. Work performed or payment of allowed time as a result of a call-out under Subsection H.5. does not qualify as a day worked for the purposes of determining sixth or seventh consecutive days worked in a workweek.
Scheduled Day Off:
2.	Employees who are notified to report for work on a scheduled day off and who do report on time shall be paid, in the event no work for which they were notified is available, for the designated number of hours at the rate in effect for the occupation for which they were notified to report for work; provided, however, such employees shall be guaranteed a minimum of eight (8) hours' work or pay at the rate in effect for the occupation for which they were notified to report for work. Such notification to report for work under this Subsection shall be given the employee before he finishes work on his last regularly scheduled shift prior to his day or days off. The employees so notified may be assigned to substitute work for which they may be qualified in lieu of their being released, and shall be paid at the rate in effect for the substitute work or for which they reported for work, whichever is the higher. Should employees refuse such assignment, they shall not receive allowed time pay or the eight (8) hours guarantee of work or pay.
Employees who are notified to report on a scheduled day off to work for a designated number of hours are guaranteed an allowed time payment for that

designated number of hours, with minimum guarantee of eight hours of pay. For example, if an employee is notified to report for three hours of work on his day off, and reports on time, he has a minimum guarantee of eight hours’ pay.
3.	An employee who is not notified in accordance with Subsection H.2. of this Article but who is called out to work a full shift on his day or days off and who reports on time for such shift shall be paid, in the event no work for which he was called out is available, for the number of hours of such shift at the rate in effect for the occupation for which he was called out. The employee so called out may be assigned to substitute work for which he may be qualified in lieu of his being released, and shall be paid at the rate in effect for the substitute work or for which he was called out, whichever is the higher. Should the employee refuse such assignment he shall not receive the allowed time pay. An employee is notified under this Subsection when:
a)	He is notified to report for work as a replacement for an absent member of a crew, and he does report, either at the beginning of the shift for the crew for which he is a replacement or at any time he is notified to report during that shift, the shift being the hours which have been designated by the Company for the crew; or
b)	He is notified to report to supplement a crew which has been previously scheduled and he does report, provided he reports at the beginning of the scheduled shift of the crew, the shift being the number of hours as designated by the Company for the crew; or
c)	He is notified to report for work where no crew has been notified in accordance with Subsection H.2., and he reports at the beginning of the shift which is designated by the Company to him at the time of notification.
The following example shows the manner of payment of allowed time: If there is a designated six-hour shift for a crew of employees who had been notified under Subsection H.l. and one member of the crew, who had been so notified in advance of that shift, could not work because of sickness, another employee could be called out under Subsection H.3. as a replacement. If such replacement reported at the' beginning of the designated shift for the crew, he would be eligible for allowed time payment up to a maximum of six hours. If, because of the shortness of the notice, the replacement reported one hour after the beginning of the designated shift, he would only be eligible for a maximum allowed time payment for the balance of the shift, which under this example would be five hours.
4.	Cancellation of Overtime Shifts
If an employee’s overtime shift is cancelled within four (4) hours of the time he is scheduled to report to work, he will be eligible to receive allowed time pay if told not to report. However, if the employee does report to work and the work for

which he was scheduled has been cancelled, postponed, etc. he may be offered other work in his classification, or substitute work. Should the employee refuse the other work in his classification or the substitute work, the employee will not receive the allowed time pay.
5.	Call-out
An employee called out to perform work before or after but not continuous with his daily working schedule shall be paid for not less than eight (8) hours’ work at the rate in effect for the occupation for which the employee was called out. An employee called out is subject to perform any assigned work. An employee is considered “called out” under this Subsection H.5. whenever he is notified after his scheduled shift ends that he is to perform work of an indefinite duration before he is next scheduled to work. “Continuous with”, as used in this Subsection H.5., shall not be applicable to those employees who are called out, for more than four (4) hours in advance of their shift; or in those instances where overtime agreements already in effect are applicable. It is also understood and agreed that this entire Subsection H.5. shall apply only to actual “call-outs” between shifts and not to those instances wherein the schedules are provided or changed on previous shifts.
An employee called out within two (2) hours prior to the start of a shift shall make every attempt to report at the start of the shift or as soon thereafter as practical, however, the employee shall have up to a maximum of two (2) hours in which to report to work. The employee shall receive allowed time from the start of the shift until the time he reports to work, but in no event more than two (2) hours.
An employee is called out when:
1.	He is called out to work on his day off, but only if he begins work at a time other than at the starting time of a scheduled shift, or
2.	He is called out to perform work within the twenty-four hour period from the starting time of his last scheduled shift worked, regardless of whether or not he begins his call-out at the beginning of a scheduled shift.
General:
1.	In all instances, an employee must meet all applicable contractual conditions to be eligible for allowed time payment.
2.	The hours worked added to the hours for which allowed time payment is made are not to exceed in total the hours for which the employee was either regularly scheduled or notified to report.

b)	An employee is not put to work or is laid off after having been put to work, either at his own request or due to his own fault, or
c)	The Company gives reasonable notice, as determined by the Company and the Grievance Committee, of a change in schedule or reporting time and that the employee scheduled or notified to report for work need not report.
then the provisions of this Section H. do not apply.
I. Pay for injury on the Job
Any employee suffering an injury on the job arising out of his work, which in the opinion of the Company Doctor or Nurse renders him unable to continue work, shall receive pay at the rate either straight time or overtime, he was being paid at the time of the injury for the balance of the shift on which the injury occurred. If the employee is sent to the plant medical department, or to a non-plant medical facility without being admitted and is required to remain at the medical department or facility for medical examination or treatment beyond the end of the shift upon which he was injured, such time shall be paid as hours worked. In addition, the Employee will be paid if the Company schedules an examination or treatment on a day other than the day on which the injury occurred.
It shall be understood that the Company will accept an employee's personal physician's opinion, in lieu of the Company Doctor or Nurse's determination, for all purposes specified in Article 7.I. provided: (1) the employee has reported the injury to the Company on the shift on which it occurred, and (2) the employee, upon return to work presents the Company with a letter or certificate from his physician which verifies the fact that the employee was treated by the physician and in the physician's opinion he was unable to work or continue work on the day in question.
In all cases where the employee has reported the injury on the shift on which it occurred or the Company acknowledged that the injury occurred on that shift and the employee submits medical certification that he was unable to work, the Company shall promptly pay the employee the appropriate “Pay for Injury on the Job.” The Company may, however, challenge the employee’s entitlement to such payment and should it thereafter be established that the employee was not entitled to such payment, the Company shall recover the payment from the employee’s earnings.
It is not the intent of this section to provide pay in addition to that received under applicable Workers’ Compensation statutes. If an employee is paid under this provision and the company is directed to or inadvertently pays Workers’ Compensation for the same day, the overpayment will be deemed to be recoverable from the employee’s earnings.

J. Forced Overtime
When it becomes necessary to force employees to work overtime, the section superintendents will communicate the need to force to the appropriate grievance representatives. The parties agree that employees will be forced, if necessary, when one or more of the following conditions are present:
1.	A serious safety problem exists;
2.	Critical spares need maintaining;
3.	To maintain continuity of operations;
4.	Environmental deadlines must be met;
5.	Economic penalties will be incurred, such as ship demurrage.
This agreement relates only to the forcing of straight day employees and employees on shifts other than 12 hour/21 turn shift operation. The forcing of twelve-hour shift/21 turn shift employees is governed by the Twelve-Hour Shift Agreement.
K. Weekend Tandem
Regarding an interpretation of Article 7, C.1.a., with respect to the case of an employee working a full shift on Sunday and a full shift on Monday, all of which falls within a 24-hour period, commencing at the beginning of the Sunday shift.
In such case, it is understood that the time worked on Monday shall be paid at appropriate overtime rate for all hours worked, irrespective of the end-of-the-week break, or the lack of consecutive work hours. The following three examples illustrate this understanding:

A.	Eligibility
1.	An employee shall be entitled to a vacation with pay during a calendar year if, at December 31 of the preceding year, or at any time while he is working between January 1 and November 30, inclusive, of such calendar year, he has one or more years of seniority and has either (1) worked 1000 or more hours in the immediately preceding 365 calendar days or (b) worked in at least 60% of the preceding fifty-two (52) weeks, provided during such period the scheduled work weeks have been reduced below five (5) days per week for more than twenty-six (26) weeks.
For the purpose of determining whether 1,000 or more hours have been worked, time lost during such 365 calendar days due to an injury arising out of Company employment, or due to jury or witness duty (Article 20), or due to bereavement leave (Article 21), or due to absence from work while on a previous year's vacation under this Article, or time lost while on Union business connected with the Company or holiday hours not worked but paid for, shall be added to the actual hours the employee worked at the rate of eight (8) hours per day but no more than forty (40) hours per week. An employee otherwise eligible who on November 30, lacks thirty-one (31) calendar days or less of the required seniority, will be deemed to have satisfied the seniority requirements for eligibility and for length of vacation.
2.	1 Week, 1 Day at a Time
a)	Employees eligible for at least three (3) weeks of vacation in a year may schedule up to two (2) weeks of vacation one day at a time. Employees eligible for less than three (3) weeks of vacation may schedule one (1) week of vacation one day at a time. If an employee chooses to schedule vacation one (1) day at a time during the vacation scheduling period, that decision is final. There can be no later decision to opt for a full week of vacation.

3.	An employee who, in any calendar year obtains a leave of absence for the purpose of entering the Armed Forces, and who provides proof of having entered the Armed Forces in such year, will be credited with hours worked at the rate of eight (8) hours per day but not more than forty (40) hours per week during such leave up to the date of having entered the Armed Forces, for the purpose of determining whether 1,000 hours have been worked during the immediately preceding 365 calendar days, and will be credited with service credit for the balance of such year for the purpose of satisfying the seniority requirements for eligibility and length of vacation for that year. An employee who, after being honorably discharged from the Armed Forces, is reinstated pursuant to the requirements of applicable federal law, shall in the year of his reinstatement without regard to the hours or weeks worked requirement be entitled to a regular vacation.

The Vacation taken shall consist of consecutive days and shall include Sundays and holidays; however, vacations of two (2) three (3) four (4), or five (5) weeks may consist of separate periods of one (1) week each.
In the calendar year in which an employee will become eligible for an additional week of paid vacation due to passing an anniversary date, the employee may take the vacation with pay in that year as long as it is scheduled to be taken after the employee’s anniversary date.
C.	Vacation Scheduling
1.	The vacation period shall be from January 1 to December 31, inclusive. However, a vacation week which overlaps a calendar year-end will be considered to be taken in the year in which it commences.
2.	Time lost by an employee for a period of at least an entire payroll week during the vacation period due to the necessity of reducing the working forces or due to bona fide sickness or injury or due to leave of absence shall be applied to any regular vacation time to which such employee is entitled if the employee so requests.
3.	The Union and the Company recognize the desirability of taking regular vacation rather than working and receiving pay therefore and, consequently, except in the case of National Emergency, by mutual agreement, or except as provided employees shall take regular vacations rather than receive pay in lieu thereof. However, the employee who is required to work instead of taking time off for regular vacation shall be entitled to vacation pay in addition to his regular pay providing he has not had time lost as described applied to all regular vacation to which he is entitled.
4.	In light of the amount of regular vacations provided by this Article, it is essential that the Union and Plant Management promptly review the vacation scheduling practices in effect, for the purpose of arriving at mutually satisfactory scheduling arrangements. In such review, the parties shall endeavor to accommodate the wishes of the employees as to desired vacation periods in an equitable manner, giving consideration to operating requirements and the desire of employees to take their regular vacations at times most appropriate to their individual situations. However, operating requirements will take precedence in vacation scheduling. The parties may also mutually agree to a plant shutdown, partial or complete, for the purpose of employees taking their regular vacations.
5.	The following provisions shall apply:
a)	The employee shall take his vacation as scheduled by the Management, provided he has not had time lost as described, applied to all regular vacation time to which he is then entitled. The employee’s desired vacation scheduling will be given consideration, but such schedule will

necessarily be governed by the operating requirements of the plant. No scheduled regular vacations will be changed without at least thirty (30) days’ notice to the employee, unless the employee consents to the change.
b)	An employee who is receiving sickness and accident benefits at a time when he would otherwise be on a previously scheduled vacation shall, upon request be paid his vacation pay for the vacation period involved.
c)	Whenever an employee moves voluntarily or otherwise, from one department to another subsequent to the completion of regular vacation scheduling in the latter department for the oncoming year, he shall not be entitled to displace another employee of this second department from an established regular vacation schedule regardless of their relative seniorities. The employee moving to the new department shall be scheduled for his vacation in accordance with his preference but subject to the orderly operation and production requirements of his new department.
6.	The parties agree to meet during the 4th quarter of each year to discuss the effectiveness of the vacation scheduling guidelines.
D.	Vacation Pay
1.	The vacation pay for a vacation of one week shall be the employee's average hours worked per week (not less than forty (40) hours and not more than fifty (50) hours) multiplied by the employee’s average earnings per hour (exclusive of overtime earnings, and schedule premium). The vacation pay for two (2), three (3), etc., weeks shall be two (2), three (3) times, etc., that amount respectively. The employee’s average earnings per hour, as well as the employee's average hours worked per week are averaged over the period of the ten (10) payroll weeks (excluding any week in which a paid holiday is observed) in which the employee worked prior to the date on which (a) the vacation period begins (or fourteen (14) days preceding that date if the employee requests advance vacation pay), or (b) the date the vacation is considered as starting.
Vacation pay computed on the basis of payroll weeks prior to a general wage change for a vacation or portion thereof scheduled after such wages change in such year shall be calculated as though the total wage change for such year had been in effect during the period used for calculating such vacation pay.
2.	The vacation pay will be paid as follows:
a)	Vacation pay will be paid on the regular pay days for the period of the employee’s vacation. However, an employee may receive vacation pay before he leaves for vacation time off provided such request is made in

b)	For the employee who request that regular vacation be applied because of time lost or who works instead of taking time off, as described under C.2. and C.3., the vacation pay shall be paid him on the first regular pay day occurring not less than ten (10) days following the date the employee makes such request.
c)	In the event of death of an employee who was eligible for a vacation, the amount of vacation pay to which he would have been entitled shall be paid to his proper legal representative.
E.	Miscellaneous
In the event of a war or other national emergency, or federal legislation designed to reduce the normal work week below forty (40) hours, either party may notify the other of a desire to negotiate with respect to an appropriate modification of this Plan or its termination. In the event of failure to agree within 120 days from such notice, if given as a result of the above described type of federal legislation, the Plan shall remain in effect subject to the termination provisions of the Agreement, but the parties shall be free to strike or lockout in support of their position with respect to such matters (and no other) notwithstanding the provisions of this or any other agreement between the parties.
Workweek vs. Vacation Week

3.	A Line of Progression describes and governs the manner in which an employee moves upward and downward and laterally through the job classifications in his department, and shall be set forth in Appendix “B” of this Agreement.
4.	A Department Line as shown in Appendix “B” is used in the application of seniority practices relating to reduction in forces.
B.	In all cases of promotion and transfer, except those positions excluded under the definition of employees in Section P hereto, and in all cases of increase or decrease in forces, the factors listed below	shall be considered.
1.	Seniority
2.	Ability to perform work
3.	Physical fitness
C.	Seniority shall be applied in the seniority unit, which may be an entire plant or any subdivision thereof, in such manner as may be established and agreed upon between the Union and the Management of the Company covered by this Agreement. A job may be in one seniority unit for one purpose, such as promotions, and may be in a different seniority unit for another purpose. The existing seniority unit or units to which the seniority factor shall be applied and the rules for application of the seniority factor, including service dates within these units covered by existing agreements, shall remain in effect unless or until modified by written agreement signed by the Company and the Union, and in which such agreement has not been consummated the Union and the Plant Management should complete an agreement covering the units of operation within each plant to which the seniority factor shall be applied within thirty (30) days from the date of execution of this Agreement; provided, however, that if a seniority agreement is not completed within the above mentioned thirty (30) day period, representatives of the Union and the Plant management shall agree to mutually satisfactory extension of such thirty (30) day period.
D.	Seniority shall be calculated from date of first employment or reemployment following a break in continuous service in accordance with the following provisions of this Article; provided, however, that the effective date of employment prior to the date of this Agreement shall be the date of first employment or reemployment after any event which constituted a break in service under the practices in effect at the time the break occurred.
1.	There shall be no deduction for any time lost which does not constitute a break in Seniority. Seniority is broken by:
a)	Voluntarily quitting the Company;
b)	Absence due to discharge or termination; or
c)	Absence due either to layoff or to disability, or both, which continues for more than three (3) years.

2.	Leaves of absence for elected office.
An employee appointed to or accepting any elective, full-time federal, state, county, or municipal government office shall, upon appropriate written notice to the Company, be granted a leave of absence for the duration of the term of office. Such employee may not accumulate seniority in excess of one term of office during such leave of absence except for the purpose of recall rights under this Article 9, and any accumulation in excess of one term of office shall not be counted for any other purpose under this or any other agreement between the Company and the Union. Further, any employee benefiting from this provision will not receive or accumulate any other benefits during such leave. These benefits include, but are not limited to, vacation, insurance, pension, and SUB benefit tiers.
Any employee who shall be granted a leave under this Subsection will be reinstated to such position as his qualifications and accumulated seniority shall entitle him in accordance with plant practice, provided he shall apply to the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after the expiration of his term of office and shall report for work within ten (10) days after his application is received by the Company.
E.	New employees, which includes those hired after a break in continuity of service, will be regarded as probationary employees for the first ninety (90) days of actual work. Such employees will receive no continuous service credit during such period, except as provided for in Article 3, Section D. Probationary employees may be laid off, or terminated at the discretion of the Company. Probationary employees continued in the service of the Company subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day of actual work shall receive full continuous service credit from the first day worked.
F.	The Company shall provide the Union with the record of years of service of all employees and keep the same current in accord with arrangements between the Plant Manager and authorized representatives of the Union, in order that the seniority status of employees may be determined. Any employee who has a grievance in regard to seniority status as indicated by such seniority records must present his grievance within thirty (30) days after delivery by the Company to the Union of the seniority record which first determines such employee's seniority status for any purpose, including but not limited to the seniority status of employees set forth in lists heretofore delivered to the Union by the Company; it is the intent hereof that employees shall not have the right to file grievances respecting their own seniority status at the time of delivery of future lists, unless such future lists show a change in seniority status from that established on lists previously delivered by the Company to the Union. The Company shall make available to inspection by the Union its records upon which it bases the aforesaid seniority lists upon request of the Union in the event of any dispute between employees as to their relative seniority status.
The Company shall prepare and post on bulletin boards for inspection seniority lists for each department.

Seniority lists shall be available within departments for inspection at all times and shall be revised to reflect the seniority status as of January 31, and July 31 with copies sent to the Union.
Whenever two or more employees have equal department seniority, the employee with the most plant seniority shall be considered the most senior.
If employees have equal plant seniority, the employees will be ranked in badge number order, the lower badge number being considered the most senior.
G.	Seniority List Corrections
Whenever a mistake on a seniority list is discovered and acknowledged, a form shall be available to be signed by the foreman and the affected employee which corrects the mistake, and one copy of the form shall be sent to the Company office where the seniority lists are maintained, and one copy of the form shall be provided to the Union. If such alleged error is agreed as to an error by Step 3 representatives of the Company and the Union as defined in Article 10 such error will be corrected irrespective of the time interval between occurrence and initial knowledge of such error.
H.	Reductions in Force
1.	Whenever possible, the Company will provide the Union with at least seventy-two (72) hours-notice of a reduction in force. In the event of layoffs resulting from strikes, work stoppages in connection with labor disputes, breakdown of equipment or failures of utilities beyond the control of the Company, emergencies, or acts of God, the Company will provide as much notice as possible.
2.	When a reduction in force is implemented in a given job, employees in the affected job will be permitted to volunteer for layoff on the basis of departmental seniority.
3.	In the absence of a sufficient number of voluntary layoffs, the employees in the affected job with the least amount of department seniority shall be reduced to the next lower job that they have previously been qualified to perform in that line of progression, provided they have the department seniority to displace other employees in that job.
4.	The above procedure will be followed in each successive lower job in that line of progression until the employees with the least amount of department seniority in the lowest job in that line of progression have been displaced.
5.	The least senior employees who cannot hold the lowest job in their line of progression may exercise their department seniority to displace the junior employees in the lowest job for which they have previously been qualified in another line of progression in that department.

6.	The least senior employees who cannot hold the lowest job in their department may exercise their plant seniority to displace the junior employees in the lowest job for which they have previously been qualified in another department. If there is no such position for which these employees have previously been qualified, they may exercise their plant seniority to displace junior employees in the lowest job in any department to which they would otherwise be eligible to transfer under Article 24; provided that such employees will not be eligible to displace junior employees in the Warehouse or the Laboratory.
7.	Affected employees who desire to accept a layoff instead of exercising bumping rights and employees in affected jobs who elect to take a voluntary layoff must so notify the Human Resources Department in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of notice of the reduction in force. An employee who accepts a layoff under either of these conditions shall be eligible for recall only to his own job classification on the basis of his department seniority.
8.	In case of reductions in forces and recall from layoff, the Chairman of the Grievance Committee and Safety Committee, Grievance Committeemen and Union officers, as designated by the International Union shall be given preferential seniority to retain employment within the plant and to be recalled from layoff to the plant as allowed by law. Grievance Committeemen may exercise preferential seniority to remain in their respective department, provided, however, if the entire department of the Grievance Committeeman is shut down, then the Grievance Committeeman for such department may exercise preferential seniority only to remain within the plant. Preferential seniority shall not be recognized for promotions or demotions to higher or lower rated jobs within the plant or any department.
9.	During a short-term shutdown of Digestion and/or any other department, for the purpose of inspection and/or repair, bargaining unit employees will not be laid off.
I.	Recall from Layoff
1.	When employees are to be recalled from layoff, the Company will notify the individuals to be recalled by certified letter. Each employee must keep the Human Resources Department advised of his current address and telephone number. The Company shall fully satisfy its notification obligation by sending a certified letter to the address carried on the Company's personnel records. A list of those recalled will be forwarded to the Union.
2.	Employees notified of recall must contact the Company within twenty-four (24) hours following notification of recall and must report for work within seven (7) calendar days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date of notification. Employees who fail to report to work shall be deemed to have voluntarily resigned their employment and forfeit all seniority rights, together with all other rights under the Labor Agreement.

J.
Prior Job Qualification
For purposes of implementing Sections H and I, above, an employee will be deemed to have previously been qualified for a particular job if he had been qualified for such job within the five (5) years preceding the layoff or recall, as the case may be.
K.	Recall from Layoff.
Employees who have been reduced from a particular department and subsequently laid off shall, upon recall, be recalled to that department prior to assigning other employees into that department.
L.	Application of Preferential Seniority
1.	Where a shutdown or substantial reduction in employees is scheduled or it otherwise appears that such will result in a violation of the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, appropriate representatives of the International Union and the Company shall make adjustments in the operation of this Section so as to bring it into compliance with the law.
2.	When a Grievance Committeeman is responsible for more than one department and when the department in which he is employed is shut down, he is entitled to preferential seniority in the other department over which he is responsible. For example, if a Grievance Committeeman has responsibility over Departments A and B, and he is employed in Department A, if Department A is shut down or is eliminated, he has preferential seniority rights in Department B, even though he has theretofore never been employed in Department B.
M.	If employees, not to exceed two (2), are hired as full-time representatives by the International Union, they shall be entitled to leaves of absence for the period of their employment by the International Union. Full-time representatives of an International Union benefiting from this provision will be eligible to participate in the Company’s medical plan until the earlier of: (1.) when the representative is eligible for coverage under the International Union’s medical plan; or (2.) for one (1) year following their appointment. Additionally, they may only accumulate seniority for the purpose of recall rights under this Article 9. Accumulated leave shall not be counted for any other purpose under this or any other agreement between the Company and the Union. Further, fulltime representatives of the International Union benefiting from this provision will not receive or accumulate any other benefits during such leave. These benefits include, but are not limited to, vacation, insurance, pension, and SUB benefit tiers.
N.	It is recognized that efficiency of operations may reasonably require, under certain circumstances, a relaxation of strict adherence to detailed seniority practices which may be established by mutual agreement at plants covered by this Agreement. It is therefore agreed that the Company shall have the right to take up such matters with the Grievance Committee, which, in good faith, will cooperate with the Company in making specific exceptions to such rules to the end of meeting these problems.

O.	Any employee promoted or transferred to a position excluded from this Agreement shall continue to accumulate seniority during the time he is working in an excluded position, provided that at the time of said employee’s transfer or promotion he was eligible to accumulate seniority under the then existing understanding between the parties; and provided further that the employees of the Unit to which such employee is transferred are represented by the Union. Any employee so promoted or transferred after the date of execution of this Agreement, in order to continue to accumulate seniority, must have worked at least two thousand eighty (2,080) hours as an employee; provided, however, that in the establishment of new departments or plants, the parties by mutual consent may relax this requirement so as to permit the promoted or transferred employees to continue to accumulate seniority. Accumulated seniority as set forth herein shall be exercised in accordance with agreements provided for in Section C. of this Article.
1.	However, no person in a supervisory position shall retain or accumulate seniority under this Labor Agreement unless the Company and the Union mutually agree to the contrary. Company utilization of bargaining unit employees as temporary supervisors without loss of seniority shall be subject to option and agreement.
2.	An employee who is transferred or promoted from the bargaining unit to an “excluded position” shall be given ninety (90) calendar days from the date of such promotion to return to his former job in the department from which he was promoted without modification of his seniority or right to return to the job from which he was promoted. After the ninety (90) calendar day time limit, an employee who remains in the excluded position will not retain or accumulate bargaining unit seniority.
3.	Exception to Paragraphs 1 and 2 will be made for hourly employees who are temporarily transferred to excluded positions for the following reason:
a) Employees transferred to other plants for training purposes and start-up operations.
Such temporary assignments shall not exceed one (1) year unless the parties to this agreement agree to extensions due to unusual circumstances.
Vacancies caused by employees being promoted or transferred to an “excluded position” shall be filled by permanent promotion to the end of the ninety (90) day evaluation period during which time the job(s) will be filled in accordance with the provisions for filling permanent vacancies, but the job(s) shall not be awarded permanently until the completion of the ninety (90) day period.
P.	When an employee is disabled and he is no longer capable of performing his regular job, such employee may exercise his seniority, to find a job which he can capably perform.
When an employee is permanently or temporarily partially disabled he shall be examined by the Company doctor to determine the type of work that he is able to perform. This decision is subject to arbitration, in which event, the Company doctor and a doctor designated by the Union will mutually select a third doctor to act as arbitrator.

1.	In the event he is no longer capable of performing his job, he shall be assigned to a lower job in his leg of the departmental line of progression according to department seniority.
2.	If he is unable to perform a job in his leg of the departmental line of progression, or lacks sufficient departmental seniority to displace an employee in his leg of the departmental line of progression, he may be assigned to one of the bottom jobs in departmental line of progression in his department according to department seniority.
3.	If he is unable to qualify for one of these bottom jobs due to lack of department seniority or physical limitation, he may be assigned to the Spare classification in his department (if applicable) by department seniority.
4.	If he is unable to perform any of the above jobs due to lack of department seniority or physical limitation, he may then be assigned to displace by plant seniority an employee in accordance with Article 9, Sec. H.
If it is necessary assigned to displace a junior employee, the disabled employee must first be assigned to a job that is equal to or below his previous labor grade. He must also be assigned to the job equal to or below to the labor grade his permanent job. The employee must be assigned to the lowest rated job-by-job class that he is able to perform.
The disabled employee, placed on the job in accordance with the above procedure, must be qualified in all respects to perform the job as determined by the Company doctor.
5.	Displaced employees who are reduced from their jobs as a result of this provision,
will be reduced according to Article 9, Sec. H.
6.	An employee initially electing to be assigned as a result of a permanent partial disability shall forfeit his old department seniority and commence accruing department seniority in the new department effective the date of the new assignment. The employee shall exercise his departmental seniority in the newly assigned department in accordance with the provisions of the Supplemental Agreement.
In case a disabled employee is subsequently bumped from his department, he may bump the junior plant employee occupying a job that he is qualified to perform. He shall be recalled to the department where his seniority exists.
Q.	Minimum Standards for Seniority Agreement
The Company shall have the right to designate the specific job to which an employee shall be assigned and to change such assignments where necessary to provide jobs for longer service employees except in those exceptions already agreed to at the plant level. Furthermore, in order to maintain efficiency, the Company need not assign laid off

employees to a job in any operating or service unit where such assignment will result in undue dilution of experienced employees in such unit except as specifically agreed to the contrary. It is understood and agreed to that these jobs shall be used in effecting layoff and recall from the plant. It is further agreed that the local parties will negotiate such rules as are necessary and proper to fulfill the objectives of this Article.
R.	Plant Closing Program
1.	The Company shall provide sixty days written notice, if circumstances permit, to the International Union of its intention to permanently close a plant or major operating department. In the event of such notice, the parties shall immediately commence discussions regarding the impact which the closing will have on affected employees. At the Union’s request the Company shall explain the basis for its decision to close a plant or major operating department.
Without being obligated to bargain over its decision to permanently close a plant or major operating department the Company shall consider any proposals of the Union which may either postpone or avoid the necessity for the closing, or which may minimize the adverse consequence of the closing for affected employees. If requested by the Union, the Company will share any reasonable costs not paid by any public agencies for a feasibility study to determine whether there are alternative uses of the plant, or alternative forms of ownership, including employee ownership, which would preserve job opportunities at the plant.
If a plant or major operating department is to be permanently shut down, the Company and the Union will designate appropriate representatives at the location to coordinate such activities as:
•	liaison with federal, state, and local governmental officials who have some relationship to the assistance of affected employees in an effort to focus governmental support for the affected employees;
•	personal contact with affected employees to assess needs and personal preferences in terms of assistance.
2.	In the event of the permanent shutdown of a plant, or a substantial layoff at a plant location, the Company and International Union representatives shall meet to determine whether appropriate Federal, State, or local government funds are available to establish an employee training, counseling, and placement assistance program for that facility. If such funds are available, the Company and Union shall work jointly to secure such funds to establish a program to provide: alternative job training for affected employees for job opportunities; counseling for affected employees on available benefit programs and job opportunities possibly available at other plants of the Company covered by this Agreement.
In implementing such program, the Company will cooperate with the involved union and state unemployment agency, other appropriate public or private employment agencies, and area employers in an effort to seek job opportunities

ARTICLE 10
ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
A.	Purpose
It is the intent and purpose of this Article, which shall be available to both the Union and the Company, to provide for the presentation and equitable adjustment of grievances. Except under the conditions set forth in this Article (and in the case of the Union only after compliance with the International Constitution of the Union.), there shall be no lockouts, strikes, or interruptions or cessations of work during the term of this Agreement. Should any differences arise between the Company and the Union as to the meaning or application of the provisions of this Agreement, or as to any question relating to the wages, hours of work, or other conditions of employment of any employee, the same shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
It is understood, however, that should either party fail or refuse to comply with the decision of an Arbitrator made under Step 5 of this Article, the foregoing provisions shall have no force or effect if compliance with such an award by the defaulting party is not made after a demand for compliance by the other party through the following designated representative: (a) on behalf of the Union, the appropriate International Representative; or (b) on behalf of the Company, its Counsel.
B.	Grievance Committees
The Grievance Committee for the plant shall consist of not less than three (3) employees nor more than ten (10) employees designated by the Union. The Union will certify to the Company a list of all Grievance Committee members. The Union Committee representative shall not handle any grievances arising outside of his respective department or steps of the grievance procedure as set forth in Article 10 except when the department union representative is not in the plant. The Grievance Committee members will be afforded time off with pay after application to, and permission from, their supervisor as may be required to take up matters pertaining to the settlement of grievances. Time off for the above purpose will not be unreasonably withheld. Authorized time spent by an employee involved in the grievance process shall not be counted as time lost for computing eligibility qualifications for vacation purposes.
1.	The Company agrees to pay the Union President and Safety Chairman at the standard rate and shift differential, if any, of their job prior to assuming their fulltime Union duties. Such hours will be considered company paid union business. Any work performed by such Union officials beyond their paid union business will otherwise be compensated in accordance with this Agreement.

2.	Grievance Chairman Pay
The Chairman of the Union’s Grievance Committee shall be relieved from duty and paid for twenty-four (24) hours per month, exclusive of time spent in scheduled meetings with the Company’s grievance representatives. Such paid time off must be scheduled in advance by Wednesday of the preceding week, and it must be scheduled in four (4) hour increments. If the Company cannot relieve the Chairman on a particular day in a given week because there will not be sufficient number of qualified employees available to fill the resulting vacancy, the Company will work with the Chairman to identify an alternative day on which the time off may be taken. The rate of pay under this section shall be the same rate as the Chairman would have received had he worked such hours.
C.	Procedure
Each grievance shall be presented to the appropriate party hereinafter indicated for the initiation of a grievance within fourteen (14) calendar days after the occurrence of the grievance or be deemed to have been waived by the aggrieved party; provided, however:
If the grievance occurs when the employee aggrieved is absent from the plant due to vacation or holiday, such fourteen (14) calendar day period shall not commence until the employee returns to work.
Step 1: Any employee who believes that he has a justifiable request, or alleged complaint may discuss the request or alleged complaint with the affected foreman, with or without the Assistant Grievance Committeeman or Grievance Committeeman being present as he may elect, in an attempt to settle the same, except when the complaint involves an alleged breach of this Agreement a Committeeman shall be present. Where the request or complaint has been submitted to the affected foreman, he shall give the aggrieved employee an answer within seven (7) calendar days. No written disciplinary action may be issued to an employee without a Union representative present.
Whenever a Committeeman has been present for a justifiable request, alleged complaint, or an alleged breach of this Agreement, subsequent discussions on the same instant issue must also be in the presence of the Assistant Grievance Committeeman or Grievance Committeeman.
Step 2: In order for a grievance to be considered further, within seven (7) calendar days thereafter, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, the grievance shall be reduced to writing by such employees on forms provided by the Company, dated and signed by the employee involved and four (4) copies delivered to his Department Superintendent (or such other representatives as may be designated by the Company) by his Grievance Committeeman. A meeting will be held in Step 2 within seven (7) calendar days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the grievance is delivered.
After the grievance has been discussed in a meeting between the Superintendent (or other Company representative, as the case may be) and the Department Grievance Committeeman, the Superintendent (or other Company representative, as the case may

Either party may produce at the meeting any persons familiar with the facts involved to aid in the solution of the problem.
Step 3: In order for a grievance to be considered further, the Chairman of the Grievance Committee shall serve written notice of appeal on the Company prior to the expiration of ten (10) calendar days following the disposition of the grievance in Step 2 hereof. Such grievance shall be discussed thereafter at a meeting to be held between the Chairman of the Grievance Committee and a representative of the Company within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of service of the notice of appeal, and a written disposition made thereof within ten (10) calendar days following the Step 3 meeting. Either party may produce at the meeting any persons familiar with the facts involved to aid in a solution of the problem.
Step 4: In order for a grievance to be considered further, a representative of the International Union shall serve on the appropriate representative of the Company written notice of appeal to Step 4 prior to the expiration of ten (10) calendar days following the receipt of the Company’s written disposition of the grievance in Step 3 hereof. Such notice shall state (a) the subject matter of the grievance, (b) its identifying number, and (c) the objections of the appealing party to the previous disposition. Such grievance shall be discussed thereafter at a meeting to be held upon a mutually agreeable date (but within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of service of the notice of appeal) between the representatives of the Company certified to the Union in writing as accredited representatives of the Company, and representatives of the International Union similarly certified to the Company, for the purpose of attempting to settle the grievance. The International Union representative may request an extension of time for this meeting. Such request will not be unreasonably withheld.
Grievances discussed in such meeting shall be answered in writing by the representatives of the Company within ten (10) calendar days after the date of such meeting unless by mutual agreement a different date for disposition is agreed upon.
Either party may request a further statement of facts to be made available not later than three (3) calendar days preceding the date set for the meeting. Either party may produce at such meeting any persons familiar with the facts involved to aid in a solution of the problem.
Typewritten minutes shall be kept of the meeting and shall confirm essentially to the following outline:

Step 5: In order for a grievance to be considered further, it shall be appealed within ten (10) calendar days from the date of receipt of the written disposition of the grievance in Step 4 by the accredited representative of the International Union or the accredited representative of the Company to an impartial Arbitrator whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties.
The parties shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to submit a panel of five (5) qualified arbitrators. The Company will pay for the panel list. Within ten (10) days of receipt of the panel, a representative of the Company and the representative of the International Union shall alternately strike names from the panel until one remains who shall be the arbitrator. The parties will strike first on a rotating basis.
The Company agrees that it shall not subpoena or call as a witness in arbitration proceedings any employee from any bargaining unit in the plant from which the grievance arises. The Union agrees that it shall not subpoena or call as a witness in such proceedings any non-bargaining unit employee from the same plant.
The Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction and authority only to interpret, apply or determine compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Memoranda, Supplements, etc., insofar as shall be necessary to the determination of grievances appealed to the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement, Memoranda, Supplements, etc. No Arbitrator shall be selected in a discharge case unless he agrees to advance to render a decision within 45 days of the close of the record.
The expense and salary incident to the services of the Arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Company and the Union. Where grievances concerning written warnings and/or disciplinary suspensions of less than 5 days are to be arbitrated, they shall be arbitrated in the Accelerated Arbitration Procedures unless the 4th step representatives of the Union agree to refer such grievance to regular arbitration through regular procedures.
No briefs shall be submitted in the course of arbitration by either party, except by mutual agreement; provided however, that if the arbitrator requests post-hearing briefs either party may submit a brief without consent of the other.
In the event a transcript is requested by the arbitrator, or the Company elects to have one, the Company will pay the expense of the court reporter, and the Union will pay only the cost of their copy of the transcript if they request one.
Grievances by the company, and grievances of a general nature by the Union, shall be initiated in Step 4 by a written statement thereof served by the aggrieved party upon the other.

Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, or any of them, may be waived by agreement of the representatives involved in each particular step of the grievance procedure. During each step of the grievance procedure the Union and the Company shall disclose the pertinent facts and information relied upon. Copies of such information or materials shall be made available.
The failure of the aggrieved party or his representative to present the grievance within the prescribed time limits in Steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 shall be considered as a waiver of the grievance.
Waiver by the Union or by an employee as hereinbefore provided for, due to failure to process the grievance within the time periods established, shall not constitute a binding precedent on the merits of the particular grievance, in the event of a later recurrence of any situation which gives rise to the grievance so waived or automatically granted.
If an employee is given a written discipline, written notice of such discipline shall be given to the employee. The written notice shall include a statement of his right to grieve the discipline and to have Union representation. Records of previous disciplinary action more than one year old shall be void and not used for any purpose.
In the event an employee dies, the Union may continue to process or initiate on behalf of his legal heirs any grievance claim filed prior to or after the death, if such claim would result in a monetary award under any provision of this Agreement.
Subject to the need to obtain clarification of an arbitrator’s decision, any payment required under a grievance settlement or arbitration award shall be made within 30 days from such settlement or receipt of such award.
It is recognized that multiple grievances occasionally arise out of a single incident and that such grievances often have a common set of facts. Also, it is recognized that multiple grievances are occasionally based upon the interpretation of the same provision of an agreement. In these situations, where expediency and convenience are otherwise served, the Company will consider submitting such grievances to a single arbitrator. However, in the interest of rapid handling of grievances and compliance with the time limits of the Labor Agreement, multiple grievances shall not be submitted to an arbitrator under any circumstances if they did not occur within a common 30-day period.
Neither party shall use as evidence in support of its position in any grievance or arbitration proceedings, any bargaining proposals that were introduced and subsequently withdrawn during this and any prior negotiations.
D.	Accelerated Arbitration Procedure
The parties shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to submit a panel of five (5) qualified arbitrators. The Company will pay for the panel list. Within ten (10) days of receipt of the panel, a representative of the Company and the representative of the International Union shall alternately strike names from the panel until one remains who shall be the arbitrator. Their expenses and fees shall be borne equally by the company and the local Union. The rules of procedure for Accelerated

Arbitration shall be maintained by the representatives of the parties and modified by them as deemed appropriate.
Grievances concerning alleged violations of Article 12, Supervisors shall be arbitrated in the Accelerated Arbitration Procedure unless the 4th Step representatives of the Union agree to refer such grievance to regular arbitration through regular procedures.
The Accelerated Arbitration Procedure shall be implemented with due regard to the following:
1.	As to any grievance appealed to Step 4 of the grievance procedure, the parties’ Step 4 representative shall within ten (10) days after receipt of such appeal review the grievance and grievance record and shall communicate with one another to determine whether such grievance shall be referred to the Accelerated Arbitration Procedure. If either party’s Step 4 representative disagrees, the grievance shall not be submitted to this Accelerated Arbitration Procedure and the plant representative shall be so notified. Time requirements for regular appeal to Step 4 shall then apply.
2.	If the parties’ Step 4 representatives agree to refer the grievance to the Accelerated Arbitration Procedure, the following shall govern:
a)	As to any grievance referred back to Step 3, the parties’ Step 3 representative shall again attempt to settle the grievance. If they are unable to settle the grievance, the Union Step 3 representative may appeal the grievance to the Accelerated Arbitration procedure by notifying the Company’s Step 3 representative within seven (7) days of receipt of the referral of the grievance from Step 4. In such case the procedure outlined in subparagraph (b) below shall be implemented.
b)	A FMCS panel member shall be contacted and requested to serve on the case or cases designated for accelerated arbitration at a time and place agreed upon by the Step 3 representatives. The date for the hearing shall be within ten (10) days of the appeal unless an extension of time is mutually agreed to by the Step 3 representatives. The rotation shall be followed until a panel member accepts the assignment. The next assignment shall be offered to the next panel member in the rotation.
3.	The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
a)	The hearing shall be informal;
b)	No briefs shall be filed or transcripts made;
c)	There shall be no formal evidence rules;
d)	Each party’s case shall be presented by a previously designated representative, who shall be the plant and local Union representatives;

e)	The Arbitrator shall have the obligation of assuring that all necessary facts and considerations are brought before him by the representatives of the parties. In all respects, he shall assure that the hearing is a fair one;
f)	If the Arbitrator or the parties conclude at the hearing that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to require further consideration by the parties, the case shall be referred to the 4th Step and it shall be processed as though appealed on such date.
4.	The Arbitrator shall render his decision within forty-eight (48) hours after conclusion of the hearing, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays). His decision shall be based on the record developed by the parties before and at the hearing and shall include a brief written explanation of the basis for his conclusion. These decisions will not be cited as a precedent in any discussion of grievances or at any step of the grievance procedure or in subsequent arbitration, except that the disciplinary action resulted shall not be barred by this provision from use in other grievances or Arbitration Cases at the same location. However, when previous disciplinary cases decided in accelerated arbitration are cited in subsequent grievances, or arbitration cases, the citation shall be limited to the result of that prior decision. The decision itself shall not be presented.
The authority of the Arbitrator shall be the same as those provided in Article 10 of the Labor Agreement between the parties.
5.	Any grievance appealed to this Accelerated Arbitration Procedure must be confined to issues which do not involve novel problems and which have limited contractual significance or complexity.
6.	The decisions in accelerated arbitration shall be consistent with the decisions issued by Impartial Arbitrators through the regular arbitration procedure, except in those instances where differences exist in Master Agreements and where the decisions of the Impartial Arbitrator concern different Local Supplemental Agreements or Local Understandings.

8.	The Leaderman may be removed from the position if the Company determines, following consultation with the Union, that the Leaderman is not adequately performing the role of a Leaderman. If dissatisfied with the Company’s decision, the Union may challenge the removal with an “arbitrary and capricious” standard to be applied by the arbitrator.

ARTICLE 13
DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINE CASES
A.	In the exercise of its rights under Article 11, the Company agrees that no employee shall be peremptorily discharged from and after the date hereof, and in all instances in which the Company may conclude that an employee's conduct justifies suspension or discharge, he first shall be suspended. Such suspension shall be for not more than five (5) calendar days, unless by mutual agreement of the parties or due to extenuating circumstances. During this period of initial suspension of the employee, if he believes that he has been unjustly dealt with, shall request a hearing and a statement of the offense before the Department Superintendent or his designated representative, with his Grievance man and/or Chairman of the Grievance Committee present. At such hearing the facts concerning the case shall be made available to both parties. After such hearing the Company may conclude whether the suspension shall be converted into discharge or, dependent upon the facts of the case, that such suspension be affirmed, extended, or revoked. If the suspension is revoked, the employee shall be returned to employment and receive full compensation for earnings lost, but in the event a disposition shall result in the affirmation or extension of the suspension or discharge of the employee, the employee may within five (5) calendar days file a grievance in Step 2, which shall be deemed to have been appealed to Step 4 of the Grievance Procedure under Section C of Article 10, and the Step 4 meeting shall be held and a decision made within five (5) calendar days from the date of filing or such grievance. Should it be determined by the Company, or by an Arbitrator in accordance with Step 5 of the Grievance Procedure, that the employee has been discharged or suspended unjustly, the Company shall reinstate the employee and pay full compensation for earnings lost.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Union may agree to a compromise settlement of a discharge case in the event it is shown that the employee was partially at fault, or an Arbitrator may in such a case modify the disciplinary action.
B.	The following discipline procedure shall be applicable to non-probationary employees for disciplinary suspensions, discharges and terminations, provided: (1) the continuance of employment does not represent an impairment to the Company’s ability to operate in a safe manner and (2) no concerted activity is involved. When practicable, such disciplinary action should take place within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Company receiving sufficient information to determine that the employee engaged in behavior that merits discipline.
C.	This procedure shall not be applicable to suspensions, discharges and terminations resulting for causes such as the following:
1.	Fighting.
2.	Possession of or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
3.	Theft or fraud.

6.	Actions that represent a danger to the safety of employees.
D.	Regarding administration of discipline to which this procedure is applicable, the employee shall be returned to work (if he would have been scheduled to work but for the discipline) when a grievance is timely filed. If a grievance is filed after the start of suspension for a cause to which the procedure is applicable, the employee shall be contacted and shall be advised that as a result of the grievance filing, the remaining balance of the suspension period is being deferred pending final resolution of the grievance and he will be scheduled to return to work (if he would have been scheduled to work but for the discipline) as soon as practicable but without pay for the time he was held out of work, unless such pay is provided for in the final determination of his grievance.
E.	Grievances involving employees who are retained or returned to work under this procedure will be processed under the regular grievance and arbitration procedure; provided, however, the parties recognize that time is of the essence and both parties will exert their best efforts to expedite the processing of the grievance at all steps and will immediately select an arbitrator. Grievances concerning disciplinary suspensions of less than 5 days shall be arbitrated in the accelerated arbitration procedure in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article 10.
F.	An employee who has invoked this procedure will remain subject to all other provisions and conditions of continued employment applicable to any other member of his or her bargaining unit.
G.	Grievance or disputes concerning the applicability of this procedure will be submitted to the regular arbitration procedure.
H.	Discipline During Shift. Disciplinary suspensions shall not commence during an employee’s shift unless, in the opinion of the Company, the immediate suspension of the employee is in the best interests of safety or good order. No such suspension shall be issued until a Union representative has first been notified, unless a Union representative is not readily available.
ARTICLE 14
SAFETY AND HEALTH
The Company and the Union will continue to cooperate toward eliminating safety and health hazards and will continue to encourage employees to use the procedures stated herein in reaching this objective.

Identified hazards will be reported to Management for appropriate corrective action.
At every third monthly meeting the Committee shall review its activities conducted during the previous period. The International Union Staff Representative servicing the location may attend and participate in this meeting.
The Company shall provide protective devices, wearing apparel (excluding safety shoes) and other equipment necessary to protect employees from industrial illness and/or injury. The management and union co-chairmen of the joint safety and health committee shall confer and resolve any safety and health problems associated with personal apparel provided by the company. And further, the Company will continue to maintain adequate first aid coverage at all of its facilities.
On April 1, 2017, April 1, 2018, April 1, 2019, April 1, 2020 and April 2021, each employee who on that date has one year of seniority shall receive an allowance of $75.00 to purchase safety shoes for his wear at the plant. This allowance will not be subject to tax as long as permitted by Internal Revenue Service. This benefit is in lieu of and supersedes any local practice or agreement to pay for shoes or metatarsals except where the employees have any superior conditions they may elect to retain the existing practice or agreement, and except where the Company is required by law to pay for such shoes and metatarsals.
Health and Safety Committee may contact and use available internal Management Industrial resources in the area of ventilation, temperature control, fumes, smoke, toxic substances, flammable materials, chemicals, solvents, and compounds.
Specifically, the Management Environmental Steering Committee is available to the Safety and Health Committee in matters pertaining to acceptable health levels and techniques of monitoring environmental control. It is also expected that the Steering Committee will have occasion to communicate with individual employees and groups of employees concerning implementation of applicable Safety and Health laws and standards. Any unresolved issues may be entered at the third step of the grievance procedure.
A.	An employee who believes that there exists an unsafe condition, beyond the normal hazards inherent in the operation, which involves an immediate danger of injury to his person may request an immediate meeting with the foreman. The foreman shall investigate to determine whether or not such conditions do exist.
1.	If the foreman determines that such imminently hazardous conditions do not exist and the employee still believes that such conditions do exist, the matter shall be reduced to writing by the employee on forms provided by the Company and the employee may then request that the Company Safety Supervisor and the Chairman of the Union Safety Committee, or their designated representatives confer immediately on the subject. The employee will then be assigned other work in his classification or another classification as appropriate or substitute work if available. Upon conferring, the parties must first decide if an immediate danger of physical injury exists. If the parties agree that no such danger of immediate physical injury exists, the employee shall perform the work.

2.	If upon conferring, the Safety Supervisor and the Chairman of the Union Safety Committee cannot agree if an immediate danger of physical injury exists, the work shall be performed by the employee. If the employee believes that there still exists an immediate danger of physical injury to his person he will be assigned other work in his classification or offered work in another classification as appropriate, substitute work, if available, or he will be sent home. Nothing contained in this Article shall preclude the Company from assigning another employee to the job in question after he is advised by supervision that an unsafe condition has been alleged. No employee, other than communicating the facts relating to the safety of the job, shall take any steps to prevent the assigned employee from working on the job. The Company Human Resources Manager and a Representative of the International Union shall confer immediately to decide if an immediate danger of physical injury exists.
3.	If the Company Human Resources Manager and the Representative of the International Union are in dispute, the matter shall be submitted immediately to the State Safety Representative, or such other person as may have been agreed upon in advance, whose decision shall be final and binding, and whose expenses, if any, shall be shared equally by the Company and the Union.
In all cases under the above procedure the disposition of the complaint shall be reduced to writing on the forms provided for that purpose.
If the employee is sent home and it is later decided in accordance with the above procedure that such conditions did not exist, the Company may exercise its right under Articles 10 and 11 of the Agreement. If, on the other hand, the employee is sent home and it is later decided in accordance with the above procedure that such conditions did exist, the employee shall be entitled to recover the pay for the time lost.
In providing the procedures outlined above, the parties agree to guard against the misapplication of this procedure by those seeking to use it for purposes not related to safety or health and/or by the misapplication of the immediate danger provisions described above, it is therefore the continuing responsibility of all employees, as well as all Company and Union representatives to make certain that the provisions of this Article 14 are applied solely for, and in the manner intended herein. If the Company believes that this Article 14A procedure is being abused at any of the plants under this Agreement, use of this Section may be suspended until the Union and Company Negotiating Chairmen have an opportunity to review such abuse and take necessary corrective action.
B.	An employee alleging an unsafe working condition beyond the hazards inherent in this particular operation, which does not pose an immediate danger of injury to his person, should file a grievance in Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure rather than use the l4A procedure above. It is understood and agreed that if the grievance is filed on an unsafe working condition; such grievance shall receive preferred handling and shall be expedited through the Grievance Procedure. The Chairman of the Union Safety Committee shall handle such grievance for the Union in Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure.

1	C. The Union members of the Safety Committee shall have access to all places in or about 2 the plant or property of the Company at reasonable times to investigate safety and health 3	conditions, provided reasonable notice has been given to the Department Head to be
4	visited or his designated representative. Each Union member of the Safety Committee 5	shall, upon reasonable notice to his immediate supervisor, be afforded such time off
6	without pay as may be required for the purposes of making such inspections and
7	performing other duties provided for in this Article. The Director of the International
8	Union Safety and Health Department or his designee may arrange to make a plant
9	visitation by making arrangements with the Union Chairman of the Negotiating
10	Committee who may contact the Company Chairman of the Negotiating Committee.
11	D. When an employee is temporarily reassigned from his job because of a Company medical 12	determination establishing that exposure to a toxic substance involved in such job has
13	adversely and temporarily affected his health, he shall retain his regular rate of pay for a
14	period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days while working on any other Company
15	assigned job. The local parties may mutually agree to an extension of the rate retention
16	period.
17	E. Industrial Injury
18	1. When, because of a disability attributable in whole or in part to his employment
19	with the Company, it is medically indicated that an employee be removed from
20	his job, the following shall apply:
The removed employee shall be entitled to exercise all rights under the Agreement as though he had been affected by a reduction in forces. Such rights include, but are not limited to, the right to transfer to an available job in the plant.
For purposes of this Section “available job” means one to which the employee is entitled under the Agreement and which he can perform consistent with his physical ability and condition and health requirements.
In the event no available job exists in the plant, the Local Union President, or his designee, and the Plant Manager, or his designee, may agree upon an alternative suitable job in the plant for a removed employee. A job shall be deemed suitable if the removed employee can perform the essential functions of the job consistent with business necessity and with reasonable accommodation, if necessary. The employees’ physical ability, condition and health requirements will be part of this determination.
In the event that a suitable job is not available, the Union and the Company will work in good faith to determine if meaningful work tasks can be assigned the employee consistent with any restrictions of the employee and need of the Company.
The Company will proceed with the above analysis mindful of its obligations to accommodate workers injured in industrial accidents,

The fees incurred in connection with this determination shall be shared by the parties. Any lost wages or expense incurred by the employee in connection with this determination shall be borne by the Company.

employee representative. Whenever the Company physician detects a medical condition, which, in his judgment, requires further medical attention, the Company Physician shall advise the employee of such condition or to consult with his personal physician.
3.	Medical Clearance
a)	Return to Work
Normally, when a Company doctor is not available to examine an employee prior to his return to work, the employee will be provisionally permitted to return to work, pending subsequent clearance by the Company’s doctor, upon presentation of a statement from his personal doctor certifying his fitness to do so. However, in those cases where the nature of the illness or injury is such that the Company requires clearance by the Company doctor, such will be necessary prior to return to work.
b)	Third Doctor Arbitration
If any difference shall arise between the Company and the Union as to the employee’s inability to return to work as a result of any injury or illness, such difference shall be resolved by filing a grievance, which shall be deemed waived by the parties to Step 4. Differences remaining thereafter shall be submitted to a special arbitrator whose decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator shall be a physician mutually agreed upon between the Company doctor and a doctor appointed by the Union. It is understood that it is the prerogative of the Company or the Union to have their respective physicians present to assist in the presentment of their opinions and the facts in resolving the dispute. The fees and expenses of the physicians selected by the Company and the Union shall be borne by the party appointing such physician, and the fees and expenses of the third physician, the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the Company and the Union.

2.	It is the responsibility of employees who have been off work by reason of personal illness for more than 14 work days to obtain medical clearance from the company prior to reporting for work.
In certain specific cases of chronic or habitual absences due to sickness of whatever duration, the Company may, with prior notice to the individual involved, require that medical clearance be obtained prior to reporting for work.
An employee out of work for six (6) consecutive months will require a physical exam of the same general scope as the preplacement examination.
The purpose of this exam is:
1)	To determine if there is a significant impairment of a body function essential to satisfactory work performance.
2)	To establish a new baseline record of physical condition.
This must be scheduled through the medical Department as soon as possible and the employee will not be provisionally allowed to return to the field until the exam is completed.
If proper notification is given and this exam results in lost earnings, the employee will be paid either A&S or lost time, as appropriate.
4.	Medical Surveillance
We have reviewed with you and your medical personnel the program we have instituted in order to insure proper and necessary medical surveillance of our employees. We intend to actively pursue the program on a continuing basis and we look forward to the cooperation of our employees and the Union in this important program.
5.	Sampling
The Company will continue its program of periodic in-plant air sampling and noise testing under the direction of qualified personnel. Where the Union Co-Chairman of the Safety and Health Committee reasonably believes there is a significant on-the-job health hazard due to in-plant air pollution, or noise, the Company will make appropriate tests and investigations that are reasonable and necessary, and will notify the Union Co-Chairman of the Safety and Health Committee when such a test is to take place. Upon request the Union Co-Chairman or designee may be present

For such surveys conducted at the request of the Union Co-Chairman, a written summary of the sampling and testing results and the conclusions of the investigation will be provided to the Union Co-Chairman.
6.	Toxic Materials
Where the Company uses materials at levels considered to be toxic under normal conditions of use, or where employees might be exposed to unusual concentrations of toxic materials through accident, it shall inform the affected employees what hazards, if any, are involved, and what precautions shall be taken to insure the safety and health of the employees. Upon the written request of the Union Co-Chairman of Safety and Health Committee, the Company shall provide in writing requested information from material safety data sheets, if they are available to the Company, or their equivalent on toxic substances to which employees are exposed in the work place; provided that when the information is considered proprietary, the Company shall so advise the Union CoChairman, and provide sufficient information for the Union to make further inquiry.
7.	Safety and Health Training
The Company recognizes the special need to provide appropriate safety and health training to all employees. The Company presently has safety and health training that provides either the training described below or the basis for such training as it relates to the needs of the Company and its various plants. Training programs shall recognize that there are different needs for safety and health training for newly hired employees, employees who are transferred or assigned to a new job and employees who require periodic retraining.
a)	Training of Newly Hired Employees
Newly hired employees shall receive training in the general recognition of safety and health hazards, the applicable labor agreement provisions, and the purpose and function of the Company’s Safety (Health) and Medical Departments, the local Safety Committee and the international Union Safety and Health department. In addition, upon initial assignment to their duties, they shall receive necessary training on the nature of the operation or process, the safety and health hazards of their duties, safe

working procedures, the purpose, use and limitations of personal protective equipment required, and other controls or precautions associated with their duties.
b)	Training Review
The necessary training of employees shall be directed to the hazards of the duties to which they are assigned. Such training shall include hazard recognition, safe working procedures, purpose, use and limitations of special personal protective equipment required and any other appropriate specialized instruction.
The Union Co-Chairman of the Safety (and Health) Committee and the International Union Safety and Health department or a designee shall, upon request, be afforded the opportunity to review the training program for all employees at the plant level.
c)	Retraining
As required by an employee’s duties and assignment area, periodic retraining as necessary shall be given on safe working procedures, (hazard recognition, and other necessary procedures) and precautions.
8.	PCB Control Program

H.	Heat Stress
The parties reviewed that area of our relationship which has been constructively developed over more than twenty years and which has addressed itself to potential safety and health hazards, particularly those in the area of heat stress. This is to reaffirm the Company’s intent to continue the advancement of that relationship under the auspices of the Executive Safety and Health Committee and the Human Resources Department and the International Union appropriate headquarters representatives.
Nothing herein modifies any existing obligations of the parties at the local level.
I.	Hurricane Defense Staffing
The Union is concerned over the protection of the plant property and equipment; however, our primary concern is the safety and welfare of our members, their families and property. Therefore, the Union will abide by the “Gramercy Alumina Hurricane Plan”. Further, the officers and committeemen will assist the local plant management to try to procure necessary staffing should the need arise. In the event the Hurricane Plan changes, the Company will discuss any changes with the Union.
J.	Drug and Alcohol Policy
The negative impact of substance abuse on productivity, employee safety and employee health is a well-documented problem. The philosophy of approach in dealing with such problems in Gramercy is corrective and rehabilitative, not punitive. This policy is to provide guidelines for all employees regarding alcohol and drug abuse.
The Company herewith adopts procedures that are designed to:
•	Establish and maintain a safe, healthy working environment for all employees;
•	Ensure the reputation of the Company and its employees as responsible citizens;
•	Reduce the incidence of accidental injury to employees or to property and take advantage of the current Worker's Compensation statute.
•	Reduce absenteeism, tardiness, indifferent job performance and other nonproduction actions; and
•	Provide assistance toward rehabilitation for affected employees.
1.	BASIC POLICY
The company expects employees to be physically and mentally able to perform. Their jobs and work free from alcohol and drugs (hereafter referred to as drugs). Failure to meet these basic expectations will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.

The Company will treat drug dependency as a health problem. Seeking assistance for such problems is encouraged and will not jeopardize an employee's job. However, seeking assistance will not be a defense to the imposition of disciplinary action or forestall termination where conduct is so flagrant as to be deemed intolerable nor will the presence of drug or alcohol serve to tolerate or excuse conduct which otherwise clearly warrants discharge.
2.	OBJECTIVES
•	Education: See that all employees and their families understand the health and safety risks caused by alcohol/drugs and the danger posed in the workplace by substance abuse.
•	Training: Managers and Supervisors and Local Union Top 5 Officers, Chief Steward and Assistant Chief Steward will be trained in alcohol and drug abuse. Supervisory personnel and Local Union Top 5 Officers, Chief Steward and Assistant Chief Steward will be trained in criteria that would indicate reasonable suspicion of drug/alcohol use which may affect job performance, safety of personnel and Company property.
•	Enforcement: The Company may search vehicles on Company property, desks, lockers in change room, break areas, restrooms, use dog sweeps and alcohol/drug testing.
•	Treatment: Counseling from qualified counselors will be provided through the Company's Employee Assistance Program to make a determination of the degree of treatment necessary.
•	Discipline: Up to and including termination if there is found to be just cause consistent with the provisions of this Drug & Alcohol policy.
•	Non-Users: The policy protects their freedom. We apologize for testing non-users, yet it is in order to protect their safety and health.
3.	POLICY
For years the Company has had a rule prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs in order to maintain a safe working environment. Consistent with the past rules, the Company has developed this policy statement regarding alcohol and drug abuse. Our goal is to establish and maintain a safe work environment that is free from use of drugs and alcohol. An employee must be in a fit condition to perform the work required of him. An employee under the influence of intoxicating beverages, narcotics, or drugs is not considered in fit condition to work. The Company expects employees to report for work in condition to perform their duties. The company recognizes that the employees' off-the-job and on-the-

Drug screening for reasonable suspicion will be initiated immediately. Screening an injured employee will be initiated after required medical treatment, but within twenty-four hours.
7.	Drug Screening - Random Testing
i.	The Company may periodically, but no greater than one per week, randomly select a number of Employees that will be no greater than a total of two and one-half percent (2.5%) in any one week and five percent (5%) in any one month, who shall submit to a random drug and alcohol screen. The parties shall meet on Monday to have a random generation computer program select which day of the week (Monday — Wednesday) and shift (starting time 7 am — 6:59 pm, or 7 pm — 6:59 am), the random selection of Employees shall occur. When Monday is a holiday, or the day selected is a holiday, random testing shall not occur that week.

The Company shall declare the percentage or number of Employees to be drawn, in advance of the selection. The designated Union representative shall be permitted to review the names of the Employees in the random pool in advance of the selection. The parties agree the names of the Employees selected shall remain confidential. If one or more Employees are not on the designated shift for the selected day, the random generation computer program shall select an equal number of replacements until the predetermined percentage or number has been reached.
iii.	Once selected in the presence of the designated Union official, the selected Employees working on the designated shift on the day of the selection shall be contacted by a Company representative. Such Employees shall report to the plant Health Services department before the end of his/her shift that day.

v.	A proper chain of custody will be maintained on all samples.
vi.	The employee will be provided with a copy of test results. The results of such tests will not be divulged by the Company to a third party other than the Medical Review Officer without the consent of the tested employee unless discipline is involved and a grievance is filed. Then, the Union will be furnished the results. However, the Company and the Union reserve the right to refer the said results to any disciplinary hearing, arbitration or unemployment hearing initiated by the employee or Union.
vii.	Semi-annually, the Company will provide the Staff Representative and the Local Union President the number of employees tested - no names.
vii	i. Employees who are requested to submit to a drug screening test will be asked to sign a consent release form authorizing the test to be performed and the test results to be released to the Company. Refusing to sign the form or to submit to the test will subject an employee to immediate discharge.

x.	Any altering or attempt to alter any specimen or screen will also result in immediate termination.
9.	Self-Reporting.

After completion of the treatment regimen, the Employee will be subject to "no notice" testing in the workplace for a period for two (2) years and will be required to complete an aftercare agreement established and maintained by the EAP provider. Any such self-report shall not be deemed a positive drug test in violation of the terms and conditions of this policy.

basis for the selection), will be offered the opportunity to submit to any evaluation by the EAP, if the positive test is not a second positive test within a 7-year period. Employees electing to decline this opportunity will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. If the Employee agrees to an EAP evaluation, that Employee must fully comply with the recommendation of the EAP, including a return to work recommendation and any other such treatment program as referred. Further, an Employee who tests positive will be on unpaid leave (however, it is understood that Employees who test positive will not be denied the Sickness and Accident benefit if otherwise qualified) until a negative test result has been provided to the Company. Such an unpaid leave period can be as short as possible, subject to the terms of the EAP treatment program, so long as the employee can test negative before returning to work, but cannot last more than 30 days (or 45 days in the case of an initial positive test for Cannabinoid). Employees cannot ask to be retested during the period that the Company is awaiting the results of a prior test. If the Employee cannot achieve a negative test result by the 30th day (or 45th day in the case of an initial positive test for Cannabinoid), the Employee will be considered as having his/her second positive test result and will be terminated.
ii.	An employee who tests positive in violation of this policy, who is returned to work by a treatment program shall commence no-notice random screening for two (2) years from the date of the original positive test result. Any employee who has a positive test while in EAP shall be terminated.
iii.	An employee may not request to enter the Employee Assistance program to avoid: a) any drug and alcohol tests set forth herein (e.g. random, reasonable suspicion, post-accident, return to work); b) the consequences of a test result; or c) the obligation to submit to a test under this Article.
11.	Screening levels
The Parties agree that the substance screening levels be set forth for the life of the Agreement as follows, and it shall not be deemed a violation of the policy unless an Employee’s substance screen results exceed the test results set forth herein:
Amphetamine - cut-off 1000 ng/ml
Barbiturates - cut-off 200 ng/ml
Benzodiazepines - cut-off 200 ng/ml

The employer agrees to hold the Union harmless and to bear any expenses incurred by the Union in defending litigation outside the Step #4 Grievance and Arbitration procedures alleging that the employer's drug testing procedure violates the U.S. Constitution or violates a Louisiana statute, where such litigation arises out of the employer's activities in carrying out the drug testing program.
Safety and health on the job is a firm management position; it is also the law. Your Union has negotiated with this endeavor and has reached an acceptable agreement. We intend to cooperate with the local law enforcement authorities. We also intend to increase security in the locker rooms, entrances and exits, parking lots, etc. Security is everyone's responsibility. If you see someone doing wrong and ignore it, that is the same as saying it is OK. We are asking for full employee support in maintaining a safe and healthful workplace.
K.	Replacement of Welding Gloves and Hand Tools
1.	The Company will replace welding gloves damaged or worn out in the course of employment for those Maintenance employees who are required to weld. The damaged or worn out gloves must be turned in to the Company for the employee to be eligible for a replacement.
2.	The Company will replace hand tools which are required on Maintenance classification tool lists that are damaged or worn out in the course of employment. The damaged or worn out hand tools must be turned in to the Company for the employee to be eligible for a replacement.
The Company will periodically inspect Maintenance men's tools to determine that the employee has the hand tools required for his classification and gives them proper care.
L.	Clothing Damage - Scalers

M.	Clothing Damage Compensation
A reasonable cash adjustment will be made to compensate an employee for work clothing that is damaged beyond use in an industrial accident. The damage to the clothing must be through no fault of the employee such as failure to wear designated protective-equipment. There must be a specific single accident that damages the clothing beyond future use. It is not the intent of this policy to compensate employees for an accumulation of minor damage such as acid spots, welding spark burns, tears, etc.
The cash adjustment will be based on the average cost of work clothing and takes into consideration the prior wear and tear of the article ruined. If an employee qualifies for a clothing adjustment, the Safety Supervisor will determine the amount of such adjustment under this policy.
Claims should be initiated by the employee on the "Claims for Clothing Damage" form available from his supervisor. Supervisors may get forms from the Safety Department.
The supervisor will investigate the accident, verify the claim, and sign the form. The damaged clothing and the form will be forwarded to the superintendent for approval. When approved, the clothing and the form will be forwarded to the Safety Department for determination of allowance amount and payment.
N.	Certified Welders Clothing Allowance
The Company will pay an annual clothing allowance to each currently qualified General Repairer who becomes qualified per Company guidelines as follows:
Qualified/Specialty Welder/MIG -- $750
Basic Welder -- $250
O.	Car Damage Claims
The Union complained about the procedure for claims handling, the amount of the settlements being made, and the time necessary to get claims handled. The Company will assign claim handling to one Company representative and will make a good faith effort to expedite claim handling. The Company will be consistent and fair in its settlements.
The Company policy in this regard will remain as it has in the past; i.e., there must be a specific emission incident in the plant, the incident must be a matter of record, wind direction must be supportive of the claims, and it must be verified that the employee's vehicle was in the appropriate parking lot during the emission and the license number recorded.

GROUP INSURANCE BENEFITS
A.	Group Insurance
1.	The Group Insurance Benefits for current employees and employees who retire during the term of this Agreement shall be set forth in booklets entitled Employees’ Group Insurance Program and such booklets are incorporated herein and made a part of this Labor Agreement by such reference.
2.	It is understood that this Agreement with respect to insurance benefits is an agreement on the basis of benefits and that the benefits shall become effective on January 1, 2017, except as otherwise provided in the applicable booklet, and further that such benefits shall remain in effect for the term of this Labor Agreement.
B.	Insurance Reports
The Company shall provide the appropriate Union Representative with an annual report concerning the premium and claims experience under the group insurance program.
C.	Health Care Cost Containment
The parties have discussed the problem of escalating health care costs and the serious impact which such inflation has had, both on the ability of the Company to maintain our negotiated group insurance plans, and on the capacity of active and retired employees to afford their own out-of-pocket expenditures for unreimbursed medical services.
We confirmed our commitment to develop and implement cooperative efforts, particularly within the local community, which will promote greater efficiency in the use of health care resources by Steelworkers and their families. Furthermore, the parties agree to join together to combat those instances where health care providers engage in wasteful practices or overcharge for their services.
In order to achieve our objectives in this area, the Company and the Union agree to encourage the establishment of plant-level committees on health care and cost containment.
These committees shall consist of two (2) representatives of the bargaining unit and two (2) representatives of management unless the parties mutually agree to enlarge the committee. The respective committee members shall be designated in writing by the Union to the Company and by the Company to the Union.
The local committee shall study the operation of the group insurance plan and particularly the influence which the plan has on the utilization and cost of area health care services.

As part of the study, the joint committee may recommend that the benefit provisions applicable to a given employment location be modified on an experimental or permanent basis to determine if a given modification will make more efficient utilization of health care resources or to take into account particular circumstances at a given employment location.

The employee will present proof of such service.

When death occurs in an employee’s immediate family (i.e., employee’s legal spouse, mother, stepmother, father, stepfather, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son, stepson, daughter, stepdaughter, brother, half-brother, stepbrother, sister, half-sister, stepsister, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparents, or grandchildren), an employee, upon request, will be excused for up to three (3) days (or for such fewer days as the employee may be absent) on which he otherwise could have worked and which occur within six (6) days of the death, funeral or service. The employee shall receive pay for any such excused scheduled shift provided he attends the funeral or service. Payment shall be eight (8) times his average straight time hourly earnings. An employee will not receive bereavement pay when it duplicates pay received for time not worked for any other reason. Time thus paid will be counted as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime or premium pay liability. Bereavement for 12-hour shift workers is covered in the 12 Hour Shift Agreement, Appendix D, Section VIII. D.

ARTICLE 23
CONTRACTING OUT
A.	It is the Company’s desire to use its own employees to perform bargaining unit work. Bargaining unit employees are expected to respond to Company requirements to perform and complete necessary work. The Company will not contract out work for the purposes of laying off bargaining unit employees. When proper business considerations deem it advisable, the Company will contract out work.
In the event the Company decides to contract out work that will not result in the layoff of bargaining unit employees, or if the Company decides to contact out work that the Company determines is construction, new construction, warranty work, major breakdown repair, emergency, work that requires certain expertise or equipment, work that cannot be completed timely because of working high volumes of overtime, work previously performed by contractors, work listed below in B “Continuous Notification,” non-core work or work that is not consistently and ordinarily bargaining unit work, the Company shall have no obligation to notify the Union in advance of the action.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to contract out work if there are insufficient volunteers or employees subject to forced overtime to perform the work to be contracted.
The parties have established a contracting out committee that will discuss issues related to contracting out. The Company will meet weekly with the Union’s subcontracting committee to review progress of current projects and discuss future projects. The Company agrees that prior to contracting out work that does not fall within the work set out in paragraph two of this Section, it will notify the local Union President or his designee of its intention to do so and will afford the Union an opportunity to discuss the matter prior to the final decision to contract out the work. The Company will consider suggestions from the Union to improve efficiencies, including suggestions on ways to perform work in a manner that is feasible, practical and cost effective and may reduce contracting out. The parties agree that a constructive dialogue will avoid surprises and misunderstandings with respect to contracting out. The Company will give full consideration to any comments or suggestions by the Union as to any alternative plans proposed by the Union concerning the work to be contracted out.
After the meeting with the Local Union President or his designee, any resolution by the parties shall be final and binding. If, however, the matter is not resolved or the Company has failed to notify the Union of its intention to sub-contract work not referenced above, a grievance may be entered at Step III of the Grievance Procedure.
In the event that notification is required, the “Notification of Contracting Out” form, reproduced below, shall be used.

B.	Utilization of Laid Off Maintenance Employees to Perform Project Work
The following will describe those conditions under which laid off maintenance employees may be eligible to work on major maintenance and construction projects during the period of up to one year from the date of their lay-off from the Company.
a)	Employees will be recalled on the basis of plant or departmental seniority as indicated by applicable plant seniority provisions, provided the employee has the skills necessary to perform the work called for on a specific project as well as the personal tool requirements required by the Company.
b)	Employees utilized under this provision will only be recalled to perform work on specific major maintenance and/or construction projects. This provision will not be used in the performance of day to day maintenance work.
c)	With respect to this provision, employees assigned to a covered major maintenance and construction project can perform any incidental work normally performed by any of the other trade or craft classifications.
d)	Employees must accept recall under this provision unless they can provide written documentation confirming that they have outside employment and a temporary recall under this provision would jeopardize such employment.
e)	Local union representatives will maintain contact with laid off eligible employees for the purpose of assessing interest in work under this provision and keeping the Company apprised of such interest.
f)	The recall of laid off maintenance employees on projects covered by this provision shall occur when doing so will result in the project being performed more economically, efficiently and timely than if performed by a contractor.
g)	Employees will only be recalled when the work for a particular covered project is expected to last no fewer than two weeks. Further, recalled employees shall be recalled only for the duration of the defined work and their compensation for such work will be limited for base wage and overtime rates and the employee shall not be eligible for reestablishment of medical, pension, 401(k) or other related benefits.
C.	Continuous Notification
It is agreed that certain Maintenance or Production jobs/tasks are outside the skills of the bargaining unit, or the Company does not possess the technology and/or equipment necessary to perform the work. Such work does not require notification of the Union. Should changes to the scope of the listed jobs/tasks become necessary either the Company will notify per the above procedure or both parties can mutually agree to a revision to the list below.

JOB BID, JOB TRANSFER, PROMOTION, DEMOTION
A.	Selection Procedures
The Company and the Union recognize the need to provide significant attention to this subject directed toward the goal of developing qualification and selection procedures that are job related in terms of job skill requirements, and at the same time provide competent employees.
We therefore agree with the Union to review the selection procedures for bargaining unit employees on a continuing basis with appropriate local and International Union officials. Because both parties recognize that the subject of selection is extremely technical, thus requiring adequate study by professional personnel, the successful accomplishment of our mutual objectives will require our best efforts and cooperation so that we may achieve both prompt and long range accomplishment.
B.	Permanent Promotion
1.	The Company determines whether any vacancies will be filled. Vacancies will be posted with as much notice as reasonably possible.
The following process will be followed in the event that the Company determines that a vacancy is to be filled: Vacancies will be filled first, by employee on the plant site with recall rights, or second, if there are no employees on the plant site with recall rights then the vacancy will be filled according to a job posting procedure. When a job vacancy is declared and the local Union is notified of such a vacancy, a job opening notice will be posted in the department affected and at the plant entrances. Such notices will remain posted for six (6) calendar days and during that time, any employee interested in being considered for that job must sign a job bid and deposit the bid in the bid box located outside of the Human Resource Department office. At the conclusion of the six-day posting period, the bid box will be opened in the presence of the Grievance Chairman or his designee. When an employee is offered the job, he/she may request up to 24 hours to consider accepting or rejecting the job offer. If they fail to notify the Company at the end of that period, they will be passed and the next qualified bidder considered.
Where the Union feels a vacant position to be filled should be filled on a more timely basis than the Company, the Company will in good faith consider the Union’s recommendations.

If an employee bids on a job, is the senior most qualified, accepts the job for which he has successfully bid, and subsequently is disqualified from the job, the employee will be returned to his former job, but may not bid on any job for a period of 6 months from the date of the disqualification.
c.	Once an employee accepts a job offer, the employee will not be eligible to bid into any vacancies for a period of 18 months from the date the employee accepts the new job, except for (1) promotions within the employee’s line of progression within his department at any time, (2) promotions in grade and/or base wage outside of his department at any time, or (3) lateral moves within his/her department after 6 months from acceptance of the new job.

If an employee bids on a job, is the senior most qualified, accepts the job for which he has successfully bid, and the company does not move him into the new job for a period of greater than or equal to 3 months from the acceptance of the new job, the employee may elect to decline the bid without any time-based implications and bid on other jobs immediately. It is understood that this provision applies only to Permanent Promotions.
3.	Consideration shall first be given to employees with the most department seniority in the next lower job as designated in the line of progression who have bid on the job.
4.	If a vacancy cannot be filled from the next lower classification, bidders from the succeeding lower classifications in that line of progression will be considered on the basis of their department seniority.
5.	A vacancy in the Plant Services Department will be filled by Spares. Spares will be considered within the department for bidding purposes.
6.	If an eligible bidder is not found as a result of the departmental bid, the job vacancy shall be filled by eligible employees who have requested transfer to that department in accordance with the Transfer section of this Supplemental

When an employee is demoted by the Company for cause, or if an employee requests voluntary demotion, his job will be declared vacant, and if the Company decides to fill the vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. Such voluntary demotion shall become effective seventy-two (72) hours after the employee's request. If there are no employees on the plant site with recall rights or bidders on the demoted employee's job, he must remain on that job until the Company is increasing the work force through recalls or new hires.

J.	Vacancies Resulting From Long Term Absences
The following agreement will be utilized when the Company determines that it will fill long term job vacancies that result from injury or illness and when it is uncertain whether the person involved will ever be able to return to work.
Such a vacancy and any resulting vacancies will be considered as temporary, but will be filled per the procedure as outlined in the Permanent Promotion or Transfer Sections of this agreement. Jobs filled under the Agreement will be so designated as resulting from a need to fill a long-term absence. The successful bidder will be referred to as a temporary bidder and shall be considered the junior employee in that classification regardless of his established seniority or the seniority of the absent employee for purposes of applying a reduction in force in such job classification and for the purpose of receiving temporary promotion. However, for permanent promotion purposes, such employee will not be considered in the classification until the position is considered as permanent. Such declaration of permanency will be made when the absent employee retires, dies, terminates, or returns to work in another classification, or when it is determined that the employee who is off will not return to work due to industrial or personal illness.
Subsequently, if the absent employee is able to return to work in his previous classification and an overstaffing problem results in a reduction of forces, the individual displaced will be the person who came to the classification as a result of being awarded the absent employee's position. Likewise, all resulting bidders will revert to their former jobs without modification of seniority. Such employees will retain recall rights to the job from which they were reduced.
After an employee has been awarded a job as a result of a long-term vacancy, such employee may bid on subsequent job vacancies within the same job classification in an attempt to gain an unconditional permanent award of that job classification. Such award shall be made to that employee if his/her seniority permits and the long-term vacancy shall then be considered as open and will again be filled per the aforementioned procedure.
The Company shall fill those permanent vacancies above the department line that result from the bidding of such long-term vacancies.
The application of this procedure will be determined in individual cases, based upon the merits of such a case. Such individual actions will not be precedent setting in like and/or future cases.

The Conveyor Operator will assume all MEO duties formally performed by that classification in the Section IV Department.

d.	The deployment of the RMC shall not be restricted by any provision of this Agreement, including but not limited to Art. 25, Sec. B that regulates the movement of General Repairers.
11.	General Repairers will select their preferences for area/shift bidding, using all the groups as follows: Section 1, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, Projects Crew, RMC, Mechanical Shop, Powerhouse, scheduled Shifts, as listed in Article 6, paragraph J. Failure to bid will result in the employee being assigned to any remaining opening.
C.	Shift Assignment
1.	When the Company desires to permanently assign employees within a given classification to or from any established shift, the senior qualified employees in the classification who express a desire for the assignment will be assigned. If no qualified employee in the classification expresses a desire for the assignment, the junior qualified employee in that classification will be assigned by the Company.
2.	If an employee who has been permanently assigned on 12-hour/21-turn shift desires permanent assignment to the established straight day shift (if such a regular permanent assignment is established in that classification), the senior qualified employee in that classification on day shift who expresses a desire for permanent 12-hour/21-turn shift assignment will be assigned. In the event that overtime will be required as a result of allowing employees to change shifts under this paragraph, the change will not be made unless mutually agreed between the Company and the Union.
3.	At the end of each calendar quarter, those qualified employees desiring to return to the Monday through Friday Day shift, or to be assigned to a shift other than the Monday through Friday Day shift, shall notify the Company prior to the last week of that quarter. Providing a more junior qualified employee in the classification is available to take his place, the employee shall be allowed to make the desired move in the next quarter. An employee forced on a shift other than Monday through Friday Day shift when other employees are recalled, bid into or are transferred into the department, or when a new hire is available after the ninety (90) working day probationary period is completed, may elect to return to Monday through Friday Day shift.
4.	When a vacancy occurs in a 12-hour/21-turn rotating shift job classification, an employee presently assigned in the job will have the opportunity to transfer to the open shift according to seniority; however, no reassignment shall occur which will create an adverse effect on the operating efficiency of the shift or shifts involved.
5.	When the Company desires to temporarily assign employees to a shift other than Monday through Friday Day shift, the employees on straight day shift shall be canvassed and the senior qualified employee who expresses desire for the shift

shall be assigned. If no employee expresses a desire for the shift, the junior qualified employee shall be assigned by the Company. This paragraph will only be used when there are no qualified spares available for the temporary assignment.
D.	General Repairer Turnaround Procedure
DEFINITION: A turnaround, when declared by the Company, will consist of a minimum of two (2) shifts per day.
1.	The Monday through Friday shift (except Projects Crew) will be canvassed by department seniority to determine what individuals will be assigned to the turnaround.
2.	If the Company does not get sufficient volunteers for the turnaround, the Company will assign the junior Monday-Friday day shift employees (except Projects Crew) by department seniority to the turnaround to complete the crew.
3.	When the staffing of the turnaround is completed, then those employees working the turnaround will be canvassed by department seniority for shift preference until the company's requirements for shift staffing are met.
4.	Employees assigned to the turnaround will work all overtime that occurs (if any) on the turnaround, regardless of the number of their overtime hours, and will not be considered for any other overtime while the turnaround is in progress. However, after exhausting the group overtime list, turnaround employees can be canvassed for other overtime according to the provision of the overtime agreement.
5.	Employees working on the turnaround will not be assigned to other jobs, except in cases of emergency to prevent loss of production or damage to equipment while other employees are called to get additional manpower to cover the emergency.
6.	Under no circumstances shall the Company be deprived of special skills needs to fulfill the staffing of turnarounds. Employees who have special skills that are required for the turnaround will be assigned to the turnaround by the Company.
7.	If assignments cannot be made on the basis of seniority, then the Company will meet with the Union to explain the circumstances. In the event mutual understanding is not reached, the final decision shall rest with the Company.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the only intents and purposes of this agreement are those set forth above and no other intent or purpose should be read into it.

E.	P&S Clerk Duties
This position will assume the responsibilities of scheduling and soliciting overtime for General Repairers on weekdays from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm. After 3:00 pm, a salaried employee will schedule and solicit overtime, unless the Company and the Union agree that the P&S Clerk will complete the canvassing for General Repairers and other overtime required.
F.	In-Plant Transportation
The Gramercy plant has developed a practice of transporting some employees to and from plant gates at the beginning and end of work shifts. Although there is no set pattern as to who is transported and how the respective department employees secure rides, it is understood that some employees do have transportation to some degree.
The union has expressed concern over the possibility that the Company might discontinue the practice of allowing this transportation to continue. In fact, the Company has expressed concern over the transportation method and the growing concern over energy conservation. As a result of the parties separate concerns, the Company agrees that no indiscriminate or arbitrary changes will be made to alter the current transportation method, but at the same time, the Union acknowledges that is may be necessary for Management to alter, or modify, the plant transportation in the future for the reasons stated above.
G.	Insulation - Work Assignment
Application and removal of insulation shall be done by C/P/I's, except other crafts may remove minor amounts of insulation incidental to performing their specific job functions.
Should an emergency situation arise that requires deviation from this agreement, the parties will meet at the earliest practical time to discuss the situation.
H.	Bauxite Reject Handling
1.	During runs of wet or contaminated bauxite when the customer elects not to buy the limestone reject, the Company will, within an eight-hour period, secure a truck and place a bargaining unit conveyor operator on the job for the duration of the wet bauxite condition.
2.	In-plant handling of limestone reject by the customer will be confined to transporting between the Bradford Breaker building and a specific designated storage area on the plant site. This in-plant inventory of limestone reject will be the source of supply for the Company's needs in other areas of the plant. The inplant trucking from the inventory pile to other areas such as fluoride, the chlorine ditch, the levee or road building sites, etc. will be performed by bargaining unit employees.

3.	MEO's can be canvassed for Dock work if all qualified department employees are utilized and additional support is required.
I.	Use of JLG Lift
When it is necessary to use the lift to perform non-destructive testing duties, a trained Hourly employee will drive the lift to the department where testing work is to be performed. Salaried employees will operate the lift within the department and do lift movement from one spot to another within the department. Hourly employees will move the lift between the various departments.
J.	Company Vehicles Washed and Serviced
The following is a list of vehicles serviced and washed outside the plant:
1.	Manager's vehicle
2.	Engineering vehicle
Listed below are vehicles washed outside the plant:
1.	Vehicles used to transport	salaried	employees home.
2.	Vehicles driven outside	that plant	that can	be washed while in town; i.e., trips to
Lutcher, Gramercy, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, etc.
K.	Electrical, Instrument, Temporary Assignment
Electrical and Instrument Specialist classifications are excluded from the Temporary Assignment other than Monday through Friday day shift.
The Company will, therefore canvass by seniority whenever temporary vacancies occur in the Electrical and Instrument Specialist classifications.
This does not apply to any other Trade and Craft or assigned maintenance classification.
L.	Lubrication Specialist Work
The Union expressed concern over the issue of replacing a Lubrication Specialist on off shifts with other classifications. Therefore, a Lubrication Specialist will be assigned in all instances where the lubrication duties are not considered a part of the lubrication duties of the other classifications. Lubrication Specialists will be required to use tools so that they may perform their lubrication responsibilities without the need to call for maintenance assistance.
Both parties acknowledge that lubrication will continue to be done by these other jobs as is currently practiced, and by the Lubrication Specialist classification in unusual major replacement or when adding a large quantity of oil.

However, resulting from the Productivity Improvement Agreement discussions, Operations personnel may perform any lubrication (oil and grease) on a non-routine basis required to protect equipment. Again, it is not the intent of this agreement to involve operators in lubrication procedures currently by the Lubrication Specialist Classification on their established routes.
There may arise emergency situations which require deviation from this agreement, and proper communications will take place.
M.	Control Valves
The General Repairers, Electrical or Instrument Technicians will remove control valves and/or valve operators. Electrical or Instrument Technicians will disconnect/connect signal wires and/or instrument air tubing.
N.	MAINTENANCE ASSIST AND OVERLAP
1.	MAINTENANCE ASSIST
On any particular assignment, a maintenance employee may be assisted (“as an extra pair of hands”) by other maintenance employees or may be required to assist production worker on operational requirements as outlined in T below.
In all cases, provided the employee performing the work has or receives the appropriate level of training for the work being performed. This provision does not mean that an employee cannot work alone. This provision does not constrain the maintenance overlap provisions below.
2.	MAINTENANCE OVERLAP
On a particular work assignment, a maintenance employee may be required, providing the employee has or receives the appropriate level of training for the work, to perform “Maintenance Overlap Work.” “Maintenance Overlap Work” is work that is related and incidental to the employee's particular work assignment, even though the work is normally performed by other classifications. It is understood that minor maintenance or adjustments not requiring specialized skills may be performed by any trained employee able to perform the work.
The following list is an illustrative, but not exhaustive, application of Maintenance Overlap Work as it may be applied:
•	Electricians may perform cutting, burning and welding that is related and incidental to their job assignment.
•	All qualified employees can operate lifting equipment such as forklifts and small cranes.
•	Vessel entry to be performed by any qualified craftsman.
•	Small scaffold erection.

O.	PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES ASSISTING MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES AND PERFORMING MAINTENANCE WORK AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES PERFORMING PRODUCTION WORK
1.	Production Assist
Production employees may be assigned to assist maintenance personnel “as an extra set of hands” as required in the maintenance or repair of production equipment or infrastructure, provided that the employee has or receives the appropriate level of training required for the work. This assignment could be for the duration of a project (such as breakdowns, surge, turnaround or overhau1/outage work) or as a minor part of an employee’s regular work.
In no event shall such work become, in the aggregate over time, a substantial part of an employee's job.
The following list is an illustrative, but not exhaustive, application of production employees assisting maintenance employees as it may be applied:
•	Operators to replace small light bulbs
•	Operators perform minor maintenance on all safety Showers
•	Operators replace all small filters for water requiring simple tools
•	Operators replace splash guards on small pumps not requiring rigging,
welding or burning
•	Operators perform routine lubrication duties on equipment in their area
•	Operators adjust conveyor skirts
•	Operators replace elastomer type pump couplings
•	Operators assist maintenance with troubleshooting
•	Operators assist in changing bags on dust collector

3.	Maintenance Employees Performing Work Traditionally Performed by Operational Employees
Maintenance employees may also perform production work for the purposes of troubleshooting equipment and providing “extra hands” type assistance. This includes the activities associated with preparing equipment and area for the commencement of maintenance work and with the running of the equipment and product to verify the repair under actual production parameters.
The parties further agree that instances of maintenance employees performing production work for the purpose of verifying equipment readiness should not extend beyond the timeframe required to complete the equipment readiness work.
In situations where the company has exhausted contractual and overtime procedures to timely secure production employees to perform production work, the company may assign maintenance employees to perform such work for 1) the balance of the shift or 2) until production employees can be secured through contractual or overtime procedures, whichever is sooner.

APPENDIX B-1 & B-2 Overview
Alumina Production Red Side & White Side
As the industry continues to compress in the United States as well as globally, it is imperative for refineries such as Gramercy to constantly evolve to become as operationally efficient as possible in order to compete and survive. Consistent with industry best practices for alumina refineries similar to Gramercy, site operations will largely be concentrated, segmented and staffed from a Red Side and White Side perspective. The Red Side will largely represent what has historically been referred to as Sections I & II, while the White Side will largely represent what has historically been referred to as Section III.
While Sections I, II & III will represent the core of the Red and White Side approach, certain equipment and/or functions, as well as certain other areas, may be moved from time to time relative to physical proximity and/or other operational/business synergies (e.g. the potential of the Press Floor currently in the Red Side moving to the White Side).
Where practical, control rooms, work areas, locker/break areas will be centralized to Red Side and White Side focus. The areas will evolve to meet, train and operate as unified areas.
All employees in the Red Side and White Side are subject to assignment at Company discretion to any of the jobs and/or specific tasks within the areas, providing the employee has the required skills and/or training to perform the job or job task safely. If a Red Side or White Side employee is assigned to job in a grade class above their then current grade class, they will be eligible for the pay of the higher job class, with the exception of training and cross-training time.

APPENDIX B-1
Alumina Production Red Side
The transition to a Red Side approach will include the consolidation to the extent practicable of Red Side control rooms into what is currently the Digestion Control Room, and the consolidation of locker, break, lunch and meeting/training areas for at least what has historically been referred to as Digestion and Clarification into the Digestion Building. These consolidations of work related areas will take place as soon as practicable. It is recognized that the consolidation of the Evaporation control room and the movement of the Evaporation Operator may require more time due to technology and logistics related challenges.
In addition to the physical movements of control rooms and work related areas, the initial focus will be on the consolidation of the Digestion Operator and Clarification Operator into a Red Side Operator, trained and qualified on all operator responsibilities of Digestion and Clarification. While the full training and qualification process will take place over time, Digestion and Clarification operators are immediately subject to assignment at Company discretion to any of the jobs and/or specific tasks within the Digestion and Clarification area, providing the employee has the required skills and/or training as appropriate to perform the job or job task safely. To the extent practicable, job assignments will take into account employee seniority.
To the extent that there are conflicts between this Appendix B and Appendix E, the provisions of Article B will prevail.

Alumina Production White Side
Precipitation and other Section III areas will continue to transition to a White Side approach, which will include to the extent practical the further consolidation of control rooms, locker, break, lunch and meeting/training areas. These consolidations of work related areas will take place as soon as practicable. It is recognized that the consolidation of the certain control functions may require more time due to technology and logistics related challenges, and some may not be practicable. To the extent practicable, job assignments will take into account employee seniority.

Applicants for training programs will be selected in accordance with the applicable seniority provisions of the Basic Labor Agreement and Local Supplements without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, or handicap. Employees currently working in a Trade or Craft or Assigned Maintenance Job with a standard rate in excess of Job Class 19 shall not be eligible for entrance into the training program without prior approval of the Committee.
Applicants shall be furnished a form which contains space for the employee's name, seniority, schooling, and the details of any special training and/or related experience which may tend to qualify him for advance credit in the training program. The form shall be signed by the employee and returned to the Committee. Applicants who meet minimum qualifications will be referred to the Committee for final interview and credit approval. Applicants accepted by the Committee will be notified in writing of their selection and advanced standing, if any, and a copy of the notification shall be sent to the Company, the Union, and a copy shall be kept by the Committee.
Trainees selected in accordance with the above shall be subject to a probationary period for the first 1,040 hours of the program. Credited hours for advanced standing will not be used to reduce the 1,040 hour probationary period.
VI.	Credit for Related Experience
Applicants for a training program shall be verbally examined with respect to previous training and/or experience and, when the Committee deems necessary, by performance demonstration tests to determine the amount of advanced standing to be credited, if any. In such cases, the total time required in the program may be shortened by the Committee, and the trainee will be assigned to the wage rate applicable to the period to which he has been advanced, but such advanced standing will only be granted to trainees who demonstrate their entitlement to the satisfaction of the Committee.
Advance standing credit shall not exceed the total of time devoted to either the particular work processes or classroom training course of instruction involved in the training program, but in no event shall a trainee be granted more than the total time involved in the particular training program, less the 1,040 hours probationary period.
VII.	Probationary Period
The first 1,040 hours of the training program shall be considered a probationary period during which either the Company or the trainee may terminate the trainee’s participation in the program. The seniority rights and status of any trainee whose training program has been terminated will be subject to the applicable seniority provisions of the Basic Labor Agreement and Local Supplements.

The trainee shall sign a training agreement which outlines the conditions of training and meets applicable requirements of Federal and/or State Apprenticeship and training agencies, if any.
The training agreement shall be signed by both the authorized representatives of the Company and the Union or authorized members of the Committee acting as their agents. A copy of the executed training agreement will be furnished to the trainee and the designated Company and Union members of the Committee.
IX.	Term of Training
The total duration of any training program shall be the sum of the required number of 1,040 hour training periods specified in the Schedule of Work Processes, less the number of hours credited by the Committee for advanced standing upon entrance, if any, and the number of credit hours thereafter given for exceptional training progress.
All hours worked and regular vacation hours and paid holidays not worked, shall be credited toward completion of the total training program hours required. Except as provided for above, the total duration of the training program may not be shortened.
X.	Related Instruction
Trainees will be required to attend and satisfactorily complete a minimum of 72 hours of related classroom instruction contained in the applicable supplement for training jobs for each 1,040 hour period of required training.
The Company shall arrange for and outline all courses of related instruction which may be given in plant classrooms, local vocational facilities, as practical instruction, or approved home study courses, subject to review by the Committee.
The Company shall obtain instructors for such related instruction courses based on their ability to instruct and their knowledge of the machinery and work function involved.
Time spent by the trainee on supervised related training courses during working hours shall be paid for at the trainee’s applicable training rate.
The cost of any outside related instruction, including necessary books, will be paid for by the trainee; provided, however, that upon satisfactory completion of each period of training, the Company will refund the cost of such instruction and books to the trainee if such costs are neither covered or reimbursable to the employee by some other agency.
It is intended that related instruction, as far as practical, shall pertain to the requirements of a specific job, and to the extent possible, such related instruction will parallel and supplement the on-the-job experience.

XI.	On-The-Job Training
Training in the shop or on-the-job shall be the responsibility of the foreman or other supervisors, as assigned by department heads. It shall be the responsibility of the foreman or supervisor to assign, as soon as practical, productive on-the-job work which the trainee can perform individually on his own and/or provide the trainee, working with qualified skilled employees, work experience on the major divisions of the job to be learned as covered by these Guidelines.
Since the employee will be in a trainee status, it is important that his working role is clearly understood. The trainee is a student. The department is his school. The primary reason for him being there is to learn the job. As teachers, he has the foreman and supervisor and various standard rate craftsmen whom the foreman may assign to instruct and direct him. He has not been brought in as a marginal laborer or to replace a craftsman. The fact that he does perform productive work is a by-product of his effort to learn the job. The trainee has been added to the payroll because it has been determined that, by the time he has completed his training, the Company will need an additional man in that job.
A Schedule of Work Processes, in major divisions of the job titles to be learned on the job, for each of the jobs covered by these Guidelines, is prepared for guidance of on-the-job assignments or work experience and contained in the supplement to these Guidelines. Instruction of the trainee need not follow that chronological order of divisions as they appear in the Schedule of Work Processes, but may be taught in the sequence deemed best suited to the volume and type of work common to the job, provided that all trainees shall receive instruction on all major divisions of the job as listed in the Schedule of Work Processes, except for those divisions for which credit allowance has been made.
A trainee who fails to achieve a satisfactory supervisory performance rating on all of the major divisions of the job assigned during a particular training period (except the probationary period) shall be held in that phase without change of rate of pay for an additional qualifying period. During this period, he shall receive special training in the types of work covered by the assignments in which he failed. At the completion of this period, the trainee must achieve a satisfactory supervisory performance rating in all representative work assignments to receive the advancement in pay rate.
XII.	Periodic Review of Progress
The Company shall arrange such job-related tests as are necessary to determine the trainee's progress in required work skills and related technical knowledge, subject to review by the Committee.
Records shall be maintained of the trainee's performance in each phase of training and each trainee will be evaluated as a trainee (not a craftsman) on both work experience and classroom instruction.

If an unsatisfactory progress rating is given in some specific phase of work experience or classroom instruction, or both, the trainee must satisfactorily repeat that phase of the program before advancing to the next period of training. Receipt of a second unsatisfactory rating for same period shall be considered cause for terminating the trainee from the program.
Trainees who demonstrate unusual ability and progress in mastering related instruction and on-the-job training portions of their standards may upon application, have their training periods reduced by the Committee, it being understood that a training period will be reduced only to the extent that it can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the Committee that the trainee has mastered a particular phase of the training, but under no circumstances shall a trainee be graduated from a program without having satisfactorily served the 1,040 hour probationary period.
XIII.	Request for New Program Review
Upon the request of the Director of the Wage Department of the International Union, and upon the approval of the Chairmen of the Negotiating Committees, the Company will discuss and review with the Director or his representative the implementation of any Apprenticeship program installed at one of the Company's plants covered by this Agreement.
XIV.	Wage Progression
Trainees will receive the wage rate of the permanent job from which they bid or Job Class 6, whichever is higher, for the first 1,040 hour wage progression period. During the intervening 1,040 hour periods, the wage rate for a trainee paid at a wage rate higher than that for Job Class 6 will not be reduced and adjusted and will not be subject to the periodic progression adjustments until such time as the length of training would give the trainee a higher wage rate in accordance with the wage progression provision. However, in no instance will the wage rate exceed the standard hourly wage rate of the job for which the trainee is being trained. All trainees will be eligible for general wage rate increases, cost-of-living adjustments and will use their retained wage rate for benefit purposes.
Rate retention will cease once the trainee leaves the training program for any reasons; or when the rate as described in Appendix C, paragraph XIV of Labor Agreement exceeds the retained rate; or when the trainee completes the training program.
A schedule of training rates for each of the required 1,040 hour periods shall be established in accordance with the above and contained in the applicable supplement.

12 HOUR SHIFT AGREEMENT
I.	General terms
This Memorandum of Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated May 16, 2016, establishes the terms and conditions which are applicable when employees are scheduled on a 12-hour continuous shift operation at the Gramercy Plant. This Agreement is between New Day Aluminum LLC (the “Company”) and the United Steelworkers, AFL-CIO (the “Union”), for an in behalf of its Local Union 5702, Gramercy Plant. It describes the terms under which bargaining unit employees may work a “2-3-2” rotating shift schedule consisting of fourteen (14) twelve (12) hour shifts during a twenty-eight (28) day period.
Certain criteria had to be met in the preparation of the Agreement. It was desirable to conform as closely as possible to the contractual pay provisions under the Labor Agreement and it was essential that the Company’s costs and the employee’s wages be equitable for the same amount of time worked under both a 21-turn shift schedule and the 12-hours continuous shift operations schedule (hereinafter referred to as the “12-hours shift schedule”).
Federal Wage and Hour law required an employee be paid time and one-half for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a work week. Although it is questionable whether the Gramercy Plant is subject to the Walsh-Healy Act, it is agreed that employees will be paid time and one-half for hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in the workday. In addition, it is agreed that hours worked on Sunday will be paid at time and one-half. No other overtime/premium payments shall be applicable to the 12-hour shift schedule.
In order to satisfy legal and contractual requirements and to provide employees with equitable pay for the same amount of time worked under a 21-turn shift schedule and the 12-hour shift schedule, the standard hourly wage rates will be adjusted for the 12-hour shift schedule. These adjustments are based on the ratio of equivalent straighttime hours paid on the 21-turn shift schedule to those on the 12-hour shift schedule. The adjusted hourly rates, which are determined by multiplying the current standard hourly wage rates by the hours ratio, are applicable only for the proposed schedule. All hours worked or paid outside a 12-hour shift schedule such as holdover overtime or call-out will continue to be paid on the basis of the standard hourly wage rates.

III.	Condition for 12 Hour Shifts Period
The conditions under which the 12-hour shift schedule will be implemented as follows:
A.	Coverage of shift vacancies will be mandatory in accordance with the existing requirement that an employee may not leave his work area until properly relieved or the completion of sixteen (16) hours worked.
B.	Overtime coverage will be guaranteed in accordance with the standby schedule listed on the rotating 12-hour shift schedule. The standby period of two (2) hours will consist of the last (1) hour of the prior shift and the first (1) hour of the shift for which the employee is on standby.
C.	If the foregoing conditions are fulfilled and the trial period is begun, both the Company and the Union reserve the right to cancel the 12-hour shift schedule any time after six (6) months with at least thirty (30) days notice, if either party is dissatisfied with the results.
IV.	Pay Practices
A.	Regularly Scheduled Hours
1.	Base Pay
a.	On the 21-turn rotating shift schedule, employee works twenty-one (21) eight (8) hour shifts within a four (4) week period. This amounts to 168 hours worked for which the employee receives 180 hours pay.
b.	On the 12-hour rotating shift schedule, an employee works fourteen (14) twelve (12) hour shifts within a four (4) week period. This amounts to 168 hours worked for which the employee receives 204 hours pay.
c.	In order to equalize the cost to the Company and earnings of the employee, it is necessary to apply a ratio of 180/204 or .8824 to the standard hourly wage rate for each job class and develop an adjusted hourly rate for each Job Class.
d.	An illustration of the use of the adjusted hourly rate is shown below. In this example, it is assumed that the standard hourly wage rate is $10.00 an hour.
$10.00 x 180 paid hours = $1,800.00/Month
$10.00 x 204 paid hours = $2,040.00
$2,040 x .8824 = $1,800.00/Month

e.	Overtime worked as part of the regular 12-hour shift schedule will be paid at the adjusted hourly rate and referred to as regularly scheduled overtime (RSOT).
2.	Schedule Premium
a.	On the regular schedule of a 21-turn rotating shift schedule, an employee receives the thirty (30) cent schedule premium on 172 hours.
b.	On the regular schedule of a 12-hour rotating shift schedule, an employee shall by this Agreement receive the thirty (30) cent schedule premium on 196 hours.
c.	The employee on 21-turn rotating shift receives $51.60 (172 x .30) in schedule premium for each four (4) week period.
d.	Using a ratio of 172/196 (.8776), a schedule premium of $.2633 for all hours worked on the regular schedule was established.
$.30 x .8776 = $.2633 $.2633 x 196 = $51.60
e.	The schedule premium will be $.2633.
3.	Shift Differential
a.	On the 21-turn shift schedule during a four-week period, an employee is paid for sixty (60) hours at the afternoon differential premium of 3% an hour and sixty (60) hours at the night shift differential premium of 5% an hour, for a “total” of “480%”.
b.	On the 12-hour shift schedule during a four-week period, an employee on the 6AM-6PM (day shift) receives 56 hours at zero percent and 28 hours at 3% x 1-1/2 totaling “126%”; an employee on the 6PM-6AM (night shift) receives 28 hours at 3% plus 28 hours at 5% plus 28 hours at 5% x 1-1/2 totaling “434%”. The total for the full schedule would be “560%,” unless the premium amount was adjusted.
c.	Accordingly a ratio of 480/560 or .8571 will be applied as follows:
(1)	6AM-6PM (day shift) for each hour; “126%” x .8571 4 84 hours + (28 hours x .5) 4 .8824 x 100 = 1.249%.
(2)	6PM-6AM (night shift) for each hour; “434%” x .8571 4 84 hours + (28 hours x .5) 4 .8824 x 100 = 4.302%.

This results in the 6AM-6PM (day shift) receiving “108%” plus 6PM-6AM (night shift) receiving “372%” or a total of “480%.”
B.	Using the examples in Section IV, Pay Practices, an employee whose standard hourly rate is $10.00/hour would be paid as follows:
Adjusted hourly rate = $8.824 ($10.00 x .8824)
Schedule Premium = $.2633
Shift Differential = $.1102 (day shift) $8.824 x 1.2493
= $.3796 (night shift) $8.824 x 4.30

C.	Overtime
1.	Overtime worked outside the regular 12-hour shift schedule will be paid at the standard hourly wage rate under the terms of the Labor Agreement.
2.	The computation of hours or days worked for the appropriate overtime premium will be done under the terms of the Labor Agreement, except that the work week shall be from 6:00 a.m., Monday, until 6:00 a.m., the following Monday. The work day shall begin at 6:00 a.m. and end at 6:00 a.m. the following morning.
3.	If an employee works at least nine (9) hours on a 12-hour shift, the day on which the shift was worked shall be counted as a day worked for the sixth and seventh consecutive day overtime purposes.
4.	Employees assigned to 12-hour shifts will eat their lunches on Company time at such hours as their duties permit. No overtime lunches will be provided to employees while working scheduled 12-hour shifts.

D.	Holiday Pay
1.	On a 21-turn shift schedule, a holiday is paid as follows:
3 shifts x 8 hours x 2.5 times	=	60 hours paid
(Off shift) 8 hours x straight time =	8 hours paid
68 hours paid
Assuming a standard hourly wage rate of $10.00/hour, the holiday cost amounts to a total of $680.00.
2.	On a 12-hour shift schedule, a holiday would be paid as follows:
2 shifts x 12 hours x 2.5 times =	60 hours paid
(Off shift) 16 hours x straight time =	16 hours paid
76 hours paid
Assuming a $10.00 standard hourly wage rate, the holiday cost would amount to $760.00.
3.	In order to equalize the cost to the Company and the earnings of the employees, it is necessary to apply a ratio of 68/76 or .8947 to the standard hourly wage rate for each job class and develop an adjusted holiday rate for each job class.
4.	An illustration of the use of an adjusted holiday rate is shown below. In the example, the standard hourly wage rate is $10.00 an hour.
$10.00 x .8947	= $8.8947
$8.947 x 24 x 2.5	= $536.82
$8.947 x 16 x 1	= $143.15
Company Cost	$679.97
5.	An employee who works on a regularly scheduled holiday will be paid 2-1/2 times his adjusted holiday wage rate only for all hours worked on the holiday. The standard hourly wage rates shall continue to apply for any hours worked on a holiday outside the employee’s normal shift schedule.
6.	An employee scheduled off on a holiday will be paid eight (8) hours only at his adjusted holiday wage rate. Also, an employee who is scheduled to work on a holiday but is excused for personal sickness will be paid eight (8) hours at the adjusted holiday wage rate.
7.	For the purposes of this Agreement, holidays will be the same as those listed in the Labor Agreement.

In order to equalize the cost to the Company and the earnings of the employees under a 12-hour shift schedule as compared to a 21-turn shift schedule, the average hours worked per week as computed under Article 8, Section D. shall be reduced by two (2) hours, but shall be no less than forty (40) hours per week in any case.
D.	A week of vacation under the 12-hour shift schedule shall be a work week as defined under Section IV, paragraph C.3., hereof, i.e., 6:00 a.m., Monday until 6:00 a.m., the following Monday, provided suitable standby coverage is maintained.
VI.	Overtime Procedure
In addition to paragraphs A. and B. of Section III of this Agreement, the following shall apply:
A.	Twelve-hour Shift Overtime Coverage will be obtained from the replacement chart shown on the 12-hour shift schedule except as otherwise specified below.
1.	Employees designated as standby will be considered on standby for the entire period specified. Standby employees will be required to be available one (1) hour prior to and one (1) hour after the official shift-change times of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. but may be called at times other than these as established per area specific shift change practices.
2.	Employees on standby do not have the right to refuse 12-hour shift vacancy overtime once contacted. The area specific overtime agreements detail standby requirements. See Appendix E of the agreement.

Re: Workplace Restructuring and Productivity
Dear Mr. Delaneuville:
The parties recognize that employment security and productivity improvement must be inseparably linked if the Company is to attain sustained profitability. Accordingly, the parties recognize and agree that the workplace must undergo significant restructuring. The objective of this restructuring is to maximize efficiency by having employees perform a broader range of duties and by eliminating barriers that may interfere with flexibility and productivity. Among other things, this process requires the restructuring of existing job classifications and establishment of new lines of progression (“LOP”) and new job descriptions.
In order to achieve the workplace restructuring objective, the parties have agreed to the following to govern its implementation:
1.	A box in a LOP represents a position to which an Employee may hold incumbency. Former job titles listed inside a box in a LOP represent the duties of the position encompassed by that position box. Such a former job title is not a “job” as that term is used in the 2005 Labor Agreement. Employees may be assigned to perform any function within their new position descriptions that they are capable of safely performing, being mindful not to infringe upon the employee’s right to exercise his seniority based preference. Rotation through the various functions encompassed by the new positions will be necessary and required to provide and maintain job knowledge and skills. In periods of stable operations, where employees have been fully trained such that maximum workforce flexibility and productivity is achieved, Employees may select their preferences to repetitive routine assignments within a new position box and shift preferences on the basis of seniority. These preferences will be honored, provided that the exercise of such preferences does not interfere with achievement of the objectives of this Agreement. To this end, Employees may be temporarily reassigned to duties other than their preferred assignment as required by operations, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. A temporary assignment will be limited in duration as necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the temporary assignment was made (e.g., training, operational requirement, etc.).
2.	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Labor Agreement, all existing local seniority agreements, practices and local working conditions, whether by agreement or otherwise, will be modified or eliminated, as appropriate, to implement the new seniority structures and achieve the parties’ restructuring objectives.

3.	There shall be no layoff or reduction in force in any of the restructured lines of progression solely as a result of the implementation of this Workplace Restructuring and Productivity Agreement.
4.	Employees will receive any pay adjustments associated with their restructured job once they are qualified to perform all functions of such job. The Company will use its good faith best efforts to train employees to perform all functions of their job. To the extent possible, such training will take place on employees’ regularly scheduled work time. Employees who fail to qualify for their restructured job will be demoted to the next job in their LOP for which they are qualified.
5.	As a transitional matter, the incumbents of the Loader/Unloader position as of the Effective Date of this Agreement shall retain departmental seniority in the Plant Services Department as well as Alumina Production Section III until such incumbent successfully bids on another job.
6.	As a transitional matter, should Employees, who as of the Effective Date, occupy the source jobs that have been consolidated into the combined jobs of Classification Operator or Clarification Operator fail to complete satisfactorily the Company’s training program for their combined job and fail to qualify on all functions of the combined job despite exercising their best efforts to do so, they will continue to be employed under the following conditions:
Classification Operator
a.	They will be utilized to the fullest extent of their qualification on functions within the job;
b.	They will have the right to transfer to another vacancy, in accordance with Article 24; and
c.	If they remain in the Classification Operator position as a limited utility employee, their rate of pay will be reduced to the greater of (i) Labor Grade 4 or (ii) their rate of pay in 2010 prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement.
Clarification Operator
a.	They will be demoted to the position of Filter Operator, or they may transfer to another vacancy, in accordance with Article 24; and
b.	The senior incumbent Filter Operator interested in moving up will be afforded the opportunity to train and qualify on the Classification Operator job.
7.	Issues arising in connection with the implementation of this Workplace Restructuring and Productivity Agreement shall first be discussed by the Joint Workplace Restructuring Committee. Such Committee shall be comprised of three (3) Union representatives and three (3) representatives of management. The Joint Committee shall have authority to discuss and resolve issues attendant to implementation of the workplace restructuring

contemplated by this letter. It shall not have authority to make any substantive changes to the Departments, LOP’s or jobs resulting from the restructuring, nor shall it have any authority to discuss job classification or pay issues.
8.	If the Joint Committee is unsuccessful in resolving any issue(s), the matter will be referred to the Local Union President and Grievance Chair and the plant manager or his designated representative. Should agreement not be reached, the Local Union President may notify the Co-Chairs of the Negotiating Committee that a dispute exists. The CoChairs (or their designees) shall promptly meet and attempt to resolve the dispute. Should resolution not be achieved, the Union may appeal the dispute to Arbitration. The matter will promptly be heard, the Arbitrator’s consideration of the dispute shall be guided by the principles articulated in this letter, and the Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding only for the specific dispute presented.

Re: Impact of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Dear David Delaneuville:
The Parties recognize that certain modifications to the Employees’ Group Insurance Program (the “Program”) may be required to comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”). In making such changes as may be necessary to comply with federal law, the Company agrees as follows.
(1)	Prior to modifying the Program, the Company agrees to explain the required modifications to the Union and afford the Union the opportunity to meet and discuss potential plan design changes which may serve to offset increased costs to bargaining unit employees resulting from the required modifications.
(2)	Should the USW contend that the Company’s modifications exceed the requirements of the PPACA, the USW shall have the right to file a grievance in accordance with the terms of the Labor Agreement and submit the matter directly to arbitration. If the arbitrator determines that the Company’s changes to the Program exceed the requirements of the PPACA, the arbitrator shall have the authority to order the Company to rescind the modifications; provided that, the arbitrator shall have no authority to make any order that may jeopardize the Program’s qualified status.

APPENDIX G
Supplemental Workplace Restructuring Implementation Agreement
In accordance with Appendix E, para. 7 of the parties’ 2010 collective bargaining agreement (the “2010 Agreement”), the parties have agreed to clarify the impact of workplace restructuring on certain components of the 2010 Agreement and to resolve their dispute concerning the application of transitional pay rates reflected in Appendix A to the 2010 Agreement.
Specifically, in consideration of the mutual promises and commitments described below, the parties agree as follows.
A.	Transitional Pay Rates
The parties have agreed to resolve their dispute concerning the interpretation of the provisions concerning Upgrades in Art. 4, Sec. B. 4. of the 2010 Agreement and the application of the transitional pay rates reflected in Appendix A to situations in which employees perform different “functions” within their new combined job or “box” as follows.
1.	Until the final year of the 2010 Agreement, when all pay rates for each Labor Grade will be the same, employees working in jobs that have multiple pay rates within the job will be paid as follows:
a.	The “Regular Rate” for each employee shall be the pay rate that corresponds year by year to his or her initial rate of pay as of the Effective Date of the 2010 Agreement for so long as such employee remains in the new combined job he or she occupied on the Effective Date;
b.	The “Regular Rate” for employees hired after the Effective Date and for employees who bid into a new job after the Effective Date shall be the Standard Rate of such job, i.e., the lowest rate assigned to the job;
c.	Each “function” of a new combined job that was formerly a separate “source job” will be assigned a separate pay rate, as set forth in Exhibit A;
d.	If an employee works a full shift or an overtime shift in a function assigned a rate of pay higher than the employee’s Regular Rate, the employee will receive the higher rate of pay for that shift. Employees working in a higher paying function while training, including refresher training, will not receive the higher rate and will continue to receive their Regular Rate.
2.	Work in higher paying “functions,” as described in paragraph 1, will not be considered an “Upgrade” for purposes of Art. 4, Sec. B. 4. because such “functions” are not “jobs” within the meaning of Art. 4, Sec. B. 4.
3.	In all other respects, the “source jobs” will cease to exist as anything other than component “functions” of the new combined jobs.

B.	General Repairer Roving Maintenance Crew
The parties have agreed to establish a General Repairer (“GR”) Roving Maintenance Crew (“Crew”) to afford the Company greater flexibility with respect to the scheduling and assignment of maintenance while continuing to recognize the seniority rights of GR’s. The GR Roving Maintenance Crew will be implemented as follows.
1.	The Crew will be established as a new Group V. As such, it will be a separate “area” for purposes of applying the bidding procedures described in Art. 25, Sec. B relating to GR’s.
2.	The Company will determine the size of the Crew, and it will initially be scheduled on 8-hour weekday daylight shifts. Subsequent schedule changes will be governed by the 2010 Agreement.
3.	The Company will have the right to deploy the members of the Crew anywhere in the plant that the Company determines is necessary to meet its operational and maintenance needs, including but not limited to assigning some or all of them to fill a vacancy on any crew for which they are qualified, to supplement an existing crew, to support the Project Crew (including turnarounds) and to such other maintenance tasks as the Company may determine. The deployment of the Crew will not be restricted by any provision of the 2010 Agreement, including but not limited to Art. 25, Sec. B, that otherwise regulates the movement of GR’s.
C.	Transition Committee Guidance
The parties’ respective Co-Chairs of the Negotiating Committee recognize and appreciate the efforts of the Transition Committee to resolve issues concerning the implementation of the 2010 Agreement. In particular, the Co-Chairs want to recognize and support the work of the Transition Committee with respect to the application of the 2010 Agreement’s workplace restructuring principles and its new combined jobs to the Powerhouse Overtime Agreement. The result of their work in the Power Plant Department is a model for implementation of the 2010 Agreement in all departments.
The outcome of the Transition Committee’s work on the Power Plant can be summarized as follows:
1.	The Transition Committee appropriately recognized and understood that the new Powerhouse Operator position is comprised of the former Turbine Operator and Auxiliary Assistant Boiler Operator positions. As a consequence of the 2010 Agreement, those former positions ceased to exist as “jobs” or “classifications.” They now constitute the functions of the Powerhouse Operator position.
2.	Accordingly, all references to “classification” in the Powerhouse Overtime Agreement now refer only to the three positions in the Power Plant Department -Control Operator, Boiler Operator and Powerhouse Operator.

3.	Now that all Powerhouse Operators are trained and qualified to perform all of the functions in the new combined job, there are no separate overtime distribution designations, lists or procedures relating to the former positions of Turbine Operator and Auxiliary Assistant Boiler Operator. The overtime distribution rules apply to all incumbents of the Powerhouse Operator position without regard to their former source jobs.
The Co-Chairs commend the Transition Committee for its work and encourage the Committee to use outcomes like this one in the Power Plant as a model to guide their work going forward as they apply the 2010 Agreement to the particular needs of other departments in the plant.
Agreed, this _16th__ day of June, 2011.
