PREAMBLE
This AGREEMENT entered into by the COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, hereinafter referred to as the County, and UNITED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, hereinafter referred to as UPE, currently affiliated with Public Employees UPE, Local #1, has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the County and UPE; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences;
-vii-
and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment.
The term "Agreement" means the written agreement provided for under Section 3505.1 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE I RECOGNITION AND COVERAGE
1.1	RECOGNITION
a.	The County recognizes UPE as the exclusive negotiating agent for all employees in the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit.
b.	UPE recognizes the County Executive as the negotiating representative for the County and shall negotiate exclusively with his or her designee except as otherwise specifically spelled out in this Agreement.
1.2	COVERAGE
a.	The Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit consists of all employees in the classes as listed in Exhibit “A” of this Agreement.
b.	This Agreement applies only to employees in the above described representation unit.
ARTICLE II UPE RIGHTS
2.1	UPE SECURITY
a.	It is the intent of this article to provide for the regular dues of UPE members to be deducted from their paychecks insofar as permitted by law.
b.	The County agrees to deduct and transmit, to the treasurer of UPE, dues in uniform amounts from all UPE members within the unit who have signed an authorization card for such deduction in a form approved by the County. The written authorization for UPE dues deduction shall remain in full force and effect unless revoked, as provided in such authorization form. In the event the County misses one (1) or more dues deductions in a payroll period, due to no fault on the part of UPE, the County will correct the error in the next biweekly pay period if notified by UPE in writing.
2
c.	The County shall deduct and transmit to UPE payroll deductions authorized by employees to cover approved insurance and benefit programs sponsored by UPE.
d.	"Approved insurance and benefit programs" are those which the County Executive or his designated representative has approved from the standpoint of not being in competition with or not duplicating the health and medical, life, disability and dental insurance programs offered by the County. It is understood that life insurance, except for accidental death and dismemberment, is competitive and duplicative of County-offered programs. The County retains the right to disapprove any insurance or benefit program, which, in the judgment of the County, is in competition with or duplicates County-sponsored programs. UPE shall receive approval of the County before offering any insurance or benefit program which utilizes County payroll deductions. Approval by the County shall not be unreasonably delayed. The County shall have the right to cancel deductions for UPE's insurance and benefit programs in the event UPE offers programs which have not been approved by the County.
e.	Forms and procedures pertaining to deductions for insurance and benefit programs shall be subject to approval by the County. Deductions shall not exceed $99.99, including dues, each pay period.
f.	UPE agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the County harmless against any claims made of any nature whatsoever, and against any suit instituted against the County arising from its deductions for dues or insurance and benefit programs offered by UPE.
g.	Solicitation or servicing regarding UPE's insurance and benefit program shall not interrupt any employee who is on duty. Solicitation may be conducted in County facilities only with advance approval by the County and in locations, at times and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the County. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.
h.	The County shall distribute membership information packets, provided by UPE, to each newly hired employee at orientation meetings. UPE representatives may attend this orientation to make a brief presentation.
2.2	UPE NOTICES AND MEETINGS
a.	UPE may use County conference rooms and similar building facilities for meetings with employees in the unit it represents; may post material on bulletin boards located (as provided below) to serve employees in the unit it represents; and may visit work locations to confer with its members regarding grievances or other business within the scope of representation or otherwise provided for within this Agreement.
b.	Use of County meeting facilities requires reasonable advance notice to the appropriate County official and is subject to County use of such facilities; provided,
3
however, that once scheduled, such UPE meetings may not be cancelled by the County except under emergency situations. The County may establish reasonable regulations governing the use of County facilities as provided by this section.
c.	At each office location, a bulletin board shall be provided. No publication shall be posted by UPE which indicates County action or approval when none has been given.
d.	Duly authorized representatives of UPE shall be permitted, at all times, that employees in the unit it represents are working, to enter offices to transact business within the scope of representation and to observe conditions under which employees are employed and carry out their responsibilities; provided, however, that UPE representative shall, upon arrival at the facility, notify the person in charge of the areas he/she wishes to visit. Access shall not be unreasonably denied. If denied, the reason or reasons for denial must be stated.
e.	UPE may transmit reasonable amounts of written materials through the department's inter-office mail system, except as prohibited by law.
f.	The County Telephone Directory shall contain UPE, Local #1 name, location and telephone number of UPE office during the term of this Agreement, unless the County discontinues printing the directory.
2.3	UPE REPRESENTATION
a.	The County recognizes and agrees to deal with designated stewards and representatives of UPE in all matters relating to grievances, disputes and the interpretation of this Agreement.
b.	A written list of the officers of UPE and the stewards, with assigned areas of responsibility indicated, shall be furnished the County (County Executive or his designee and the Director) immediately after their designation and UPE shall notify the County promptly of any changes of such officers or stewards. Those officers or stewards shall not be recognized by the County until such lists or changes thereto are received and acknowledged by the Director.
c.	The stewards shall be as follows:
(1)	One (1) bureau steward in each bureau who shall be a member of the unit.
(2)	Four (4) chief stewards, each of whom shall be a member of the unit.
(3)	One (1) grievance chairperson, who shall be a member of the unit.
d.	The provisions of Subsection c. may be negotiated during the term of this
4
Agreement if significant changes are made in the geographic location of employees in the unit.
e.	A bureau steward may assist in the investigation or presentation of a grievance to management in a grievance meeting as set forth under Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of this Agreement. A chief steward may assist in the investigation or presentation of a grievance to management in a grievance meeting as set forth under Section 5.8 (where the bureau steward is absent) and Section 5.9. The grievance chairperson may assist in the investigation or presentation of a grievance to management in a grievance meeting as set forth under Section 5.9 (where the chief steward is absent) and Section 5.10. The applicable steward shall be allowed a reasonable time for the above purpose during working hours without loss of pay, subject to prior notification and approval by the steward's immediate supervisor. For investigation or grievance presentations which take a steward physically outside the bureau office space, such notification shall be on a form prescribed by the County which will state the amount of time spent for the purpose. When a steward is assisting in the investigation or presentation of a grievance within the bureau in which he/she works, the prior notification may be oral and the form need not be used; however, the steward shall accurately record on his/her timesheet all on-duty time spent investigating or presenting grievances to management. Bureau stewards who represent unit members outstationed in Elk Grove, Galt, and Rio Consumnes Correctional Center Offices will be allowed reasonable travel time when it is necessary to travel to these offices to assist in the investigation or presentation of a grievance to management.
f.	Up to fourteen (14) UPE members in the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit who are on the Board of Directors shall be entitled to four (4) hours authorized UPE time off without pay per calendar month.
2.4	FAIR AND EQUAL REPRESENTATION
It is recognized that UPE owes the same responsibilities to all employees in the representation unit and has a duty to provide fair and equal representation to all employees in all classes in the unit whether or not they are members of UPE.
5

c.	(1) Execute a written declaration that the employee is a member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which holds a conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting any public employee organization as a condition of employment; and
(2)	Pay a sum equal to the agency fee described in Section 2.5-b. to a nonreligious, non-labor charitable fund chosen by the employee from those chanties listed within United Way or CHAD. The employee shall furnish written proof to the County and UPE that this contribution has been made.

b.	The amount of the fair share service fee: Such fee shall not exceed the proportion of dues calculated in Section 2.5-b. above.

2.10	FAILURE TO POST FAIR SHARE FEE EXPLANATION AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CHALLENGE
Should UPE fail to post the required annual Fair Share Fee Explanation and Notice of Right to Challenge set forth above within the required sixty (60) days after the effective date of the agency shop or the end of its fiscal year, the County shall have the right to give UPE two (2) pay periods notice to provide the required notice. If UPE fails to provide the required notice by the expiration of the two (2) pay periods, then the County shall make no further payroll deductions of any kind on behalf of UPE (dues, fair share fees, insurance, et cetera) until such time as UPE provides the required notice.
2.11	LABOR ORGANIZATION ANNUAL REPORT
Annually, UPE shall file with the Director of Labor Relations a fully completed copy of the U.S. Department of Labor LM-2 (Labor Organization Annual Report) which shall serve as the required financial disclosure pursuant to Government Code Section 3502.5 (d). If UPE has paid or distributed all or a portion of the dues or fees collected to any other organization for the purpose of providing direct and ongoing representation to employees in the unit, UPE shall also be required to submit fully completed LM-2 forms from those organization(s) at the same time UPE submits its completed LM-2.

2('s), then the County shall have the right to give UPE two (2) pay periods notice to provide the required LM-2('s). If UPE fails to provide the required LM-2('s) at the expiration of the two (2) pay periods, then the County shall make no further payroll deductions of any kind on behalf of UPE (dues, fair share fees, insurance, et cetera) until such time as UPE provides the required LM-2('s).

a.	UPE shall notify the employee (a copy to the appointing authority) of noncompliance by certified mail, return receipt requested. Said notice shall detail the non-compliance by explaining that the employee is delinquent in not tendering a fair share service fee, specifying the amount of the delinquency, and warning the employee that unless such fees are tendered within thirty (30) calendar days, UPE will request that the employee be terminated as provided in this section.
b.	If the employee fails to comply, UPE shall file with the appointing authority, in writing, proof of compliance with Subsection a., the specific charges, and a demand that the employee be terminated. The charges shall include:

The employee may appeal the order of termination to the Civil Service Commission.
f.	UPE shall bear all costs of terminating the employee, including all costs of the County in defending any appeal of an employee from the County's termination of such employee for failure to pay a fair share service fee.

The notice requirement shall not apply to temporary or emergency assignments.

d.	All employees normally shall be allowed a lunch period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than one (1) hour, which shall be scheduled generally in the middle of the workshift. Whenever it is necessary for an employee to work overtime in excess of two (2) consecutive hours, he or she shall be granted an additional lunch period, the taking of which is optional with the employee. Lunch periods shall not be counted as part of total hours worked except for those employees for whom lunch periods include the actual performance of assigned duties such as employees assigned to work a straight eight-hour shift. An employee required to remain at the work station during the lunch period shall be considered to be performing assigned duties.
e.	When an employee is ordered by the County to attend training, the time spent in training shall be counted as hours worked. Training which takes place during off-duty hours with attendance voluntary is not hours worked.
f.	For Medical Assistance Bureau employees assigned to the Sacramento Medical Center, there shall be no permanent change in shift without giving five (5) working days advance notice, except for temporary or emergency assignments. An emergency is defined as a sudden, generally unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances, demanding immediate action.

19
6.2	9/80 WORK SCHEDULES
a.	An appointing authority, with the prior approval of the County Executive, may approve requests of employees covered by this Agreement in their department to work a 9/80 work schedule.
b.	For reference purposes only, this subsection discusses the application of the 9/80 schedule for employees who do not receive time and one-half overtime. This subsection does not in any way change or impact the time and one-half overtime employees receive under the Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3.
(1)	For employees who do not receive time and one-half overtime pay,
the workweek will remain from 12:00 a.m. on Sunday to 12:00 a.m. the following Sunday, a period of seven (7) consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods.
(2)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule which during one (1) week of the biweekly pay period the employee is scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts for a total of thirty-six (36) hours, and during the other week of the pay period, is scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) eighthour workshift.
(3)	For these employees working the 9/80 work schedule who are eligible to earn straight-time overtime, overtime shall be earned when the employee is required to work in excess of nine (9) hours when normally scheduled to work the nine-hour workshift, and in excess of eight (8) hours when normally scheduled to work the eight-hour workshift. Overtime shall also be earned when an employee eligible for overtime is required to work in excess of thirty-six (36) hours during the week the employee is scheduled to work thirty-six (36) hours, or in excess of forty-four (44) hours during the week the employee is scheduled to work forty-four (44) hours.
c.	For employees who do receive time and one-half overtime pay, the individual employee's workweek must be redesignated by the County so that it commences in the middle of the eight-hour workshift as described in Subsection b.(2) above. This redesignated workweek must be in writing and specifically state the day of the week and time of day that the workweek commences and the effective date of the redesignated workweek. This must be completed and approved prior to the employee working the 9/80 schedule, and be filed in the employee's personnel file. This redesignated workweek must be changed prior to the employee altering the day of the week or time of day that the eight-hour workshift occurs; the redesignated workweek must always commence during the middle of the eight-hour workshift. This redesignated workweek must also be changed back to the standard Sunday through
20
Saturday workweek upon the employee moving off of the 9/80 work schedule.
(1)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule in which during each redesignated workweek the employee works four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) four-hour workshift. The two (2) four-hour workshifts are worked consecutively in a manner to constitute one (1) eight-hour work period, similar to the eight-hour workshift provided in Subsection b.(2) above.
(2)	For these employees, overtime shall be earned when the employee is required to work in excess of nine (9) hours when normally scheduled to work the nine-hour workshift, and in excess of forty (40) hours during the redesignated workweek. Additionally, overtime will be earned when the employee is required to work more than four (4) hours when normally scheduled to work either of the four-hour workshifts.
(3)	When determining overtime eligibility, pursuant to Section 6.2-c.(2), all paid leave except sick leave shall be counted as time worked.
d.	Employees working a 9/80 schedule shall take an unpaid meal period in the middle of their nine-hour and eight-hour workshifts, or between the two (2) four-hour workshifts, consistent with Section 6.1. Employees may receive one (1) rest period during the first half of the employee's nine-hour or eight-hour workshift and one (1) rest period during the second half of the nine-hour or eight-hour workshift. Employees who work two (2) four-hour workshifts may receive one (1) rest period during each four-hour workshift.
e.	An employee shall be granted a holiday that falls on the employee's scheduled eight-hour workshift. If the holiday falls on the scheduled nine-hour workshift, the remaining hour must be taken off as leave first from accumulated compensating time off or holiday in lieu, and second from accumulated vacation time; and, if there are no leave balances, then leave without pay. If the holiday falls when the employee is scheduled to work the two (2) four-hour workshifts, then both four-hour workshifts shall be deemed to be the holiday. If a holiday falls on an employee's scheduled day off, the employee shall accrue eight (8) hours compensating time off.
f.	Full shift absences on vacation, sick leave, compensating time off, or holiday in lieu taken by employees on a scheduled nine-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of nine (9) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences on the eight-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of eight (8) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences from either four-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of four (4) hours from the employees accrued leave balances.
g.	Employees may return to the standard five-day, forty-hour workweek upon the approval of their appointing authority.
21
h.	The appointing authority shall have the right to return employee(s) to the standard five-day, forty-hour workweek schedule after providing advance written notice of two (2) full pay periods to the affected employee(s).
6.3	OVERTIME
a.	Employees will be compensated only for overtime ordered by designated supervisory personnel.
b.	All paid leave except sick leave shall be counted as time worked. Time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a day shall not be counted in determining whether an employee has worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.
c.	Part-time employees shall be compensated for overtime at their regular hourly rate for each hour worked in excess of their normal workday or week; provided, however, for work performed in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week, they shall be compensated in the same manner as full-time employees.
d.	Employees who work overtime shall promptly and accurately report such time in the manner prescribed by the County.
e.	Overtime shall be distributed fairly among employees insofar as circumstances permit.
f.	Employees covered by this Agreement, when required to work in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week, shall be compensated for such overtime with pay at one and one-half times the hourly rate or by compensating time off on the basis of one-and one-half hours off for each hour of overtime worked. Compensation may be paid in cash when overtime is required for the protection of persons or property, when the granting of time off would seriously disrupt the operations of the department, or in other cases of a unique nature warranting cash payment. Compensating time off shall be given in all other cases. Such compensating time off shall be used within one (1) year from the time the overtime was performed. If the department is unable to schedule and grant the time off within one (1) year, cash payment shall be made in lieu of compensating time.
6.4	STANDBY ASSIGNMENTS

d.	Return to Former Class: An employee who is returned to a former class following promotion, transfer, or demotion due to layoff, shall receive that step of the range which he or she would have received had he or she never left the former class.
26
e.	Promotion: Upon promotion an employee shall receive the lowest step in the new class which provides an increase of at least 5.0%. Extra-help employees shall be placed at the lowest step of the new class.
f.	Transfer: Upon transfer an employee shall receive the same step in the
new range as he or she received in the former range. For purposes of this provision, a transfer is a change between classes when the maximum salary range of the class to which the transfer is made is less than 5.0% higher or is less than 5.0% lower.
g.	Demotion: A demotion is a change to a class which has a maximum salary rate which is at least 5.0% lower than the maximum salary rate of the former class. Whenever an employee is demoted due to layoff, without cause or inability on his or her part, his or her salary shall be that step in the new range which provides an equal salary, or in the absence thereof, the nearest lower salary, to that received prior to the demotion. In all cases of demotion for cause, the employee shall receive the same step in the lower range as he or she received in the higher range. An employee with permanent status in a class who, with the approval of the appointing authority, voluntarily demotes to a lower class shall receive the step in the lower range which provides an equal salary or, in the absence thereof, the nearest lower salary to that which was received prior to demotion.
h.	Return from Leave Without Pay: Return following leave without pay is not an appointment, but is a continuation of service; however, salary and benefits, other than employment status, shall be based on actual service. This provision shall not apply to employees returning from military leave.
i.	Y-Rate: The Board of Supervisors may adopt a Y-rate to apply to: (1)an employee who would suffer an actual decrease in salary as a result of action taken by the County, without fault or inability on the part of the employee, or (2) an employee who is changing from one (1) class series to another, as a normal consequent of career development through the County's upward mobility program, and the salary of the class the employee enters in the new class series is less than the salary the employee was receiving in the former class. A Y-rate means a salary rate, for an individual employee, which is greater than the established range for the class.
j.	Y-Rate Salary Increase: An employee for whom a Y-rate is established shall not receive any increase in salary until such time as his or her rate of compensation is within the established range for his/her class, at which time the employee shall receive the highest step of the range. The employee shall receive a proportionate decrease in salary whenever a lower range is established for the class in the Agreement.
k.	Granting of Status: Whenever the Civil Service Commission or other appropriate authority grants an employee direct status in another class, the employee shall receive the step determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.
27
I.	Class Salary Range Changes: When the salary range for a class is changed in the Agreement, employees in the class shall change to the new range but shall remain at the same step. When changes in an employee's class or salary, or both, occur simultaneously with salary range adjustments in the Agreement, the employee changes shall precede the Agreement adjustments in application.
m.	Entry Step Adjustments: When the entry step for a class is adjusted to above Step "5" in the Agreement, the salary step for each employee in the class shall be increased in proportion to the change in entry step; provided, however, that no employee shall advance beyond Step "9".
n.	Biweekly Salaries: The pay period for all employees shall cover fourteen (14) calendar days, starting on a Sunday and ending with the second Saturday thereafter. Salaries shall be paid on the Friday following the end of the pay period; except that if Friday falls on a holiday, salaries shall be paid on Thursday. Salaries shall be computed as provided in this Agreement.
o.	Salary Computation: The regular salary for each employee shall be based on the actual number of days or hours worked in the pay period, including authorized absences with pay, multiplied by the employee's daily or hourly rate. Such payments shall not exceed the biweekly rate as determined by the employee's range and step.
p.	Special Pay: Special payment, including standby, overtime, premium, and other special payments, shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
g.	Payment in Full: Compensation paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be payment in full for services rendered in a County position. No employee shall accept any other compensation for services performed in such position.
r.	Exceptional Qualifications: At the reguest of the appointing authority and subseguent to a recommendation by the Personnel Director, the County Executive may approve a salary above the established entry step for the class in order to recruit an individual who has demonstrated superior knowledge and ability in the civil service examination process and whose combined education and experience represent substantially better preparation for the duties of the class than reguired by the minimum employment standards. In the application of this provision, consideration also shall be given to current employees in the same class who possess comparable gualifications and, if determined eguivalent, adjustments shall be made by the County Executive.
7.4	MERIT INCREASES
a.	Regular employees shall be eligible for merit salary step increases. Increases to steps above the entry step shall be based on performance and length of service. The employee must have earned the eguivalent of at least twenty-six (26) biweekly pay periods of full-time eligible service since his/her step increase date.
28
b.	Except as otherwise provided herein, an employee's step increase date shall be the first day of the first full biweekly pay period in any class or the date of his last step increase, whichever is most recent.
c.	An employee's merit increase may be deferred while he or she is in provisional or probationary status. Upon receipt of a deferred increase, the employee's merit increase date shall be the same as it would have been had the increase not been deferred, and retroactive payment will be made.
d.	Upon change in class which results in a salary decrease or in a salary increase of less than ten percent (10%) or the equivalent of two (2) steps, an employee shall retain the same merit increase date.
e.	An employee in Step "9" shall have no merit increase date, and service in Step "9" shall not be considered as eligible service for future merit increases.
f.	Extra-help employment shall not be considered eligible service for merit increases except that continuous extra-help employment may be considered as eligible service for employees who transfer to a regular position without a break in service.
g.	Overtime work shall not be considered as eligible service.
h.	A merit increase may be denied only for just cause. Denial of merit increase shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
7.5	PAYROLL ERRORS
a.	This provision applies when the Director of Personnel Services determines that an error has been made in relation to the base salary, overtime cash payment or paid leave accruals, balances, or usage, or for medical insurance premiums or life insurance premiums. In such cases the County shall, for purposes of future compensation, adjust such compensation to the correct amount. The Department of Personnel Services also shall give written notice to the employee.
b.	As used in this section:
(1)	"Base Salary" means the biweekly rate of pay including special pay allowances and differentials but excluding overtime cash payment.
(2)	"Overtime cash payment" means authorized pay for working in excess of a prescribed number of hours, usually eight hours (8) per day or forty (40) hours per week.
(3)	"Paid leave" means vacation, sick leave, compensating time off, and all other types of authorized leave with pay.
(4)	"Overpayment" means any cash or leave (balance, usage or accruals) that has been overpaid or overcredited to an employee
29
regardless of the reason, including but not limited to: administrative, clerical or system errors.
(5)	"Underpayment" means any cash or leave (balance, usage or accruals) that has been underpaid or undercredited to an employee regardless of the reason, including but not limited to: administrative, clerical or system errors.
c.	If the error has resulted in an overpayment or underpayment, reimbursement shall be made to the County if the error was an overpayment, or by the County if the error was an underpayment, in the amount which has occurred within one (1) year prior to the date of the Department of Personnel Services’ initial written notice to the employee.
(1)	In the case of overpayment, reimbursement of the overpayment
shall be made through one (1) or a combination of the following methods:
(a)	In cash payment(s) mutually agreed to by the employee and the Department of Personnel Services.
(b)	In the case of overcrediting of paid leave accruals, balances, or usage, a one-time only adjustment to CTO or vacation equivalent to the dollar amount of the overpayment (sick leave may not be used unless the overpayment involved the use of sick leave). If the balances are not sufficient to cover the overpayment, payroll deductions of the overpayment sufficient to cover the overpayment from the employee's future salary shall be made in installments until the overpayment is fully reimbursed; or the employee may make a single cash payment. A charge against future accruals shall not be permitted.
(c)	Installments through payroll deduction to cover the same number of pay periods over which the error occurred. If the installments exceed 10% of the employee's base salary (including incentives, et cetera), lower deductions may be made providing the lower deduction is at least 10% of the employee's base salary including incentives, et cetera.
(2)	In the case of an underpayment, the County will expedite reimbursement to the employee via an in lieu warrant, a gross pay adjustment or a leave balance adjustment, whichever applies and is most appropriate.
(3)	An employee whose employment terminated prior to full reimbursement of an overpayment shall have withheld from any salary owing the employee upon termination, an amount sufficient
30
to provide full reimbursement. If that amount is not sufficient to provide full reimbursement, the County shall have the right to exercise other legal means to recover the additional amount owed.
(4)	Any amount of overpayment or underpayment for any period earlier than one (1) year prior to the date of the Department of Personnel Services’ initial written notice to the employee, shall be deemed waived and not reimbursable.
d.	The provisions of this section do not apply to grievance disputes which contend that the County has underpaid by misapplying or incorrectly interpreting the terms of this or any previous Agreement. The time limits for the filing and processing of any grievance shall not be deemed to be excused, extended or otherwise modified by the provisions of this section. Nor shall the relief available through the grievance procedure be enlarged by or as a result of the provisions of this section.
e.	The provisions of this section apply only to errors involving base salary or overtime cash payment and paid leave accruals, balances, or usage.

An employee who while on vacation is incapacitated for one (1) or more days due to personal illness or injury may charge such days to accrued sick leave. In such event, the employee promptly shall notify his department, and upon return to duty shall substantiate the need for, and use of, sick leave.
9.4	WELLNESS/SICK LEAVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM
a.	Effective with Pay Period #14, beginning June 14, 1992, the County shall establish a sick leave incentive program. Eligible full-time regular employees who use twelve (12) hours or less of sick leave in Pay Periods #1 through #13 of any year shall receive a wellness certificate enabling them to take eight (8) hours off with pay during the following six-month period. Eligible full-time employees who use twelve (12) hours or less of sick leave in Pay Periods #14 through #26 of any year shall receive a certificate enabling them to take eight (8) hours off with pay during the following six-month period. The certificate shall have no monetary value.
b.	Regular employees must be continuously on the County payroll to be
38
eligible to earn and use the wellness certificate during the entire 26-week period from Pay Periods #1 through #13, and from Pay Periods #14 through #26. Any employee on an unpaid leave of absence during a portion of the designated 26-week period is excluded for that time period. An employee who is released without pay at the request of UPE and with the approval of their manager to attend to UPE business shall not be excluded from participation in the time period solely for that reason. Any employee during the 26-week period who receives pay pursuant to Labor Code Section 4850 or who receives SDI integration pursuant to Section 10.5, or who selects the disability leave option pursuant to Section 9.7-b.(2)(b), is excluded from participation for that time period. Any employee who was temporary and transferred to a permanent position during the designated 26-week time period is excluded for that time period. If an employee is denied a wellness certificate due to leave covered under the FMLA, such employee shall be entitled to such certificate upon show of proof.
c.	Part-time regular employees who work forty (40) or more hours per pay period shall be eligible to participate in the Wellness Incentive Program. The same eligibility rules as outlined in Subsection b. above shall apply. However, the maximum amount of sick leave allowed for a part-time employee to use in Pay Periods #1 through #13, or in Pay Periods #14 through #26, shall be prorated. This means for a half-time employee the maximum sick leave that may be used is six (6) hours; for a four-fifths employee, the maximum would be nine and six-tenths (9.6) hours. The amount of time off received by the qualifying part-time employee shall also be prorated. This means a half-time employee would receive a certificate for four (4) hours time off, and a four-fifths employee would receive a certificate for six and four-tenths (6.4) hours time off.
d.	The County shall provide UPE with a copy of the County Policy and Procedure necessary to implement the County's Wellness/Sick Leave Incentive Program as outlined above.
9.5	FAMILY DEATH LEAVE
a.

The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor in advance of taking such leave.
b.	Such absence for family death shall be limited to time which is definitely required and shall not exceed five (5) days for any one (1) death. Family death leave benefits will be prorated for part-time employees based upon the number of hours worked (for example, a half-time employee to a maximum of twenty [20] hours, four-fifths employee to a maximum of thirty-two [32] hours, a full-time employee to a maximum of forty [40] hours).
c.	The intent of this benefit is that it be used within reasonable proximity of the death of the relative unless there are circumstances present which are clearly beyond the control of the employee.
39

Employees shall be granted military leave as required by statute.
9.7	DISABILITY LEAVE
a.	An employee who has suffered possible injury in the performance of assigned duties shall immediately undergo such medical examination as the appointing authority deems necessary. He or she shall not be considered absent from duty during the time required for such examination.
b.	A regular employee who is unable to perform any appropriate work assignment because of disability incurred in the performance of assigned duties shall be entitled to the following disability leave benefits, in addition to those provided pursuant to the California Worker's Compensation Insurance Act:
(1)	During any period of disability for which payment is not provided under Worker's Compensation Insurance, the employee shall be placed on disability leave with pay to the extent of any leave with pay which he or she has accrued. Such disability leave with pay shall be charged against the employee's accrued leave with pay;
(2)	During any period of disability for which payment is provided under Worker's Compensation Insurance the employee shall elect to either:
(a)	Retain any worker's compensation benefits received during the pay period and receive full pay. The employee shall use their accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO, and HIL on an hour-for-hour basis to cover all hours the employee is absent from duty due to the work-related disability during the applicable pay period. Or,
(b)	Retain any worker's compensation benefits received during the pay period and receive a partial paycheck in an amount so that the partial pay and the worker's compensation benefits added together are equivalent to the employee's full pay. The employee shall use their accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO, and HIL in an amount equal to one-half of the number of hours the employee was absent from work during the pay period due to the work-related disability. If, however, the amount of the workers' compensation benefits is subtracted from the employee's full pay for the time off due to the disability, and the remainder is less than one-half of the amount of such full pay, then only the number of leave balance hours necessary to equal that remainder shall be
40
charged.
c.	All disability leave provisions of this section shall terminate when the employee uses all accrued sick leave, vacation, CTO or HIL balances, or upon the date of the employee's recovery from disability, receipt of permanent disability under Worker's Compensation Insurance, retirement, termination from County employment or death.
9.8	JURY DUTY
a.	A regular employee shall be allowed such time off with pay as is required in connection with jury duty; provided, however, that payment shall be made for such time off only upon remittance of full jury fees, or upon submittal of acceptable evidence that jury fees were waived.
b.	Such employee shall notify his appointing authority immediately upon receiving notice of jury duty.
c.	An employee who takes vacation or compensating time off while on jury duty shall not be required to remit or waive jury fees in order to receive his regular salary.

The County may allow employees time off without loss of compensation to attend seminars, conferences and meetings when such attendance will benefit the County.
9.10	TIME OFF FOR PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATIONS
Employees shall be released from duty without loss of compensation while competing in County promotional examinations that are scheduled during duty hours.
9.11	ASSIGNMENT OF LEAVE FOR CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS AND OTHER PURPOSES
Regular employees shall be eligible to participate in the County's program of assignment of leave for catastrophic illness and other purposes. The County will provide UPE a copy of the standardized County Policies and Procedures regarding the implementation of this program.
9.12	PARENTAL LEAVE
a.	Each regular County employee with at least one (1) year of continuous service shall be entitled to schedule paid parental leave upon the birth of the employee's child or during the process of an adoption of a minor child by an employee. In the case
41
of an adoption, the entitlement shall arise upon both: (1) the placement of the child in the employee's home and (2) the employee initiating or having completed an adoptive home study for the adoption of the child. The purposes of parental leave are to facilitate parental bonding, family adjustment, and child care, and such leave shall be used consistent with these purposes.
b.	Parental leave shall be approved by the employee's appointing authority, except where the granting of the parental leave request would unduly interfere with or cause severe hardship upon department operations. Wherever possible, departments shall make reasonable accommodations to permit parental leave, either on a full-time or part-time basis.
c.	The maximum paid parental leave for full-time regular employees shall be 160 hours. Parental leave shall be prorated for part-time regular employees. Parental leave shall not extend beyond four (4) months from either: (1) the date of birth of the employee's child, or (2) in the case of adoption, the initial date of residence of such child with the employee. The maximum 160 hours shall apply to each birth or adoption, regardless of the number of children bom (twins, triplets, et cetera) or adopted.
d.	Parental leave is separate and distinct from the use of sick leave for pregnancy, since it is not based upon disability. Parental leave is available to be scheduled at the conclusion of the use of sick leave for pregnancy.
e.	Employees must make a written request to use parental leave. The written request shall be made at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated start of the parental leave, except in cases of an unanticipated early childbirth or adoption, in which case the employee shall make the written request with as much advance notice as possible. The written request shall also provide such information or substantiation as may be required by the Director of Personnel Services.
f.	An employee who while on parental leave is incapacitated for one (1) or more days due to personal illness or injury may charge such days to sick leave. In such event, the employee promptly shall notify their department, and shall submit substantiation of the need for, and use of, sick leave.
g.	Use of parental leave does not reduce or adversely affect the maximum one-year unpaid leave of absence that an employee may request for child care or family reasons following the birth or adoption of a child.
9.13	COUNTY EMPLOYEES AS VOLUNTEER POLL WORKERS PROGRAM
a.	Any regular County employee, other than employees assigned to the Division of Voter Registration and Elections, may apply for paid leave from County employment to serve as a volunteer poll worker in a polling place in Sacramento County through the County Employees as Volunteer Poll Worker Program when the election
42
day and/or required poll worker training fall within the employee’s regularly scheduled workday.
b.	Subject to the sole discretion of his or her appointing authority to grant or deny the request based on the needs of the service, a regular employee is qualified for approval as follows:
(1)	The employee has successfully applied for and has been selected and found qualified by the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters to serve as a volunteer poll worker;
(2)	The employee has made a request in writing to his/her appointing authority for an absence from County employment as is necessary to attend and complete Poll Worker Training as directed by the Registrar and an absence for the employee’s entire regularly scheduled workday on election day to serve as a volunteer poll worker in Sacramento County;
(3)	On the day of the election the employee has fully executed his/her responsibilities as a poll worker and reported to his/her assigned polling place at the designated time, performed all duties appointed by the County elections official and as required by applicable state and federal elections laws, and remained on duty until the poll was properly closed and secured and until released by the County elections official. As a volunteer, the employee is entitled to receive the normal stipend paid by Voter Registration and Elections to all volunteer poll workers. The stipend shall not be counted in any computation of the total wages or compensation paid the employee by reason of his/her regular employment with the County.
c.	Any regular County employee who qualifies and is approved for the County Employees as Volunteer Poll Workers Program will receive his/her regular pay while on paid leave from County employment for one (1) regularly scheduled work day that falls on the day of the election and for such leave time prior to the election as is necessary, including travel, to attend the required Poll Worker Training during the employee’s work hours. No overtime or compensatory time shall be earned or accumulated during such paid leave.
ARTICLE X HEALTH AND WELFARE
10.1	MEDICAL INSURANCE AND HEALTH PLAN
a.	The County shall pay for each full-time regular employee and each parttime regular employee who works forty (40) hours or more per biweekly pay period up to $465 per month for any of the medical insurance or health plans made available to
43
employees pursuant to this Agreement. The County contribution shall be applicable to either “employee and dependent” coverage or to “employee only” coverage. If the cost of the coverage exceeds the maximum County contribution, the employee shall pay the additional cost.
b.	Effective October 1,2002, the maximum County contribution shall increase to $535 per month.
c.	Effective January 1, 2003, the maximum County contribution shall increase to $555 per month.
d.	Effective January 1, 2004, the maximum County contribution shall increase to $575 per month or eighty percent (80%) of the Kaiser Health Plan premium based on co-payments described in Subsection I. for employee and dependent coverage, whichever is greater.
e.	Effective January 1, 2005, the maximum County contribution shall increase to $595 per month or eighty percent (80%) of the Kaiser Health Plan premium based on co-payments described in Subsection I. for employee and dependent coverage, whichever is greater.
f.	Effective January 1,2006, the maximum County contribution shall increase to $615 per month or eighty percent (80%) of the Kaiser Health Plan premium based on co-payments described in Subsection I. for employee and dependent coverage, whichever is greater.
g.	The County shall provide employees with at least the following medical plan options:
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan VG2
A health maintenance plan
A health plan with a point of service (PCS)
A catastrophic health plan
h.	All full-time regular employees and part-time regular employees per Section 6.4-h. shall enroll in one (1) of the medical and health plans listed in Subsection g. above. If such employee fails to enroll in one (1) of these health plans, the County will take whatever steps are necessary to enroll the employee in the least expensive plan listed, employee-only coverage. An employee shall not be enrolled in catastrophic only coverage by the County under this subsection.
i.	If all the recognized employee organizations of the County advise the County in writing that they are in agreement with a three-tier insurance premium rate structure, the County shall implement the three-tier premium rate structure on the
44
effective date of the following insurance enrollment.
j.	Employees hired prior to August 15, 1999, with medical insurance or health plan coverage whose premium rate is less than the County contribution shall receive a cash payment not to exceed $535 per month minus the cost of the premium rate. For such employees who are covered by social security (FICA), this cash payment will not exceed $535 per month minus the cost of the premium rate for the employee’s medical insurance or health plan coverage, minus a percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages, and minus any County costs (excluding FICA) which are applicable to such cash payment, if any. For such employees who are not covered by social security, the cash payment will be calculated in exactly the same manner, except there will be no deduction of the percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages. Employees hired on or after August 15, 1999, shall not receive this cash payment. Current employees who receive cash-back benefits shall be grandfathered for the duration of their continuous employment history with the County of Sacramento. Such cash-back benefit shall be a vested right.
k.	Employees hired on or after August 15, 1999, shall show evidence of group health insurance at the time of insurance enrollment with the County when selecting catastrophic health insurance coverage. Effective January 1,2003, such employees who select catastrophic coverage shall receive a $150 per month plan selection incentive.
I.	UPE agrees with the Consultant’s recommendations in the 2000-01 Health and Welfare Review to increase the County-sponsored HMO’s to match the PERS 2002 HMO office visit and prescription drugs co-payments effective January 1,2003. UPE further agrees that the County shall have the right to implement all or portions of the Consultant’s recommendations on the Health Plan Restructuring as proposed in the 2002 Health and Welfare Review.
m.	The County shall have the right to further increase the HMO office visit and prescription drug co-payments by no more than $5 effective January 1,2005, based on the accumulative percentage increase of premium increases for employees with dependent coverage for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan for the period January 1,2002 to January 1,2005. (For example, if the accumulated percent increase on the Kaiser premium for the three year period were 30% ($500 January 1,2002 to $650 January 1,2005), a $10 co-payment could be increased by $3 ($10 X 30%) to $13.)
10.2	DENTAL PLAN
The County shall provide at its expense to each full-time regular employee and each part-time regular employee per Section 6.5-h. the following dental benefits for the employee and the employee's eligible dependents:*
a.	A deductible of $25 per patient per calendar year. When three (3) members of a family have each met a $25 per patient deductible, no
45
deductible shall be required of other family members during that calendar year. The deductible shall not apply to two (2) prophylaxes and one (1) dental examination per patient in any calendar year.
b.	There shall be no deductible for any calendar year following two (2) consecutive calendar years during which such person is continuously eligible and in each of such years has utilized the prophylaxes benefits twice each calendar year.
c.	Each calendar year thereafter, no deductible will be required for persons who qualified under Subsection b. above, provided they continue to satisfy the preventive dental maintenance care of two (2) prophylaxes each calendar year.
d.	Persons will be ineligible for the waiver of the deductible if they fail to have the prescribed maintenance care in any calendar year and must repeat the requirements as set forth in Subsection b. to again qualify for no deductible.
(*NOTE: Dependents eligible for benefits are: 1) Lawful spouse; 2) Unmarried children (including stepchildren, adopted children and foster children, provided such children are dependent on the employee for support and maintenance) to their 19th birthday, or their 24th birthday if they are enrolled at an accredited institution of learning; 3) An unmarried child who has reached his 19th birthday but is incapable of self-support because of physical or mental incapacity that commenced prior to his 19th birthday, provided a physician's certificate of such incapacity is submitted to the County Insurance Administrator within six (6)months following his 19th birthday or the employee's date of eligibility in the County Dental Plan; 4) If both spouses are eligible employees, they must each be enrolled as employees, and their children must be enrolled under the parent whose birthday (excluding year of birth) occurs earlier in the calendar year; 5) Dependents in military service are not eligible.)
e.	The dental benefits payable are to be computed at 100% of the Table of Allowances. The Table of Allowances will be based on actual claims history of the previous period October 1 to and including September 30, and will represent approximately 80% of the overall average dental charges to persons covered under the County's dental program for that twelve-month period.
(1)	In order to preserve the 80% concept, the Table of Allowances will be reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, on an annual basis. Reviews will cover the annual period October 1 to and including September 30, and revisions will be effective the first of each calendar year thereafter.
(2)	The County may make necessary and appropriate adjustments to individual allowances for each procedure in order to preserve the
46
80% concept, except adjustments shall not be permitted below the first-year base.
(3)	If it is determined, after an annual review, that the County's dental plan paid less than 79% of the overall average dental charges to persons utilizing the Sacramento County Dental Plan, the revised Table of Allowances shall contain a penalty factor which would increase the Table of Allowances to reflect the same percentage points over 80% in direct proportion to the percentage points under 80% rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the plan paid 74% for the period October 1 to and including September 30, the penalty factor would increase the revised Table of Allowances, effective January 1 of the following calendar year, to 86%. In the event the revised Table of Allowances did not reflect an 86% benefit as determined by the next annual review, the penalty factor would be adjusted in the next Table of Allowances to reflect the miscalculations, rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the next annual review indicated the plan paid 83% rather than 86%, the next Table of Allowances would continue the penalty factor of 3% so that the plan would be designed to pay 83%. The penalty factor would continue in this manner until it is within 1 % of the 80% concept. In no event will the penalty factor be used to reduce the Table of Allowances below 80%.
f.	Additional dental benefits under the County's dental plan shall include the following:
(1)	The County will pay 50% of the total and actual costs of orthodontic care but not to exceed a County payment of $750 perpatient lifetime maximum.
(2)	Dental accidents paid at 100% of actual charges, without application of deductible and is not subject to the $1,500 maximum.
(3)	The plan contains a per-patient calendar year maximum of $1,500 except for the $750 per-patient orthodontic lifetime maximum and for the accident benefit.
(4)	Effective August 15, 1999, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $1,750 and the orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $875. Effective January 1,2000, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $2,000 and the per-patient orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $1,000.
g.	Upon request, the County will make available to recognized employee organizations for inspection the actual dental claims experience used in the annual review or other pertinent periodic tabulations.
h.	Dental benefits will be coordinated with dental benefits provided by any
47
other plan under which the patient is insured, in accordance with the usual established rules covering coordination of benefits as outlined by the California State Insurance Commissioner.
i.	It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this section is a continuation of the pre-existing dental plan and that, under the said preexisting dental plan, a penalty factor of 0% was in effect for the calendar year 1982. It is the intent of this Agreement to continue to make annual penalty factor adjustments, as may be necessary so as to preserve the intent of the original plan.
j.	The plan document was designed after the Valley Clerks Trust Dental Care Program.
k.	The County agrees to provide dental plan pamphlets including the revised Table of Allowances, to UPE and all employees covered by the dental plan on an annual basis.
10.3	DOMESTIC PARTNERS
a.	No sooner than January 1,2003, but no later than July 1, 2003, depending upon administrative implementation, any of the medical insurance and dental plans made available to employees pursuant to this Agreement will be available, at no coverage cost to County, to domestic partners as defined by Section 297 of the California Family Code.
b.	The employee shall be solely responsible for any additional cost of such coverage of the domestic partner and shall be required to provide certification of domestic partner registration. In no event will the County’s monthly health and welfare contribution be used to pay for the cost of the domestic partner’s coverage. The following shall determine employee cost for a domestic partner.
(1)	The dental coverage shall be $39.78 per month for Fiscal Year 2002-03. The cost in subsequent fiscal years shall be determined at the discretion of the County.
(2)	An employee with “employee only” medical plan coverage who adds a domestic partner to that plan will pay the cost difference between the medical plan premium for the “employee only” and “dependent” coverage.
(3)	There will be no further cost if an employee adds a domestic partner to his/her medical plan where the employee has and continues to have “dependent” coverage. In such event, the employee shall have taxable imputed income based on the “employee only” medical plan premium.
48
c.	The employee will be responsible for any tax consequences resulting from the inclusion of a domestic partner under the medical insurance and dental plans offered pursuant to this Agreement.
10.4	LIFE INSURANCE
a.	Basic Benefit: Effective August 29, 1999, the basic life insurance benefit will be $15,000 for employees, and $5,000 for dependents.
b.	Living Benefit:
(1)	Effective August 29, 1999, the life insurance benefit will include a "living benefit" option. To be eligible for this "living benefit," the claimant must be under the age of 70, be diagnosed terminally ill (with life expectancy of twelve [12] months or less); not have assigned his or her employee life benefits; and not have a court order in force which affects the payment of life insurance benefits.
(2)	The life insurance benefit will pay a benefit of up to 50% of the combined basic and any supplemental life amounts. The maximum amount of the living benefit is $50,000, and the minimum is $7,500. Should the employee recover, the amount paid under this provision would be subtracted from the face amount of his/her full benefit at the time of death.
c.	In addition, employees shall have the first option of purchasing supplemental coverage to equal annual salary (minus the initial $15,000 at County expense) rounded to the next even $1,000 up to a maximum of $50,000 life insurance.
d.	The County shall provide a second option to permit employees to elect a second additional amount equal to annual salary so that the total amount of provided and purchased life insurance will equal twice the total first option. Premium rates for the second option shall be determined by the County based on the quotation from the insurance carrier selected by the County to provide the life insurance.
e.	If the employee selects the optional insurance coverage (either Option I or Option II), $5,000 life insurance is provided for each dependent ($200 from age fourteen [14] days to six [6] months) in addition to the amount of insurance applying to the employee at no additional cost.
f.	The County may adjust insurance premiums and amount of insurance on a single date each year for all employees, rather than throughout the year as changes occur in age and salary.
g.	The County may agree with the life insurance carrier that the waiver of premiums for life insurance coverage of disabled insured persons, who otherwise
49
maintain eligibility, shall be continued for one (1) year following the determination by the insurance carrier that the insured is totally disabled and entitled to such a waiver.
h.	The insured may convert such life insurance coverage from group coverage to private coverage at the end of the one-year period.
i.	The County may modify the life insurance premium rate schedule from the existing twenty-six (26) annual premium payments to a twenty-four (24) annual premium payment schedule. In such case, the premiums shall be paid from the first two (2) pay warrants issued each month. Should the twenty-four (24) annual payment schedule be implemented, UPE shall be notified.
j.	If the $50,000 limit in Subsection d. is raised, it shall also be raised for employees covered by this Agreement. In such case UPE shall be notified and provided a copy of the expanded table.
10.5	STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE
a.	The County shall maintain State Disability Insurance, at employee cost, for employees in classes covered by this Agreement.
b.	Employees who are absent from duty because of illness or injury and have been authorized to use County-paid leave benefits, sick leave, vacation, compensating time off, holidays and holiday-in-lieu time, shall be eligible to integrate the payment of State Disability Insurance benefits with such County-paid leave benefits. No integration of County-paid leave benefits and State Disability Insurance shall occur unless the appointing authority has approved the use of the County-paid leave benefits by the employee requesting integration.
c.	Integration of County-paid leave benefits with State Disability Insurance will require detailed procedures which the County shall, in its sole discretion, implement to ensure the equitable application of the program consistent with this Agreement provision. Integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance shall not be paid in a retroactive manner, in accordance with current County policy.
d.	Integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance shall take place subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The intent of this program and contract provision is to insure that those employees who participate in the program comply with all applicable laws, policies, and procedures established to provide integration of County-paid leave balances and State Disability Insurance so as to provide a combined biweekly adjusted net income equivalent to 100% of regular net income - gross income less required deductions, such as taxes, retirement, State Disability Insurance premiums, and other mandatory deductions - as long as such eligible disability qualifies and available leave balances are
50
authorized by the appointing authority. Other employee authorized deductions shall be deducted from the resultant net pay.
(2)	Upon approval of the use of County-paid leave benefits by the appointing authority and the employee's established eligibility for State Disability Insurance, the County shall make leave accrual payments to the employee in the usual manner except that the net pay, including State Disability Insurance benefits and net County pay, shall not exceed 100% of the regular net pay. If State Disability Insurance benefits equal or exceed 100% of the regular net pay, no County payment shall be made. County-paid leave benefits shall be used in the following order: sick leave, vacation, compensating time off, and holiday-in-lieu time.
(3)	Special pay allowances not of a permanent nature, such as overtime compensation, standby, night shift differential, call back or out-of-class pay, shall not be counted in determining the employee's gross or net pay.
(4)	Sick leave, vacation, and holiday-in-lieu shall not accrue during any pay period in which the employee receives County-paid leave benefits integrated with State Disability Insurance payments, except that the employee shall accrue sick leave, vacation, and holiday-inlieu for any actual hours worked during a pay period in which integration occurs. Service credits toward seniority and step increase eligibility shall not be affected by any pay period during which an employee is on the integrated leave and State Disability Insurance program.
(5)	When an employee exhausts all available County-paid leave balances, the employee shall either return to work or request an unpaid leave of absence from his/her appointing authority. No request for an unpaid leave of absence shall be considered unless the employee submits proper and adequate verification of the need for such leave to the appointing authority in a timely manner. The appointing authority shall have the discretion to approve or deny such leave of absence, but a denial shall not be on an unreasonable basis. Regardless whether the employee continues to receive State Disability Insurance payments, once all County-paid leave balances are exhausted, County compensation shall cease unless the employee returns to work.
(6)	The County shall continue its contributions towards the employee's health, dental, life and retirement contributions in accordance with established laws and practices during the pay periods which include County payment for integrated leave balances. The employee shall be responsible for payment of premiums required to maintain medical insurance coverages when County contributions cease.
51
(7)	Eligible part-time employees shall be included in this program on a prorated basis.
e.	In the event the County determines that legislative or judicial determinations cause changes which in any way restrict, reduce or prohibit this program operation, it shall immediately and automatically terminate without any further action by either party to this Agreement.
10.6	EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
a.	The County will make an employee assistance program (EAP) available to each full-time regular employee and each part-time regular employee per Section 6.5-h. The EAP will provide personal counseling for employees and/or members of their immediate families. The counseling is intended to assist employees and family members who are experiencing personal problems such as family/marital problems, personal/emotional problems, substance abuse problems, and work-related problems.
b.	"Members of employees' immediate families" consist of and are limited to the employee's spouse, the employee's or employee's spouse's children or adopted children who are unmarried and under the age of nineteen (19) who are covered by the County's dental plan.
c.	The County will pay the cost of the counseling it has made available, not to exceed 360 minutes (six [6] sessions of approximately one [1] hour each) per incident per calendar year for each employee and each covered family member. Participation in the Employee Assistance Program shall be confidential unless written consent is given by the employee or family member.
d.	It is understood that the County will provide the service through an independent contractor. The County may from time-to-time in its sole discretion change from one (1) contractor to another.
10.7	DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Regular employees shall be eligible to participate in the County deferred compensation program.
10.8	DEFERRED COMPENSATION - TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
a.	An employee covered by this Agreement who is not a member of, or currently earning benefits under, the Sacramento County Employees' Retirement System shall become a participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan set forth in County Code Sections 2.83.200 through 2.83.360.
52
b.	The employee shall contribute 3.75% of his or her compensation for any period of service performed for the County while a participant in this plan. The County shall additionally credit an amount equal to 3.75% of the employee's compensation to the investment account maintained for each participant.

10.10	HEALTH AND WELFARE REOPENER
a.	The parties agree to reopen this article to review the health and welfare benefit program for the purpose of reaching mutually acceptable changes to the program. The vested right of the cash-back benefit for incumbents employees shall remain an option. This article shall remain unchanged without agreement of the parties.
b.	Any agreed-upon changes may be effective during the term of the existing Agreement or may become effective on the date of the successor agreement.
c.	The review shall be conducted in a labor-management forum with every effort made to establish a joint labor-management committee consisting of appropriate management representatives and representatives of all recognized employee organizations in the County.

14.6	LEAVES OF ABSENCE

b.	A request for a leave of absence without pay shall be made in writing. Such leave shall be subject to approval of the appointing authority and the Director of Personnel Services.

14.7	RESIGNATION
An employee may resign from County service by submitting his written resignation to the appointing authority. The resignation shall be effective for all purposes upon its submission. However, an employee wishing to resign from the County service in good standing shall, at least two (2) weeks before his last day of actual work, submit to his appointing authority a written resignation stating therein the last day he or she intends to work, unless such two (2) weeks' notice is waived by the appointing authority.

14.8	VOLUNTARY INTRA-DEPARTMENTAL TRANSFERS
a.	The following rules shall govern the right of employees in the unit to transfer to different locations or programs:
b.	The provisions of this section shall only apply to permanent vacancies in the classes covered by this Agreement. A permanent vacancy is where a permanent position has been vacated due to resignation, retirement, termination, promotion, demotion, inter-class transfer, or death, or where a new position has been created in the County Salary Ordinance. Temporary assignment to a permanent position and/or the shift of an employee(s) to balance programs or workload or to reduce staff in one (1) or more programs shall not be considered a permanent vacancy under this section.
c.	The department will announce permanent vacancies to be filled in the classes covered by this Agreement in the department announcement bulletin. The department will also announce resultant openings created when permanent vacancies are filled by intra-class transfer. Employees interested in the announced openings shall be given five (5) working days from the date of the announcement bulletin in which to submit an intra-departmental transfer request for transfer to the division manager or program manager indicated. Upon request within thirty (30) calendar days of the announcement of a vacancy, UPE shall have the right to review intra-departmental
59
transfer requests submitted during the applicable five (5) working day filing period for any announced positions.
d.	Employees with permanent status in a class shall have the right to submit an intra-departmental transfer request indicating a desire to transfer to a different designated geographic location within the same program. In filling permanent vacancies which occur in the future at the designated location in the employee's class and program, selection must be made from among the three (3) most senior employees who submit intra-departmental location transfer requests, unless there are fewer than three (3) such requests, in which case the County shall have the right to fill the permanent vacancy in any manner it chooses. This subsection shall not apply to the filling of permanent vacancies in specialized organizational units and programs as currently exist or which may be established.
e.	Employees with permanent status in a class may submit intradepartmental transfer requests indicating a desire to transfer to a different program, to a specialized unit, or to a Section 7.8-a. differential position. In filling permanent vacancies in the indicated program, specialized unit, or Section 7.8-a. differential position, the County shall give consideration to employees who submit intradepartmental transfer requests. In filling permanent vacancies from among persons not currently in the program, specialized unit, or Section 7.8-a. differential position, the County shall have the absolute right to select the person to fill the permanent vacancy in any manner it chooses.
f.	Any employee covered by the Agreement who is or plans to be absent from his/her job for a period of thirty (30) days or less, may submit an intra-departmental request for a transfer to a specified location or program, specialized unit, or Section 7.8-a. differential position. Such requests will be considered in filling any permanent vacancies in the specified location or program, specialized unit, or Section 7.8-a. differential position, which are advertised during the employee's absence, provided the employee is available to be interviewed upon request by the County. Once submitted, such intra-departmental requests shall not be revocable by the employee for the period of his/her absence.
g.	Except with the approval of the director, employees may not be considered for transfer to a different location or to a different program, or to a specialized unit, or Section 7.8-a. differential position, unless they:
(1)	Have been in their current assignment for at least twelve (12) months (time spent in AFDC induction training does not count in the twelve-months period); or
(2)	Have been involuntarily assigned to their current assignment within the last twelve (12) months; or
(3)	Were returned from a leave of absence within the last twelve (12) months and were not assigned to (a) their previous location and program or (b) their location and program of choice.
60
h.	The County shall have the right to revoke an employee's rights to transfer if the employee's performance or behavior has been unsatisfactory.
i.	If a permanent vacancy is not filled per Section 14.8-d., employees who have been in a special skills class for at least one (1) year and are qualified for the class of the announced permanent vacancy may be considered for such vacancy via an inter-class transfer. An employee from a different class who is accepted to fill a permanent vacancy, must transfer to the class of the vacant permanent position.
j.	For the purposes of voluntary and involuntary intra-departmental transfers, the County and UPE shall attempt to jointly define the list of programs in Financial Assistance and Social Service programs, and any changes thereto. If agreement is reached, it shall be confirmed in writing in a side letter. If agreement is not reached, UPE may file a grievance that the County's list of programs is unreasonable. If the County intends to modify the list of programs, it shall provide written notice to UPE. The County will meet with UPE to discuss the proposed changes to such list. If the County implements such changes, UPE may request to meet and confer over the impact of such change on employees' transfer rights.
k.	At the time of hire or when employees have completed a training class and are prepared to move into permanent positions, the County shall apply the following procedure:
(1)	Announce all permanent vacancies as required by this Section (14.8).
(2)	Fill those vacancies as required by this section (14.8).
(3)	When an employee is accepted for transfer in their program under
Section 14.8-k.(2), the transfer will be completed in a timely fashion. In any event, such a transfer will be completed within 45 days.
(4)	Allow the trainees to bid for the permanent vacancies created by the transfer of regular employees under (1) and (2) above. Incumbent workers who have transferred to the training class shall be the first within the training class to bid.
This procedure applies only at the time of hire or when employees have completed a training class and are prepared to move into permanent positions. At all other times permanent vacancies shall be announced and filled by the terms of this section. Employees who complete training early shall bid at the time of the graduation of the training class. Trainees may be temporarily assigned to bureaus as part of the training program.
I.	For the purpose of voluntary or involuntary transfers, 4/5 time workers will be treated as if they were full-time.
61
14.9	INVOLUNTARY INTRA-DEPARTMENTAL TRANSFERS
The County shall have the right to make involuntary location or program transfers of employees with five (5) days' notice under the following two (2) paragraphs.
a.	The County shall have the right to involuntarily transfer an employee in cases of sexual harassment, discrimination, or for the purpose of medical accommodations. If the director has not made a final determination in the above stated cases, the employee shall be paid mileage from their current work location to their new work location up and until such time as the director makes a final determination on the above stated issues. The decision by the director shall not be arbitrary or capricious.
b.	The County may involuntarily transfer workers for the purpose of workload balancing with five (5) days' notice and in compliance with the following procedures:
(1)	When employees are involuntarily transferred from one (1) location or one (1) program to another for the purpose of workload balancing, such employees shall be transferred on the basis of inverse seniority among the employees in the affected program or location. Employees involuntarily transferred for the purpose of workload balancing shall have priority in returning to their former program or location over voluntary transfers by order of the most senior employees. The priority in returning to their former program or location shall exist for one (1) year following the involuntary transfer for the purpose of workload balancing. Any employee who fails to exercise the right to return to his/her former location or program thereby waives the right to priority for future vacancies. Priority return rights shall be applied as follows:
(a)	If a full-time position opens up in a program and there are workers who had been involuntarily transferred out of the program, the return rights would be:
1.	If the senior returnee is full-time, that worker would get the position.
2.	If the seniority order is a half-timer senior, the next down is also a half-timer and the third down is fulltime, the two (2) half-time workers would get the position.
62
3.	If the seniority order is a half-timer senior, next down is a full-time, and the third down is a half-time, the fulltime would get the position.
(b)	If the seniority order is a half-timer and no one else with involuntary transfer rights back:
1.	The department will advertise for a half-time match. If a match cannot be found, then
2.	The department will advertise for a full-time worker.
3.	If a full-time worker cannot be found for the program,
the half-time worker with return rights will be given the slot and, if needed, involuntarily transfer another halftime worker into the program to fill the position.
14.10	TRANSFERS DUE TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
When it is necessary for the department to make a mass transfer (twenty [20] or more Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit employees) to a different geographic location due to organizational changes, the department shall so notify UPE sufficiently in advance to permit meeting and conferring on the method to be followed in reassigning employees. The meeting and conferring shall conclude within thirty (30) days of the time notice is given UPE. Nothing in this section shall prevent the County from making transfers it deems necessary in the event agreement is not reached on the method of reassignment. This section shall not apply to immediate reassignments due to emergencies or a shift of employees to balance programs or workload.
14.11	LOANS OF EMPLOYEES TO OTHER AGENCIES
Any employee loaned to work under the direction of another agency shall continue to enjoy the benefits and protection of this Agreement.
ARTICLE XV CASELOADS

e.	Use of total County service without regard for breaks in service, as provided in Subsection a. above, shall not be used to increase leave accruals or other monetary benefits beyond those to which an employee is entitled based on continuous service since the most recent date of appointment to County service.
17.3	LAYOFF
a.	When it becomes necessary due to lack of work, lack of funds or in the interest of economy, to reduce the number of employees in a department, the order of separations within each class affected by the layoff shall be based on seniority as provided in Section 17.2.
b.	Temporary and provisional employees in the class involved shall be separated prior to probationary or permanent employees.
72
c.	Any County employee scheduled for layoff shall have a right to demote within the department to a class in which he or she formerly held permanent status. He or she also may request a demotion to another class in another department in which he or she formerly held permanent status. If employees also are being laid off in the class to which the employee has a right to, or requests to, demote, his seniority in the lower class shall be determined as if he or she were currently serving in that class.
d.	Probationary and permanent employees shall be laid off in the reverse order of seniority.
17.4	APPLICATION
Sections 17.2 and 17.3 shall be applied in accordance with the following rules:
a.	If an employee's position is reallocated to a different class, and the former class no longer is used in the employee's department, the employee's service in the former class shall count toward seniority in the class to which the position was reallocated. In such cases the right to demote, pursuant to Section 17.3-c. shall apply to the new class.
b.	If an employee returned to a former class in which the employee previously held permanent status, seniority in the former class shall be determined as if he or she were currently serving in that class.
c.	An employee who acquired probationary or permanent status in a class shall be given seniority credit for prior temporary, provisional, or limited-term service in that class provided that such service immediately precedes the probationary or permanent service.
d.	"Temporary employees" include employees serving in limited-term appointments as provided in Subdivision (f) of Civil Service Commission Rule 7.7, who shall also be separated in the order determined by the appointing authority. Service in a limited-term position shall not be considered as a limited-term appointment unless the employee has agreed in writing to accept a limited-term appointment. Any employee who holds both permanent status under a limited-term appointment and permanent status under a regular appointment in the same class, shall be deemed to hold only permanent status under a regular appointment in that class.
e.	For layoff purposes, "demotion" means a change between classes where the maximum salary rate at the top step of the range for the class to which an employee is demoted is any amount lower than the maximum salary rate at the top step of the range for the class from which the employee is demoted.
73
f.	With respect to personnel within a class in the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit who are laid off from that class and demote pursuant to Section 17.3-c. above, to a class outside of the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit which is governed either by an agreement with another unit representative which contains terms regulating seniority, layoff and the right to demote or request demotion or by the Sacramento County Code or Personnel Rule No. 4 with respect to such matters, the seniority of such personnel for purposes of identifying the persons to be laid off within the class to which demotion is made shall be determined by the terms of the applicable agreement or Code, as the case may be.
g.	Personnel employed under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) shall be laid off and separated in compliance with, and their right to demote within the department and to request demotion to another department shall be subject to, all requirements established by Congressional enactments, Federal Regulations and Orders, and grant terms and conditions as they exist and apply on the effective date of layoff.
h.	The right under Section 17.3-c. above, to demote to a class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which is within the department to which the employee is assigned, shall be implemented as follows:
(1)	When an employee is scheduled for layoff from a class, if there is only one (1) other lower salaried class within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status, he or she shall be demoted to that class. If there is no vacancy in that class, and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the demoting employee shall be laid off from that class and from employment.
(2)	If there are two (2) or more lower salaried classes within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status, the employee shall be demoted to that class in which he or she formerly held permanent status which has the highest salary (when measured at the top steps of the ranges of the salary schedule). If there is no vacancy in that class, and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the demoting employee shall be demoted to the next lower salaried class within the department in which he or she formerly held permanent status. If there is no vacancy in that class and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the above process shall continue until the demoting employee either reaches a class within the department in which he or she formerly held permanent status in which there is a vacancy or in which he or she is not the least senior employee within the department in that class, or he or she is
74
laid off from employment.
(3)	Employees who are least senior in a class in which there is no vacancy and to which an employee demotes from a higher class within the department or with respect to which an employee's request to demote from a higher class in another department is granted shall be laid off from that class, and shall, accordingly, have the same right to demote under Section 17.3-c. above, as does any other employee who is laid off.
(4)	Employees demoted under the above procedure shall be deemed to have exercised their right to demote under Section 17.3-c. above, and to have accepted each demotion, subject to their right to resign from employment. An employee who resigns in lieu of accepting a demotion, shall retain, in that class from which the employee was demoted, reemployment rights pursuant to this article.
(5)	The words "scheduled for layoff" under Section 17.3-c. above, shall mean laid off. An employee demoted under Section 17.3-c. above, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from each class from which he or she demotes or is displaced, including classes which he or she passes through because of the absence of a vacancy and insufficient seniority to occupy a position in that class.
i.	Except as hereinafter provided, the right to request demotion to another department under Section 17.3-c. above, applies to any class in which the employee formerly held permanent status, which has a lower salary than the class from which the employee was laid off (when measured at the top steps of the ranges of the salary schedule), which is situated in any department other than the one to which the employee was assigned prior to layoff. Such right to request demotion shall not apply to a class to which the requesting employee is demoted and from which he or she is not laid off within the department to which the requesting employee is assigned. The appointing authority of the receiving department may, in his or her discretion, grant a request to demote if there is either a vacancy in the class within the receiving department or the requesting employee would not be the least senior employee in the receiving department within the class to which the request refers.
j.	The words "scheduled for layoff" under Section 17.3-c. above, shall mean laid off. An employee whose request to demote to another department is granted, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from the class from which he or she demotes.
k.	Separation: Release from employment of a temporary employee or the return of a regular employee from a temporary upgrade to the
75
immediate former class in which the employee held permanent status. Separation does not constitute a layoff.
17.5	NOTICE OF LAYOFF
a.	Each employee subject to layoff shall be given written notice of layoff. The notice shall prescribe the effective date of layoff. The written notice shall either be personally handed to the employee, delivered to a person at his or her last known address, or mailed to the last known address by certified mail. The last known address shall be deemed to be that address which is within the personnel file of the employee within the department to which he or she is assigned. The notice shall be deemed served on the date it is personally handed to the employee, or on the date it is delivered to his or her last known address, or on the date it is mailed to his or her last known address, as the case may be.
b.	With respect to any layoff which becomes effective on or before July 31, 1978, the effective date of layoff shall be not earlier than the date of service of the notice of layoff. With respect to any layoff which becomes effective on or after August 1, 1978, the effective date of layoff shall be not earlier than the 14th calendar day following the date of service of the notice of layoff.
17.6	NOTICE TO UPE
Each time a layoff is or layoffs are ordered, the County shall deliver to UPE, not later than the date of service of the last notice of layoff, each seniority list by class and department in which an employee within the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit is to be laid off. Each such list shall identify the personnel to be laid off and show the date of service of the notice of layoff to each employee who is to be laid off.
17.7	GRIEVANCE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
The grievance-arbitration procedure set forth in Sections 17.8 through 17.18 shall be applicable only to disputes concerning the validity or timeliness of service of notice of layoff, the order of layoff, or the identification of who is laid off under the order of layoff.
17.8	DEFINITION
A grievance is a complaint by one (1) or a group of employees or UPE involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the express terms of this article relating to the validity or timeliness of service or notice of layoff, the order of layoff, or the identification of who is laid off under the order of layoff, and asserting that an employee or employees have not been served with notice of layoff or have not been timely served with notice of layoff, have been misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff, in violation of the terms of this article.
76
17.9	TIME, PLACE AND MANNER OF FILING
a.	A grievance shall be filed on a form prescribed by the County. Each grievance shall state the factual basis for the claim, cite the provision of the article allegedly violated, and state the name of each employee who it is contended has not been validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff. Any grievance which either is not filed on a form prescribed by the County or which does not state the name of any employee contended to have been not validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff, shall be deemed invalid, null and void.
b.	All grievances shall be filed with the Department of Personnel Services (Director's Office).
c.	All grievances shall be filed not later than seven (7) calendar days following the date of service of the notice of layoff upon the employee or employees it is contended by the grievance were not validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff. Any grievance which is not received by the Department of Personnel Services (Director's Office) within seven (7) calendar days following the date of service of such notice of layoff shall be deemed invalid, null and void, and a waiver of the employee or employees named in the grievance assert their rights. Grievances filed by UPE shall be considered timely, if filed within seven (7) calendar days from the date of notice, pursuant to Section 17.6.
17.10	DELIVERY TO UPE
The County shall deliver a copy of each grievance filed by an employee or group of employees to UPE not later than eight (8) calendar days following the date of filing. If many grievances are filed within a period of a few days, it is intended that copies of the grievances be delivered to UPE in a group or groups and not one (1) at a time.
17.11	COMPLAINTS BY UPE
a.	Not later than fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of delivery of copies of grievances by employees pursuant to Section 17.10 above, or twenty-two (22) calendar days after the filing of a grievance by UPE, whichever is earlier, UPE shall file a consolidated complaint with respect to all such grievances. The complaint shall name each employee who UPE asserts has not been validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff. No claim may be asserted with respect to any employee named in the complaint who has not been named in a preceding timely
77
grievance as one who has not been validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff. Any employee named in a preceding timely grievance filed by UPE or a timely employee grievance (a copy of which has been delivered to UPE at least fifteen [15] calendar days preceding the date of filing of the complaint) as having not been validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, misplaced within the order of layoff or incorrectly identified for layoff under the order of layoff, who is not so named in the complaint, shall be deemed to have been validly served with notice of layoff in a timely manner, correctly placed within the order of layoff and correctly identified for layoff under the order of layoff.
b.	In formulating and filing the complaint or by not filing a complaint, UPE shall have authority to waive the claims of employees which it elects not to assert. The failure to assert such claims or name such employees in the complaint (as to grievances filed by UPE and employee grievances, copies of which were delivered to UPE at least fifteen [15] calendar days preceding the date of filing the complaint) shall be deemed to be a waiver of such claims and rights which is binding both upon UPE and the individual employee.
c.	The complaint shall be filed with and received by the Department of Personnel Services (Director's Office) within fifteen (15) calendar days following delivery to UPE of the copies of employee grievances or twenty-two (22) calendar days following filing by UPE of its grievance, whichever is earlier. The failure of said department to receive a complaint within said time shall be deemed to be a waiver of all claims and grievances to which the complaint is required to refer.
17.12	ARBITRATION - SCHEDULING
Timely complaints shall be submitted to and determined by an arbitrator. Each arbitration proceeding shall commence not earlier than ten (10) calendar days and not later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of filing of the complaint.
17.13	CONSOLIDATION OF PROCEEDINGS

e.	If UPE withdraws from a consolidated proceeding, the County shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.12 above, have a right to a reasonable continuance of any hearing of UPE's complaint if necessary in order to avoid the hearing of more than one (1) complaint of a unit representative on the same day.
f.	If UPE withdraws from a consolidated hearing, and if the arbitrator makes a back-pay award under UPE's complaint, there shall be subtracted from the amounts owing any and all back-pay attributable to the period, if any, between the date of the arbitrator's decision on UPE's complaint and:
(1)	The date of the arbitrator's decision in the consolidated proceeding from which UPE withdrew, if any, or if all unit representatives withdrew from the consolidation except one (1).
(2)	The date of the arbitrator's decision with respect to the complaint of the unit representative who did not withdraw from the consolidation, or, if all of the unit representatives withdrew from the consolidation.

b.	The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to order reinstatement, back pay or any other relief for any employee who is determined to have been not validly served with notice of layoff or not served in a timely manner, or identified for layoff in violation of the terms of the Agreement, unless the employee has been alleged to have been not validly served or not served in a timely manner or incorrectly identified for layoff in both a timely grievance and a timely complaint.
c.	The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to revise the order of layoff as to any employee who has not been alleged to have been assigned an improper order in both a timely grievance and a timely complaint, except to the extent necessary to grant relief to an employee determined to have been assigned an improper order who was so alleged in both a timely grievance and a timely complaint.
d.

e.	Under no circumstances shall an arbitrator have jurisdiction or authority to order any remedy which either directly or indirectly permits the layoff of fewer personnel within any department or organizational unit or class than ordered by the County, or which otherwise impairs the discretion of the County to determine the number of personnel within each department and within each class who will be employed.

DIVISION C REEMPLOYMENT
17.19	ENTITLEMENT
With respect to classes within the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit, reemployment entitlements shall be as follows:
a.	A person whose effective date of layoff occurs at any time after July 1, 1978, and who held permanent or probationary status in the class from which he or she was laid off shall, during the four-year period following the effective date of layoff, be entitled to be appointed from a departmental reemployment list to a vacancy in that class within the department from which the person was laid off and subject to the provisions of this article.
b.	A person whose effective date of layoff occurs at any time after July 1, 1978, and who held permanent or probationary status in the class from which he or she was laid off shall, during the four-year period following the effective date of layoff, be entitled to certification from a County-wide reemployment list for a vacancy in the class from which the person was laid off, pursuant and subject to the provisions set forth below.
17.20	TYPE OF POSITION
82
The entitlement to appointment or certification applies whether the position in which the vacancy occurs is regular, temporary, or limited-term.
17.21	LIMITED-TERM AND CETA PERSONNEL
a.	Personnel serving under limited-term appointments shall not be entitled to reemployment rights or to placement on either a departmental or County-wide reemployment list, whether or not they held permanent status as limited-term appointees in the class from which they were separated.
b.	The right of personnel employed under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to reemployment, to be placed upon either departmental or County-wide reemployment lists, their order on such lists, and their priority of appointment from such lists shall be subject to and in compliance with all requirements established by Congressional enactments, Federal Regulations and Orders, and grant terms and conditions as such enactments, regulations, orders, terms and conditions may change and apply from time to time during the term of the Agreement.
17.22	DEPARTMENTAL REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	The County shall prepare a departmental reemployment list for each class in each department in which an employee with permanent or probationary status in that class is laid off after July 1, 1978. As personnel are separated from a class in which they hold permanent or probationary status, their names shall be added to the list for the class and department in which the layoff occurs in the inverse order in which they were separated from service in that class.
b.	Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the order of names on departmental reemployment lists shall be derived from (by inverting) the order of layoff prescribed by layoff lists, as the order of layoff may be modified by agreement between the parties or aware under grievance-arbitration proceedings commenced pursuant to layoff under Sections 17.8 through 17.18 above. The purpose of this provision is to insure that disputes concerning the order of layoff and of departmental reemployment lists are raised and settled at or near the time of layoff, and not at the time reemployment is sought.
17.23	COUNTY-WIDE REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
The County shall prepare County-wide reemployment lists for each class from which personnel with permanent or probationary status in the class were laid off after July 1, 1978. Each list shall constitute a merger of persons who were laid off from the class and who held permanent or probationary status therein.
83
17.24	APPOINTMENT AND CERTIFICATION PRIORITIES
With respect to the entitlement to appointment or certification, the following priorities shall apply in relation to vacancies in classes to which the entitlement is applicable.
a.	A vacancy in a class shall be filled first from the Medical Center transfer eligible lists prescribed in Section 7.7 (d) of the Civil Service Rules, as that section existed prior to August 15, 1974. If the vacancy is not filled by appointment from the Medical Center transfer eligible list, then;
b.	The vacancy shall be filled from that departmental reemployment list for the class in which the vacancy exists and for the department in which the vacancy exists. Persons shall be appointed to vacancies in the order of the list.
(1)	One (1) person shall be offered an appointment for each vacancy in accordance with the order of the list. If that person declines appointment, the next person in order shall be offered appointment.
(2)	A person to whom an appointment is intended to be offered may be contacted personally and may accept appointment orally. A person shall not be deemed to have declined appointment unless he or she has done so in writing, or unless written notice of the offer of appointment has been transmitted by certified mail to his or her last known address, and he or she has failed to accept the appointment in writing within ten (10) calendar days following the date of mailing of the notice.
c.	No persons shall be certified for appointment from a County-wide reemployment list to a vacancy in a class until there are no longer any names on that departmental reemployment list for the class within the department in which the vacancy exists or all persons on that departmental reemployment list have declined appointment to that vacancy. In such event, the names of three (3) persons shall be certified from the County-wide reemployment lists for the class in which the vacancy exists in accordance with the order of the list. The names shall be certified to the appointing authority for the class in which the vacancy exists, who shall have discretion to offer the appointment to one (1) of the three (3). If there is more than one (1) vacancy, an additional name shall be certified for each vacancy in excess of one (1).
(1)	For each person who declines an offer of appointment, an additional name shall be certified.
(2)	A person on the County-wide reemployment list shall be deemed to
84
have declined appointment under the same circumstances and in accordance with the same procedure as is specified in Subsection 17.24-b.(2), above.
(3)	If there are fewer than three (3) names on the County-wide reemployment list, rank or ranks of additional names shall be certified from regular eligible lists so as to provide a total of not less than three (3) persons available for appointment.
17.25	REMOVAL FROM DEPARTMENTAL REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
The names of persons shall be deemed removed from departmental reemployment lists and their entitlement to appointment from such lists terminated, as follows:
a.	Upon the expiration of four (4) years following the effective date of layoff of each person.
b.	As a result of appointment to a regular position within County service in a class which is the same as the one for which the list exists or which, at the time of appointment, is equal to or higher than the one for which the list exists in salary when measured at the top step of the salary schedule (personnel shall not be deemed removed from such lists by virtue of appointment to any temporary or limited-term position in any class);
c.	Upon declination of appointment from the list, under the same circumstances and in accordance with the same procedure as is specified in Subsection 17.24-b.(2) above, except in instances where the person states in writing that he or she is temporarily medically incapacitated;
d.	In the event a person states in writing that he or she does not desire appointment from the list, or fails to file a written statement expressing his or her desire for appointment within ten (10) calendar days following certified mailing to his or her last known address of written inquiry concerning such desire.
17.26	REMOVAL FROM COUNTY-WIDE REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
The names of persons shall be deemed removed from County-wide reemployment lists and their entitlement to certification from such lists terminated, as follows:
a.	Upon expiration of four (4) years following the effective date of layoff of each person.
85
b.	As a result of appointment to a regular position within County service in a class which is the same as the one for which the list exists or which, at the time of appointment, is equal to or higher than the one for which the list exists in salary when measured at the top step of the salary schedule (personnel shall not be deemed removed from such lists by virtue of appointment to any temporary or limited-term position in any class);
c.	In the event a person states in writing that he or she does not desire appointment from the list, or fails to file a written statement expressing his or her desire for appointment within ten (10) calendar days following certified mailing to his or her last known address of written inquiry concerning such desire;
d.	Removal from the departmental reemployment list. The removal shall be from that County-wide reemployment list for the class to which the departmental reemployment list applied.
e.	Except as provided in Subsection 17.25-d. above, a person shall be authorized to decline appointment to a class to which he or she has been certified by submitting a written statement which objects to the appointment on the basis of the identity of the department, geographical location of the job, or shift schedule of the job. Such a declination shall not result in removal of the person from the County-wide reemployment list. However, the person shall not thereafter be certified for appointment to a vacancy which falls within the description of the written objection.
17.27	EFFECT OF REEMPLOYMENT
When a person is reemployed from either a departmental reemployment list or a County-wide reemployment list, the period of unemployment succeeding the layoff shall not be treated as an interruption of service for purposes of salary, benefits or seniority. The period of such unemployment shall be treated as County service for seniority purposes. However, with the exception of seniority, the period of unemployment shall not be treated as County service for any other purpose.
17.28	SERVICE OF REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	Not later than January 1 of each year, the County shall serve, by mail, upon UPE a set of copies of all County-wide reemployment lists and all departmental reemployment lists for classes within the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit. Such service shall be made once, and shall include all such lists prepared as a result of all layoffs which have occurred between July 1 and the date of service.
b.	Not later than July 5 of each year, the County shall serve, by mail, upon UPE a set of copies of all County-wide reemployment lists and all departmental
86
reemployment lists for classes within the Welfare Non-Supervisory Unit. Such service shall be made once, and shall include all such lists prepared between the date of service pursuant to Subsection a., above, and June 30, inclusive.
17.29	GRIEVANCE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
The grievance-arbitration procedure set forth in Section 17.30 through 17.36 shall be applicable only to disputes arising under Division C of this article.
17.30	EXISTENCE, ORDER AND CONTENTS OF REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	Except as provided in this section, no employee, person or other entity shall be authorized to grieve, dispute or otherwise challenge the failure of the County to establish a County-wide reemployment list or departmental reemployment list required
