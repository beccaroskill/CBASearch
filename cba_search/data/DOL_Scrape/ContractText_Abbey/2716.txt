ARTICLE 6 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
6.1	DEFINITIONS
6.1.1	Individual Grievance - An individual grievance is a formal written allegation by
the Association or a unit member that he/she has been adversely affected by an alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of this Agreement.
6.1.2	Class Grievance - A class grievance is a formal written allegation signed by more
than one (1) unit member who has been personally and adversely affected by an alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of this Agreement. Though all grievants included must be identified, the grievance process may be carried out by one (1) grievant on behalf of the whole group.
6.1.3	When a class grievance is declared by the Association, the resolution (relief sought)
shall be applicable to all affected unit members.
6.1.4	Days - Days are working days during which the unit member is required to be in
attendance.
6.2	PROCEDURE
6.2.1	This procedure must be initiated within twenty (20) days following the act or
occurrence upon which the alleged grievance is based or within twenty (20) days of the date the unit members should reasonably have known of the act or occurrence. If the act or occurrence upon which the alleged grievance is based occurs less than twenty (20) days prior to the end of the unit member’s work year, it is the intent of the parties to this agreement that initiation and processing of the grievance shall proceed without interruption for summer recess, except where one of the involved parties is unavailable.
6.2.2	Informal Level - Before filing a written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to
resolve the matter by an informal conference with his immediate supervisor.

6.2.3	Step 1 - If the matter is not resolved at the informal conference, the grievant may,
within five (5) days following the informal conference, present his/her grievance in writing to the administrator with immediate administrative responsibility for the position to which the unit member is assigned. The administrator will answer the grievance in writing within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of the grievance form.
6.2.4	Step 2 - In the event the grievance has not been satisfactorily settled at Step 1, the
grievant may appeal the decision on the form provided by the District to the Superintendent, or designee, within five (5) working days after receiving the response in Step 1.

The Board will, upon request by the grievant, conduct an informal hearing in closed executive session or, if not requested, render a decision based upon a review of written documents developed in Steps 1 and 2 of the Grievance Procedure. Grievances may be considered by the Board of Education, as a whole, or by a committee of the Board, as determined by the Board.
6.2.6	Step 4 - If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step
3,	or if no written decision has been rendered within the applicable time limits, the Association may, within ten (10) working days after a written decision is rendered or should have been rendered, by written notice to the Superintendent, elect to submit the grievance to arbitration. In the event the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitrator, they shall request a panel of Modified May 2002	9
1	seven (7) names be submitted to both parties by the California State Conciliation Service. Upon
2	receipt of the list of names, the parties shall alternately delete names from the list until only one
3	(1) remains, and said last name shall be selected as the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision shall
4	be in writing and shall set forth his/her findings of fact, his reasoning, conclusions and decisions.
5	The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the issue submitted by the parties, and the
6	arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to, subtract from, alter, delete, amend or modify
7	the terms of this Agreement. Should the arbitrator determine that time limits were exceeded, the
8	arbitrator shall not have the authority to hear the grievance(s) without mutual agreement of the
9	parties.
10	6.2.6.1 All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to per diem
11	expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, transcript and the cost of any hearing room, will be 12 borne equally by the District and Association. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring 13 them. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.
14	6.3	MISCELLANEOUS
15	6.3.1	A unit member may be represented at all stages of the Grievance Procedure by
16	himself/herself and, at his/her option, by a representative selected by the Association. If a unit 17 member is not represented by the Association, the District shall not agree to a resolution of the 18 grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution 19 and has been given the opportunity to file a response.
20	6.3.2 Decisions rendered at Steps 1 and 2 of the Grievance Procedure will be in writing,
21	setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore, and will be transmitted promptly to all parties
22	in interest and to the President of the Association. Time limits for appeal provided in each step
23	shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by parties in interest.
24	6.3.3	When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to attend a
25	grievance meeting or hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to his/her Principal or
26	immediate supervisor by the President of the Association, be granted release time without loss of

6.3.4	All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file. Site grievance files will not be retained for nor transferred to successor site administrators, except that nothing contained in this provision shall prohibit any administrator from retaining in his/her possession any document of which he/she is the maker.
6.3.5	Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, making appeals, making reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared jointly by the Superintendent, or designee, and the Association so as to facilitate operation of the Grievance Procedure. The costs of preparing such forms shall be borne by the District. For the protection of the unit member and the District, all grievance proceedings shall be kept confidential, as may be appropriate, at all levels of the procedure.
6.3.6	The time limits specified in these procedures may be reduced or extended in any specific instance by a written agreement of the parties involved.
6.3.7	If a grievance arises from the action of an authority above the Principal level, the unit member may present his grievance at the appropriate step.
6.3.8	If any step of the grievance procedure is not followed by the administrator handling it, the grievance automatically proceeds to the next step. Failure by the grievant to meet time limits specified herein shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
6.3.9	The District shall not impose or threaten to impose reprisals on bargaining unit members because of their participation in a grievance proceeding.

This will only be possible when there are two (2) positions available in the District and the staff having to be moved are qualified to teach in the positions available.
8.10	PROCEDURES FOR INVOLUNTARY TRANSFER
8.10.1	When transferring a bargaining unit member, the District shall:
8.10.1.1	Provide notice of any involuntary transfer to the teacher as soon as practical and conference with the respective teacher not less than five (5) working days prior to the transfer.
8.10.1.2	Provide, upon request, the reasons for the transfer in writing.
8.10.1.3	Prevent vacancies from being filled by means of an involuntary transfer if there is a request on file by a bargaining unit member that meets all of the criteria for voluntary transfer.
8.10.1.4	Provide the bargaining unit member with two (2) days release time to set up the new class in the event a teacher is transferred involuntarily during the school year.
8.10.1.5	Provide transportation of instructional materials from the old site to the new site when an involuntary transfer occurs.

ARTICLE 9 EVALUATIONS
9.1	The basic purpose of the evaluation process is to establish the premise of
continuous improvement, to promote personal accountability, to encourage professional development, and to provide for due process. Within this context, evaluation is a cooperative and continuous process aimed at improving and maintaining quality educational programs, while serving as an essential component in the professional development of certificated personnel.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
9.2	For each year in which the bargaining unit member is to be evaluated, and not later
than the end of the 4th school week, each administrator will meet individually with the unit members of his/her staff to set up goals and objectives for the school year.
9.2.1	For the 2001/2002 school year bargaining unit members (other than first year
employees or those lacking 75% service in the first year of employment) may select either the evaluation document at Appendix F and the goals and objectives document at Appendix G or the evaluation and goals and objectives document labeled Appendix J attached herein. Commencing with the 2002/2003 school year the evaluation and goals and objectives document at Appendix J shall be used for all bargaining unit members, with the exception of persons in specialty positions for whom appropriate specialty evaluation documents shall have been mutually adopted hereafter. (Effective with the 2002/2003 school year, Appendices F and G shall be omitted. Both parties agree to meet and discuss recommended modifications to Appendix J on or about June 15, 2002.)
Evaluation formats for counselors, nurses, and designated instructional specialists.
The parties are agreed that the proposed formats will be made available for optional use in the year 2001-2002. At their discretion, bargaining unit members in these classifications may elect to use the prototype document for formal evaluation. Such completed evaluation documents shall be placed in the unit member’s personnel file. Those bargaining unit members not using the prototype document shall continue to be evaluated using the existing evaluation format (including

the “specialist” document.) The Fontana Teachers Association will assist the district in collecting feedback regarding the prototype documents for counselors, nurses and designated instructional specialists by May 15, 2002 so that such feedback may be used in the evaluation refinement process scheduled for on or about June 15, 2002.
9.2.2	When the evaluation document at Appendix J is used, the administrator and bargaining unit member shall select three (3) standards to be the focus of goals and objectives and evaluation. The standards shall be selected as follows:
a.	one standard selected by the bargaining unit member
b.	one standard selected by the evaluator
c.	one standard selected jointly by the bargaining unit member and the evaluator.
Should the process described in 9.2.2 for establishing the focus of an evaluation be declared legally insufficient pursuant to the California Education Code, this clause shall be subject to renegotiation without affecting the remainder of Article 9.
9.3	In the event that either the unit member or the administrator feels that the goals
and/or objectives are inappropriate because of unforeseen circumstances, the administrator and the unit member will meet and review these goals and may alter these goals when it is felt that alterations are appropriate and in the best interest of a good educational program. The administrator shall provide 30-day notice of a change in goals and objectives/evaluation focus to the bargaining unit member prior to completing formal observation on the modified areas.
9.4	When agreement on goals and objectives cannot be attained, a third party shall be
designated to resolve the issue. The unit member shall select a District administrator to serve as the third party; said administrator shall not be related by blood or marriage to the unit member. The decision of the third party will be final.
9.5	No formal observation shall take place prior to the determination of the appropriate
unit member’s goals and objectives or completion of the process identified in the paragraph above. OBSERVATION AND EVALUATION

9.6	Formal observations shall last for not less than either thirty (30) minutes or one (1)
full period, whichever is appropriate to the grade level and lesson, and shall be followed by a conference in which the administrator and the unit member shall review the observation and what is to be incorporated into the written observation summary. Such conference shall be held within ten (10) working days after the observation, and a typewritten summary shall be provided to the unit member within ten (10) working days of the observation conference. At least the first observation shall be announced.
9.7	Probationary unit members shall be formally observed at least three (3) times and
evaluated at least two (2) times during a school year. Permanent unit members shall be formally observed and evaluated at least one (1) time every two years. Evaluations must be completed at least thirty days prior to the end of the unit member’s work year. At a time scheduled by the administrator, an evaluation conference shall be held. Components of the evaluation shall include, but not be limited to: the observation, the employee’s goals and objectives, other pertinent information about employee performance. Within ten (10) working days after the evaluation conference, a final typewritten copy of the evaluation shall be provided to the unit member (Appendix E). If any “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory” performance of duties is noted, Page two must be completed. The unit member shall have the opportunity to initiate a written reaction to any area of formal evaluation. Such response shall become a permanent attachment to the copy of the evaluation in the unit member’s file. Such response must be filed within ten (10) days of the written evaluation. If a copy of the response is given to the evaluator, the evaluator may elect to modify or correct the evaluation document before it is placed in the unit member’s personnel file.
9.8	Notwithstanding the above, any bargaining unit member who receives an overall
unsatisfactory evaluation shall, upon request, be entitled to two subsequent observations, two conferences and one additional written evaluation, provided that such request is made no later than

ten working days following the receipt of the overall unsatisfactory evaluation. Such entitlement is limited to one time only for each initial formal evaluation.
Notwithstanding the above, the administrator who issues an overall unsatisfactory evaluation shall issue a supplementary evaluation document covering all performance standards.
For purposes of referral to the Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR) an evaluation shall be marked overall unsatisfactory when one of the three selected standards is rated overall unsatisfactory or when at least two of the three standards are rated needs improvement. Ratings on Standard 6 shall not be used as a basis for PAR referral.
9.9	The unit member shall take affirmative action to correct any cited deficiencies
based upon the administrator’s assistance plan for improvement and assistance.
9.10	The evaluation and observation forms will be submitted to the Personnel Services
Office. In the event concerns develop regarding the performance of a certificated employee, this section shall not preclude evaluations every year when deemed necessary by the administrator. A permanent employee who has received a negative evaluation shall have an annual evaluation until the evaluation is again positive or the employee is separated from the District.
9.11	PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE
No probationary certificated employee shall be non-reelected or dismissed without all steps of the procedures as outlined in this Article being adhered to.
9.12	GENERAL
9.12.1	Members of the unit shall not be required to evaluate other members of the unit. Notwithstanding this provision, bargaining unit members shall be allowed to participate in an advisory capacity in the selection of unit members to serve in “Schedule C” or other additional assignment positions at the discretion of the individual site administrator. No member of the unit shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational program over which the member has no authority to correct deficiencies.

12.13.15	RATE OF PAYMENT
A unit member on a sabbatical leave shall receive fifty (50) percent of his regular salary, computed on a monthly basis; provided, however, that the compensation for any employment accepted during such leave shall not exceed the difference between the regular salary the unit member would have received had he remained on regular duty and the salary for sabbatical leave. 12.13.16 METHOD OF PAYMENT

ARTICLE 13 RETIREMENT
13.1	RETIREMENT PROGRAM
13.1.1	Effective October 1, 1988 and thereafter, bargaining unit members who retire after no less than fifteen (15) total years of full-time paid service in the Fontana Unified School District and have achieved fifty (50) years of age, according to District records, shall be eligible to participate in the District-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs, provided that the unit member has been covered under a plan for the five (5) years immediately preceding retirement, as follows:
13.1.1.1	Option 1 - The District shall pay the premiums for medical insurance only at the same rate that is provided for current full-time employees for a period of eight (8) years after retirement.
13.1.1.2	Option 2 - The District shall pay the premiums for the total health and welfare package (inclusive of medical, dental, vision and life insurance) at the same rate that is provided for current full-time employees for six (6) years after retirement.
13.1.1.3	Option 3 - The District shall pay the premium for fourteen (14) years of Dental and Vision insurance at the same rate that is provided for current full-time employees.
13.1.1.4	Option 4 - Bargaining unit members serving the Fontana Unified School District with thirty-five (35) or more years of service will be granted lifetime medical benefits for the employee and spouse during the lifetime of the employee.
Full retirement benefits shall be granted to the surviving spouse of an employee who qualified for lifetime benefits under Article 13 until said surviving spouse remarries, or is eligible for Medicare benefits, but under no condition longer than eight (8) years.
13.1.2	Under no circumstances shall the District’s maximum contribution for retired employees exceed that contributed by the District for current full-time employees.

13.1.3	For purposes of the foregoing, completion of seventy-five percent (75%) of the workdays within a school year shall constitute completion of a year of service. The Board may, at its sole discretion, modify retiree benefits stated herein when in its consideration the circumstances of an individual situation warrant such action.
13.1.4	Bargaining unit members who are working under less than a full-time contract shall be eligible for a pro-rata District contribution to the employee health and welfare benefits program in accordance with Article 21, Salaries and Fringe Benefits.
13.1.5	Bargaining unit members and retirees shall be responsible for payment, through payroll deduction or personal check (retirees), for health and welfare benefit selections, which exceed the benefits provided herein. Any retiree with retirement benefit entitlement pursuant to Article 13 (Retirement) who moves to an area not covered by the District’s medical, vision, or dental policy carrier(s) or for whom such carrier cannot provide convenient services may elect to find another coverage that meets their needs. Upon written request prior to May 31st of each fiscal year, the retired bargaining unit member shall be reimbursed in advance on a semi-annual basis for medical coverage so selected, provided that at no time shall the District be responsible to pay more than the dollar amount for which the retiree is eligible pursuant to Article 13. If the premium of the policy(s) selected exceeds the retired employees’ maximum dollar eligible pursuant to Article 13, individually or in combination with any other policies provided to said employee pursuant to Article 13, the retired employee shall be responsible to pay the excess balance.
13.1.6	The surviving spouse or other eligible dependents, if any, of a unit member who dies prior to expiration of his/her retirement health and welfare program (which may include medical, dental and vision protection) under this Article shall be entitled to continued benefits for the remainder of the original six (6) or eight (8) year program, whichever is applicable. For retirees who selected the full health and welfare benefits plan for six (6) years, the survivor benefits shall be limited to medical, dental and vision. For retirees who selected medical protection only for a period of eight (8) years, the survivor benefits shall be limited to medical Modified May 2002	49

only. In neither case shall the benefits include life insurance protection for the surviving spouse. This benefit of continued coverage for a surviving spouse and other eligible dependents, if any, shall only apply to unit members who retire and commence participation in the retirement health and welfare benefit program under this Article on or after October 1, 1985, and who die prior to termination of the program leaving a surviving spouse and other eligible dependents, if any.
13.1.7	For married couples both of whom are employed by the District, arrangements may be made at the time of retirement for the health and welfare benefits to be utilized in a consecutive manner rather than concurrently. In this way, the protection to be enjoyed by married retirees may be expanded to a maximum of twelve (12) years or sixteen (16) years depending upon the retirement option selected. Under these circumstances wherein unit members would seek to defer the engagement of benefits for a period of time not to exceed six (6) or eight (8) years due to eligibility under these provisions due to marriage, the District’s responsibility to pay for health and welfare benefits shall remain at the same dollar amount in effect at the time of retirement. When benefits are subsequently engaged by the retired bargaining unit member, the retiree would be responsible for paying the difference in the rates from the date of retirement to the commencement of the benefits. Once the retiree’s participation has commenced, the retiree’s contribution shall remain constant and any subsequent increases in the costs of the benefit programs would be borne by the District. It shall be expressly understood that life insurance protection under the district’s retirement plan shall not be included in this deferral program, and the life insurance coverage may exist during a concurrent period of time after the retirement of the married couple and under no circumstances shall this protection exceed the seventieth (70th) birthday of any participant.
13.1.8	For an employee, who is not qualified under Article 13.1.7, who is singularly employed by the District and who will be under continuous coverage through another health and welfare plan, may make arrangements at the time of retirement for the health and welfare benefits to be deferred to a future date. This date cannot extend beyond ten (10) years after retirement. Once the date for beginning health and welfare coverage is made, it shall be used in a consecutive Modified May 2002	50

manner. The retiree would be responsible for paying the difference in the rates from the date of retirement to the commencement of the benefits. When benefits are subsequently engaged by the retired bargaining unit member, the District shall pay only the total dollar amount that the District would have been responsible for if the Bargaining Unit Member had entered into the program at the time of retirement. It shall be expressly understood that life insurance protection under the District’s retirement plan shall not be included in this deferral program. The District shall maintain a list of deferred retirees. Thus accurate information will be readily available and can be given to each retiree who chooses to defer said benefits. Said list will be conveyed to the Association at biannual intervals.

The retiree shall notify the District annually of his/her desire to continue the performance of services. The District shall attempt to accommodate proposals by retirees regarding services to be rendered. Specific requests for pre-arranged periods of service shall receive careful consideration and be granted at the discretion of the District. Retirees shall share in the responsibility of arranging for periods of service to include as many days of participation, up to thirty (30) days annually, as the retiree desires to serve. The District shall only be responsible to make the thirty (30) days of ancillary services available to retirees; and in the event that the retiree elects to not work the full thirty (30) days annually, the District shall not be found at fault.
13.3.3.2	Thirty (30) days per year, at activities determined by the District, at a compensation rate that is equivalent to the per diem rate of the last year of service with the District, shall be made available to the retiree.

This Preparation Period Program for Grade 4 and 5 teachers will normally begin on the first day of the second week of school and will not be provided on minimum days.
15.5	Secondary bargaining unit members’ instructional responsibilities shall include
student contact assignments consisting of instruction which shall not exceed five (5) periods when organized in a 6-period day schedule. Bargaining unit members shall not normally be required to teach more than three (3) subjects during any semester. The District shall attempt to assign exceptions to the above on a seniority basis.
A.	Each site may elect to restructure the student contact assignment to provide planned instruction not normally to exceed 6 periods when organized in a 7 period day schedule. Restructuring to a 7 period day will require a three (3) year commitment and a vote of the faculty based on the following:
1.	The site administrator will provide a tentative proposal for implementation options under both 6 and 7 period day schedules for consideration by the faculty in the voting process. Elements of the tentative proposal will include, but not be limited to, the number of students per day, the length of instructional periods, proposed elective changes and possible assignment changes. Significant substantive changes in the proposal, which were or should have been predictable at the time of the vote, will provide a basis for grievance with the remedy limited to a required revote.
2.	66% positive vote of the certificated staff, conducted by FTA.
3.	After the 2000-2001 year, votes related to the implementation of the 7 period day shall be completed by February 15th.
B.	Each site may elect to reorganize instructional time, when appropriate to accommodate advisory or intervention programs designed to provide non-credit student services, such as academic programs or block scheduling. Reorganizing instructional day for the aforesaid purposes shall require a three (3) year commitment and a 66% positive vote of the faculty.

15.5.1 The District and the Association have agreed that, in certain situations, bargaining unit members in the secondary schools may teach an additional period and be compensated at an additional one-sixth (1/6) of the individual’s pro-rata rate of compensation. This payment could include pre-school preparation days and must include in-service/student non-attendance days and any other days when the teacher could have been responsible for the students (except where the unit member has made him/herself unavailable for service through leave of absence or other unavailability for duty which is not related to the use of sick leave, personal necessity leave, jury duty or mandated court appearance, bereavement or imminent death leave, or industrial leave or illness leave.)
The following rules shall be applied in determining under what circumstances an individual teacher may qualify for this arrangement; how the unit member shall be selected, and for how long the individual may participate in this arrangement.
15.5.1.1	. The District shall determine the staffing requirements at each secondary school and the administration shall make every effort to employ the number of qualified teachers needed to fill all positions vacant before any unit member may be used to teach any additional class.
15.5.1.2	The District shall not utilize this provision to replace or eliminate any teaching positions.
15.5.1.3	The assignment of unit members to the teaching of an additional period with the accompanying one-sixth (1/6) additional compensation shall be completely voluntary and shall not occur until the one-sixth (1/6) additional period opportunity has been announced or posted at the school for a period not less than 5 days. The following procedures shall be used for the assignment of such additional periods of instruction:
A. Additional periods, which have been projected for the subsequent school year, shall be posted at the school for five (5) days prior to June 15. All volunteers shall be listed and ranked in their departmental seniority order. Assignments shall be based on the following
criterion listed in rank order:

C.	Additional periods, which become available after twenty-five (25) days of student attendance, shall be assigned on the basis of availability to provide the required additional periods with the least disruption of the master schedule.
15.5.1.4	A unit member who teaches an additional class period shall do so for a maximum of one (1) year and preferably the assignment shall be limited to one (1) semester, when possible.
15.5.1.5	The unit member who teaches an additional class must have a daily preparation period and if it is at the end or beginning of the regular schedule, the individual shall be required to be present at the site.
15.5.1.6	The District shall make every effort to preclude the need for such additional assignments.
15.5.1.7	The District shall notify the Association whenever it becomes necessary to offer the individuals an additional class under the terms of this agreement.

15.6	When a school implements full inclusion with its special day class students, the
District will consider those students as part of the District ratio of that teacher’s class. Additionally, every effort will be made to have an additional adult (teacher or aide) in the classroom for the major portion of the day.
15.7	Elementary teachers of combination classes will be provided a salary stipend of
$500.00.
15.8	Unit members shall not be required to teach a split schedule.
15.9	Elementary bargaining unit members shall receive compensatory time whenever
instruction or supervision time is extended due to an “inclement weather” schedule. The site administrator, in the exercise of his sole discretion, will determine whether or not inclement weather exists. The site administrator shall establish an inclement weather schedule that defines the amount of compensatory time involved. Compensatory time shall be equal to actual additional instruction or supervision time. The compensatory time will be taken during the next available planning period. Each school will publish annually a written procedure for classroom coverage providing each regular classroom teacher or special education teacher a health and welfare break during inclement days when normal recess breaks have been canceled. For purposes of this plan the use of partner teacher or “buddy coverage” is one appropriate method.
15.10	The District may, from time to time, assign unit members duties which might extend beyond the normal professional day. Such duties and obligation include:
15.10.1	Faculty meetings shall not normally exceed one (1) hour in duration.

3.	Meetings which take place on release time.
4.	Contacts with Mentors/BTSA/PAR Teachers.
15.10.1.	1 The District shall, in collaboration with the FTA, establish a system to monitor and report on a quarterly basis (beginning January 30, 1999), the number and type of mandatory meetings affecting members of the certificated bargaining unit except those identified in items 1-4 above (15.10.1). On a quarterly basis, and at the request of the Association President or designee, the Superintendent or designee shall meet with the Association to discuss any specific concerns arising out of said reports. The District shall agree to reconsider language as proposed in 15.10.1 in the bargaining for the 1999/2000 year on the basis of information developed in this monitoring system.

inclement weather. A Joint Task Force was established to seek a timely and economic means to relieve elementary teachers from having to perform supervised duties during the day, except during inclement weather. As per the Joint Task Force and Memorandum of Understanding dated May 8, 1996, all Elementary School sites will be provided four (4) hours per day of student supervision support staff. None of the people employed shall work more than 2.75 hours per day. They will be paid at the same rate as Noon Duty/Breakfast Aide duty aides (minimum wage). Each school site will create their own plan for getting the optimum amount of student supervision time from those hired. The sole intent of this is to eliminate and/or reduce the maximum number of supervised duties certificated staff members have to do outside of the classroom. It is understood that a backup schedule will be in place in the event of an absence of these aides. The student supervision support staff shall be hired and trained for the opening of each site each year.
15.12	General supervision of student activities, such as dances, performances and athletic events, shall be voluntary to the extent possible.
15.13	At continuation high schools, teachers shall make home visits as part of the regular teaching assignment, provided the number of hours worked per day shall not exceed those of Fontana High School. Mileage for the use of personal automobiles in making home visits shall be reimbursed pursuant to Article 19. At the discretion of the site administrator teachers may be assigned to make routine phone calls to students regarding absence in lieu of home visits.
15.14	Bargaining unit members shall not normally be asked to substitute for other unit members. Secondary unit members, drawn from a pool of volunteers, shall be compensated for period substitutions at the rate of one (1) hour of certificated hourly rate for all period substitutions. Elementary unit members shall not normally be required to substitute for other unit members. In urgent circumstances, other certificated personnel may act as substitutes.

# hours sub x hourly rate to nearest half hour # of sub unit members
15.15	Persistent Vacancy
This agreement is established to provide services to students in classrooms where a persistent vacancy exists due to the district’ s inability to hire a qualified employee to provide the designated curriculum. In such a circumstance, existing agreements allow the district to use the l/6th contract extension to provide appropriate teacher staffing until the vacancy can be filled by hiring a qualified teacher. However, in some instances the l/6th contract extension cannot be used due to a variety of factors. In these instances a “persistent vacancy” may be declared in which it is anticipated that substitute teachers will be necessary for a lengthy period of time prior to filling the vacancy. When a “persistent vacancy” is declared, the following procedures may be used to alleviate the negative impact on students:
1.	Fully qualified teachers (with appropriate credentialing for the class/classes affected by the vacancy) will be offered the opportunity to accept additional assignments to prepare or advise on the preparation of lesson plans and to grade student work and /or assign term grades.
2.	Compensation for the duties indicated in clause l (above) shall be at the hourly per diem rate and shall be submitted on an hourly time sheet.
3.	The assignment of consultation on lesson plans or preparation of lesson plans will be authorized for not to exceed 3 hours per week (time submitted shall be actual time worked, not an automatic allocation for the assignment.)

However, all teachers will follow a common grading standard which shall reflect department standards or standards developed by the teacher assigned to the lesson planning function.
6.	Notwithstanding the above arrangements, whenever work assigned can be graded through computer scanning or with the use of an answer key, such work will be graded by the substitute teacher. In these cases the grades for each period of instruction shall be given to the teacher assigned to provide term grades for that class period and such grades shall be included in the computation of term grades.
7.	Selection of teachers for assignments pursuant to section 15.15 will be at the discretion of the site administrator.
15.16	The District agrees to meet and negotiate with the Association prior to the development of any plan to extend the instructional day.

15.20	Definitions - Classroom Sharing
1.	Roving Model: Roving is a system at the elementary level in which identified teachers move to a new classroom each time a track ends. At the secondary level roving is a system in which a teacher has no assigned classroom and teaches in two or more classrooms daily.
2.	Rotation Model: Rotation is a system in which Continuous Schools Program (CSP) teachers are organized in clusters and each teacher in the cluster moves to a new classroom at the end of each track.
15.20	.1 Every effort shall be made to exempt the following unit members from a required classroom share assignment: first year inexperienced unit members, SED and SH teachers and unit members who are referred PAR participants. In the event that the aforesaid bargaining unit members are required to participate in a classroom share arrangement they shall not be assigned to serve as the roving classroom in a roving model. Not withstanding the above, if a first year inexperienced teacher is assigned to rove due to the need to create the class or assign a teacher to the class after the beginning of the school year, the teacher shall be exempt from roving for the following school year.
15.20	.2 When overcrowding requires that more than one unit member be assigned to a classroom (except kindergarten and special education teachers providing pull out services) each CSP site or room sharing team shall decide annually between a roving or rotation model in an informal election conducted by the site administrator and the FTA building representative. The election shall be based on a plan for team assignments and facility assignments identified by the principal. In the event of a tie, the principal shall cast the deciding vote. If the FTA raises a challenge or concern to the validity of the vote, the Fontana Teachers Association shall be allowed to examine the ballots and/or re-conduct the vote as necessary.

Nonconsumable materials such as books, kits and materials shall be assigned to each classroom.
15.21	Secondary Rovers (6-12) Classroom Sharing
Volunteers shall be assigned first. After all volunteers have been utilized, further classroom sharing shall be equitably distributed. Every effort shall be made such that no unit member shall be required to classroom share two consecutive years/terms. Every effort shall be made such that no unit member shall be required to classroom share more than 2 periods per instructional day provided however that this requirement shall not be interpreted to require an increase in the number of roving teachers. Every effort shall be made to ensure the close proximity and subject compatibility of assigned rooms.

For CSP schools attending on a 175 day student calendar, the student contact times noted above shall be adjusted proportionately in accordance with the State waiver agreement which authorizes the 175 day school year for CSP (multi-track) school instead of the required 180 day school year for traditional and single track schools.
15.23.1.2 It is the intent of both parties that each school shall develop a plan to provide for a “health and welfare” break from student contact duties for each Kindergarten teacher approximately consistent to that available to teachers of grades 1-5. A variety of strategies may be used to implement such a release from student contact duties within the instruction day provided that the specific plan used by each school is approved by the district and is consistent with applicable law and policies of the Governing Board. In order to assist the schools in providing this break, the basic daily allocation of “yard duty” personnel to each school which is used to release teachers from daily “yard duty” assignments during student recesses shall be increased by 30 minutes (for a total of 4.5 hours).
15.23.2	OPTION ONE PROCEDURES
The district and association agree that the implementation of Class Size Reduction (CSR) strategies is a priority element of the educational program. It is, therefore, the intent of the district that schools, which have been able to implement Option 1 class size reduction programs due to available facilities, will not arbitrarily or capriciously eliminate such programs subject to the following conditions:

A.	All Kindergarten Option 1 program decisions are contingent on availability of
facilities. If facilities become unavailable due to enrollment, necessary movement or unavailability of facilities or safety or space requirements, the use of Option 1 in Kindergarten may have to be discontinued.
B.	The district will not approve arrangements whereby only some of the kindergarten
classrooms at any school are in planned Option 1 configurations. Absent extraordinary approved program arrangements, schools will be approved only for full implementation of Option 1 arrangements in all kindergarten classrooms.
15.23.3	OPTION TWO PROCEDURES
15.23.3.1	Option Two - Facilities
In the event the District finds it necessary to alter the kindergarten program from Option 1 to Option 2, the District will, to the extent possible, ensure that all kindergarten teachers are provided traditional kindergarten teaching facilities or locate their classrooms as close to restroom facilities and drinking fountains as feasible.
15.23.3.2	Minimum Day Compensation (Option Two)
Those Kindergarten teachers who are unable to be released from their “CSR time” obligations (100 minutes per day assignment to another Kindergarten class for class size reduction purposes or staggered day arrangements) will be compensated annually for two minimum days at per diem rate of pay for the end-of-semester minimum days which cannot be included in their workday.
Those Kindergarten teachers who can be released from the daily 100 minutes without violating the CSR requirements will be released from the “shared time” or other 100-minute instructional responsibility on the end-of-semester minimum days.

compensation for parent conferencing duties from 7.5 hours to 10 hours at per diem rate of pay. Basic Assignment Kindergarten teachers who have 20 or less students will be ineligible for additional compensation in connection with parent conferencing but will be released from their shared time or other 100 minute per day additional instructional responsibilities during the scheduled parent conference week. The only exception to this shall be Option 1 Basic Assignment Kindergarten teachers who have a required “CSR time” assignment in Kindergarten due to unusual circumstances.
The Basic Assignment Kindergarten Teacher will have the option of scheduling these parent conferences during any portion of their normal work day (excluding student contact time) and deferring duties normally performed in non-student contact hours to non-workday time and non-work locations. Notwithstanding such deferral or relocation of duties, each Basic Assignment Kindergarten Teacher will be allowed to submit the additional assignment time for parent conferences as indicated above.
15.23.3.4.1	Planning Procedures
The planning process is expected to be participatory involving the site administrator and kindergarten faculty. While all possible solutions and proposals shall be considered, the principal will have the final authority with regard to the models to be used at each individual school for the implementation of kindergarten class size reduction.
15.23.3.4.2	If a conflict occurs at a site which is not resolved by school site procedures, the FTA President and Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services, will meet with the administration and the planning committee of the school to discuss and consider the conflict. However, final approval of the kindergarten plan for each school will remain with the principal.
15.23.3.4.3	After each school has identified the model or models which will be used to implement class size reduction at that individual site, decisions with regard to the assignment of a CSR model to an individual teacher/classroom will be governed by the following:

Feasibility given scheduling, staffing, program elements, and other
restraints.
2.	A model will not be considered feasible if the use of that model in an individual assignment (grade level and track) requires that one currently-assigned teacher “bump” another currently-assigned teacher from his/her grade/track assignment.
3.	After feasibility issues have been resolved, if discretion exists with regard to the assignment of models to individual teachers, such assignment will be based on teacher preference. Teacher preference will be considered on the basis of:
(1) grade level seniority, (2) site seniority, (3) district seniority.
If an individual school has developed a viable model that is not contained in this agreement, the school will be given the opportunity to jointly consult with the FTA President and Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services. Should such model receive district approval, compensation will be proportionate based on the model contained in this agreement (using average increase in required student contact minutes as the basis for increased compensation), and the FTA President will have the power to agree to a compensation plan on behalf of the Association.
For Option 2 only, Basic Assignment Kindergarten Teachers and CSR Kindergarten Teachers will both be paid for an additional l hour per week joint planning period at their (per diem) hourly rate.
15.23.3.4.4	. The Option 2 models listed below and existing workday models will be used to accomplish kindergarten CSR. In individual classes where none of the existing or modified models will fully accomplish Option 2 requirements, class size reduction may be deferred for one year so that additional strategies can be researched and developed. The issue of feasibility will be analyzed solely on the basis of program facilities and scheduling.
Notwithstanding the above, the basic kindergarten workday, with 200 minutes of student contact time and 100 minutes shared time, will be a model used in all schools, even if

15.23.3.4.5	Kindergarten teachers who do not wish to participate in the specific plan developed by their site will have the option to consider requests for reassignment and transfer. Administrators are strongly encouraged to work cooperatively to resolve such situations.
If a kindergarten teacher does not wish to participate in the kindergarten CSR program, the administrator shall announce an anticipated kindergarten vacancy to all staff members and shall determine if reassignment to an existing or anticipated vacancy is appropriate, as per Article 8 of the Master Contract. If no appropriate vacancy is available at the current site, the kindergarten teacher may request transfer to an acceptable assignment at another site, as per Article 8 of the Master Contract.
15.23.3.4.6	The selection of the appropriate models for kindergarten CSR at each individual site will be an annual process, and decision-making described herein will take place at least on an annual basis.
15.23.3.5 Scope of Responsibility for Cooperating Teachers - The basic assignment kindergarten teacher, and Kindergarten CSR teacher(s) shall mutually develop a responsibility plan for implementing the language arts and mathematics portions of the kindergarten program.
If the parties are unable to come to consensus on an issue(s) they shall meet with the Site Administrator who will assist them on developing an acceptable plan. The Site Administrator shall give primary consideration to the continuity of the Basic Assignment Kindergarten Teacher’s program and classroom plan.
In the event a problem arises once the plan has been implemented, all parties will meet to resolve the plan. If mutual agreement, which is acceptable to the site administrators, cannot be reached, the site administrator will have the final authority to resolve disputes. Such resolution shall be reduced to writing.

15.23.4 Approved Models (Option 2)
NOTE:	In all models, student contact time while kindergarten classes are staffed at the 20:l
student/teacher ratio must be used in the language arts and mathematics programs.
Staggered Day Kindergarten Model
The staggered day kindergarten model requires only one teacher but accomplishes the 20:1 ratio by using a “staggered day” for students. A sample of such workday is indicated below:
SAMPLE WORKDAY:
7:30	Teacher arrival
8:00 - 9:40	Group 1 (language arts and math)
9:40	Group 2 arrives
9:40 - 9:55	Motor Skills and “Transition Time” for both groups together
9:40 - 12:00	Groups 1 & 2 together
11:15 - 11:55	Lunch (teacher and students)
11:55 - 12:00	Transition (exit Group 1)
12:00 - 1:40	Group 2
1:40 - 2:50	Teacher Prep and Unstructured Time
This model may have limited application because it requires that the kindergarten classroom be available for the full day without sharing.

ARTICLE 16 CLASS SIZE
16.1	The Association and the District will jointly establish a standing committee,
meeting on a monthly basis to monitor instances of excess class size at individual schools. The committee will agendize a review of specific site overloads on request. An overload is established when a class is in excess of the guidelines established in sections 16.2 and 16.3. Committee membership will include the Association president and one appointed representative of the Association, the Assistant Superintendent, Educational Services and the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel. When individual overloads are discussed, the site principal or designee and building representative will be ad hoc members of the committee.
The committee shall review the reasons for cases of excess class size limits, the alternatives available to alleviate the situation and make recommendations to the Superintendent for action. The committee will jointly develop a format for the reporting of cases reviewed and recommendations to the Superintendent.
The Superintendent shall state in writing her/his decision(s) and send copies to the Association, the principal of the affected school site and the teacher(s) involved.
The following staffing ratios shall go into effect as follows:
	1995-96	1996-97	1997-98
K - 5	30:1	30:1	29:1(a)
6 - 8	30:1	29:1	29:1
9 - 12	28:1	28:1	27:1(b)
Staffing ratio for Continuation High Schools to be 80% of enrollment staffed at 22:1			
(a)	As the cost for additional portables may make this proposal prohibitive, the District will work with the Association to lower class sizes.
(b)	This staffing ratio will be based on the estimated enrollment figures at the beginning of the second semester of each school year.
16.2	The following language will be implemented as of the beginning of second
semester of the 1998-99 school year.

The above class sizes apply to classes covered by the state-supported “Class Size
Reduction” program and these ratios will be automatically removed from the agreement if the state
withdraws the program.
The following classroom pupil-teacher ratios are agreed to as guidelines for
establishing reasonable student group compositions with classrooms:

**Maximum Class Size (for all regular classes with the exception of Physical Education) for Continuation High School per period to be 26 students in attendance.
**Maximum 5 period load will be 110 students in attendance per day.
(Note: **refers to the clause on page 79 at line 1 establishing the financial penalties for exceeding these maximums.)
The District will establish a committee to monitor class size in secondary physical education classes. The Association will appoint member(s) to serve on this committee.
(a) For teachers in grades K-5, should the District exceed a maximum of 33 students per class the remedy shall be financial compensation to the bargaining unit member based on a pro-rated per diem basis per student until the class no longer exceed the 33 maximum.

16.3	Non-academic secondary classrooms including, but not limited to, art, music, shop,
speech, business, home economics and physical education, shall comply to the physical facilities, supplies and equipment.
16.4	The class size committee will review efforts made by the District to maintain class
sizes at target ratios. Any class exceeding the target ratio for more than twenty (20) calendar days will automatically be referred to the Class Size Committee for review and possible resolution.
16.5	Continuation high school pupil-teacher ratio shall follow the requirements of the
California Education Code small school staffing formula.
16.6	The District may exceed the staffing ratios established in this Article when the
revenue from the State is reduced or other financial constraint makes the retention of these guidelines impossible.
16.7	Each school shall attempt to program students in such a manner as to equalize the
student group compositions within classrooms.

16.9	Understanding that the district now has a significant number of vacant positions in
RSP and SDC positions which have proven extremely difficult to staff with qualified employees and that recruitment efforts to fill these vacancies will continue to be an extremely high priority for the district, the Fontana Unified School District (“District”) and Fontana Teachers Association (“Association”) have agreed to the following measures to compensate bargaining unit members assigned to RSP or SDC positions for duties related to excess caseloads:
1.	For the purposes of this agreement the “basic caseload” will be 28 students for RSP and 18 students for SDC teachers. (Basic caseload for RSP teachers with extended-year Modified May 2002	79

2.	Acceptance of additional compensation/duties will be voluntary on the part of teachers.
3.	District and site administration will work with each school to develop a plan to alleviate student needs or compensate special education teachers assuming duties as a result of excess caseload. Compensation methods will include the use of 1/6th contract extension and hourly per diem rate compensation for additional duties with the proviso that no individual employee may receive both methods of compensation. Assessment duties in connection with the development or update of IEPs, IEP development, and related meetings will be compensable when performed for excess caseload students. Compensation for assessment or meetings in connection with student study team referrals is specifically excluded from this agreement.
4.	Where compensation is related to excess caseloads caused by vacant positions, see section 15.15.

Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall deduct one-tenth (1/10th) of such dues from the regular salary check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year.
18.1.2	Any unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of assigned duties, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the Association a fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments, payable to the Association in one (1) lump sum cash payment. In the event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the Association, the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in California Government and Education Code and the Educational Employment Relations Act.

26.1.1	Increase the certificated salary schedule by a cost-of-living adjustment of 3.44% retroactive to July 1, 2001. Said increase shall also apply to Schedule C and the certificated hourly rate.
26.1.2	The certificated hourly rate shall be $29.29 for the 2001-2002 school year.
The counselor hourly rate shall be $30.29 for the 2001-2002 school year.
26.2	EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS
26.2.1	For the plan year 10/1/01 through 9/30/02 the district shall pay the full cost of the Kaiser (HMO) Health Plan with ten dollar ($10) co-payment provisions or the Health Net (HMO) Medical Plan with ten dollar ($10) co-payment for office visits, five dollar ($5) co-payment for generic drugs, ten dollar ($10) co-payment for brand name drugs, and five dollar ($5) co-payment for chiropractic services based on the network provider options excluding Loma Linda providers. The premium shall be based on a super composite for all full-time employees. The excess cost over the Health Net (HMO) Medical Plan premium option with ten dollar ($10) co-payment for office visits, ten dollar ($10) co-payment for generic drugs, ten dollar ($10) co-payment for brand name drugs, and five dollar ($5) co-payment for chiropractic services shall be defrayed through the use of restructuring benefit funds from the 2000-2001 school year. (In the event that the District determines that the provision of the $10/$5/$10 Health Net co-payment plan is in violation of the District’s contract with the Kaiser Health Plan, and notwithstanding the above, the parties agree that the district-sponsored Health Net plan would revert to the $10/$10 co-payment identical to the Kaiser HMO program described above.)
26.2.1.1	Employees enrolled in the Health Net PPO Plan during the 2000-2001 school year shall be eligible to select the Health Net Elect (CDA) Plan. Eligible employees wishing to select the Health Net Elect Plan (with Loma Linda provider options) shall be subject to a five or twenty-

five dollar ($5/$25) co-payment for office visits and 80% hospitalization coverage to specified annual caps when using non-HMO network providers. The excess cost of the Health Net Elect Plan (with Loma Linda provider options) over the Health Net (HMO) premium option excluding Loma Linda providers shall be defrayed through the use of restructuring benefit funds from the 2000-2001 school year.
Any change in provider or substantial increase in premium will be subject to meet and negotiate. Any additional district funding provided to other bargaining units to defray increases in health and welfare benefits coverage will be provided in an equal sum to the certificated bargaining unit to replace the restructuring benefits funds used to defray additional costs in health and welfare benefits coverage for the 2001-2002 school year. In the event that the percentage of the bargaining unit enrolled in the Kaiser Health Plan increases by more than 1 percent above the percentage enrolled in the Kaiser Health Plan in the 2000-2001 year, such increased expenses to the District shall be deducted from any remaining restructuring benefits funds. Any shift in percentage enrollment from Kaiser to Health Net exceeding 1% of the bargaining unit will be recaptured in the same manner to the FTA restructuring benefits fund.
26.2.2	Employees with less than full-time contracts shall receive a prorated share for the plan chosen and shall be required to pay the balance of the super composite premium or 1, 2, or 3 party contract premium when required by the carrier through payroll deduction. In the event that carrier mandates require use of 1,2, 3 party contract premiums, the total of district-sponsored funds in the pro-rated share for affected bargaining unit members shall be pooled so that the balance remaining from members requiring 1 or 2 party contracts, maybe applied to defray excess costs of 3 party contracts.
An exception to this procedure may be established in the case of shared contracts pursuant to Article 24.4.2 that provides for the contracting parties to divide the policies without cost sharing by either party.

necessary or appropriate, other models as indicated below may be used. In calculating all ratios indicated below, a Referred Participating Teacher shall be deemed to have a weight of 2.
B.	Full-Release Model
1.	Each Full Release Consulting Teacher model shall serve a 192-day, “flexible” calendar while in the position of Consulting Teacher. Days of work shall be defined as an 8-hour day. Compensation for this expanded work year will be a .13 factor based on the individual bargaining unit member’s placement on the certificated salary schedule. Hours in excess of 8-hours per day shall be approved by the Joint Committee and compensated at certificated hourly rate.
2.	Each Full Release Consulting Teacher shall be assigned no more than the equivalent of 15 Participating Teachers. No Full-Release Consulting Teacher shall be assigned more than five (5) Referred Participating Teachers.

4.	If, given fiscal constraints, the district finds it necessary to implement the full-release model with 182 day work year and a "6-hour" workday, the Joint Committee will establish and monitor adjustments in the caseload (number of teachers served) and the expected number of direct hours of service per participant. This full-release configuration will provide the Consulting Teacher the ability to schedule observations and meetings for teachers served within the parameters of the normal school day, subject to approval of the Consulting Teacher supervisor. In addition, the Consulting Teacher will be allowed to schedule the 182 day work year, with approval of the Consulting Teacher supervisor, to meet the needs of both the teachers served and the Consulting Teacher.

2.	Each Half-Contract Consulting Teacher will be assigned no more than the equivalent of seven (7) Participating Teachers. No Half-Contract Consulting Teacher shall be assigned more than two (2) Referred Participating Teachers.

When an individual teacher serves as a Consulting Teacher in this model, compensation shall be $5,000.00 for 125 hours of direct services. Each Stipend Model Consulting Teacher will be assigned to no more than two (2)

ROTC STAFF “STIPEND ADJUSTMENTS”
Whereas, members of the ROTC staff have, by long-standing past practice, received their cost-of-living salary adjustments on the basis of the Department of Defense adjustment which is usually established in January of each year, and
Whereas, the FTA has agreed that this practice is acceptable given the unique salary structure which must be used for compensation of ROTC staff members and the unique work year for these employees, and
Whereas, the “stipend” portion of salary received by ROTC members was established as an offset to net income losses which would otherwise be experienced by ROTC staff when they accept this position, and
Whereas, the “stipend” portion of salary has not been adjusted by annual cost-of-living adjustments through what appears to be an oversight or misunderstanding by all parties.
Now, therefore, it is agreed and understood by the parties as follows:
1.	Effective July 1, 1998 the “stipend” portion of ROTC staff members’ salaries will be adjusted from $6,000 to $6,600 annually for Associate Instructors and from $7,200 to $7,920 annually for Instructors.
2.	The “stipend” portion of salary shall be adjusted annually at the same rate as the Department of Defense cost-of-living adjustment which is applied to the salary pursuant to notification from the Department of Defense.

APPENDIX D-1 DEVELOPMENT CENTER SALARY SCHEDULE (Permit Teachers)

This service credit will be granted for all service rather than only Post-B.A. service.
When there is a 35% attrition of the workforce hired prior to this agreement, Step 6 & 7 will be added to the final column.
Current salary schedules for employees hired prior to May 17, 2000 are found in Appendix D-2.
Current salary schedules for employees hired after May 17, 2000 are found in Appendix D-2.

The above salary schedule is based on a work year of one hundred eighty-two (182) days with one hundred eighty (180) days of pupil instruction. Each salary schedule derived on this agreement shall identify a specific number of workdays and shall provide two (2) days annually of fully paid teacher preparation or staff development time.
Summer school employment shall be voluntary and shall be compensated at the certificated hourly rate.
CLASS AND STEP PLACEMENT ON TEACHERS SALARY SCHEDULE FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT BARGAINING UNIT MEMBERS SELECTED TO BECOME CERTIFICATED TEACHERS
FUSD Child Development, Pre-school and Day Care teachers selected for employment as a K-12 teacher will have the opportunity to move into K-12 vacancies. Bargaining unit members selected for employment under this provision must meet minimum qualifications to be fully credentialed. When there is a planned reduction in force in the Child Development Department, bargaining unit members will need to meet only the minimum requirements of an emergency credential to be eligible for consideration.
Placement on the salary schedule will not result in a cut in pay. Salary Placement will ensure that annual compensation will not be less than the amount employees would have earned had they remained in their current positions within the Child Development Department. When initial placement results in a bargaining unit member being placed at a rate of pay higher than what he/she would have earned in their current position, movement will not be allowed to a higher class until units have been earned consistent with placement on the salary schedule as a fully credentialed teacher. However, step movement will be allowed consistent with the current salary schedule.
