Within five (5) working days following presentation of the written grievance to the Cell Manager, the grievant(s) and appropriate area Steward will meet with the Cell Manager and attempt to settle the dispute. If no settlement is reached within this five (5) day period, the Cell Manager shall provide the Steward with the Company’s Step Two answer, explaining the Company’s position within five (5) working days.
Step Three
If no settlement is reached in Step Two, the Union’s Business Representative may present a written request for a Step Three meeting.

The parties shall then meet promptly to discuss the grievance and attempt to resolve it.

Step Four
If no settlement is reached in Step Three, the Secretary/Treasurer of the Local Union, or his/her designee, may present a written demand for arbitration to the Company’s Director of Human Resouces within ten (10) days after the Step Three answer has been given.
6
Section 7.03 Retroactivity.
Employees will be entitled to full retroactivity provided they file a grievance as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than seven (7) work days after its occurrence.
However, if an employee should file a grievance after the above stated period, the employee will be entitled to not more than seven (7) work days retroactivity.

Section 7.04 Witnesses
The Union and the Company shall have the right to call witnesses at any step of the grievance procedure.
Section 7.05
Meetings - Pay

Section 7.07

7
to the next Step if the Company’s answer is not received within the designated time limits.
ARTICLE a ARBITRATION
Section 8.01 Selection of Arbitrators The Company and Union shall each select a representative within ten (10) working days after receipt of the written request to arbitrate. An arbitrator shall then be selected and assigned within this ten (10) day period in accordance with, the procedure described in this Article:
(a)	The parties will select an arbitrator from a panel of arbitrators mutually agreed upon by the parties.
(b)	For the duration of this Agreement, unless modified by mutual consent, the panel of Arbitrators, and order of selection are:
(1)	Aaron Wolff
(2)	Herbert Berman
(3)	Steven Briggs
(4)	Robert McAllister
(5)	Randi Hammer Abramsky
(c)	For each grievance that is submitted to arbitration, the parties shall refer grievances to the first available arbitrator on the panel on a rotating basis.
(d)	In the event that multiple cases have been sent to the Company in which arbitration was demanded, the date upon which the arbitration was demanded will be controlling in determining which arbitrator will be designated to hear that case upon the rotating basis. In the event that multiple cases are sent to the Company where arbitration was demanded on the same day, the date upon which the grievance was filed will be controlling in determining which arbitrator will be selected from the list. In the event that multiple cases are submitted to the Company where the arbitration demand date and the grievance filing dates are the same, the parties will flip a coin to determine which action shall proceed first.
(e)	Grievances referred to arbitration involving discharge and suspensions over ten (10) days shall be assigned prior to any other grievances.
(f)	The party demanding arbitration is the moving party and carries the burden of going forward in selecting and assigning an arbitrator. Once an arbitrator
8
has been selected and assigned, the moving party shall notify the arbitrator within ten (10) working days, in writing, of his assignment and request dates for a hearing.
(g)	The arbitrator shall schedule a hearing to commence within forty-five (45) days of his/her assignment. If the arbitrator is unable to schedule the hearing within this time frame, either party has the right to have the case reassigned to the next available arbitrator on the panel. If none of the panel arbitrators are able to schedule the hearing as required, then either party may request the American Arbitration Association to assign an arbitrator who: resides in the Chicago area; is a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators; and is able to schedule the hearing as required by this Agreement.
Section 8.02 Payment of Arbitration
The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on both parties and the expense of the arbitrator and the hearing room, if any, shall be shared by both parties. Each party will pay its own participants at the arbitration.
Section 8.03 Arbitrator’s Powers
It is further mutually agreed that the arbitrator shall have only the power to determine the meaning and application of this Agreement, and to grant such remedy as may be appropriate consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

The parties recognize that because of the nature of the operation, it is necessary to temporarily assign employees to the performance of work in a job other than the one in which they are regularly assigned or to shifts other than the one that they are normally assigned for a period of up to ninety (90) calendar days. In the event it becomes necessary to temporarily assign employees as a result of fluctuation or fractional manpower requirements, however, this does not include the situation as defined in Section 9.11 (A), or for such reasons as but not limited to absenteeism, vacations or leaves of absence, the employee with the highest seniority in the same cell desiring the job will be temporarily assigned to work. In the event the temporary vacancy is not filled in the above manner, then the employee with the lowest seniority in the cell who is qualified to perform the work will be temporarily assigned to the work. This assignment will be contingent on skill and ability to perform the work, and the employee will be returned to his/her regular job should he/she be unable to do the work. If it is necessary to add additional employees to a cell on a temporary basis, they usually will be provided from the least senior employees of other cells provided
15
they can satisfactorily perform the work. On occasion the Company may decide it is advisable to temporarily assign an employee to a job in a lower job group.
Section 9.11	(A) Transfer Downgrading
In case of transfer or downgrading to avoid layoff as a result of job elimination or production requirements, the adjustment of personnel within a cell shall be made in accordance with the seniority provisions of Section 9.05.

Layoff
In the event a layoff becomes necessary, affected employees in the affected cell who have less than five (5) years of service will be placed directly on layoff, provided other senior employees are capable of performing their work. With the completion of this movement, the layoff process will continue as follows:
The number of affected positions in the affected cell to be reduced will be identified. A like number of least senior non-skilled employees working in the affected cell, regardless of home cell, will be designated to be laid off, employing the “shuffle” principles, if necessary, outlined in the Letter of Understanding concerning Job Consolidation signed and dated April 8, 1998. With the completion of this movement, bump options will be as follows for displaced employees:
1.	Any least senior position in the affected cell, provided the employee can perform the job within several hours.
2.	Least senior in job, facility-wide.
3.	Any least senior position in the job group, provided the employee can perform the job within several hours.
4.	Least senior five (5) non-skilled in the facility.
“	5. Any open or temporary job.
Skilled employees working in the affected cell, regardless of home cell, either affected or bumped, will have the following bump options:
Any least senior position in the affected cell, provided the employee can perform the job within several hours.
1.	Least senior in job, facility-wide.
2.	Any least senior position in the job group, provided the employee can perform the job within several hours.
16
3.	Least senior five (5) non-skilled in the facility.

In order to manage the layoff/recall process and minimize the impact of unnecessary movement of employees, the Company reserves the right to schedule an annual two (2) week partial or total shutdown per work cell. (With the option of at least one week scheduled on a cell-by-cell basis during the year-end holiday period.) The Holiday Eligibility requirements as set forth in Section 13.02 of the current labor contract shall remain in full force and effect.
If an entire cell is shutdown, then employees with five (5) or more years of seniority will be allowed to bump into one of the jobs of the five least senior employees in any other cell as long as they are more senior than the employees being bumped and capable of satisfactorily performing the job within several hours without being trained. Those employees who are unable to bump or who choose not to bump will be placed on layoff to the street. This section shall apply to all layoffs in excess of four weeks.
Section 9.11 (C) Temporary Layoff If, in the discretion of the Company, conditions arise which necessitate work going down temporarily in one or more jobs within a cell, temporary layoffs of up to four (4) weeks shall be permitted. During any contract year no regular employee may be temporarily laid off for an accumulated period greater than four (4) weeks. These temporary layoffs may be made without application of the general layoff and seniority provisions herein except that employees with more than 15 years facility seniority shall not be subject to temporary layoffs.
Temporarily laid off regular employees may bump any of the five (5) most recently hired temporary employees, provided the regular employee is capable of satisfactorily performing the work in question. If the regular employee successfully bumps the temporary employee, the regular employee will assume the applicable job group rate for the work being performed if the job group is different from his/her own assigned job group, and perform work as assigned. If the regular employee bumps a temporary employee within the regular employee's assigned job group, the regular employee will be paid the rate of the job group or his/her Red Circle Rate, whichever is higher. A regular employee, who once commits to a temporary assignment, must complete that entire assignment and may not during the temporary assignment exercise a right to layoff.
17
Section 9.11 (D) Temporary Shutdown A line or job within a cell may be shut down for as long as six (6) work days for machine repairs, lack of production, new method of implementation, and any other conditions that may arise and the affected employees of the line or job will be utilized at the Company’s discretion before the Company reassigns the affected employees according to seniority in accordance with Section 9.05.
Section 9.11 (E) Permanent Job Elimination When an employee is displaced by the permanent elimination of the permanent job to which the employee is assigned, the employee shall be paid the earnings of the new job or the earnings of the eliminated job, whichever are highest. This Section will only apply to the employee affected and only for a period often (10) work days.
Section 9.12
Recall
Employees subject to recall after layoff will be notified by letter sent to the last known address of the employee with the understanding that failure to keep the Company advised of their latest address shall be no excuse for non-receipt of such notice. The employee, will be given five (5) work days after the notice is mailed to return to work. However, it is understood that each employee must notify the Company forty-eight (48) hours prior to returning of his/her intent to report to work, or the employee will be considered as having quit.
When recalls commence:
1.	Openings will be offered by seniority to all employees working in the facility holding the needed job who belong to the work cell where the opening has occurred, but not working in the needed job or not working in their home work cell.
2.	Following the above movement, employees on layoff will be recalled according to the employee’s seniority, into any cell, as expressed on the “Layoff/Recall Option” form completed by the employee at the time of layoff.

18
business for those employees who have established seniority before any new employees are hired.

Whenever possible, the Company will provide the Union a copy of both the layoff and recall lists and if time does not permit the publication of the lists, the Union will be notified verbally.

When the Company deems it necessary to fill a supervisory vacancy due to vacation, illness, leave of absence, or other temporary absence of a regular supervisor, assistant manager, or manager; or due to an increase of production not to exceed six (6) months, the company may select an employee to serve in the capacity
19
of relief supervisor to carry out the temporary assignment. The Company shall notify the Union of relief supervisors who are serving due to an increase in production.
