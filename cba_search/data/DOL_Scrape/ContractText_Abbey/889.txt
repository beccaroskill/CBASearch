The function of the team will be to assist and guide the process of implementing team concept by:
•	helping employees understand team concept;
•	assist in the planning of training necessary for implementation;
•	devising feedback and evaluation methods;
•	discussing problem areas of implementation and suggest alternatives;
•	identifying on-going communication methods to promote understanding of the concept;

•	to act as a resource to expand the concept to the fullest potential.
Both the Company and the Union recognize the successful implementation of team concepts must be an on-going collaborative effort. To that end, the team will continue to meet on a regular basis providing guidance until such team concepts are firmly understood and practiced throughout the mill.
The committee will revisit, refine and reinstate the current Team Concept plans. In addition the committee will address those flexibility issues raised by the company at these discussions, as well as any other issues referred to the committee by the company.
This concept will be subject to review by representatives of the International Unions and the HR Manufacturing Director. This group will be provided with monthly progress reports from a local monitoring group comprised of one representative from each of the local unions and four local management representatives during the first 6 months of implementation. Thereafter, quarterly progress reports from the local monitoring group will be provided. If requested by either party, the HR Manufacturing Director will meet with Internationa! Representatives and the local monitoring group to discuss concerns or issues.
'' Examples of issues (not all inclusive) that will be discussed are as follows:
•	Supercalendar roll changes: E/I, operators (or others) to assist with roll changes
•	Operators change rolls at 6A&B Supers
•	Add remote controls for all bridge cranes and operate from the floor by any trained person
•	Magazine loaders grease excavators and perform minor maintenance and assist maintenance on major repairs.

The following new subsection 22.6 will be incorporated into the Memorandum of Agreement:
“22.6 Effective 1/1/2005 the cost of the 12 hour shift schedule will become neutral to the 8 hour shift schedules in place previously. To accomplish this, a 12-hour rate deck will be established for all wage rates shown in Appendix A of the current collective bargaining agreement. The 12-hour rate will be calculated by multiplying the current wage rate by 0.9773. Any employee working a 12-hour schedule will be paid the 12-hour rate for hours worked.”

HOURLY INCENTIVE PLAN
Preamble:
The Bucksport mill Hourly Incentive Plan is unique to the financial situation at the Bucksport mill. Active hourly employees will participate in this plan during the term of the extended agreement. The Company retains the right to modify the safety and financial budgets on an annual basis.
Plan Design:
For the plan to payout, all 3 conditions below must be met:
I.	Must meet safety performance rate hurdle (for 2004 hurdle is 3.4 TIR).
II.	Nominal (actual) ROI must be greater than budget (for 2004 budget is 2.1%).
III.	Payout - 15% of the gain above the current year price neutral budget
Notes:
1.	Current year price neutral budget excludes the impact of sales price and purchased pulp price. Payments will be made quarterly. Maximum employee payout will not exceed 3% of W-2 earnings.
2.	Only active hourly employees are eligible for the plan.
3.	Safety and financial budgets to be adjusted annually by the Company.
Examples:
1.	If actual ROI is 1.8% and price neutral EBIT improvement gain is $3.13 MM (see next page), then payout is zero due to not meeting second hurdle.
2.	If actual ROI is 2.5% and price neutral gain is $3.13 MM, then payout is 1% of wages (see next page for various scenarios)

The rate so determined shall be made effective not later than thirty (30) days after the job started.

Examples include the restructure of the Off Machine Coater line of progression, the reduction in force in the Finishing department, the reduction in force in the Mechanical Maintenance department, and the restructure of work in the Switch Room. It is agreed that these examples are not violations of the labor agreement.

VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE
Notes: This offer is on a non-precedent setting basis.
It must be understood that the Company cannot deplete critical skills within a given department or line ofprogression/classification. Therefore, the specific guidelines below will be followed for the consideration of candidates for such a “voluntary severance” program.
Voluntary severance packages will be offered within the affected department first. Management will determine the maximum number per line of progression (LOP) and/or department to be determined based upon need to maintain operations.
All those interested in participating in the voluntary severance program will complete a form in the human resources department. Any employee who chooses to participate and is approved for a severance package will be considered a voluntary resignation and will not have any recall rights for future employment at the Bucksport mill.
Any employee who requests and is approved by the Company for the “voluntary” severance program will be released by the Company as soon as practical. However, the services of some employees who are approved for the “voluntary” severance program may be required for training and other transitional work past the period the announced changes are made. The Company retains the right to determine and/or change the actual termination dates. The Company will not rescind an approved voluntary severance package in the 90-day period prior to the planned voluntary retirement date occurring under Quantum Leap.
11/6/2002

Page 2 of 4
COMPANY BEST OFFER
Any employee who is approved for the “voluntary severance” program who leaves the employment of the mill before he/she is released by the Company will forfeit his/her “voluntary severance” payments.
The only way the Company will approve a severance package is when an employee’s employment is terminated under Quantum Leap and results in a headcount reduction. If attrition occurs in other ways, no additional severance packages will be offered.
INVOLUNTARY SEVERANCE
If an employee’s employment is involuntarily terminated under Quantum Leap and results in a headcount reduction, this enhanced severance package will be offered. Any employee who chooses to participate in, and is approved for, an enhanced severance package will be considered a voluntary resignation and will not have any recall rights for future employment at the Bucksport mill. Any employee who chooses not to participate in the enhanced severance package will be considered a layoff per the labor agreement and will have recall rights as set forth in Section 7.11.
SEVERANCE CALCULATION
The Company will use the following to calculate severance payments.
ENHANCED FORMULA (Whichever is higher)
2000 or 2001 or Previous Full Year W-2 Earnings x 3% x years of service
Or
40 Hours x Employee Card Rate x 52 Weeks x3%x years of service (only for those employees whose W-2 earnings were negatively impacted by layoff or approved leave)
RETIREMENT
To employees electing voluntary severance and who are pension eligible as provided for in the labor agreement, the Company will add $100.00 per month lifetime supplement.
MEDICAL COVERAGE
Per the provision of Section 18.4 of the current labor agreement, employees retiring between the age of 55 and 65 will be able to continue their group medical insurance until they are eligible for Medicare and will be required to contribute a percentage of the cost of such coverage based upon service and age in accordance with the schedule as outlined on page 23.
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Employees and their immediate family as defined in the EAP program will be eligible to utilize the services of the Company’s Employee Assistance Program. An employee will have EAP coverage for three months from the date of his/her termination,
RED CIRCLE RATE PROTECTION
The Company will offer on a non-precedent setting basis the following regarding the concept of red circle of rates for employees reassigned as a result of actions taken under Quantum Leap.
An employee who is reassigned as a result of the job eliminations, will, for the remaining time of the current Labor Agreement following such reassignment receive his/her former regular rate at the time of the reassignment, unless the employee is set up, scheduled or promoted to a job paying more than the former regular rate in which event the employee will be paid the higher job rate.
11/6/2002
11:55 AM
Page 3 of 4
COMPANY BEST OFFER
The red circling of rates will end no later than 4/30/2005.
Note: Provisions of the multi-local bargaining unit (Section 15.8) apply to the red circling rate provisions above.
ATTRITION PROVISION
For the first 100 positions eliminated, up to 30 of those positions can be attrited naturally without providing severance packages. For additional position eliminations above 100, all can be attrited naturally, without providing severance packages.
Note: Not filling an existing vacancy or job opening does not count toward our minimum headcount reduction of 100 hourly employees.

SECTION 7	Seniority
7.1	All new employees shall serve a probationary period of2,000 hours worked or one (1) year of employment, whichever comes last, and shall not accrue seniority during that period.
Employees will be eligible for all other negotiated benefits after (480) hours worked.
Employees serving a New Hire Probationary period are not allowed to bid on regular classified positions, but are subject to assignment if there are no qualified applicants. During said probationary period, the Company may, at its option, lay off or dismiss said probationary employees and such employees shall not have recourse to the grievance procedure. Employees retained at the expiration of the probationary period shall become regular employees and shall be credited with seniority from the date of hire. A new employee shall mean a person with no previous employment with the Signatory Company or a person rehired after a discharge or voluntary separation.
7.2	For the purpose of this Agreement, there shall be four types of seniority: Job, Department, Mill and Company.
1.	JOB OR CRAFT SENIORITY is defined as the date of assignment to their current job or craft.
2.	DEPARTMENT SENIORITY is defined as the date of permanent assignment to a department.
3.	MILL SENIORITY is defined as the time an employee is a member of the bargaining unit. 4. COMPANY SENIORITY is defined as the date of employment with the Company. For the purpose of this Agreement, there shall be three types of employees: Temporary, Probationary and Regular.
1.	TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE:
•	Temporary employee is defined as a person who may be employed for summer vacation replacements.
•	Temporary employee(s) may also be employed for specific periods of time by mutual
6
consent
•	Temporary employee(s) will not accrue seniority.
No temporary employee will become a regular employee unless they are hired as a regular employee and complete a new probationary period.
2.	PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE is defined as an employee hired with the intent to become a regular.
3.	REGULAR EMPLOYEE is defined as an employee who has completed his probationary period.
7.3	A permanent vacancy will be filled, if possible, first from within the department. Apprentice vacancies are excluded. Secondly, effective May 1,2001 bottom jobs in departments and deadend jobs not filled within the department, as well as GMS vacancies, shall be posted mill-wide. For bidding purposes GMS is considered a separate department. It is understood that departmental pools are considered as bottom jobs in the departments. The bid will be posted for seven days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). Employees can submit bids at the Human Resources Department during the posted period.
The successfill bidder will not be held in their department more than 28 calendar days, from the date the bid is awarded. In a meeting with the local(s) involved, deviations may be made by mutual agreement.
It is agreed to give each of the union Presidents copies of the millwide job postings when they are posted and at the end of the bidding process indicating who were the top 3 candidates for the position and who the successful bidder was replacing in that department.
7.4	An employee may not successfully bid more than twice per contract year. This does not include permanent setups in a line of progression.
7.5	Employees may indicate to the Human Resources Department prior to leaving on vacation those jobs in which they have interest. The job posted will be awarded to the senior qualified bidder. Mill seniority shall be the seniority used in such situations.
Determining qualifications - Set up a process in each department to determine qualifications for entry level and special jobs. The process would be reached by mutual agreement between company and the union(s) holding jurisdiction over the job. Factors such as experience in work directly applicable to the job being filled, training which bears directly on the job being filled, etc. may be considered.
In the event a reasonable disagreement about the senior applicant’s qualifications exists, he/she will be offered a trial period.
7.6	The probationary period, referenced in 7.9 below, shall apply should the employee decide to return to his former job without loss of seniority and will also apply should the Company need to remove the employee because of failure to qualify. Before such action is taken the employee and Union will be notified.
7.7	Bids will not be accepted from an employee who is on a probationary period in their current job.
7
7.8	Employees laid off from a department will revert to spare list in accordance with mill seniority except as provided for in Local 1 -1188's Recognized Agreement No. 2.
7.9	In cases of transfers from one department to another the Company will be allowed 240 hours worked to determine whether or not the transferred individual can do the work. In the event that it is decided the individual cannot do the work, or does not want the job, they shall be returned to their former department with no loss of seniority. Should the company disqualify the employee from a job/department which provides greater than a 240 work hour probationary period, the employee shall be returned to his/her former department/job without loss of seniority. Upon completion of the probationary period, said individual shall lose seniority in their former department and start accumulating seniority in the new department from the date on the bid. The probationary period in newly created departments will be worked out with the Union(s) involved.
It is understood that deviations from the above may be made by mutual agreement of the local(s) involved.
7.10	If employees are promoted, those older in point of service and properly qualified have preference. In the event of a layoff, the employees with the least department seniority shall be the first laid off in each department and snail be returned to work in reverse order.
7.11	Seniority referenced in this section shall refer to Mill Seniority as defined in Section 7.2. If an employee with one (1) year seniority or less is laid off for less than twelve (12) months due to lack of work, their seniority remains unbroken. If an employee with more than one (1) year seniority is laid off for less than eighteen (18) months due to lack of work, their seniority remains unbroken. If more than twelve (12).months or eighteen (18) months respectively, their seniority starts anew. If an employee is recalled and offered employment at their regular kind of work within the twelve (12) month or eighteen (18) month period respectively, and does not report, their seniority will be broken.
7.12	In the event of a temporary curtailment of operations which does not exceed sixteen (16) continuous days, the following guidelines are established to Local 1-1188 and the E&I Department.
1.	Every reasonable effort will be made to give people time off during the curtailment if they request it. Scheduled vacations will be honored first.
2,	Positions will be filled by department seniority with the employees following their own crews, when possible. Seniority means most senior qualified.
3.	No employee will be scheduled for more hours than they would normally be scheduled. Qualified Day Workers who bump to a Tour Crew will work the crews’ schedule and visa versa.
4.	Employees scheduled in accordance with paragraph 2 and 3 will not be scheduled to work additional hours until all qualified department employees not scheduled have an opportunity to be scheduled.
5.	Unanticipated openings will be offered to the most senior qualified person not scheduled per paragraph 2,3 or 4.

I.	TWELVE-HOUR SHIFT OPERATIONS TEMPORARY VACANCY PROCEDURE
I. If a vacancy exists and the supervisor determines that it needs to be filled and it cannot be filled on a straight time basis, the following overtime procedure will apply:
For those departments without a vacancy procedure in the Department Redesign Agreement the following provisions will apply:
A.	SCHEDULED VACANCIES
1.	Scheduled vacancies will be filled from the sign-up sheet. It will be the responsibility of each employee to sign up for their preference of day off and shift they will be available to work. When the schedule is made out, those employees on the sign-up sheet will be used to fill vacancies based on seniority and qualifications. It will be the responsibility of the employee to check the schedule and report to work as scheduled.
2.	If no employee has volunteered to fill a vacancy, the unrelieved employee can be required to work a double if they have the next day off.
3.	If the above steps fail to fill the vacancy, set the crew up as far as possible and then draft the junior-qualified employee on his/her day(s) off; except that those employees on their Monday day off between the three day shifts and three night shifts can be drafted only as a last resort.
4.	The unrelieved employee will be given a reasonable opportunity to secure an available qualified relief. Management approval is required.
B.	UNSCHEDULED VACANCIES
1.	Employees not relieved have the option to work if the double shift is followed by a day off.
2.	Offer the double shift to employees on tour by seniority and qualification if the double shift
37
is followed by a day off.
3.	Offer the overtime to employees who have signed up to work their day off using seniority and qualifications.
4.	If the vacancy is still not filled, the employee on the shift and an employee coming in on the shift following the vacant shift may split the double. This would result in 18 consecutive hours for each employee
5.	If the above steps fail to fill the vacancy, set the crew up as far as possible and draft the junior-qualified employee on his/her day(s) off; except that those employees on their Monday day off between the three day shifts and three night shifts can be drafted only as a last resort.

It should be remembered that swaps are allowed as a convenience to our employees, and if serious problems arise as a result of them, we will have to take steps necessary to correct the situation.
Daily or weekly swaps in the Production Department have to be approved by Management. When a swap takes place, the two (2) people that swap will each take the other’s seniority for set up purposes. If one or the other is not qualified for the upgrade, the next senior qualified person will take the upgrade and will be the only one paid for that upgrade.

No. 8 RESTRICTED DUTY POLICY
Restricted Duty Policy for Workers’ Compensation Short and Long Term Disability (accident & sickness insurance)
A joint task force was formed to develop an effective restricted duty program that will be good for our employees and the operation.
"Rights and duties hereunder provided under this agreement shall in no way diminish, shorten, waive or adversely affect in any fashion the rights of the employer to offer or assign any suitable work or
45
the rights of a restricted worker to employment or reemployment under the Maine Workers' Compensation Law and/or any other applicable law."
Attached are these guidelines. They have been mutually agreed to by local management, PACE Local 1-1188 and 1-0261, IAM&AW Lodge 1821, and IBEW 1777. Changes to these guidelines will be by mutual agreement.
The guidelines are a road map for both Management and Unions in the return to work process of restricted employees.
The Company, specific Unions involved and employees will mutually agree on restricted duty assignment. If the Parties fail to reach mutual agreement, neither the Company, Union or Employee will forfeit any of the rights it had prior to this agreement with respect to appropriate workers' compensation or disability payments. The Parties recognize the final decision must conform to applicable State and Federal law. Each case will be handled on an individual basis.
The three (3) steps of restricted duty are as follows:
Short Term (can return to regular duty within 60 days)
* A seed list has been included to help stimulate departmental ideas.
Long Term A (will take greater than 60 days to return to regular duty)
Long Term B (will not be able to return to a regular job in their department and recovery is not expected)
In addition to the overall guidelines, the following agreements have been reached:
A.	Additions to or deletions from the established Alternative Jobs will be made by mutual agreement (management/locals).
B.	Employees on Long Term Restricted Duty who cannot work within their own local may be assigned work within another local provided there is mutual agreement between the two locals.
C.	In case of conflict in medical opinions there will be no change in restricted duty (classification) until resolved through provisions of the compensation act.
It is the suggestion of this task force that education of both management and union officials is critical prior to starting and/or implementing this new program. We would also recommend that, should problems arise, this task force reconvene to correct or resolve those issues.

NO. 9 TEAM CONCEPT
The existing Labor Agreement will be revised to the extent necessary to reflect the provisions of these proposals.
I.	TEAM OPERATIONS CONCEPT
A.	It is not the intent of this concept to change the duties of the job classifications and it is generally accepted that employees normally perform tasks more skillfully within their classified job and progression line. However, to achieve optimum utilization of manpower and skills, employees may be assigned to perform tasks outside their normal job duties.
B.	The mill lines of progression and operating departments staffed by crews, who, under the Team Operations Support Concept, work as teams assisting each other in accomplishing their assigned tasks and responsibilities. Team members are trained in various operational duties and tasks within their department, or line of progression, or other departments to enable them to assist each other and work as a team. Assisting in other departments will be limited to assignments in departments adjacent to the employee's department. In order to allow for this team work concept, there shall be no classification restriction between jobs in a department or job in line of progression. As operating conditions warrant, employees may be given assignments which are customarily performed by employees in higher or lower classifications. It is understood that when such assignments are performed, employees will not receive an increase or decrease in rate of pay. Employees scheduled to a higher rated classification will be paid such higher rate and employees scheduled or demoted to a lower rated classification due to curtailment will receive the applicable classified rate.
C.	Production employees will also perform adjustments and other minor maintenance work that does not require the skills of a journeyman craftsman. It is not the intent to make trained craftsmen out of production employees, but rather to concentrate the skills of maintenance personnel where they are most needed. It is understood that production employees must be able to perform such work safely. Production employees and maintenance employees will be expected to temporarily assist each other.
D.	When a temporary vacancy occurs, it will be the supervisor's responsibility to determine whether or not the job will be filled. In making this determination, the supervisor will make his/her decision based solely on the operating conditions that exist at the time of the vacancy.
The Company also reserves the right to temporarily transfer employees to fill vacancies in his/her department or in other departments based on operating conditions that exist at the time the vacancy transfer occurs. The transfer of an employee to another department will be made based on seniority in the department or line of progression being affected. Employees transferred from their department will not be replaced for the term of the transfer.
Employees assigned to the Power Plant, Old Wood Room and Drum Barking, Treatment Plant and Kraft and Clay area will not be transferred out of their areas.
When an employee is temporarily assigned to a job paying a higher rate than their regular occupation, they shall receive the higher rate providing they can perform all the duties of the new position. An employee asked to temporarily take a lower rate job while their regular job is in operation shall receive their regular rate of pay.
50
E.	AH members of the crew are responsible for cleanup.
II.	TEAM MAINTENANCE CONCEPT
Utilizing the Team Maintenance Concept, the Maintenance Department will function as a team. Each individual's craft and primary skill will be recognized and assignments will be made accordingly.
Each employee may perform work in any other craft, so as to perform maintenance work incidental to accomplishing their job and/or assist other craftsmen. Maintenance employees will also be expected to do incidental maintenance work of any craft.
Production employees will also perform adjustments and other minor maintenance work that does not require the skills of a journeyman craftsman.
Painting using brush, roller, spray can, including the required preparation work, may be performed by any hourly Union employee.
The oxygen-acetylene torch may be used by any maintenance employee to perform heating, cutting, or burning.
All maintenance craftsmen will perform rigging tasks in conjunction with work assignments. Minor rigging includes the use of a forklift or pick-up truck to transport material and equipment. This does not include the use of a Boom truck.
Minor welding may be done by Millwrights, Pipers, Machinists, Truck Mechanics when it is an incidental task associated with their job assignment. Tinsmiths may use spot welders.
In the application of the above, it is understood that employees must be able to perform the assigned tasks safely.
III.	STEERING COMMITTEE
The Company and the Union recognize the need for a representative group of mill employees that will assist in the implementation of team concepts. This group will help guide the implementation of team concept so as to allow for a maximum concern for efficiency, cost, productivity, and a maximum concern for employees.
The group will consist of eight (8) union bargaining unit employees and a group of eight (8) management representatives.
The function of the team will be to assist and guide the process of implementing team concept by:
•	helping employees understand team concept;
•	assist in the planning of training necessary for implementation;
•	devising feedback and evaluation methods;
•	discussing problem areas of implementation and suggest alternatives;
•	identifying on-going communication methods to promote understanding of the concept;
•	to act as a resource to expand the concept to the fullest potential.
Both the Company and the Union recognize the successful implementation of team concepts must be
51
an on-going collaborative effort. To that end, the team will continue to meet on a regular basis providing guidance until such team concepts are firmly understood and practiced throughout the mill
IV.	MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
In exchange for agreement and support of productivity and team concepts, no employee on the payroll at the time of ratification will be laid off from the mill as a direct result of the implementation of such concepts.
The Company agrees that reductions in the bargaining unit which might result from implementation of these concepts will be handled by attrition.
Excluded from the above understanding are any reductions caused by market conditions, capital projects, shutdown of equipment or machinery or other conditions beyond the control of the Company.
NO. 10 SAFETY ORGANIZATION
The parties agreed to include a description of the present mill safety organization in the new Safety Rule Booklet. This would include the Bucksport Action Committee on Safety (BACS), the Central Safety Committee and the various sub-committees.
NO. 11 BULLETIN BOARDS

NO. 14 BUCKSPORT’S IMPAIRED EMPLOYEE PROCEDURE
INTERNATIONAL PAPER BUCKSPORT OPERATIONS GUIDELINES FOR DEALING WITH AND THE REMOVAL OF AN IMPAIRED EMPLOYEE
OBJECTIVES:
•	To ensure a safe, productive workplace in accordance with established mill rules.
•	Through a joint Union/Management effort provide guidelines for removing an "impaired" employee from the workplace and eliminate the potential for serious injury to the employee or his/her co-workers.
•	To assure that the "impaired employee" is provided immediate medical attention to determine an appropriate course of treatment.
I. PROCEDURE
The supervisor shall do the following if he/she observes that an employee is unable to do his/her job, regardless of the reason the supervisor perceives is the basis for the inability to do the job:
1.	Observe and record the action and behavior of the seemingly "impaired employee". If possible, request a second salaried employee to do likewise. (Disposition of the Impaired Employee attachment)
NOTE: No Champion employee is qualified to diagnose, assess or determine any illness or cause for unacceptable behavior. This is important to keep in mind as sometimes a person seemingly under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs may actually be "impaired" from another illness or taking a prescription medication.
2.	Advise the employee in the presence of the shop steward/or union official that he/she appears to be "impaired" and unfit to perform his/her duties and will be subject to the provisions of the Substance Abuse Testing Policy. On the basis of the supervisor's observations, request that the employee go to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor or the hospital of the employee's choice (that is qualified to perform testing under the Bucksport’s Substance Abuse Policy), (transport by ambulance) so that a medical professional may determine the problem, take the appropriate
57
urine sample and prescribe an appropriate course of treatment. (At no time are the Hall Security Officers to be expected to transport the employee )
3.	The Company nurse on duty will be called to help deal with the problem. The nurse will notify the Human Resource Manager.
IL REMOVING THE EMPLOYEE AND TRANSPORT TO MEDICAL FACILITY
1.	The employee will be transported to EMMC or the hospital of his/her choice (that is qualified to perform testing under the Bucksport Substance Abuse Policy), by ambulance. The supervisor involved will follow the ambulance to the hospital.
2.	The nurse will call the appropriate hospital and the employee’s immediate family.
3.	Once at the hospital, the supervisor will advise the attending medical professional of his/her observations concerning the employee's behavior, provide the physician with the release signed by the employee and request that a urine sample is taken. The physician will then take charge of the case.
4.	If, after examination, the employee is released from the medical facility, the supervisor will arrange for the employee to be driven from the medical facility to his/her home. If medically approved to return to work the supervisor will arrange for transportation back to work.
5.	Prior to return to work a meeting will be scheduled with the employee, the supervisor, union officials, and a Human Resource representative. The employee’s return to work will be in accordance with the Substance Abuse Testing Policy.
6.	The purpose of the meeting will be focused on helping the employee.
7.	It must be pointed out that the purpose of this procedure is not punitive but to provide appropriate professional attention as soon as possible to an employee who appears to have a medical problem which manifested itself in unacceptable workplace behavior.
III. IF THE EMPLOYEE REFUSES TO GO TO A MEDICAL FACILITY..(SUPERVISORfS RESPONSIBILITY)
1.	Any employee refusing to sign a consent form or to submit to a substance abuse test will be regarded as insubordinate and will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.
2.	Inform the employee that it is your responsibility as a supervisor to provide a safe working environment for all employees and that he/she is relieved from his/her duties pending the determination of the problem.
3.	Arrange for transportation home. (At no time are the Hall Security Officers to be expected to transport the employee.)
4.	If the employee refuses assistance, contact the next of kin and request that transportation be provided from the work site to the employee’s home.
58
NOTE: Under no circumstances should a potentially ’’impaired” employee be allowed to drive him/herself home.
5.	Prior to returning to work a meeting will be scheduled with the employee, the supervisor, union officials, and a Human Resource representative. The employee’s return to work will be in accordance with the Substance Abuse Testing Policy.
Should it be determined that there has been a violation of mill rules, the Company reserves the right to pursue appropriate disciplinary action as discussed in the Labor Agreement.
Questions pertaining to this procedure should be directed to the Human Resource Department.

65
NO. 3 CREW MEETINGS
The Union and the Company recognize the need and importance of holding crew meetings. Accurate and timely communications is essential if we are to achieve a level of performance which is superior to our competition. Consequently, we have established the following as guidelines on how these meetings should be conducted in order to achieve the highest level of participation.
1.	Crew meeting will be voluntary.
2.	Both sides reserve the right to caucus.
3.	The crew may call a meeting in addition to the regularly scheduled session should circumstances dictate. Also, either party may ask to extend any crew meeting in order to give everyone an opportunity to share their opinions.
4.	Scheduled crew meetings will not be canceled unless both parties mutually agree.
5.	Crew meetings should not be held during normal break time (if applicable) or lunch time unless the crew so designates. Meetings which are scheduled before or after the normal workday will be paid per the Labor Agreement.
6.	Decisions made at crew meetings will be documented and distributed to the crews. If the Union or Management has problems with the decision, they will meet with the crews to problem solve the issue.
7.	The crew may request a union representative (committee person or other) to be present at its meetings. Union representatives may also attend any crew meeting on their own initiative.
8.	Any changes modifying the Labor Agreement must be mutually agreed to by the Union and the Company.
9.	Crews may call joint meetings with other crews or send representatives to other crew meetings.
10.	Each crew determines how best to run their meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to exchange information regarding the overall operation of the mill and to work through problem issues which can improve the crew’s level of performance. Execution of crew meeting decisions will not be subject to discipline.
It is understood that these are only interim guidelines and can be modified by each department redesign task force to best fit the department needs to communicate. It is also understood that the intent of these crew meetings is not to circumvent the redesign process. Any issue that is problem solved by a crew which results in improved operation will subsequently be made part of the department redesign and the savings credited to the final package.
NO. 4 TRIAL PERIOD
The purpose of this agreement is to allow the employee a reasonable opportunity to determine if the position is suitable to them and to allow the company a reasonable opportunity to determine if the employee is suitable to the position.
66
I.	Bids within a Functional Area
In cases of transfers from one position to another within a functional area the Company and employee will be allowed a trial period of (7) days worked in the new position to determine whether or not the transferred individual can do the work or wants the position. The employee may terminate the trial period before the (7) days has expired and will thereby be returned to their former position as soon as the schedule allows. Those pre-redesign employees in the Supercalendar Department and #7 <6 #2 Paper Machines who bid per the provisions of their respective Batch Bid Agreement will not be entitled the trial period.
II.	Bids to another Functional Area
In cases of transfers from one functional area to another, the Company and employee will be allowed a trial period of (14) days worked in the new position to determine whether or not the transferred individual can do the work or wants the position. The employee may terminate the trial period before the (14) days has expired and will thereby be returned to their former position as soon as the schedule allows.
III.	Bid limit
The employee will be allowed only two (2) successful bids, which includes those refused during the trial period, in any twelve-month period.
IV.	Seniority
In the event that it is decided the individual cannot do the work, or does not want the job, they shall be returned to their former position with no loss of seniority. Upon completion of the trial period, said individual shall lose seniority in their former Functional Area and/or position and start accumulating seniority in the new Functional Area and/or position from the date on the bid.
Deviations from the above may be allowed by mutual agreement between the Union and the Management of the impacted Functional Area(s) and line(s) of operation.

Spare Employees’ Work Week
The application of all provisions of Section 23 to spare employees was intended only if a spare
67
was scheduled for a full normal work week.
1.	For spare employees working an eight hour schedule, full and normal is defined as five (5) days replacing a regular employee and regardless of shift (vacation, sick leave, holiday, etc.).
2.	For spare employees working a twelve hour schedule, full and normal is defined as either (3) or (4) twelve hour shifts replacing a regular employee and regardless of shift (vacation, sick leave, holiday, etc.
3.	Full and normal work weeks occur for Spares when the spare is scheduled on Friday to work a full and normal work week or more during the next work week even though all shifts may not be the same job or on the same shift or in the same department. The key requirement is that a full and normal work week is scheduled by 3 p.m. Friday. Otherwise, the employee does not meet the definition of a scheduled Spare and such employees will not have scheduled off day(s).
4.	It is also understood that the Company will make every effort to schedule Spares for a full and normal work week. Where spares are scheduled on Friday to work less than a full and normal work week then these Spares have no "off' days as such in that work week and for interpretation purposes, they arc considered unscheduled Spares.
5.	It is further understood that Spares scheduled to work different jobs and shifts which require them to work "8/12 on, 8/12 off and 8/12 on again", will do so on straight time unless beyond the appropriate work week.
6.	A member of the general mill spare list, or a member of another department pool, hired prior to 1979, may request, in writing, to be excused from assignment to the Groundwood Department. If such a request is made he/she will not be assigned work in this department unless there is no one else available to be assigned from the spare list.

Dear Sirs:
During negotiation of the 1995 Agreement, the subject of production workers operating the OMC Crane was discussed.
It is not the Company's intention to allow Production employees to operate the OMC Crane from the Cab. We intend to make a full review of the remote operation of the Crane, develop necessary procedures and training for remote operation and implement after we are confident that all safety and training issues have been addressed.
Sincerely,
