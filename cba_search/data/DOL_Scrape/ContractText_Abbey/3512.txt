AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT made this 12th day of March, by and between THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, a corporation not for pecuniary profit, organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, located at Chicago, Illinois (the "University"); and THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION LOCAL NO. 73 and its University of Chicago Council (the "Union") for and on behalf of themselves and the employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 1	- PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
The purpose of this Agreement is to promote good relations between the University, the Union and the employees in the bargaining unit represented by the Union, and to make clear the basic terms upon which such relations depend. It is the intent of both the University and the Union to work together to provide and maintain satisfactory terms and conditions of employment and to prevent as well as adjust misunderstandings or grievances relating to employment.
ARTICLE 2	- RECOGNITION
Section 2.1	- Inclusions / Exclusions,
A.	The University recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining agency for all its employees, working at its buildings and properties, including part-time employees seasonal and temporary employees, who are working twenty (20) hours or more per week in classifications listed in Schedule A and Appendix E of this Agreement, provided the positions in Appendix E are reinstated by the University at any future time.
B.	Excluded from the bargaining unit are all supervisory employees (meaning thereby, employees having the right to hire or discharge), students, employees working less than 20 hours per week, salaried employees, and professional employees. The term "employee" or "employees" when used in the Agreement shall mean individuals for whom the Union is recognized as the bargaining agency in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph.
Section 2.2	- Definitions, For purposes of this Agreement,
"Classification" refers to the job titles as listed in Schedule "A" of the Agreement,
"Occupational Group" refers to related classifications as grouped in Appendix A of this Agreement.
"Operational Section" (Shop) refers to separate operating groups within a department.
"Department" refers to the various University departments.
Section 2.3	- Work by Supervisors. Notwithstanding a supervisor’s responsibility to provide ‘hands-on’ instruction, the University will not use supervisors to perform the normal duties of employees unless an emergency exists. An emergency is defined as an occurrence which endangers life, health or property. In addition, there may be times during the first day of an unscheduled employee
1
absence or a special emergency condition when a supervisor may provide active assistance.
Section 2.4	- Policy on Work Assignments and Contracting Out of Work
A.	The parties pledge to cooperate together in seeking the appropriate means to maximize the work performed by University employees, and minimize the work performed by subcontractors. The University agrees not to contract out work normally performed by bargaining unit employees except for legitimate economic reasons. Should the University contemplate sub-contracting work which has historically been performed by bargaining unit employees, or such subcontracting will result in the displacement of bargaining unit employees, such action shall be discussed with the Union prior to the implementation of such contract. During the course of these discussions, the University agrees, on request, to supply to the Union relevant data including subcontracting proposals and current costs for performance of the work in question.
B.	The contracting out of work normally performed by employees within the bargaining unit is considered an appropriate topic for discussion in Labor-Management Conferences as provided in Article 24.
C.	Grievances protesting subcontracting action taken by the University shall be subject to the grievance procedure including arbitration as provided in this Agreement.
Section 2.5	- Not Supplanting Regular Jobs with Student Employees. The University agrees not to use student employees to supplant regular full-time or part-time members of the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE 3	- NON-DISCRIMINATION
The University and the Union agree that both will abide by the letter and spirit of applicable federal, state, and municipal laws and statutes prohibiting discrimination against any employee because of race, color, marital status, parental status, ancestry, source of income, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status or veteran status. The parties acknowledge their commitment to maintaining a work environment free from sexual harassment.
ARTICLE 4	- FUNCTIONS OF MANAGEMENT
The University shall exercise the regular and customary functions of management, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including the authority and the responsibility for the supervision of the employees and of their work; the making of reasonable rules to assure orderly and effective work; the determination of what duties shall be performed and of employee competency; the selection, hiring, transfer, promotion, demotion, layoff and discharge of employees for just cause.
2
ARTICLE 5	- PROBATIONARY PERIOD
Each new employee shall be in a probationary status until s/he has completed one-hundred twenty (120) days of employment. During his/her probation, a new employee may be laid off or terminated at the discretion of the University subject to the grievance procedure for probationary employees (Article 8, Section 8.10). The probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement, in writing, between the parties -- the University and the Union -- and a copy of the agreement shall be furnished to the Employee. Neither party will unreasonably withhold an agreement to extend a probationary period. When successfully completed, the employee's probationary period counts for both length of service and seniority purposes. Non-bargaining unit University employees who secure positions within the bargaining unit shall be deemed probationary for purposes of this Article, except the hire date will reflect University service for purposes of paid allowances and benefits.
ARTICLE 6	- UNION MEMBERSHIP
Section 6.1	- Employees. All employees shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of execution of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days following the beginning of their employment, whichever is the later, either

B.	in the alternative, tender a monthly agency fee to the Union which shall not exceed the amount of initiation fees and monthly dues uniformly required for employees to acquire and retain membership in the Union.
C.	All employees shall, during the term of this Agreement, remain in good standing as members of the Union or continue to pay the required agency fees. If an employee fails to comply with this requirement, on the written request of the Union, he/she will be discharged by the University; provided, however, that the University shall not be required to discharge or discriminate against any employee for non-membership in the Union if such membership is not made available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members or if membership is denied to the employee or terminated for any reason except non-payment of dues.
Section 6.2	- Membershi p,
A.	The University agrees, subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 of this Article, that as a condition of employment, all employees who are or who become members of the Union of The University of Chicago Council, shall continue to pay regular Union dues for the term of this Agreement or any extension or renewal, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 6.3 of this Article.
B.	The Union agrees that no eligible employee shall be prevented from joining the Union, nor shall any eligible employee who is a member of such Union be deprived of Union membership for any reason except non-payment of dues.
C.	Any employee shall have the right to withdraw from Union membership by giving written notification to the Union by registered mail, with a copy by registered mail to the University’s Director of Labor Relations, postmarked between the tenth (10th) and the
3
twenty-fifth (25th) days of June of any year of this Agreement. This withdrawal will take effect on the following August 31st. However, all employees who have taken advantage of this provision shall, upon execution of the renewed Agreement, be required to comply with Section 6.1, provided that the Union has shown to the University that said Union represents a majority of those employees eligible for membership in the bargaining unit.

Employees who are subject to the agency fee payments shall have the right to appeal in accordance with applicable laws.
C.	Deductions.
1.	Deductions will be made from the first payroll check/direct deposit received in the month, except that, if an employee is included in that payroll but his/her earnings are not sufficient to cover this deduction the dues deduction will be made from the next payroll check.
2.	Deduction authorization and revoking notices to be effective in any given month must be in the possession of the Comptroller one (1) week before the regular date for issuance of the first payroll check of the month. Authorizations received late will not be effective until the next month.
3.	Union dues deduction authorizations currently in effect are renewed for the period of this Agreement or any extension. Dues shall continue to be deducted in such amounts as may be certified by the Union as the appropriate monthly dues.
4.	An authorization is automatically revoked if an employee is terminated for any cause from employment in the bargaining unit, or if at any time, no contract is in effect with the Union providing for these dues deductions.
5.	Upon receipt of proper written notification from an employee, deduction authorizations shall be irrevocable for successive one (1) year periods or until the termination of this collective Agreement, whichever occurs first. An employee may revoke his/her deduction authorization by giving written notice to the University not more than twenty (20) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of each successive period of one (1) year, or of each applicable collective agreement between the University and the Union, whichever occurs sooner. In the event of a renewal of this Agreement, an authorization shall automatically be renewed from year to year unless an employee notifies the University of his/her desire to terminate the said authorization as heretofore provided.
4

Section 6.4 - Bulletin Boards. The University shall permit the Union to post notices of its meetings and other Union activities on bulletin boards normally used for posting notices to employees. Such notices will be delivered to the office of the Director of Labor Relations.
Section 6.5 - Union Activity. The University agrees that it will not discriminate against, interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee because of membership in the Union. The Union agrees that its officers, members and agents will not engage in Union activity on the University’s time (not including casual personal conversations between employees), or in such manner as to interfere with the efficient operation of the University.
Section 6.6 - Union Stewards. The University agrees to recognize a reasonable number of certified Stewards, the number to be agreed upon in writing from time to time. Each Steward shall be an employee of the University. So far as is practicable, the Council will not request the University to recognize any employee as a Steward who has not been employed for at least one (1) year. The Union will notify the University of any changes in the personnel of its Stewards at least three (3) days in advance of the date on which the new Steward becomes authorized to act on behalf of the Union.
ARTICLE 7-SENIORITY
Section 7.1	- Principle of Seniority. It is the desire and intent of this Article to preserve the principle and policy that job security shall be commensurate with length of continuous service.

An apprentice mechanic or engineer employee shall accumulate seniority, for all purposes other than that of shift choice, in the appropriate journeyman classification from the beginning date of apprenticeship; provided, however, that such seniority is applicable only within his/her operational section.
B.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.7 and 7.8, seniority shall be determined by the length of the employee's service in his/her occupational group. Seniority shall accumulate from the first day of employment in the employee's occupational group, but no employee shall be entitled to benefits of seniority until s/he has completed his or her probationary period.
Section 7.2	- Seniority shall continue to accumulate:
A.	during absences, caused by illness or injury incurred in the course of employment equal in length to the employee's seniority standing immediately prior to the occurrence of the illness or injury, but not to exceed a maximum of two (2) years,
B.	during absence for military service to the extent provided in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act as amended,
5
C.	during other leaves of absence approved by the University in writing for a period of one (1) year or less,
D.	when an employee is rehired within thirty (30) days following resignation or discharge.
Sect lQn_7.3^La ps.e_of_Sen lority.
Accumulated seniority shall be lost when:
A.	an employee resigns or retires,
B.	an employee is discharged for just cause,
C.	an employee is absent for three (3) consecutive workdays without notification to the University of the reason for the absence, unless the employee is unable to notify the University due to extenuating circumstances,
D.	an employee fails to return from a University-approved leave of absence,
E.	an employee fails to report for work within ten (10) days after s/he or she has been requested to return to the same or a comparable job within the bargaining unit following a temporary lay-off.
Section 7.4 - Seniority, Retention of (when transfer from bargaining unit) An employee who is promoted within the bargaining unit or accepts a University position outside the bargaining unit shall continue to retain his/her seniority in his/her previous classification and occupational group for a period of sixty (60) calendar days from the date the employee begins work in the new position. If an employee returns to his/her previous classification within sixty (60) calendar days after starting in the new position, s/he may not interrupt or supersede already selected schedules for vacation, holidays or leaves, except in cases where the employee was involuntarily transferred.
Section 7.5	- Seniority When Serving as Union Officer or Delegate. Any employee selected as an officer or delegate of the Union shall be allowed reasonable time off for the performance of such Union duties without loss of seniority rights but without pay.
Section 7.6	- Seniority When Temporary Employees Become Regular
A.	A temporary employee who works for the University for more than one-hundred eighty (180) calendar days or 999 hours worked (whichever comes first) shall be made a regular University employee unless an extension of the period of temporary employment is agreed to by both the Union and the University. Such employees shall be subject to the provisions provided in Article 6 of this Agreement (Union Membership) on the 31st day of employment.
B.	Whenever temporary employees are accepted as regular employees, their seniority shall commence with the last date of hiring as temporary employees, and they shall accrue sick leave and vacation benefits beginning from that date, provided there has been no break in service exceeding seven (7) calendar days. No other benefits shall be retroactive, but shall become effective as of the date of change from temporary to regular employee.
Section 7.7	- Seniority, Used for shift choice, Management's ability to assign shifts
A.	In operational sections (Shops) that have more than one (1) fixed shift, the senior one-half (1Z ) of employees in any classification shall have choice of shift. Such choice shall not be exercised more than once in any twelve (12) month period and shall take effect as of the
6
first pay period in July. An employee seeking to exercise such choice must notify management not less than thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date.
B.	Management will have the ability to move an employee, when deemed necessary, to a shift not of the employee's choice, for a period required to cover a specific need. Such changes will be limited to up to three (3) periods; where each period is not to exceed ten (10) work days, with an overall total of thirty (30) work days within any calendar year.
C.	When operations require that an employee be transferred to a new operational section (Shop), the University will first solicit volunteers from the affected classification(s). If there are no volunteers, the University will transfer the least senior qualified employee.
Section 7.8:	Layoffs
A.	In the event of a reduction in force, probationary employees shall first be laid off from the occupational group and classification affected in reverse order of seniority (least senior laid off first). If further reduction is necessary, non-probationary part-time employees shall be laid off in reverse order of seniority in the affected job classification. If further reduction is necessary, non-probationary full-time employees shall be laid off in reverse order of seniority in the affected job classification.
B.	Laid-off non-probationary employees shall be given the opportunity by the University to displace (bump) other employees as follows:
1.	A part-time employee may displace the least senior part-time employee within the same classification elsewhere in the bargaining unit provided his/her seniority exceeds that of the employee s/he seeks to displace. If s/he is unable to do so, s/he shall be given the opportunity to displace the least senior part-time employee in a lower-rated classification within the same occupational group.
2.	A full-time employee may displace the least senior employee, whether full-time or part-time, within the same classification elsewhere in the bargaining unit provided his/her seniority exceeds that of the employee s/he seeks to displace. If s/he is unable to do so, s/he shall be given the opportunity to displace the least senior employee, whether full-time or part-time, in a lower-rated classification within the same occupational group, provided his/her seniority exceeds that of the employee s/he seeks to displace.
3.	In no event shall an employee displace another pursuant to this section unless s/he is fully capable of performing the work of the employee s/he seeks to displace.
C.	A former full-time employee that accepted part-time work because of a reduction in force shall be reinstated to full-time status should a full-time position become vacant in his/her classification anywhere in the bargaining unit.
D.	Except in case of emergency, the University shall provide the Union and the affected employee not less than one (1) week's written notice of any layoff.
E.	Any employee laid-off pursuant to Paragraph A of this Section 7.8 shall be given consideration for transfer to any existing University vacancy outside this bargaining unit for which s/he possesses the necessary qualifications as determined by the University, except where prohibited by other bargaining unit agreements. University of Chicago Hospitals Skilled Unit employees on lay off shall have preferential consideration as
7
identified in Section 10.4.
F.	Employees temporarily laid-off due to lack of work shall, for a period equal to the length of their accumulated seniority immediately prior to the date of layoff to a maximum of two (2) years, retain seniority accumulated to the date of layoff, and shall, subject to the provisions of this Agreement during that period, be rehired in order of seniority before new employees hired in the open market.
Section 7.9 - Lists Provided to the Union. The University agrees to compile and to furnish to the Union a list showing for each department, the job classification, operational section, University Service Date, Occupational Group Seniority Date, and Classification of each employee, on February 1 of each year of this Agreement, The University agrees to furnish to the Union every two months a list showing all personnel transactions relative to new hires, promotions, transfers, leaves of absence, temporary employment and terminations.

Section 8.2	- Grievance Defined. For the purposes of this Agreement, a grievance is defined as a difference of opinion between the University and the Union or between the University and an employee with respect to the meaning or application of any provision of this Agreement which is reduced to writing and filed for processing through the Grievance procedure.
A.	Any employee may consult directly with a member of his/her immediate supervision on a matter which does not necessarily constitute a grievance. The supervisor will follow through on such matters and try to adjust them. In the event a satisfactory adjustment is not made, the matter may become a grievance and the Grievance Procedure may be followed.
B.	In any case where an employee is not satisfied with respect to the disposition of the matter on which s/he has informally consulted with a member of his/her immediate supervision, the employee may submit his/her complaint as a grievance, but this must be done within fifteen (15) days from the occurrence of the incident, or when the employee acquired direct knowledge of the condition which gave rise to the complaint, and if more than fifteen (15) days pass, the employee shall be barred from processing the complaint as a grievance.
C.	Time limits in Article 8 are expressed in calendar days.

5.	Employees in the above-listed classifications, within the RP and other shops, may be interchangeably assigned repair, maintenance and renovation tasks in off-campus apartments and/or in on-campus properties, as needed.
6.	Regardless of location of work, the scope of work performed by Building Trades (BT) employees (including RP shop staff) will be determined by the University’s operational needs and the individual skills, abilities and experience of the employee assigned to do the work. In making assignments, the University will attempt to assign the employee most suited for the assignment.

7.	When a position becomes available, a Helper 1 or 2 may be given first consideration, presuming they possess the necessary skill set and certifications (if required).
8.	Helper 1 employees will receive 2.8% increases after 12 months; after 24 months; after 36 months (commensurate with service crew laborer employees in Landscape Services).
9.	After 48 months, Helper 1 employees will transition to the Helper 2 classification.
10.	For future hires, the beginning Helper 2 pay rate will be 21.00 per hour.
11.	Helper 2 employees will receive 2.8% increases after 12 months; after 24 months; after 36
months.

The increases to vehicle allowances will take effect on the same date as general wage increases. The parties agree to meet and confer in the future regarding the phase-out of vehicle allowances and parking permits for current RP employees. This meeting will occur on or before September 2012.
48
NOTES REGARDING UNIFORMS
14.	RP Shop employees will be provided with seven uniforms and safety shoe reimbursement for one pair of safety shoes.
15.	RP employees will be provided with outdoor gear equal to the outdoor gear provided to grounds shop employees including one of each of the following every two years: Carhartt bib and jacket; raingear; hooded sweatshirts.
APPENDIX I, Continued
NOTE REGARDING TOOL ALLOWANCE
16.	The University will eliminate the tool allowance and provide tools to all RP employees by September 2012.
