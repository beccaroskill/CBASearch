All Regular employees will stop accruing PTO when they have accrued 120 hours of PTO. Any previously accrued ETO will be counted towards the 120 hours of PTO. Once this maximum accrual amount has been reached, no additional PTO will be earned until previously accrued PTO is used. There will be no retroactive grant of PTO for the period of time that the accrued PTO accrual was at the maximum accrual amount.
ARTICLE 11.	SICK TIME

Sick days are not interchangeable with PTO and cannot be added to PTO or DCRC holidays to extend the time off, unless in the case of an approved disability leave. Employees may not receive pay in lieu of sick days, nor will they be paid for any unused sick days upon termination of employment with the Employer.
Section 3.	Sick Leave Accrual.
Employees will accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Paid sick leave will carry over from year to year, with a cap on accrual of 48 hours (or six days).

The Employer utilizes various procedures to address work problems such as misconduct or poor performance. Verbal warnings, written warnings, demotions, disciplinary suspensions without pay and discharge are generally the procedures used in response to unacceptable conduct.

When verbal warnings are given, they will be noted in the employee’s personnel file. Written warnings and suspension notices should be signed both by the supervisor and employee.

When written warnings are given, the employee will receive a copy of the warning or suspension notice and a copy will be placed in the employee's personnel file.
