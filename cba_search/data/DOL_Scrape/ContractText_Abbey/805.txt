For the purposes of this policy if a test reveals the presence of alcohol at a level of .00% or more by weight, it shall be presumed that Ihe employee has violated this policy. If Ihe test reveals the presence of alcohol in excess of .05% by weight, but less than 08%. the results of the test will be considered along with all other relevant information (eg. employee condud, speech, performance, etc.) in determining whether the employee Is in violation of this policy. If a test reveals the presence of alcohol of less than .05% by weight il shall be presumed that the employee is not under the influence of alcohol in violation of this policy. The presumption regarding the presence of alcohol of less than .05% by weight is rebuttable based on consideration of all other relevant information (e.g., employee conduct, speech, performance, etc.). The Company bears the burden of proof in rebutting such presumption. In the event an employee objects to alcohol testing by Mood sample, the Company will test the employee through an evidentiary alcohol breath analyzer which conforms to the same standards as cited above.
