The City has established a trust fund for prefunded retiree health care benefits for all eligible retired Fire Fighters (hereinafter referred to as “the Fund”) and has increased its contribution levels for the purpose of establishing an actuarially sound retiree health benefit fund, evaluated over thirty years. The parties agreed in principle, in 1995, that, once an actuarially sound fund was estabbshed by current contribution levels, the responsibility for future contributions (made necessary by changes in circumstances, the economy, and the medical care system) would be jointly shared by the parties, and would be quantified and allocated by negotiation in future agreements, as necessary. In keeping with this principle, the contribution levels to the trust fund and their effective dates shall be as follows:
Page « of 79
Effective Date	City (% of base pay + longevity/ mouth)	Each Firefighter (S/mouth)
June 1,2002	8.92	40
October 1,2002	8.71	50
October 1,2003	8.51	60

The costs of study shall be paid by the City and deducted from its contribution to the Fund. The study shall be conducted by a firm having experience in conducting actuarial analysis on municipal retiree health benefit programs, and which is jointly selected by the City and the Unions. The study shall evaluate the amount of monthly contributions necessary to provide benefits under the fund and amortize the unfunded liability for a period of not more than thirty (30) years. The City shall provide such accurate and complete information, as the actuary shall require. The assumptions utilized shall be determined by the actuary, provided that any material change in the assumptions shall be preceded by notice to the City and the Union, and an opportunity for input or conferences prior to completion of the study.

Contributions beyond the term of this Agreement shall be as negotiated by the parties in future contract terms with the understanding that the parties have agreed, in principle, to share contributions to the Fund as follows: 2/3 City and 1/3 Union members.
In the event that legislation is proposed to be introduced to the Texas Legislature during the term of this Agreement, which removes control over the benefits levels from the collective bargaining process or establishes contribution amounts to the Fund, the parties agree to reopen negotiations to discuss any revisions to this section. The parties agree to include the San Antonio Police Officer’s Association in any such discussions. The Association has obtained this provision to reopen negotiations on the basis of its commitment and agreement that any change by legislation which removes any control over the Fund from the collective bargaining process shall establish a defined contribution level in order to protect the City and its taxpayers from any unfunded liability resulting form such revisions.

Section 2.	Reasonable suspicion testing
A.

Sections. General.
A.	The thresholds listed above shall apply to all testing under this Article. Employees will complete a pre-testing consent form each time a test is conducted as part of drug testing procedure under this Article.

B.	In all testing under this Article, only conclusive results are to be reported to the City. A positive urinalysis tost will be confirmed by a GC/MS test and reviewed by a Medical Review Officer before considered conclusive. Both tests must be positive or the results are considered inconclusive, thereby causing a negative test result to be reported to the City.
C In all testing under this Article, individuals with positive test results for drugs will be notified by the MRO (or a para-professional acting as his delegate) in person or by telephone. An interview will be conducted to determine if there is an alternative medical explanation of the drugs found in the employee’s urine specimen. The employee is entitled to request and receive an in-person interview with the MRO prior to release of a positive result. If the employee provides appropriate documentation and the MRO is satisfied with the explanation, the drug test result is to be reported as negative to the City.
D. Concentrations less than the thresholds listed herein, or initial positives not confirmed by the confirmatory testing shall be disregarded by the City, and may not be referred to or used at any time for any employment or disciplinary purpose whatsoever by the City.
