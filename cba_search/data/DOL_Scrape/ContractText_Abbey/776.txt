COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS AGREEMENT
(October 17,2001-October 16,2004)
ARTICLE I: PARTIES, TERM, AND APPLICABILITY
1.	Parties
The Joint Policy Committee on Broadcast Talent Union Relations of the Association of National Advertisers and American Association of Advertising Agencies (ANA-AAAA) and on behalf of each company whose name appears on the lists submitted to the Federation in October, 2001 together with any other party which executes the appropriate Letter of Adherence (each of which is herein severally called the "Employer")—and the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (herein called "Federation”) agree to the following terms, conditions and provisions (herein called the “Agreement”).
2.	TERM
This Agreement shall be in effect commencing October 17, 2001—or in the case of any new signatory Employer, on the effective date in the Letter of Adherence—and continuing through October 16, 2004.
3.	Services Covered
This Agreement shall apply to the employment of persons who fall within the bargaining unit classifications set forth in Article II (1) in connection with the recording of music tracks to be used in the production of television and radio commercial announcements, and the performance of services under Article XV. Excluded from this Agreement are music tracks recorded in Canada by members of Canadian Locals performing services under the Television and Radio Commercial Announcement Agreement for Canada. Commercial announcements (called “jingles and spot announcements” in prior Agreements) shall include those announcements which consist of (1) words accompanying music, (2) words under or over music, or (3) music intended to be performed without words. Theme music for a program shall be excluded from the definition of commercial announcements.
This Agreement shall also apply to the employment of persons who fall within the bargaining unit classifications set forth in Article 11 (1) in connection with the recording of music tracks to be used in the production of Internet commercial announcements insofar as the Internet commercial announcement is capable of being used on television or radio in the same form as on the Internet.
4.	Subsidiaries and Controlling Interests
The Employer’s obligations under this Agreement shall also be binding upon (1) its subsidiaries, (2) any interest which controls it, and (3) subsidiaries of any interest which controls it, to the extent that any of these makes or deals with commercial announcements covered by this Agreement: The Employer, any interest which controls it, and the subsidiaries of either shall be
Printing 12/03/02
1
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
jointly and severally liable with respect to the Employer’s obligations arising or due under this Agreement. An interest which owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any class of stock in the Employer shall conclusively be deemed to control the Employer. A corporation shall conclusively be deemed a subsidiary of any person, firm or corporation which, directly or indirectly, owns at least 10% of any class of its stock.
5.	Non-Transferability
This Agreement shall be personal to the Employer and shall not be transferable or assignable by operation of law or otherwise without the written consent of the Federation. Without such consent, the Employer shall not transfer or assign any individual contract or part thereof for the performance of services of any member of the Federation or any other member of the bargaining unit or give anyone else control over such contract or such services. If the foregoing is violated and services are thereafter performed by such members of the Federation or other person, or if the transferee or assignee does any act which the Employer is permitted to do under this Agreement, the obligations and duties imposed by this Agreement shall be binding upon the transferee or assignee.
6.	Termination
With respect to any individual Employer, the Federation shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this Agreement at any time after a transfer of any interest which controls that Employer or in the event that such Employer or any interest which controls it-or any subsidiary of either-makes or deals with commercial announcements covered by this Agreement without having in effect a collective agreement with the Federation covering the same. This Section shall apply only when the signatory Employer and the entity making or dealing with the commercial announcements covered by this Agreement constitute a single employer or joint employers.
7.	Outstanding Claims
The Employer represents that there does not exist against it any claim of any kind arising out of musical services, and that if any valid claim is found to exist, the Employer shall satisfy the same.
8.	Waivers
No conduct or failure to act—with or without knowledge by the Federation—other than a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer thereof shall constitute a waiver by it of any provision of this Agreement.
9.	Applicable Laws
With respect to services rendered in the United States, this Agreement shall be construed and applied according to the laws of the State of New York and any action against the Federation shall be brought only in courts located in New York County. With respect to services rendered in Canada, this Agreement shall be construed and applied according to the laws of the Province of Ontario and any action against the Federation shall be brought only in courts located in the County of York.

ARTICLE II:	RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

2.	Bargaining Unit Work

All other Musicians performing services in the United States shall become and continue to be members in good standing of the Federation as a condition of their employment no later than the 30th day following the commencement of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. To the extent permitted by applicable law, only the services of members in good standing of the Federation shall be used for the performance of any bargaining unit work in Canada.
4.	Bylaws
All present provisions of the Bylaws, rules and regulations of the Federation are made part of this Agreement as though fully set forth herein to the extent to which their inclusion and enforcement as part of this Agreement are not prohibited by any applicable law. No changes in the Federation’s Bylaws, rules and regulations which may be made during the term of this Agreement shall be effective to contravene any of the provisions hereof. The Employer acknowledges its responsibility to be fully acquainted, now and for the duration of this Agreement, with the present contents of the Federation’s Bylaws, rules and regulations.
5.	Conflict of Duties
To the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing in this Agreement shall ever be construed so as to interfere with any obligation which Musicians who are members of the Federation may owe to the Federation as members thereof.

The Employer reaffirms its policy that no employee shall be discriminated against in employment hereunder, because of race, color, creed, sex, national origin, or age provided the employee is qualified and has the physical ability to perform the work required thereunder. The Federation reaffirms its policy of non-discrimination with respect to admission to membership and rights of membership. The Employer shall annually advise all leaders, contractors, and any of its supervisory personnel involved in the hiring of musicians of the contents of this Section.

For services rendered under this Agreement, the Employer shall pay at least the minimum rates of pay set forth herein and shall fully and faithfully perform and observe all other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in any individual agreements with the persons performing such services. The Employer shall not require, request, induce, or in any manner attempt to influence any Musician to play, perform, or render services in a manner contrary to this Agreement.
10.	Federation’s Obligations
The Federation shall exercise full authority in order to assure that its Locals and members do nothing in derogation of the terms and intent of this Agreement.

To the extent practicable, such individual agreement shall be negotiated prior .to the time of performance.

In the event this Agreement is not renewed or a new one is not entered into prior to or immediately upon the expiration of this Agreement, such members may, at their option, render services to any others without obligation or liability to the Employer.

ARTICLE IV:	TRANSFER OF RIGHTS
1.	Federation Approval
Without the prior written permission of the Federation*, the Employer shall not use or grant any rights to use—whether by way of sale, assignment, mortgage, lease, gift, license or other transfer of title or permission to use, and whether by operation of law or otherwise (herein called “transfer”)—in whole or in part, any commercial announcement, film, videotape or recording, which, in whole or in part, embodies pictures of Musicians rendering musical performances or which embodies or is accompanied by performances by Musicians recorded and/or photographed under this Agreement, for purposes other than those permitted under this Agreement.
*The Federation has advised that it shall grant permission provided that:
(a)	the Employer has required a buyer, licensee, or other authorized transferee (“Licensee”) to become responsible for session payments and benefits (including pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions), and any applicable use/re-use payments that would be required under the then effective applicable Federation agreement, and the Employer has provided the Federation with evidence of, or an extract of, the provision in the license agreement by which the Licensee has agreed to make those payments; or
(b)	the Employer has agreed in writing to make the session and benefit payments (including pension contributions, but excluding health and welfare contributions) to those musicians who rendered services in the production of the commercial announcement that would be required under the then effective applicable Federation agreement.
2.	Assumption agreement
Any transfer of a commercial announcement, film, videotape or recording produced under this Agreement, or any rights therein, shall be subject to the rights and duties of the Employer established by this Agreement. No such transfer shall be effective unless and until (1) the Federation shall have received and approved an assumption agreement substantially in the form and substance set forth in Exhibit A hereof (which approval the Federation shall not unreasonably delay or unreasonably withhold) duly executed by the person, firm, or corporation receiving such transfer (“transferee”), or (2) the transferee, in addition to executing and delivering to the Federation such assumption agreement, shall have posted a surety company bond with the Federation guaranteeing to the Federation and the persons covered by this Agreement the performance by such transferee of its obligations pursuant to such assumption agreement.

ARTICLE V:	GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
1.	Scope of Grievances
Any disputes or controversies of any kind between any Musician(s) or the Federation and an Employer arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, disputes concerning the meaning, interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions set forth in this Agreement) shall be resolved exclusively through the procedure set forth in this Article.
2.	Step 1—Initiation of Grievances
Within 60 calendar days after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the grievance or after the date that the aggrieved party reasonably could have learned of that event, whichever is later, a grievance must be submitted in writing to the Employer by the Federation on its own or on behalf of the individual Musician(s) or to the Federation by the Employer. The grievance shall be submitted on a form as set forth in Exhibit C. Failure to follow the time limits specified above shall be grounds for rejecting the grievance/
3.	Step 2—Resolution Meeting
Within 15 calendar days from receipt of the grievance, a representative designated by the Federation and a representative designated by the Employer shall meet to discuss the matter and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
4.	Step 3—Written Answer
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute at that meeting, the party against whom the grievance is filed shall submit a written answer to the grievance within 15 calendar days after the resolution meeting.
5.	Step 4—demand for Arbitration
If either party to this Agreement is not satisfied with the answer or if no answer is submitted within the time limit specified, the dissatisfied party may elect to submit the dispute to arbitration by notifying both the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the other party in writing within 30 calendar days after the date the answer was due. The written demand for arbitration shall include a copy of the grievance that was filed and the answer, if any.
6.	Selection of arbitrator
At the time arbitration is invoked, the party invoking arbitration shall request that the AAA furnish the parties to the dispute a panel of nine arbitrators who are members of the AAA. Arbitration shall be conducted in either New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, or such other city which the parties agree to, with due consideration to factors such as where the grievance arose, where the parties are located, where the relevant records are located, or other factors peculiar to the case. The panel of arbitrators furnished by the AAA shall be generally from the area where the arbitration is to take place. Within seven working days from the receipt of the AAA panel, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from the panel utilizing, if necessary, an alternate striking process until a single arbitrator remains who shall then become the selected
2nd printing 12/03/02
10
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
arbitrator. If no arbitrator on the original panel is acceptable to either party, the parties may request a second panel of arbitrators from the AAA and go through the same process within the same time limits set out above. No future panels may be requested by the parties after the second panel.
7.	Hearing and Award
When the arbitrator has been selected, the parties shall immediately confer with him/her to determine the earliest practicable date for a hearing. Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the proceeding itself (e.g., court reporter) shall be borne equally by the parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be rendered within 30 calendar days of the close of the hearing or 30 calendar days after submission of post-hearing briefs, where applicable. The award of the- arbitrator shall constitute a final and binding resolution of the dispute with respect to all parties—the individual Musician(s), the Federation and its Locals, and the Employer. The arbitrator shall have the power and authority to issue an award that he/she may deem appropriate, but shall not have the power or authority to amend, add to or subtract from, or alter in any manner the provisions of this Agreement.
8.	Extension
Any of the time limits set forth above may be extended by mutual agreement in writing.

The Reporting Form shall accompany each payment required under this Agreement, with three copies sent to the applicable AFM Local, one copy sent to the AFM-EP Fund, and one copy retained by the Employer.

Instrumentalists, Leaders and Contractors shall be paid not less than the rates set forth below and the conditions set forth shall apply.
1.	Minimum Call Session
There shall be a minimum call session of one hour during which no more than three music tracks may be recorded, the total length of which may not exceed three minutes in the aggregate, except as provided in Articles IX and X. Musicians may be called on a staggered basis for the same session.
2.	Guaranteed Length of Call
Each call must be for a specified and guaranteed period of time, which may be extended although no Musician shall be obligated to more than 40 additional minutes without his/her consent.
3.	Overtime
A.	Continuous Overtime
Overtime continuously following a session, during which one additional one-minute music track may be recorded for each 20 minutes of such overtime (except as provided in Articles IX and X), shall be paid for in 20-minute increments. The overtime rate to be paid shall be based on the total number of Musicians who incur overtime. For one Musician the rate shall be one-third of the single Musician session fee rate for each 20-minute overtime increment. For two or more Musicians, the rate shall be one-third of the “2 or more” session fee rate for each 20-minute overtime increment.
B.	Non-Continuous Overtime
Any work which is not continuous shall be paid for as additional sessions. >
4.	Single Advertiser
Only commercial announcements advertising the products of a single advertiser may be made during any one session and the overtime related thereto.

With respect to any Musician for whom a session call is more than six hours—or for whom the session extends beyond six hours as a result of overtime—a meal period of not less than one-half hour nor more than one hour shall be provided not later than six hours after the Musician reports for work.

6.	Rest Periods
There shall be a rest period of not less than five minutes duration during the first hour of work. In each subsequent hour of work, there shall be a rest period of not less than ten minutes duration. Any breach of the foregoing shall require an additional payment equivalent to a 20-minute overtime increment.
7.	Contractor Required
If ten or more Side Musicians and Leader are employed for any session, a Contractor shall be employed with respect to said session. Such Contractor must be present during the entire recording session. The Contractor may be one of the Side Musicians. No person shall be employed as a Contractor (or continue in employment as a Contractor) who is disapproved by the Federation according to lists published by the Federation in the “International Musician” or to specific notice to the Employer provided that such disapproval shall not be predicated upon non-membership in the Federation under circumstances in which such membership may not be required lawfully.
. 8. Leaders And Contractors Paid Double
The base scale for Leaders and for Contractors shall be double the base scale of pay applicable to the Side Musicians employed in the session, but in any event, the base scale for any person performing both as Contractor and as Leader or Side Musician shall not exceed double Side Musician’s base scale.
When a Leader or Contractor also performs as a Side Musician, the scale payment for the Leader or the Contractor includes the performance of a single instrumental part. The scale payment for any additional instrumental part(s) as provided in Article VII (12) shall be the Side Musician’s scale rate for each such part.
9.	Single Musician
If only one person actually performs, whether or not more than one person has been engaged for the session, such sole performer shall be paid double the Side Musician’s base scale.
10.	Same Musician
The same Musician may not be reported on more than one line for the same instrument at any session, unless such Musician performs multiple instrumental parts as provided in Article VII (12). This provision shall not affect the right of any Musician to receive residual payments based on overscale.
11.	Doubling
When one or more doubles are played by any Instrumentalist in any one session and the overtime related thereto, for the first double, the Instrumentalist who doubles shall be paid not less than an additional 30% of the base scale otherwise applicable for the session and the overtime related thereto, plus an additional 15% of such base scale for each double beyond the first. When a Leader or Contractor doubles, the additional fee due shall be computed at the Side Musician’s base scale and not on the Leader or Contractor’s base scale even when the Leader is the only Musician employed to render services.

(iv)	Latin rhythm instruments: Any Latin instruments when used in less than eight bars in connection with any other instrument or used not in a rhythm pattern
B.	Electronic Device Doubling
If, in addition to the normal sound of an instrument, an electronic device (i.e., multiplex, divider, maestro, multiplier of octaves) is used to simulate other instrumental sounds, such use shall be construed as a double.
C.	Instruments Requested But Not Played
A $12.00 fee will be paid each Musician directed by the Employer or his representative to bring to an engagement an additional instrument, which would require a doubling fee if played, if such instrument is not actually played at the engagement,
12.	Multiple Parts
If a Musician performs multiple instrumental parts (other than doubles), he/she shall be paid the total of all payments which would otherwise have been payable had separate Musicians been used for those parts.
This provision shall also apply whenever the same music is played and recorded more than once and the tracks are combined in a manner which results in a final music track which sounds as if it had been recorded by a larger group of Musicians than actually rendered services.
Where a Musician is listed on more than one line on the Reporting Form because the Musician performed multiple parts, that fact should be identified on that Report.

ARTICLE VIII:	STANDARD RECORDING RATES
(Called National Recording Rates in previous Agreements)
1.	Base Scale—Session Fees
The Base Scale pay for each Side Musician employed on a session except for all Regional and Local Commercial Announcements (Article IX and Article X) shall be as follows:
No. of Musicians*
Base Scale Per Musician
Leader, Contractor, Single Musician....................... $212.00
Side Musician...................................................................................	$106.00
2.	Maximum Number of Commercials Per Session
A maximum of three commercial announcements may be claimed for any original one-hour minimum call session. One additional commercial announcement may be claimed for each additional 20 minutes or part thereof that has been paid as part of the original session.
In computing the maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed, the Employer shall be limited to the number of commercial announcements which may be claimed for the Side Musician with the lowest reported hours worked for such session (including overtime, if any). For purposes of this computation, the services of Arranger, Orchestrator or Copyist shall not be considered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any session where the music is produced entirely by means of synthesizers), no more than eight commercial announcements may be claimed even if the number of reported hours worked exceeds two hours and forty minutes.
Ex	ample A: For a session lasting two hours and forty minutes of consecutive time in the aggregate, hours worked are reported as follows:
Leader:................................................ 2:40
Side Musician A:....................................... 2:40
Side Musician B:....................................... 2:00
Side Musician C:....................................... 1:20
The maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed by the Employer for the session would be four (three for the initial hour, plus one for an additional twenty minutes), because the 1:20 reported for Side Musician C amounted to the lowest reported hours for any of the Musicians who performed at the session.
2nd printing 12/03/02
19
Television and Radio Commercial announcements Agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
Ex	ample B: Four music tracks are recorded in a session lasting one hour and twenty minutes of consecutive time in the aggregate and hours worked are reported as follows:
Leader:................................................ 1:20
Side Musicians A, B & C:..............................   1:20	each
Side Musician D:....................................... 1:00
Even though four tracks were actually recorded, the maximum number of commercial announcements which may be claimed by the Employer for the session would be three because the 1:00 reported for Side Musician D amounted to the lowest reported hours for any of the Musicians who performed at the session.
Payment for the initial use cycles of the first three commercial announcements incorporating any one of the tracks is covered by the Initial Use payment. If any one of the music tracks recorded at the session is incorporated into an additional commercial announcement or any subsequent commercial announcement, payment of the applicable use fee or re-use fee for the initial cycle shall be due to the Leader, Side Musician(s), Sideline Musician(s) and music preparation personnel who performed services on the tracks so used.

37
Television and Radio Commercial announcements Agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
D.	Informational and Promotional Changes
(1)	To make copy and/or video changes over the recorded music of a commercial, provided such changes are limited to destinations, points and times of departures, frequency of service, telephone numbers, rates, pricing, availability, dates, and dealer identification. Such changes may be made without creating new or additional commercials, provided all versions are identical except for changes otherwise permitted under this Article XII Editing.
(2)	To make copy and/or video changes over the recorded music of a commercial to reflect modifications necessary for short promotional messages. Such changes shall be limited to special offers, sales or giveaways, sweepstakes or sales events, whether offered by the advertiser or the designated dealer. These changes may be made without creating a new or additional commercial provided all versions are identical except for changes otherwise allowable under this Article XI Editing, and provided that:
(a)Thc promotion may be referenced only once, although it may appear anywhere in the commercial.
(b)The promotion must be in the nature of a “tag” as that term is commonly used in the industry.
For every 13-week cycle of use of any commercial incorporating any changes referred to in (1) and/or (2) above, including the first use cycle, the Musicians shall receive 200% of the applicable re-use fee set forth in Article XIV, Paragraph 5 at page 44 (e.g., $159.00 for a side musician who has not doubled and $318.00 for a leader/arranger/orchestrator/contractor).

Whenever a music track is mechanically shortened or lengthened to a different music track length, the Musicians whose services are utilized on the shortened or lengthened track shall be paid a dubbing fee.
2nd printing 12/03/02
38
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements Agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
B.	No Bearing on Total Length of Commercial
This mechanical editing provision applies only with respect to lengthening and/or shortening recorded music track(s) and bears no relationship whatsoever to the length of the commercial in which said music track(s) is incorporated or to the use of music tracks in the length originally recorded.
EXAMPLE:
(i)	In a two-hour session music tracks of the following lengths are recorded: 40 seconds, 30 seconds and 20 seconds. These music tracks may be used in a maximum of six commercials broadcast in the same medium. If two of said tracks are mechanically edited to 15 seconds and 10 seconds, two dubbing fee payments shall be made to the Musicians (one for the 15 second music track and one for the 10-second music track) regardless of whether or not the Employer has utilized all six commercials which he/she is entitled to pursuant to the original session. These two dubbing payments shall entitle the Employer to use the new 15-second music track in one commercial broadcast in the same medium and similarly the new 10-second length music track in one commercial broadcast in the same medium.
(ii)	In a one-hour session music tracks of the following lengths are recorded: 60 seconds and 30 seconds. These music tracks may be used in a maximum of three commercials broadcast in the same medium. If, after three commercials have been broadcast, it is decided to use the 30-second music track in two more commercials and the 60-second music track in one more commercial, three dubbing fees shall be due the Musicians for these additional three commercials broadcast in the same medium.
(iii)	In a one-hour session a 20-second music track is recorded; this music track may be used in a maximum of three commercial announcements broadcast in the same medium.
C.	Use Payments for a Mechanically Edited TV Commercial Broadcast Simultaneously with Original Commercial
With respect to television commercials only:
If the video portion of a commercial is mechanically edited to make a single shorter or longer commercial, and either:
(i)	the music track of both versions is identical, or
(ii)	the music track has been re-recorded solely for purposes of timing and synchronization or has been mechanically lengthened or shortened to fit a longer or shorter version,
Then, with respect to the second and all subsequent 13-week cycles, both the commercial and its version shall be considered a single commercial for the purpose of making use payments.
Imprinting 12/03/02
39
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
EXAMPLE:
(a)	A 30-second TV commercial contains a 12-second music track;
•	The video portion is mechanically edited to make a 15-second commercial; and
•	The identical 12-second music track is included in the 15-second version.
In this example, the 30-second commercial and 15-second version may be considered a single commercial commencing with the second 13-week use cycle because the music track of both versions is identical.
(b)	A 30-second TV commercial contains a 20-second music track;
•	The video portion is mechanically edited to make a 15-second commercial; and
•	The 20-second music track is mechanically shortened (not recorded "live") to 10 seconds to fit the 15-second version or the 20-second music track is re-recorded to 10 seconds to fit the 15-second version.
In this example, the 30-second commercial and 15-second version may be considered a single commercial commencing with the second 13-week use cycle because the music track was mechanically shortened to fit the shorter version or the music track was re-recorded solely for purposes of timing and synchronization to fit the shorter version.
Note, however, that payment of a Dubbing Fee shall be required when a mechanically edited music track is incorporated into a version under this Section. (See Article XII, Paragraph 3(A) of the Agreement.)
4.	Changes Required by Law, Broadcast Standards and Language Translations
The following alterations may be made in a commercial announcement without changing it into a new or additional commercial announcement for the purpose of this Agreement:
(a)	The on and/or off-camera message of a commercial announcement made for a designated advertiser and/or product shots contained therein may be varied (but only to the extent necessary) for compliance with legal requirements, broadcast standards and practices, and any other regulations which affect the acceptability of the commercial for broadcast. The Employer must advise the Office of the President of the Federation of each change made and the reasons therefor. This notice must be sent, whenever possible, before first air date, but in no event later than 10 business days after first air date.
(b)	The off-camera message of a commercial announcement or any words shown in a commercial announcement made for a designated advertiser may be recorded or translated in the United States or in Canada in any language.

ARTICLE XIV: USE/RE-USE
(Applicable to all Commercials except Regional, Local and Internet Commercial Announcements—Articles IX, X and XI)
1.	INITIAL USE
Upon the first use of a commercial announcement claimed for an original session occurring on or after May 1, 1991, a single, one-time payment at the applicable rate provided below (plus appropriate adjustment for doubling if any) shall be made to each Musician whose services are reported for such session, regardless of the hours of employment at the session:
Leader, Contractor, Single Musician...................... $60.00
Side Musician, Sideline Musician......................... $30.00
Orchestrator, Arranger................................... $60.00
Copyist.................................................. $30.00
Upon such payment, all of the commercial announcements claimed for the same session may be used during their respective initial use cycles commencing with their respective dates of first use, without additional payment.
The Initial Use cycle of a commercial announcement shall be a period of 13 weeks (“initial cycle”) from the date of first broadcast either by television stations or by radio stations.
2.	13-Week Re-Use Cycles
The first additional broadcast after the expiration of the initial cycle and in the same broadcast medium shall start a new 13-week cycle. The first broadcast in such broadcast medium following the second 13-week cycle shall start a new 13-week cycle, etc. The end of one 13-week cycle and the commencement of the next such cycle need not be contiguous.
3.	8-Week Use and Re-Use Cycles-Radio Commercials Only
Use cycles for radio commercials may be 8 weeks or 13 weeks, whichever the Employer elects. In those cases where the Employer elects to pay for an 8-week cycle,
•	the Use fee
•	the Re-Use fee
•	the Dubbing fee
•	the Conversion fee
shall be 80% of the 13-week Use fee, 80% of the Re-Use fee, 80% of the Dubbing fee or 80% of the Conversion fee, whichever applies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a music track for a television commercial produced under a prior AFM Television and Radio Commercial Announcement Agreement, if such track is dubbed into a radio commercial produced on or after May 1, 1987, the Conversion
2nd printing 12/03/02
43
Television and Radio Commercial Announcements agreement
October 17,2001 - October 16,2004
fee shall be 100% for the first such use cycle and the Re-Use fee shall be 80% for subsequent 8-week Re-Use cycles.
The session fee shall not be affected by this provision.
4.	Short Term Use
Upon payment of a dubbing fee, up to three different commercials made for the same advertiser > may be broadcast in a single medium during a period of 13 weeks from the date of first broadcast of the first commercial, provided that the three commercials are used for a period not to exceed ten weeks in the aggregate during the 13-week cycle.
EXAMPLE
A single Dubbing Fee is paid for TV use of Commercials A, B and C, all produced with the same Musicians and for the same advertiser. They are used during a 13-week cycle which starts 4/1 and ends 6/30 in the following manner:
Commercial A............1	week......................4/1	-	4/7
Commercial B............3	weeks.....................4/15	- 5/6
Commercial C............3	weeks.....................6/1	-	6/22
Aggregate Use:..........7	weeks
In this example all use of the three commercials is covered by payment of a single Dubbing Fee because the aggregate use is less than 10 weeks during the 13-week cycle.
5.	Use/Re-Use Rates
The 13-week and 8-week cycle payments for each commercial announcement made under this Agreement or music track converted for use in a different medium as described in Article XIV, Paragraph 6 below shall be made to each person covered by this Agreement as provided in the 13-Week and 8-Week Use/Re-Use Rate Schedules set forth on pages 44-45.
It is specifically intended that a commercial announcement which has not been changed, visually or orally, in any manner whatsoever may only be claimed as one commercial announcement.
If only one commercial announcement is produced using the music track(s) recorded at the session and such commercial announcement is not changed, visually or orally in any manner, each cycle beyond the first must be paid for at the applicable re-use fees. It is not permitted to produce one commercial only and declare two or three unless the second and third are different commercials either visually or orally.
