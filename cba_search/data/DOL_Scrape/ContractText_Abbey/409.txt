TO MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATES:
The Communications Workers of America is the recognized bargaining representative for all employees in the collective bargaining unit described in the General Agreement between Verizon Washington, DC Inc., Verizon Maryland Inc., Verizon Virginia Inc., Verizon West Virginia Inc., Verizon Services Corp., Verizon Advanced Data Inc. (“VADI”), Verizon Avenue Corp., Verizon South Inc. (Virginia) and Verizon Corporate Services Corp, (the “Companies”) and CWA. This relationship carries with it serious obligations and responsibilities which the Companies and the Union are determined to fulfill. As a sign of good faith between them, the Companies and the Union have included in this General Agreement, Article 10 - Responsible Union-Company Relationship.
What is meant by a “Responsible Union-Company Relationship"? While Article 10 does not change or modify the intent or meaning of the other articles of the General Agreement, here are some examples that both the Companies and the Union agree upon:
1.	The Union’s status as exclusive bargaining representative confers upon its Local and Union Representatives an equality of relationship with Company Representatives in the handling of appropriate matters between them. The Companies and the Union always will endeavor to deal reasonably and in good faith with the representatives of the other.
2.	There is no place in a relationship of mutual responsibility and respect for attempts to pull rank, or for words, written or spoken, or for other actions on the part of either Company or Union representatives which are intended or appear to belittle or undercut the representatives of the other party regarding any matter involved in the relationship. The Companies and the Union will do their best to see that this attitude is understood and practiced.
3.	Respect for the grievance procedure as a means for the orderly settlement of disputes and for the clarification of understanding in the application and interpretation of the terms of the General Agreement implies the genuine willingness of both parties to stand ready to find reasonable solutions to disputes before the procedure is invoked where feasible and prior to the conclusion of each succeeding step.
4.	In their endeavor to administer the grievance procedure fairly, the Companies and the Union will afford each other’s representatives an adequate opportunity to present each case properly and will give careful and respectful consideration to all views and facts presented. The Union agrees that the grievance procedure is not intended to be used and will not condone its use as an irritant or as a means of harassing management,
5.	The Companies are not anti-union and the Union is not antimanagement. Both parties believe that a strong and responsible Union that fairly represents employees will contribute more to the vitality and continued success of the business than will a weak and irresponsible Union. A member’s loyalty to the Union or his participation in legitimate Union activities will have no bearing on his treatment as an employee. Both parties also believe that it is to the best interests of employees and their Union that the Companies are financially sound and provide the best possible service to their customers at all times.
6.	The Companies and the Union affirm their responsibility to train and instruct their respective representatives in the meaning and spirit of the General Agreement to the end that their relations will be conducted in a businesslike manner at all times in an atmosphere free from harassment, attempted humiliation, browbeating or threats of intimidation.
In summary, the Companies and CWA pledge themselves to continuous and sincere effort to work together harmoniously each respecting the rights and viewpoints of the other, to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings which may exist or develop between them.

However, time limits for presentation of a grievance may not be extended. Steps may be waived by written agreement between the Company’s appropriate Director or his designated representative and the International Representative of the Union.

Art. 16A
may accelerate a wage increase, but not for more than six (6) months on the applicable Wage Schedule or for employees who have less than eight (8) months of continuous service.

SECTION 4.	The basic weekly wage rates and the maximum wage rates provided for the various job classifications in the Exhibit of wage schedules attached are based upon the hours comprising the present normal work week for full-time employees.

Art. 17
SECTION 6.	CPS Distribution Calculations.
(a)	Standard Award. The “Standard" CPS Distribution shall be as follows:
Performance Year	Standard CPS Distributions	Year Payable
2003	$500	2004
2004	$500	2005
2005	$500	2006
2006	$500	2007
2007	$500	2008
(b)	Performance Percentage. The actual CPS Distribution per eligible employee will be calculated by multiplying the “Standard" CPS Distribution by a “Performance Percentage" for the Plan Year that shall not be less than 0% and not more than 200%. The “Performance Percentage" shall be based on the performance percentage that is applicable to the financially driven component of the short-term annual cash incentive award (the “STIP" award) payable for that performance year to the Chief Executive Officer(s) of Verizon Communications (the “CEO"). The Performance Percentage for this Plan for a given year shall bear the same relationship to 200% as the performance percentage that is awarded to the CEO for financial results in that year bears to the maximum percentage available to the CEO for financial results under the STIP plan. For example, for any performance year in which the performance modifier for the CEO is based on a range from 0% to 200%, then the Performance Percentage under this Plan shall be equal to the performance modifier applicable to the CEO for the same performance year. For any performance year in which the performance modifier for the CEO is based on a range from 0% to 100%, then the Performance Percentage under this Plan shall be equal to the product of two times the performance modifier applicable to the CEO for the same performance year.
(c)	Minimum Payout. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the minimum distribution for Performance Year 2003 will be $500, the minimum distribution for Performance Year 2004 will be $550, and the minimum distribution for Performance Year 2005 will be $600; the minimum distribution for Performance Year 2006 will be $650, and the minimum distribution for Performance Year 2007 will be $700, subject in all cases to prorating under Section 3.
28
Art. 17
SECTION 7.	Information Requests. The Company agrees to pro-vide to the Union upon request with publicly disclosed information about the STIP compensation of the CEO. With respect to information not publicly disclosed, the Company will only provide the Union with the following:
(a)	A copy of the approved STIP achievement scale for the performance year, which sets out the financially driven performance modifiers that would be applicable to various financial results for the year. The unions will treat this information as confidential and proprietary information and will not disclose the information to any person for any purpose other than monitoring the administration of the CPS program.
(b)	A report on the outcomes of the factors that affect the financially driven component of the CEO’s STIP award for a performance year. This information will be provided as soon as practicable after the end of the performance year.
(c)	A summary of the total CPS distribution payments which eligible employees received under the Plan. This information will be provided as soon as practicable following the end of the Plan Year.
SECTION 8.	Payment of CPS Distributions. CPS Distributions, when earned, will be paid by separate payroll remittance (EFT or check) not later than March 15th of the year immediately following the Plan Year. For eligible employees who are no longer employed at the time of payment, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to pay the CPS award if it sends payment to the eligible recipient's last known address. Each such payment shall be subject to the applicable federal withholding rate for non-recurring payments (currently, a 28% flat rate), and other applicable payroll taxes.
SECTION 9.	Benefit-Bearing Treatment of CPS Distribution.
When paid, a CPS distribution will be treated as eligible benefitbearing pay solely for the following purposes:
(a)	The CPS distribution will be taken into account for purposes of the Supplemental Monthly Pension calculation under the qualified pension plan.
(b)	The CPS distribution shall be treated as eligible benefit-bearing pay which may be contributed to the qualified Savings and Security Plan according to the same contribution percentage
29
Art. 18
(if any) as is in effect for regular wages at the time the CPS distribution is paid (and the same terms and conditions for pre-tax or after-tax treatment, and for qualifying for applicable company matching contributions).
(c)	To the extent that an employee is eligible for the one-times-pay death benefit under the qualified pension plan (subject to applicable caps on such death benefit), the last CPS distribution paid to an employee prior to an employee’s death shall be taken into account (to the extent it does not cause the death benefit to exceed the applicable cap).
(d)	The last CPS distribution paid to an employee prior to an employee’s death shall be taken into account under the terms of the group term life insurance plan for active employees.
(e)	The CPS distribution may be taken into account for union dues to the extent determined appropriate by the union representing the employee.
CPS distributions will not be included in calculations for any other purposes.
SECTION 10.	Grievances and Arbitration. The employee’s employing company shall have the discretion to administer this Plan according to its terms. The employing company's interpretations and determinations under this Plan shall be final and binding. The employee's union representative may present grievances relating to matters covered by the Plan but neither the Plan nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration, except that the limited issue of an employee's eligibility to participate in a specific distribution under the Plan shall be arbitrable. Any “make-whole" arbitration award (which reinstates an employee with full back pay) shall include any applicable CPS distribution for the Plan Year in which the employee had been separated from employment if the employee was otherwise eligible and did not otherwise receive a distribution for the applicable Plan Year.
Article 18.	- Special City Allowance
SECTION 1.	An employee whose assigned reporting location on a particular day is within the corporate city limits of Baltimore, Maryland or Washington, DC, will be paid a Special City Allowance of $2.00 for each day he works after reporting at such assigned reporting location.
30
AH. 19
SECTION 2.

Article 21.	- Promotional Wage Adjustments
SECTION 1.	Promotional pay adjustments shall apply for employees who are promoted to another job title having a higher maximum rate, except that this Article shall not apply to employees transferred between equivalent jobs as defined in Article 23, Section 1(e).
SECTION 2.	The employee shall be given a promotional pay
* The additional compensation provided for in this Section is in lieu of any daily overtime or premium payments which might otherwise be applicable, except as provided for under Article 24, Section 3 of this Agreement. (49th hour provision)

Art. 21
adjustment on the date of the promotion. The promotional pay adjustment shall be to the highest of the basic weekly wage rates resulting from the computation of the TYPE ONE, the TYPE TWO and TYPE THREE adjustments described in Sections 3, 4 and 5 below.
SECTION 3.	The TYPE ONE adjustment shall be computed by applying the employee’s wage experience credit to the wage schedule applicable to the assignment to which the employee is being promoted to determine the equivalent weekly wage; provided that:
(a)	The resulting basic weekly wage rate shall not be less than the starting rate for the new assignment.
(b)	An employee promoted from a job classification in Category II to another job classification in Category II shall not receive a basic weekly wage less than the basic weekly wage he was receiving in the old assignment.
(c)	Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) above, a resulting adjustment shall not be more than ten dollars ($10) per week; provided that if the employee had been receiving the maximum rate for the job from which he is promoted for a period of six (6) months or more, the next regular increase on the new wage schedule shall be added to the adjustment so computed.
SECTION 4.	The TYPE TWO adjustment shall be computed by applying the employee’s wage experience credit to the wage schedule applicable to the new job classification to determine the equivalent basic weekly wage; provided that:
(a)	The equivalent basic weekly wage so determined first shall be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 below if applicable; and then
(b)	Increased in the amount of the next regular increase on the new wage schedule if the employee had been receiving the maximum rate for the job from which he is promoted for a period of six (6) months or more.
SECTION 5.	The TYPE THREE adjustment shall be computed by applying the employee’s net credited service to the wage schedule applicable to the new job classification and establishing the employee’s new basic weekly wage rate on the closest lower full
33
Art. 21
step; provided that the new basic weekly wage so determined shall be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 below if applicable.
SECTION 6.	If the promotion is from a job title in a different Job Title Group to a job title in Job Title Groups 5, 6, 7, 9,10 or 11, the resulting basic weekly wage rate shall not exceed the step down rate for the new assignment, except for promotions from Job Title Group 6 to Job Title Group 7.
SECTION 7.	The increase interval for the employee’s first regular increase following the promotional pay adjustment shall be computed from the first of the month nearest the date of the promotional adjustment,
(a)	and an employee who received a TYPE ONE or TYPE TWO adjustment and whose basic weekly wage was less than the maximum rate for the assignment from which he was promoted shall have his next regular increase interval adjusted on a pro rata basis. For example; if three-fourths of the employee’s normal interval had expired on the schedule for his old assignment, credit shall be given for three-fourths of the interval on the schedule for his new assignment. The provisions of this paragraph (a) do not apply to promotions to Category IV job classifications or to employees whose promotional wage adjustment after the application of Section 6 above resulted in a basic weekly wage exactly on the step down point for their new assignment.
(b)	and an employee who received a TYPE ONE or TYPE TWO adjustment and who had been receiving the maximum rate for his former job classification prior to promotion for a period of less than the next increase interval for the new assignment shall be granted the next regular increase after the regular increase period for the new assignment has elapsed with the interval computed from the date the employee was granted the maximum rate for the old assignment. The provisions of this paragraph (b) do not apply to promotions to Category IV job classifications.
(c)	and an employee who received a TYPE THREE adjustment shall be granted as a credit against the next regular increase interval that net credited service (rounded to the nearest whole month) that is in excess of the closest lower full step on his new wage schedule. The provisions of this paragraph (c) do
34
Art. 22
not apply to employees whose promotional adjustment after the application of Section 6 above resulted in a basic weekly wage exactly on the step down point for their new assignment.
SECTION 8.	If an employee is both assigned to a new location and promoted to another job classification having a higher maximum rate, the wage treatment specified in Article 23-Transfer and Reassignment, shall first be applied before computing the promotional pay adjustment.
SECTION 9,	In the application of this Article, no employee shall receive any increase in an amount in excess of that required to reach the maximum wage rate specified under the wage schedule applicable to the employee’s new job classification.
Article 22.	- Temporary Assignments
SECTION 1.	On any day during which an employee in Categories II, III, IV or B is temporarily assigned by the Company to a position in the bargaining unit with a different maximum rate than his regular assignment, his normal daily tour shall be considered to be the normal daily tour for his regular assignment.
SECTION 2.	On any day during which an employee in Categories II, III, IV or B is temporarily assigned by the Company to a position in the bargaining unit with a higher maximum rate than that of the employee's regular assignment and assumes full responsibility in and takes over all work associated with the position for at least the number of hours equal to a full session or half tour, the employee for that day shall receive one-fifth of the difference in maximum basic weekly rates between the two wage schedules involved; provided that in no case shall an individual employee be so assigned for more than sixty (60) calendar days for any one period or assignment.
SECTION 3.	On any day during which an employee, pursuant to a temporary assignment, relieves a management employee for at least the number of hours equal to a full session or half-tour, such employee shall receive an additional $10 per day. A temporary assignment to management relief of sixty (60) calendar days for any one period or assignment must be followed by thirty (30) calendar days without temporary assignment to management relief.
SECTION 4.	On any day during which an employee, other than a Category IV employee, is assigned to provide formal training to
35
Art. 23
another employee or employees and does so for at least the number of hours equal to a half tour, such employee shall receive an additional ten dollars ($10.00) for that day and for hours equal to a full tour of formal training, such employees shall receive fifteen dollars ($15.00) for that day. An employee is “assigned to provide formal training" when such employee is directed by the Company to give instruction, other than on-the-job coaching, using Company provided media designed exclusively for formal training purposes, such as course guides, work books, work samples and audio-visual aids. Such an assignment may also include a directive to report back to supervision the results of written tests or other formal measures of the trainee’s(s') ability to learn and perform the work which is the subject of the formal instruction.
SECTION 5.	During the period of any temporary assignment covered by the preceding sections of this Article, the employee shall be given wage progression treatment according to the schedule for his regularly assigned job and in computing this wage progression treatment, the payments provided for above shall be disregarded.
SECTION 6. The payments provided for in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall be considered part of the employee's basic hourly rate only for the purpose of computing daily or weekly overtime payments where applicable under the provisions of this Agreement.
Article 23.-	Transfer and Reassignment
SECTION 1. An employee's basic wage shall be adjusted during the term of this Agreement in the event of a change (other than one of a temporary nature) in the employee's assignment or location, based upon the Company’s determination that any one of the following conditions exists:
(a)	Transfers of employees from one Locality Wage Group to another Locality Wage Group without a change in job title and from one job title to another job title with the same maximum rate.
(b)	Demotions.
(c)	Reductions in work requirements which result in reassignment of employees to a lower paid job classification.
(d)	Return to original assignment by an employee who had
36
received an increase incident to a temporary transfer or a temporary promotion.
(e)	Transfers of employees between equivalent jobs. “Equivalent jobs” are defined as:
(1)	Entry 1-B Clerk and Entry 1-111 Clerk
(2)	Entry 3-B Clerk and Entry 3-III Clerk
(3)	Semi-Skilled 2-B Clerk, Semi-Skilled 2-III Clerk and Operator
(4)	Skilled 1-B Clerk, Skilled 1-111 Clerk, Service Assistant, and Senior Traffic Office Clerk.
SECTION 2.
(a)	If an employee is transferred to a new location without a change in job title or job classification or is transferred to an equivalent job in a different classification (with or without a change in work location), his basic weekly wage shall be adjusted on the date of transfer to the extent of any "wage rate differential” existing between the locations and/or the classifications involved in the transfer. The "wage rate differential" shall be computed as follows:
(1)	The employee’s basic weekly wage at the time of transfer shall be applied to the wage schedule applicable to the old assignment and the cumulative number of months corresponding to such a basic weekly wage shall be determined.
(2)	The period so determined in (1) shall then be applied to the wage schedule applicable to the assignment to which the employee is being transferred, and the equivalent basic weekly wage shall be determined.
(3)	The “wage rate differential" shall then be determined by taking the basic weekly wage which the employee was receiving at the time of the transfer and the basic weekly wage determined in (2) above and subtracting the lower from the higher. The difference thus obtained shall be the "wage rate differential”.
(b)	If an employee is assigned to another job title with an associated wage schedule having the same or a lower maximum rate:
Art. 23
(1)	The employee's basic weekly wage at the time of the reassignment shall be applied to the wage schedule applicable to the assignment from which he is being reassigned and the cumulative number of months corresponding to such basic weekly wage shall be determined. The period of time so determined shall then be applied to the wage schedule applicable to the assignment to which the employee is being reassigned, and the equivalent basic weekly wage shall be determined. However, if an employee, within six (6) months after having been assigned to a job title with an associated wage schedule higher than his former job title, elects to be returned or is returned to the former job title upon return to his former job title his basic weekly wage shall be the rate he would have been paid had he remained continuously in the former job title.
(2)	An employee assigned to a Category IV job title with an associated wage schedule having a lower maximum rate, whose cumulative number of months, as determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this Section, does not correspond to an established wage schedule step applicable to the Category IV job, shall have his basic weekly wage adjusted to the next higher wage schedule step.
(3)	However, in no case, in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), shall the basic weekly wage paid in the new assignment be greater than the maximum rate for that assignment except as may be provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 2. Nor shall the basic weekly wage be less than the rate paid if the employee had been engaged in and remained continuously in the new assignment after taking into consideration any previous starting rate adjustment and any previous accelerated wage increases.
(c)	Where the wage adjustment specified in this SECTION 2 would result in a decrease in the basic weekly wage of an employee who is reassigned or transferred at the Company's initiative after having been in the job from which the transfer or reassignment is being effected for more than six (6) months, the Company shall elect either to:
(1)	Defer subsequent regular increases in an aggregate amount equivalent to the amount of the adjustment, or
(2)	Decrease the employee’s basic weekly wage in reason
38
Art. 23
able steps to the wage applicable to the new assignment; provided, however, that if the wage adjustment is ten percent (10%) or less (or, in the case of a transfer between equivalent jobs, seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) or less), the full adjustment shall be made on the date of the transfer or reassignment.
(d)	The increase interval for the employee’s first regular increase following the transfer or reassignment shall be computed as follows:
(1)	If the maximum wage rate for the new assignment is higher than that for the old assignment, and if
the employee’s basic wage rate was less than the maximum rate for the job classification (prior to the transfer or reassignment), the next regular increase interval shall be computed from the first of the month nearest the date of the transfer or reassignment, and in these cases the increase interval shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis. For example, if three-fourths of the employee’s normal increase interval had expired on the schedule for his old assignment, credit shall be given for three-fourths of the interval on the schedule for his new assignment. The provisions of this paragraph a. do not apply to reassignments to Category IV job classifications.
the employee had been receiving the maximum rate of the job classification (prior to the transfer or reassignment) for a period as long or longer than the next increase interval for the new assignment, the next regular increase shall be granted at the time of transfer or reassignment.
the employee had been receiving the maximum rate for the job classification (prior to the transfer or reassignment) for a period of less than the next increase interval for the new assignment, the next regular increase shall be computed from the first of the month nearest the date of the transfer or reassignment. Such regular increase shall be granted after the regular increase period for the new assignment has elapsed, computed from the date the employee was granted the maximum rate for the old assignment. The provi
39
Art. 23
sions of this paragraph c. do not apply to reassignments to Category IV job classifications.
(2)	If the maximum wage rate for the new assignment is less than that for the old assignment, and if the employee’s basic wage rate is less than the maximum rate tor the new assignment, the next regular increase interval shall be computed from the first of the month nearest the date of the transfer or reassignment and, in these cases, the increase interval shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis.
(e)	The wage adjustments provided for in this Section may be deferred or withheld by the Company in individual cases if, in its judgment, the employee does not merit such increase or adjustment.
(f)	An employee whose assigned reporting location on a particular day is within a Locality Wage Group with a higher maximum rate for his job title, shall be paid a daily “locality wage allowance" for each day he works after reporting at such assigned reporting location.
The “locality wage allowance" shall be one-fifth of the difference in maximum basic weekly rates between the two wage schedules involved.
The “locality wage allowance” shall be considered part of the employee's basic wage rate only for the purpose of computing daily or weekly overtime payments where applicable under provisions of this Agreement.
Not more than one “locality wage allowance" will be paid to an employee on any one day regardless of the number of times the employee reports to a qualified location during that day.
SECTION 3.	When an employee is reassigned (on other than a temporary basis) at the initiative of the Company to a work location which is at least thirty-five (35) miles farther from his residence than the distance between his residence and his former location, the employee may elect one of the following options:
(a)	move his household within a period of twelve (12) months following the first day of reporting at the new location, and receive relocation reimbursement as specified in Section 4(b).
40
Art. 23
(b)	commute daily from his household to the new location and receive commutation allowances as specified in Section 5.
SECTION 4.	If the employee elects option (a) of Section 3 above, the following shall apply:
(a)	The employee shall suffer no loss of regular pay for reasonable time off to arrange for the moving of household goods and personal effects and travel time to the new home location.
(b)	The employee will be reimbursed by expense voucher up to a maximum aggregate amount of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for the following actual expenditures reasonably incurred by him in conjunction with such move:
(1)	Moving expenses incurred for household goods and personal effects.
(2)	Travel ($.09 per mile if personal vehicle is used), meals and lodging expenses incurred for self and members of immediate family in connection with the final trip from the former residence.
(3)	Travel ($.09 per mile if personal vehicle is used), meals and lodging expenses incurred in connection with premove househunting trip(s) and interim living for employee at new work location for meals and lodging only for up to thirty (30) consecutive days. Provided, however, that there shall be a limit of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) on expenditures reimbursed pursuant to this subparagraph (3).
(4)	Lease cancellation fees, selling and buying costs tor housing. Provided, however, that there shall be a limit of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) plus any unused amount in subparagraph (3) above on expenditures reimbursed pursuant to this subparagraph (4).
SECTION 5.	If the employee elects option (b) of Section 3 above, the employee shall be entitled to receive monthly commutation allowances as long as he commutes daily from his household to the new location, as follows:
(a)	The Company shall determine the Commuting Mileage Factor (“CMF”) by subtracting the road miles between the employee’s residence and his former work location (using the most direct
41
Art. 24
commonly-traveled route) from the road miles between his residence and his new work location (using the most direct, commonly-traveled route).
(b)	To determine the monthly allowance, the Company shall multiply the “CMF” by $2.00.
(c)	An employee who ceases commuting to his household shall notify the Company immediately and monthly allowances shall be discontinued effective as of the termination of daily commutation.
(d)	An employee who moves his household to a new location while receiving commutation allowances shall notify the Company no later than five (5) days following the move. The “CMP will be adjusted using the formula specified in (a) above with the new residence substituted for his former residence. If the resulting “CMF” is greater, the monthly allowance will not be adjusted. If the resulting “CMP is smaller, but at least 35, the monthly allowance will be reduced effective as of the date of the employee’s move. If the resulting "CMP is less than 35, commutation allowances will be discontinued effective as of the date of the employee’s move.
(e)	Monthly commutation allowances shall not exceed $300.
(f)	No commutation allowances will be paid for months that extend beyond the second anniversary of the employee's report date at the new work location.

SECTION 4.	For the purpose of computing overtime and premium payments in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, in a week in which a holiday is observed pursuant to Article 30 on Monday through Friday inclusive, employees excused from work on that day shall be considered to have worked a normal daily tour.
SECTION 5.	Sunday Premiums. All work performed by employees within a normal daily tour, except while on Emergency Call-Out, Article 27, which begins on a Sunday (this being a Sunday tour) shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half times the employee’s basic hourly rate.

A Category IV employee assigned by the Company to work three or more consecutive Sunday tours, shall be paid for time worked on the third consecutive Sunday and each subsequent consecutive Sunday, additional compensation computed at one-half the employee’s basic hourly rate (one-half the employee's straight-time rate). For the purpose of administering this latter provision, a Category IV employee who is assigned to work on a Sunday and who voluntarily effects a change with some other employee to work for her shall not be deemed to have interrupted the continuity of her assigned Sundays but that Sunday shall be considered as a Sunday off for the said other employee in determining the continuity of her assigned Sundays.
SECTION 6.	Holiday Overtime. All employees shall be paid at the rate of two and one-half times their basic hourly rate for all time worked on a holiday observed pursuant to Article 30 in excess of a normal daily tour for a full-time employee; provided that any holiday overtime hours so compensated shall be credited against any hours for which overtime payments are required under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article.

Article 25.	- Work Schedules and Changes in Scheduled Work Time
SECTION 1.	Work schedules shall be established by the Company for Category I, II, III, A and B employees. These schedules shall show the time the employee’s normal tour starts and ends on each day of the normal work week, provided that such schedules may be changed by the Company at any time in order to meet work requirements and service conditions subject, however, to Sections 2 and 3 of this Article. Work schedules shall be posted by 6:00 P.M. of the Monday of the preceding week in advance of the first day of the employee’s first normal work week shown on such schedules.
SECTION 2.	When the Company assigns a Category I, II, III, A or B employee to work on a day on which no tour has previously been scheduled, the employee’s scheduled work time on another day of the same normal work week may be reduced by a corresponding amount, provided he is notified of the change prior to 5:00 P.M. of the second calendar day preceding the day of the added assignment or the day of the decreased assignment whichever is earlier.
If the employee is not notified of the change by Company within the time prescribed in the preceding paragraph, he may, not later than the end of the added assignment, elect to work the day on which he was previously assigned to work in addition to the added assignment. If the employee so advises that he elects to work his previously scheduled day in addition to his added assignment, his previously scheduled normal work week will remain unchanged. However, in respect to the added assignment under such circum
44
Art. 25
stances, only the hours actually worked will be paid for. If the employee elects not to work the hours specified in his previously scheduled normal work week in addition to the added assignment, his work time on one of the previously scheduled days in the same calendar week will be reduced to the extent of the additional assignment and the added assignment will be considered a part of his scheduled normal work week.
SECTION 3.	When the Company changes the starting and quitting time of a Category I, II, III, A or B employee’s previously scheduled tour without giving notification to the employee of such change before 5:00 PM. of the second calendar day preceding the day on which the change is to be made, the employee may elect to work the hours of his previously scheduled normal daily tour (or half tour) in addition to the newly assigned hours.
If the employee’s previously scheduled tour entitled him to an evening or night differential under Article 19, Section 1, and the employee, having elected to work all or part of his previously scheduled tour, does work between 5:00 P.M. and 8:00 AM, he shall be paid the differential in accordance with Article I9, Section 1.
SECTION 4.	The work time for employees called in to work a nonscheduled normal daily tour or half tour before the assigned starting time for such tour but on such short notice that they cannot report for work until after such assigned starting time shall be considered as beginning at the assigned starting time.
SECTION 5.	Employees who by pre-arrangement are assigned to work non-scheduled time (which may be on a sixth day) which is less than half of a normal daily tour for full-time employees and which is not consecutive with a normal tour or half tour win receive the same treatment as herein provided for Emergency Call-Outs, except that work time shall be considered as starting when the employee leaves his residence to proceed by the most direct route to the work location. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to part-time employees hired on or after January 1, 1981, and assigned to work in Phone-Center Stores, Bell Customer Service Centers, Bell Phone Booths (KIOSKS), DM/DR (Direct Marketing/Direct Response) Centers and any equivalent retail sales or Service Center operations.

Article 26.	■ Inclement Weather
SECTION 1. Category I employees normally assigned to outdoor work will be provided with other assignments when the Company determines that on account of weather conditions they are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties during their regularly scheduled working time. When the Company determines that on account of weather conditions such employees are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties on a non-scheduled day, they may be excused or assigned other duties, after reporting to work, for all or part of their normal tours; provided, however, that in such case the employee shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours pay computed at his basic hourly rate.
Article 27.	- Emergency Call-Outs
SECTION 1.	An "emergency call-out” is a request to report to work on a non-scheduled day or during non-scheduled hours to work an unspecified period of time provided the employee is requested to report to work as soon as possible after receiving the request. A request that an employee work a changed or additional normal tour (or half tour), or work in excess of a normal tour (or half tour), shall not be treated as an “emergency call-out.”
SECTION 2.	In cases where an employee receives an emergency call-out, work time shall be considered as starting when the employee is called and if he returns to his residence before starting his scheduled normal tour (or half tour), his work time shall be considered as ending upon his arrival at his residence. In cases where the employee starts his scheduled normal tour (or half tour), his emergency call-out shall end upon the starting of such tour.
SECTION 3.
(a)	Time worked on emergency call-outs on weekdays shall be compensated for at one and one-half times the employee’s
46
Art. 27
basic hourly rate; provided that any time which is compensated for at the rate of time and one-half (except Sunday time as covered in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this Article) shall be credited against any overtime payments required under Article 24.
(b)	Time worked on emergency call-outs on holidays observed pursuant to Article 30, shall be compensated for at one and one-half times the employee’s basic hourly rate for all hours worked up to the number of hours in a normal daily tour for a full-time employee. On such a holiday all time worked on emergency call-outs in excess of a normal daily tour for a full-time employee shall be compensated for at two and one-half times the employee’s basic hourly rate; provided that any holiday hours in excess of a normal tour compensated for at two and one-half times the employee’s basic hourly rate shall be credited against any hours for which overtime payments are required under Article 24.
SECTION 4.

Art. 34
SECTION 2.	Except as otherwise provided in Section 1 of this Article, payments made under any of the above provisions shall be at the employee's basic hourly rate and shall be limited to scheduled normal daily tours within the employee’s normal work week.

Article 34.	- Seniority
SECTION 1.	Seniority shall be based on net credited service except that during any period of part-time employment, seniority shall be accrued on a pro rata basis; that is, hours of work for part-time employment up to the number of hours per day or per week which constitute respectively a normal daily tour or a normal work week for a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group shall be accumulated, and for each accumulation of 150 such hours actually worked, the seniority shall be increased by one month. For purposes of accruing seniority but not net credited service, “hours of work" for part-time employees shall include paid hours classified as vacation, excused or absence time and shall be accumulated and updated on Company records in April and October of each year.*
SECTION 2.	The Company, in selecting employees for promotions to bargained-for positions with a higher maximum rate, agrees to adhere to the principle that the primary factors governing such selections will be the qualifications of the candidates being considered, provided; that the reclassification of employees to equivalent jobs with higher maximum rates shall not be considered promotions within the meaning of this Section. The employee whom Company finds is best qualified for a given position in the light of these factors will be selected; however, where the Company finds the qualifications of two or more employees substantially the same, it will select from among them the employee with the greatest amount of seniority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
•Effective April 1, 1996.
64
Art. 34
prevent Company from promoting employees for unusually meritorious service or exceptional ability.
SECTION 3.	In requiring the transfer of employees to “equivalent jobs” as defined in Article 23, Section 1 (e), the Company shall adhere to the principle of seniority based on net credited service and shall require such transfers of employees in the relevant work group, as designated by the Company, to be made in inverse order of seniority, subject to the Company’s determination of qualifications of individual employees to perform the assignment.
SECTION 4.	To the extent permitted by work requirements, service conditions and the ability of the employee, seniority shall be the controlling factor in the selection of vacation periods by all employees, except Category IV, within each work group as determined by the Company.
SECTION 5.	To the extent permitted by work requirements, service conditions and the ability of the employee, seniority shall be the controlling factor in the selection of tours for employees in Categories I, II, III, A and B within each work group. The work group shall be as determined by the Company. Assignment of tours may also be made based on arrangements other than seniority, with agreement of employees within the work group to be assigned; provided that in so doing, no employee’s seniority rights shall be abridged. Seniority shall be the controlling factor in the selection of part-time tours by part-time employees in the work group.
SECTION 6. It is agreed that employees in Categories I, II, III, A and B, subject to tour selection, shall normally be allowed to select tours, generally not less than every four weeks nor more than six weeks; provided, however, that such selections may be made more or less frequently when Company determines that force and service conditions require. When the Company determines that service and force conditions in a work group require the posting of work schedules on a weekly basis, the Company shall employ open scheduling and affected employees shall be entitled to change their recorded tour preferences at any time prior to the commencement of the weekly cycle of schedule preparation; provided, however, that the Company will not schedule Category I employees on a weekly basis.
SECTION 7.	Employees in Categories I, II, III, A and B, subject to tour selection, who are hired, promoted, transferred in, returning
65
Art. 34
from leave of absence, or otherwise added to the work group shall at the time of addition be assigned to an available tour in the schedule of the work group. When a new choice of tours is selected by the work group, these employees shall be allowed to select their tours in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of this Article.
SECTION 8.	To the extent permitted by work requirements and service conditions, seniority based on net credited service shall govern the selection or assignment of tours and vacations within each job classification in each central office unit for all employees in Category IV. Seniority shall be the controlling factor in the selection of part-time tours by part-time employees in the work group.
SECTION 9.	The Company shall employ open scheduling in assigning Category IV employees to tours on a weekly basis and central office employees in this category shall be entitled to change their recorded tour preferences at any time prior to the commencement of the weekly cycle of schedule preparation.
SECTION 10.	Category IV employees who are transferred into central office operating job classifications, shall be assigned whatever vacant tours remain on the schedule at the time of transfer without depriving any present employee of the tour that employee then is entitled to. As vacancies occur through resignation, promotions, transfers out, or other causes, the employees shall step into such vacancies on the seniority list until they have attained their proper place in the schedule in accordance with their seniority, but not later than the starting date for the first selection of tours on the basic schedule after the transfer to the office involved.
SECTION 11.	The term ‘'Tour” in this Article refers only to the hours assigned by the Company for the normal daily tours comprising the normal work weeks on the posted schedule.
SECTION 12.	Numerous considerations are involved in the Company's determination of which employees should be selected for job related training. Included among those factors are the seniority, ability and job performance of the employees as well as the force and service conditions of the business.
SECTION 13.	It is agreed that questions of seniority may be referred to the grievance procedure, but neither the provisions of this Article nor its interpretation or application shall be subject to arbitration, with the sole exception that the provisions of Section 2
66
Art. 35
may be arbitrated only on the issue of whether the Company has acted reasonably in its selection of an employee for promotion. Notwithstanding the time provisions of Article 13, Section 1(e), no arbitral determination pursuant to this Section shall have retroactive back pay effect more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the Arbitrator’s decision.
Article 35.	- Force Adjustment, Layoff, Part-timing and Rehiring After Layoff
SECTION 1.	Whenever, in the judgment of the Company, there exists an occasion to adjust force because of technological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of operation), or for reasons other than technological change, the Company shall determine the extent of the adjustment required, the effective date or dates thereof, and the job titles, work groups and localities affected.
SECTION 2.	Prior to taking any steps under this Article which may require part-timing, reassignment to lower paid job titles or classifications, involuntary transfer which necessitates a change in residence (i.e., to a work location which is at least thirty-five (35) miles farther from his residence than the distance from his residence to his existing work location), termination or layoff of regular employees, except regular term employees, the Company, where Article 36A applies, shall offer the benefits provided by such Article pursuant to the terms of, and to the extent authorized by, said Article to eligible employees in the work groups and localities affected.
SECTION 3.	If, in the judgment of the Company, additional force adjustments are required that may require part-timing, reassignment to lower paid job titles or classifications, involuntary transfer which necessitates a change in residence, termination or layoff of regular employees, except regular term employees, the Company shall give at least ninety (90) days notice to the Union of its intention to make force adjustments and negotiate with the Union about the method or methods to be used. If an agreement as to the method or methods to be used is not reached by the Company and the Union within thirty (30) days from the date that the Company notified the Union, the Company may then proceed as hereinafter outlined in this Article.
SECTION 4.	Sixty (60) days prior to the effective date or dates of the force adjustment the Company shall inform the Union of any
67
Art. 35
job vacancies which it determines are available to employees in the affected job titles, work groups and localities.
The Company shall offer those vacancies which it determines are available to the affected regular employees, except regular term employees, (excluding those vacancies in jobs which would result in promotions for the affected employees) in seniority order, subject to the Company's determination of an employee’s ability to perform satisfactorily the work in the vacancy of his choice. An employee shall have a maximum of seven (7) calendar days following the Company's offer in which to indicate his choice with respect to the available vacancy(ies).
(a)	If pursuant to this Section an affected employee is reassigned to an available job vacancy which requires a change in residence the Company shall offer the employee the options provided in Article 23, Section 3.
(b)	If pursuant to Article 34, Section 2 an affected employee is selected for and accepts a promotion to a job classification with a higher maximum rate at a work location which requires a change in residence the Company shall offer the employee the options provided in Article 23, Section 3, provided the Company determines that such promotion will reduce the need to take any of the steps set out in Section 5(a), (b) and (c) of this Article.
(c)	If pursuant to this Section an affected employee is limited in his choice of an available job to either: (1) a work location which requires a change in residence; or (2) a lower paid job title or classification, except a job title in an equivalent job classification as defined in Article 23, Section 1 (e), the employee may elect not to accept such reassignment and shall be paid a termination allowance pursuant to Section 7 of this Article. Provided, however, that if such employee has five (5) or more years of net credited service, he may also elect, within seven (7) days prior to the force effective date, to claim the job of the employee having the least seniority of all employees in all work locations within a thirty-five (35) mile radius of the claimant's existing work location in the claimant’s job title, or any other job title in the claimant's classification which the claimant has previously held. Provided further, however, that the claimant may not claim a job unless the Company determines that he is able
68
Art. 35
to perform it satisfactorily and he is senior to the employee whose job is claimed.
(d)	If an affected employee refuses or fails to accept a transfer in the same job classification or in an equivalent job classification as defined in Article 23, Section 1(e) at a work location which does not require a change in residence he shall receive no termination allowance.
SECTION 5.	It, after making the offers provided in Section 4 of this Article, the Company determines that further force reductions are needed in the job titles, work groups and localities affected, the Company will proceed, in a sequence to be determined by the Company to:
(a)	Terminate all contracts providing for service to be furnished within the locality affected by plant construction, line and tree trimming crews under independent contractor relationships before any Category I employees within such locality are laid off. This provision shall not be construed to require the Company to terminate any such contract contrary to its termination provision or otherwise to require the Company to breach its contract. Where such contracts require notice before termination, the Company shall not be prevented from proceeding with the other steps hereinafter set forth during the notification period. The Company may also retain contract labor while proceeding with the steps hereinafter set forth (1) unless the Company's employees can safely, properly and economically perform those types of operations, or (2) where the Company's employees are not properly qualified for such work either under the law or under regulations of governmental authorities prescribing the qualifications therefor.
(b)	Lay off all temporary and occasional employees and terminate all regular term employees engaged within the job titles, work groups and localities affected.
(c)	After (b) above, lay off all regular employees engaged in the affected job titles, work groups and localities, said employees to be selected by length of service groups and in the sequence outlined below, provided that all employees shall be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority:
(1)	Employees with less than five (5) years of net credited service, but to avoid such layoffs the Company may sub
69
Art. 35
stitute part-timing of full-time employees with less than five (5) years of net credited service or combine such part-timing with layoffs as it deems appropriate. However, an employee who is part-timed under this provision shall be scheduled to work no less than five (5) normal daily tours in any two (2) calendar weeks.
(2)	Each subsequent group thereafter shall be composed of employees in the next successive year of net credited service. ■
SECTION 6.	An employee who is notified by the Company that he is to be laid off pursuant to Section 5(c) and who has more than five (5) years of net credited service shall have seven (7) calendar days to exercise one of the following options:
(a)	Claim the job of the employee having the least seniority of all employees in all work locations within a thirty-five (35) mile radius of the claimant's existing work location in:

(2)	any other job title in the claimant’s classification which the claimant has previously held; or
(b)	Claim the job of the employee having the least seniority of all employees in all work locations within the Area in:
(1)	the claimant's job title, or
(2)	any other job title in the claimant's classification which the claimant has previously held; or
(c)	Claim the job of the employee having the least seniority of all employees in any job classification having a lower maximum basic weekly wage (other than an equivalent job classification as defined in Article 23, Section 1 (e)) in the Area in which the claimant is being laid off. Provided, however, that if the claimant is junior to all employees in the Area in all job classifications having a lower maximum basic weekly wage (other than an equivalent job classification as defined in Article 23, Section 1(e)), he may claim the job of the employee in the bargaining unit having the least seniority in any such classification.
An employee may not claim a job unless the Company determines that he is able to perform it satisfactorily and he is senior to the
70
Art. 35

SECTION 7.
(a)	The provisions of Article 37 shall not be applicable to terminations or layoffs resulting from force adjustments.
(b)	If during a force adjustment, an employee who declines ISP is terminated or laid-off (pursuant to Section 4(c) or 5(c) of this Article), the employee will be paid as a termination allowance the ISP benefits specified in Article 36A, Sections 2 through 4 he would have been eligible to receive at the time of the ISP offer.
(c)	If an employee receives a layoff, termination or similar allowance from the Company or from an affiliate or subsidiary company within the former Bell Atlantic Network Services Group, and is subsequently employed by the Company, and the number of weeks since the date of his separation is less than the number of weeks’ basic pay (or an amount equivalent thereto) received as a layoff, termination or similar allowance, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be refunded to the Company through payroll deduction in each payroll period at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee’s basic weekly wage.
(d)	An employee who is engaged (or reengaged) by the Company and again separated from the payroll after having former service credited shall upon his layoff or termination be paid the difference between the amount of the layoff or termination allowance to which he is entitled pursuant to Article 36A, and any former layoff, termination or similar allowance received from, and not refunded to, an employer where service credit was earned.

EXHIBIT IV
TRANSFER PLAN AND INTERCOMPANY JOB BANK
Effective January 1,1993, the parties agree to the following terms and conditions of the Verizon Services Corp, Transfer Plan (hereinafter Transfer Plan, or Plan).
Parties to this Agreement are Verizon Services Corp., Verizon Pennsylvania Inc., Verizon Delaware Inc., Verizon Washington, DC Inc., Verizon Maryland Inc., Verizon Virginia Inc., Verizon West Virginia Inc., Verizon New Jersey Inc., Verizon Advanced Data Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Sponsoring Employers") and the Unions currently representing employees of the Sponsoring Employers (hereinafter referred to as “Participating Unions").
Eligibility for participation in the Transfer Plan shall be limited to active, regular full time employees of the Sponsoring Employers who are represented for purposes of collective bargaining by one of the Participating Unions.
When an employee, satisfactorily rated overall, is in a work group which has been declared surplus by the Sponsoring Employer in accordance with the terms of the labor agreement applicable to the bargaining unit, the Sponsoring Employer shall furnish the employee’s name and relevant data concerning the employee to the Intercompany Job Bank Program in which all Sponsoring Employers shall participate. The employee will be given a toll free telephone number should he or she desire to make direct contact with the Intercompany Job Bank.
The Intercompany Job Bank will have as its goal the matching of force surplus in any of the Sponsoring Employers with the employment needs of other Sponsoring Employers. All movement of personnel within a Sponsoring Employer (laterals, promotions, downgrades, or others) and obligations, if any, to recall former employees of that Sponsoring Employer shall take priority over any moves under the Intercompany Job Bank.
The Intercompany Job Bank shall maintain a centralized file containing the names, job titles and locations of registered employees. This file shall be utilized by the Sponsoring Employers prior to hiring new employees into jobs for which registered surplus employees are qualified and willing to relocate. Qualified employees in the surplus groups shall have the opportunity to voluntarily transfer to job openings for which they are qualified at any of the other Sponsoring Employers. Consideration will be given in seniority
101
order to employees in the same title as the job opening and then to other qualified employees.
Upon notification of an opportunity, an eligible employee volunteering to transfer shall have ten (10) work days to respond and must be available to report to the job in the receiving unit within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of response if within commuting distance and thirty (30) calendar days from the date of response if a change of residence (i.e., transfer to a work location which is at least thirty-five miles farther from the employee's residence than the distance from the employee’s residence to his or her existing work location) is required.
An eligible employee who transfers to a different bargaining unit under the above provisions shall become eligible for all benefits provided under the labor agreement applicable to the receiving unit; provided, however, that vacations, floating holidays and excused work days taken by the employee prior to the transfer will be offset against any such benefits to which the employee shall become eligible under the collective bargaining agreement applicable to the receiving unit. The eligible employee’s seniority in the receiving unit shall be computed as if he or she had been employed in the receiving unit during the period while employed in the sending unit. An employee who opts to transfer to a job in a different bargaining unit requiring a change in residence, as defined above, will be entitled to the relocation benefits under the applicable Company-Union collective bargaining agreement in the sending unit or the benefits provided in the Interbargaining Unit Relocation Benefits Plan (Attachment A).
On the effective date of the transfer, the employee will be moved from his or her present dollar rate to the nearest step on the wage schedule in the receiving unit assuring no loss of pay, if possible. If the highest step on the wage schedule is insufficient to prevent a loss of pay, the employee will be placed on the highest step of the wage schedule and will become eligible for benefits under the Interbargaining Unit Income Protection Plan (Attachment B).
The provisions of this Agreement shall supersede conflicting or inconsistent provisions contained in any individual labor agreements or practices of the parties. It also supersedes any previous agreements concerning the Intercompany Job Bank. Disputes concerning the proper interpretation or application of the Interbargaining Unit Relocation Benefits Plan and the Interbargaining Unit Income Protection Plan shall be resolved through the grievance and arbitration provisions of the labor agree-
102
ment applicable to the receiving bargaining unit. Determinations as to what openings shall be available through the Intercompany Job Bank, proper staffing levels for transferred work and the number of employees eligible for transfer shall not be subject to arbitration provisions under the labor agreements of either the sending or receiving units.

EXHIBITV
BROADBAND NETWORK EMPLOYMENT SECURITY PROVISIONS
1.	Effective ninety (90) days following ratification of the 1995-98 General Agreement, the following work security protection shall apply to the below described work operations which are performed in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, DC, and West Virginia by the Companies in the Network Operations Line of Business, whether or not the Companies operate the Network Operations Line of Business as a separate Line of Business and whether or not these work operations are transferred to another organization or entity within the Companies:
A) With regard to that portion of the Broadband Network which is defined in subsection 1(B) as Broadband Facilities, the placement (except for the continued use of Flow Mole or other burying/trenching methods), transfer, splicing and repair of such Broadband Facilities will be assigned exclusively to employees of the Companies represented by CWA. The only exception will be in the event of an emergency or in a situation where a Company determines that there are extraordinary circumstances that require outside assistance.
B) Broadband Facility is defined as any fiber optic cable and associated electronics, coaxial cable and associated electronics, or any other newly developed wire or cable material and associated electronics actually used in the deployment of the Broadband Network to deliver a broad range of voice, data, imaging and video service applications not located within a Company central office which is or will be maintained, operated and majority or wholly owned by one of the Companies and which is or will be located between the vaults of any two Company central offices, or between a customer serving terminal/TAP/ONU and the vault of the “end office” Company central office. These facilities are commonly referred to as inter-office, feeder and distribution outside plant facilities. Broadband Facility does not include traditional copper wire facilities.
2.	These provisions concerning Broadband Network shall not apply to support or routing structures, poles, strand, anchors, guys, trees, huts, vaults, conduit, innerduct, rods, trenches or
106
other structures used to support, route or enclose Broadband Facilities or to cable locating activities.
3.	All video and telephony work on the remaining portion of the Broadband Network from the serving terminal/TAP/ONU to and including the customer's premises (e.g., drop, inside wire, set top or other equipment) can be performed by Bell Atlantic Communications and Construction Services, Inc. (BACCSI). BACCSI and CWA have reached agreement on a prehire agreement (setting forth competitive wages, benefits and working conditions) that is being signed by those parties simultaneous with this Memorandum of Understanding and is based on the following work jurisdiction and job security provisions:
A)	BACCSI can perform all work from the serving terminal/TAP/ONU toward the customer, including but not limited to installation and maintenance on drop and inside wire, telephony and video and set tops or other equipment.
B)	In all General Manager areas (districts) where BACCSI is operating, all regular full-time Network Operations employees of the Companies hired on or before January 25,1996 and holding the title of Splicing Technician, Cable Splicing Technician, Systems Technician, Services Technician and Outside Plant Technician will not be subject to layoff. In the event any of these employees’ titles are changed but their duties remain essentially unchanged, such employees will continue to have this layoff protection. If BACCSI is not operating in a General Manager area, this layoff protection will not apply.
C)	In General Manager areas where BACCSI is not operating, the rights of the Companies and CWA regarding the assignment of telephone work described in Section 3(A) are unaffected by these Broadband Network/Employment Security Provisions. However, in the event of a force adjustment which would result in the layoff, in a General Manager area where BACCSI is not operating, of a regular full-time Network Operations employee who:
(1)	is hired on or before January 25,1996,
(2)	holds the title of Splicing Technician, Cable Splicing Technician, Systems Technician, Services Technician or Outside Plant Technician, and
107
(3)	would normally have rights to “bump” a less senior employee who is protected by Section 3(8) above, such employee may elect to transfer into the title and location of the less senior protected employee provided that:
a)	such senior employee shall be responsible for all relocation expenses, if any, and will not be eligible for relocation reimbursement or commutation expense in lieu of relocation under any applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and
b)	no General Manager area will, in any calendar year, have to absorb such transfers if they exceed two percent (2%) of the average total number of employees in the affected title within the General Manager area during the last three (3) months of the preceding calendar year.
D)	The provisions of this Section 3 will supersede any contrary provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
4.	Regarding future work assignments after this Broadband Network agreement expires and regarding work operations not covered by paragraph one (1) or three (3), these provisions on Broadband Network do not modify, increase or diminish, and shall not be construed to modify, increase or diminish the rights of either CWA or the Companies under other provisions of their collective bargaining agreements.
5.	Sales of video information and programming will be handled by Bell Atlantic Video Services, Inc. (BVS) and other Video Information Providers (VIPs). It is the Companies' understanding that BVS currently plans to use multiple sales channels. While BVS is a separate company which makes its own labor policy, it is the Companies’ intent to aggressively pursue with BVS (if legally permissible) sales opportunities for the Consumer LOB to become an additional in-bound and outbound sales channel for BVS utilizing the Telephone Canvasser, Telemarketing Representative and other titles.
6.	These provisions concerning Broadband Network/Employment Security will be implemented ninety (90) days following ratification of the 1995-98 General Agreement. The use of contractors performing the work covered by paragraph one (1) will be
108
phased out during that ninety (90) day period, subject to any existing contractual arrangements with contractors which cannot be terminated within that period. Any such requirement will be terminated at the first possible date permitted under the agreement with the vendor. These provisions expire on August 5, 2000.
Broadband Network/Employment Security Provisions (Amended As of August 6, 2000)
The Broadband Network/Employment Security Provisions are renewed, as amended below, for the life of the new collective bargaining agreements of the covered Verizon operating telephone companies. The following amendments supersede any contrary or conflicting provisions in the current Broadband Network/ Employment Security Provisions. The Broadband Network/ Employment Security Provisions, as amended herein, expire on August 2, 2008.
1.	Commencing no later than August 1,2001, Verizon Connected Solutions Inc. (VCS) will no longer perform repair work between the serving terminal/TAP/ONU and the Companies’ side of the network interface device (“drop repair work"). Except as provided for below, "drop repair work” will be dispatched exclusively to CWA-represented employees of the Companies ("core" employees). Staffing associated with the return of this work will take place over the period January 1, 2001 through August 1,2001.
The exclusions to the above commitments are as follows:
•	Repair, replacement, and/or connection of buried drops, or “C" wire, after service has been restored or corrected by temporary means, and
•	In an emergency (“event of national importance, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe or severe weather conditions, e.g., Hurricane, Tornado, Blizzard, severe ice damage, or Major Flood”).
2.	Commencing no later than October 1, 2000, when a “core" employee is dispatched on “drop repair work”, and the trouble on that job is at or beyond the customer’s side of the network interface device (“inside repair work"), the “inside repair work" will be performed by the “core” employee if the customer is present to provide access at the time of the visit.
109
3.	The foregoing commitments will not affect the ability of VCS technicians to perform repair work involving the network interface device when dispatched to a repair job involving “inside repair work".
4.	Existing VCS technicians will receive full consideration for “core" vacancies created as a result of the implementation of these provisions. VCS technicians hired as “core" employees will not be counted in the 50/50 Internal vs. External Staffing Commitment. Their impact will be fully neutral.
5.	These commitments apply only to repair jobs necessary to restore or correct service in response to a specific trouble report.

Letter of Understanding - “BANDI”
This confirms our understanding August 3, 2003 that a condition of the Federal Communications Commission’s approval of the merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE is the creation of a separate data affiliate (“SDA") to provide certain data services. The parties understand that the SDA, Bell Atlantic Network Data, Inc. (“BANDI”) will need to employ employees who are currently employed by some former Bell Atlantic Network Services Companies in bargaining units represented by the CWA (“Union”). The Network Services Companies and the Union hereby agree that bargaining unit employees of the Network Services Companies may be transferred, on a voluntary basis, to employment at BANDI, which shall be treated as a transfer between employers within the same bargaining unit. Simultaneous with such transfers, BANDI will recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the transferred employees, and the collective bargaining agreement that governed employees’ terms and conditions of employment immediately prior to the change in employer will be amended to add BANDI as a party to the agreement effective as of the date of the first employee's transfer. (If BANDI's corporate name is changed, the new name will be substituted for BANDI.)
BANDI employees will continue to be covered by any promotion, lateral or downgrade plans (as well as all other rights) available to employees of the former Network Services Companies and may continue to avail themselves of the use of these plans.
The parties further understand that as a result of regulatory requirements, BANDI will not be able to provide local concession telephone service to its employees. Instead, bargaining unit employees shall receive $35 per month to be included in payroll compensation that will be effective upon the first month that a bargaining unit employee becomes employed by BANDI. BANDI employees who retire during the life of the current agreement will receive a lump sum payment of $2,600, less applicable deductions.
This Letter of Understanding shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on August 2, 2008.

Closed Time
This will confirm our agreement on August 3, 2003 with respect to providing off-line time to Consultants in all lines of business. This agreement will be effective March 1,2001, and remain in effect for the life of the 2003 collective bargaining agreement.
Effective March 1, 2001, on Tuesdays through Saturdays, excluding the first business day after a holiday, the Company will provide 15 minutes of closed time per day per scheduled Consultant. Effective July 1,2001, on Tuesdays through Saturdays, excluding the first business day after a holiday, the Company will provide an additional 15 minutes of closed time per day per scheduled Consultant. Closed time does not constitute a break, but rather is provided to the Consultant for purposes of performing productive work dealing with customer related issues. It does not, however, include training time. If an emergency condition as defined in the applicable collective bargaining agreement exists on any given day, the supervisor shall notify the Union steward that closed time is not available that day.
Any question arising in connection with this letter is specifically excluded from the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

Consultant Agreement
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, regarding Consultants. Except as modified by this Letter of Understanding, all collective bargaining agreement provisions applicable to Service Representatives will continue to apply to Consultants. The Companies may describe the Consultant title as appropriate to designate the specialized functions of various Consultant jobs (e.g., Consumer Consultant, Credit Consultant, Small Business Consultant).
The duties of the various specialized Consultant jobs may include any or all of the duties previously assigned to Service Representatives, Collectors and/or Collection Representatives. Achievement of sales results will be a job requirement for the Consultant jobs which specialize in sales, provided that sales results will not be the sole basis for discipline. In determining whether a Consultant's sales results are satisfactory, the reasons for failing to meet sales objectives (such as local economic downturns, product or service failures, etc.) always will be taken into consideration. The introduction of new equipment, new technology and/or support systems to be used by Consultants in the workplace (such as software, personal computers and/or SaleService Negotiation System (SSNS)) does not constitute a restructuring of the Consultant job or the creation of a new job from existing Consultant job duties.
Subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions, Consultants will receive such training as the Companies determine from time to time to be appropriate. Not all Consultants will necessarily receive the same type or degree of training; for example, a Consultant may receive specific collection-related training or only sales-and-service training.
The work performed by Consultants may be transferred between and among the Companies as the Companies deem appropriate, provided that no such transfer will directly result in the layoff, downgrade or part-timing of any Consultant.

Contract Labor
This is to confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that in making decisions regarding contracting out of work, it is management’s objective to consider carefully the interests of customers and the concern of employees as to its effect on them along with all other considerations essential to the management of the business.
Except when it has no other reasonable alternative, the Company will not contract out work if it would otherwise be performed by regular.employees within job titles, work groups and localities where a layoff or part timing of such employees would be the direct result of such contracting out, where a layoff of such employees is pending, or where a layoff has already occurred and such laid off former regular employees retain recall rights and are available and qualified in the judgment of the Company to perform such work. If the Company determines that it has no reasonable alternative, it shall discuss its decision with the Union.

Contracting Initiatives
Mr. Doug Thompson
Administrative Assistant to Vice President
CWA, District 2, AFL-CIO
962 Wayne Avenue
Silver Spring, MD 20910
Dear Mr. Thompson:
This will confirm our August 6, 2000 agreement regarding contracting initiatives.
The Company agrees, subject to certain conditions described below, that through 12-31-02, it will not contract out work of a type that it has not contracted out during the three years preceding the effective date of the agreement. This restriction shall not preclude contracting out work to deal with emergency situations including severe weather conditions.
The parties further agree to create a Contracting Initiatives Committee, which will be co-chaired by the CWA District Vice President and a company Senior Operations Manager (or their designee). The CEO of the Verizon and the President of CWA shall be ex-officio members of the Committee. Each party may appoint up to two additional members.
The purpose of this Committee is to find ways by which the levels of contracting can be reduced within the Verizon (Mid-Atlantic) Operating companies. The objective is for company employees to do more work in a more productive and efficient manner than that performed by contractors. The company will provide all necessary resources needed by the Committee to carry out its purpose.
In addition, the Company will notify the Union at least six months in advance of planned new, major, contracting initiatives that are to be implemented on or after January 1,2003, and which affect employees represented by the Union. The Contracting Initiatives Committee will then have the opportunity to discuss such new major initiatives. It is understood, however, that after the end of the six month period, the Company is free to implement planned, new, major initiatives that do not otherwise violate the collective bargaining a ement.
AGREED:
Very Truly Yours,

A copy shall be provided within thirty (30) days of the announcement of discipline. An alleged failure to provide a copy of such a record may be grieved to obtain the record or to verify that no record has been placed in the personnel file. An alleged failure to provide a discipline record may not be the basis for challenging the validity of any disciplinary action.

Direct Billing For Relocation Expenses
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, regard- I ing direct billing for certain moving expenses incurred under Article 23, Section 4(b). Within 30 days of the execution of this Agreement, the Company will provide the Union with a list of movers that have contracts with the Company providing for direct billing of moving costs, hereafter referred to as “Approved Movers." This list of Approved Movers may be modified by the Company at any time.
If an employee is being moved to a new location pursuant to Article 23, Section 3(a), he may obtain an estimate of his moving costs from an Approved Mover. The Company will agree to be billed directly by the Approved Mover under the following conditions:
1.	The estimate, combined with any other relocation expenses already reimbursed (including gross-up), does not exceed $5,000.
2.	Prior to the Company’s receipt of the Approved Mover's actual billing invoice, the Company will only reimburse other relocation expenses (including gross-up) equal to the difference between the Approved Mover’s estimate and $5,000.
3.	After the Company receives the Approved Mover’s actual billing invoice, it will pay the mover directly for the actual billing expense. The employee will be responsible for obtaining reimbursement of all other relocation expenses by voucher up to the $6,000 limit.
4.	If the Company’s payment to the Approved Mover together with its reimbursement of other relocation expenses exceeds the $6,000 relocation allowance, the employee shall reimburse the Company for this excess within three (3) months from the date the employee is notified that the moving allowance was exceeded.

DSL Demand Salps
This will confirm our agreement of August 3, 2003, as follows: |
1.	The Company’s Residence Sales and Service Organization (Consumer) will, by the end of the current contract, train its Consultants to handle customer incoming calls for Verizon-On-Line DSL requests in DC, DE, MD, NJ, PA, VA, WV (“MidAtlantic Region").

2.	The Company’s General Business Sales Organization (GBS) will, before June 1, 2001, train a total of at least 10 bargaining unit Consultants in the Mid-Atlantic Region to handle customer incoming calls for Verizon-On-Line DSL requests.
3.	GBS and Consumer Consultants will become the primary channel for incoming sales demand calls to business offices in the Mid-Atlantic Region requesting Verizon-On-Line DSL service for the types of customers handled by GBS and Consumer, except that complex Verizon-On-Line DSL calls will continue to be handled by the Company’s High Speed Solution Center until the Company is satisfied that the technology is in place in business offices for GBS and Consumer Consultants to handle such complex calls, and until they are trained to do so. The Company expects this technology to be developed and such training to be completed by June 1, 2001, and will use its best efforts to meet this target.
4.	Further, nothing herein shall limit the Company from assigning non-demand DSL sales work of any kind to any sales channel such as, for example, telemarketers or Internet based ordering.
5.	Except for the specific commitments set forth above, nothing in this letter of agreement shall be construed to affect any existing rights or obligations under the collective bargaining agreement.

Evaluative Observations
This letter will confirm our agreement of August 3, 2003 to modify evaluative observation practices for certain Consultants in all lines of business for the life of the 2003 collective bargaining agreement, and to conduct a trial moratorium on evaluative observations for certain Consultants.
Effective January 1, 2001, the modifications to evaluative observation practices for Consultants in all lines of business are as follows:
1)	Consultants will receive advance notification of evaluative observations except for Consultants who received an overall rating of “Needs Improvement”, “Does Not Meet Requirements", or “Not Rated” on their most recent annual evaluation under the Associate Appraisal Plan in performance only.
2)	The Company will utilize results from diagnostic observations and other criteria such as CCI results to measure the performance of each office and compare the office’s performance and results during the trial with those before the trial. This will occur during the first six months of the trial. Before a decision is made on whether or not to continue the trials, the results will be discussed with the Union. After the notification requirement contained in paragraph one (1) above has been in use for a six (6) month period, the Company and the Union will determine whether to continue it for an additional period of time.
3)	The Company will endeavor to provide face-to-face feedback on observations by the close of the day on which the observation was taken but in no event later than the close of the next business day on which both the Consultant and the Team Leader who conducted the observation are on the job and are working at a common work location for their full tours.
4)	Evaluative observing will take place only during the first 7 paid hours of a scheduled work day for employees with a 35 hour basic work week, or during the first 7.5 paid hours of a scheduled work day for employees with a 37.5 hour basic work week. If the Company determines that a Consultant’s performance is substantially different during periods of diagnostic evaluation, as compared to periods of evaluative observation, evaluative observations may be conducted on that Consultant beyond the first 7 hours or 7.5 hours, whichever applies.
136
5)	On an annual basis, evaluative observations will be limited in frequency as follows:
•	20 observations for Consultants who received an overall rating of “Exceeds Requirements" on their most recent annual evaluation under the Associate Appraisal Plan;
•	30 observations for Consultants who received an overall rating of “Meets All” on their most recent annual evaluation under the Associate Appraisal Plan; and
•	40 observations for Consultants who received an overall rating of “Needs Improvement", “Does Not Meet”, or “Not Rated" on their most recent annual evaluation under the Associate Appraisal Plan.
6)	It is expressly understood that these modifications do not apply to diagnostic evaluations, which are not appraisalimpacting.
The Company further agrees to conduct a trial moratorium on evaluative observations in one Consumer organization RSSC in each CWA Local for a three (3) month period during the term of the new contract. Consultants will be eligible to participate in this trial if they are rated “Exceeds Requirements” or “Meets All Requirements" on their most recent evaluation under the Associate Appraisal Plan. If the Company determines that overall office performance as it relates to sales, customer satisfaction or customer quality declines as a result of this trial, the Company and the Union will meet to review the information and to make a determination to continue the contact freedom trial.
This Letter of Understanding shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on August 2, 2008.

Flex-Time
The Union and the Company recognize that in certain work groups Flex-Time scheduling could be implemented without detriment to good customer service. Accordingly, in work groups where the Company and the Union agree, Flex-Time scheduling will be utilized.
Under Flex-Time scheduling, the Company will decide the following:
Core Hours - Those hours during which all employees must work during a normal daily tour. Employees are late if they have not arrived by the beginning of the core hours.
Flex Hours - Those hours at the beginning and end of the tour during which employees may vary their start and stop hours for their daily tour.
Core and Flex Hours may be changed by the Company with 48 hours notice.
Minimum Staffing - The minimum number of employees who must be present for telephone coverage, system requirements, etc., during certain hours.
All employees subject to Flex-Time scheduling will work a full normal daily tour. Should the hours selected by employees otherwise entitle them to a differential payment under Article 19, no such payment will be made. The requirements of Article 25 shall be deemed inapplicable to Flex-Time employees because they may vary their start and stop times for their daily tour.
If the Company establishes different core hours within a work group, the core hours shall be selected by seniority within the work group.
I
Either party may terminate Flex-Time scheduling in specific groups with sixty (60) days notice to the other party, when in its judgment, such scheduling is not workable.

Four Day Work Week Trial
This confirms our understanding of August 3, 2003 that for six (6) months following the ratification of this Agreement, Four-Day Work Week Trials will be implemented in Company jurisdictions under the following terms:
The Company and the Union mutually recognize that, in certain administrative groups, it may be beneficial to the employees and in the best interests of the business to establish four-day work week trials as a normal week. In such cases, the total number of hours presently constituting a five-day normal work week will be scheduled over four days of the calendar week. Four-day work weeks will be scheduled on four consecutive days.
Individual tours scheduled during a four day normal work week may or may not be of equal length, but will not be shorter than 7.5 hours or longer than 10 hours. When a four-day schedule is in effect, the duration of tours specified in the Local Agreements will be considered to be expanded accordingly.
The Company, with the Union’s input, may institute four-day trials in administrative groups. The Company or the Union may discontinue four-day trials upon fourteen (14) Days notice to the other party.
In administering four-day trials, the Company will offer four-day work weeks to employees on a voluntary basis in seniority order. If there are insufficient volunteers, four-day work week trials will not be instituted. Night differential payments shall be paid pursuant to the applicable differential provision in the local collective bargaining agreements.
When a four-day schedule is in effect as a normal work week overtime payments shall apply to time worked in excess of the new normal daily tour.
Pay allowances for absent time (including sickness absence) occurring during four-day trials will be subject to the conditions specified in this Agreement. When pay treatment is calculated on a daily (as opposed to hourly or weekly) basis, a scheduled day of a four-day trial and a scheduled day of a five-day normal work week will each count as one full day, except with respect to vacations and employee designated excused work day calculations.
Vacation and employee designated excused work days will be assessed in proportion to the ratio between the hours actually scheduled on the tour in question and the hours scheduled on
140
each tour of a five day normal work week for the employee’s administrative group. For example, if a 37.5-hour employee scheduled to work three 10-hour days and one 7.5 hour day takes a vacation day on a 10 hour day, all 10 hours (or 1.33 vacation days) will be charged. If that same employee takes a vacation day on the 7.5-hour day, 7.5 hours (or one vacation day) will be charged.
For calendar weeks containing holidays recognized under the Agreement (including floating holidays) or Company designated excused work days, the Company will revert to a five-day schedule.
Subject to the above, four-day trials will be administered in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Local Agreements. The parties may meet locally and discuss other administrative issues raised with respect to the four-day work week. These provisions will become effective upon ratification.
Unless renewed or amended by mutual agreement, these four day work week trials will terminate six (6) months following ratification of this Agreement.

Grievance Trial
This is to confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that I the parties agree to establish a trial procedure to address concerns regarding the grievance procedure for employees in Categories I, tl, III, A and B.
The Union may elect to present single issue grievances regarding local policies created by Managers or Directors, and grievances involving suspensions, excluding suspensions that involve the Regional Attendance Plan (RAP), directly to the Manager of the aggrieved employee(s) at the first step. Managers must hear the grievance at the first step or delegate the appropriate Manager of Labor Relations to hear the grievance. If the grievance is appealed to the second step it will be heard by the aggrieved employee’s Director or that Director may delegate the Director of Labor Relations to hear the grievance.
The parties will meet quarterly to evaluate the effectiveness of this trial. They may jointly agree to discontinue the trial or add to its scope.

Home Garaging Trial
This confirms our understanding of August 3, 2003 that the Home Garaging Trial will be continued in administrative work units whereby employees will be assigned a motor vehicle for use in their work, for traveling between their work locations and area of residence or other designated places where the vehicle is stored. The Home Garaging Trial will be implemented only within administrative work units where some or all of the employees normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in order to perform their work. The decision to implement a trial of this program will be within management's discretion. However, only volunteers will be utilized.
When Home Garaging is introduced within an administrative work unit, all employees within that unit who normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in the performance of their work assignment will be eligible to participate.
Since participation is voluntary if an employee elects not to participate, management will determine where the motor vehicle assigned to that employee is to be stored and that location will become the employee’s work reporting location, but not for purposes of locality wage zones, special city allowances or union local affiliation. All employees, including those who do not participate in home garaging trials in administrative work units, will report to a company designated work center (as described above) at least once a week.
Employees who participate in the program will be expected to provide normally secure and legal storage for the vehicle at their places of residence. If the vehicle cannot be properly stored at an employee's place of residence, the Company may arrange for appropriate storage at its expense.
Operating and maintenance costs will be at the Company's expense. The Company will make arrangements for maintenance of the vehicle; however, it will be the responsibility of the employee to whom the vehicle is assigned to assure that the vehicle is property maintained.
For employees who participate in the Home Garaging Trial, a work reporting area will be established on a local basis before implementation. The work reporting area normally will be a circular geographic area. In large congested metropolitan locations or where natural barriers render a circular work reporting area impractical, other mutually suitable parameters will be established.
144
Each participating employee will be expected to begin and end the work tour at any assigned location within the established work reporting area.
Employees who are assigned to a job location at the beginning or end of a work tour which is outside an established work reporting area will be paid for necessary travel time to or from their homes at the beginning or end of their tours.
As specified above, at least one (1) tour per week will begin at a Company designated work center. If requested by the Local Union representative or steward, on a voluntary basis, participants will be permitted sixty (60) Company paid minutes of union meeting time each month on those days when the participant reports to work at the Company designated work center.
Unless renewed or amended by mutual agreement, this trial will be terminated six (6) months following ratification of this agreement.

Inter-area Recall Of Laid Off Employees
This is to confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, concerning employees who are laid off by the Company. Nothing herein shall be construed as a circumvention of the recall rights provided former employees in Article 35, Section 8 of the General Agreement which shall take priority over the provisions hereof.
The Company agrees to poll former employees who are laid off to determine their interest in being considered for reemployment in their former job title in specific localities outside the Area in which they were laid off. Once such interest is expressed, offers of available jobs, as determined by the Company, will be made only in the localities of interest, subject to the Company’s determination that the laid off former employees are qualified and able to perform the available work.
Any former employee offered reemployment pursuant to this letter of understanding must accept and be available for reemployment within fourteen (14) calendar days after the offer is mailed.

Joint Committees
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, regarding Joint Committees.
“In light of the large increase in the number of grievances which have been appealed to arbitration in recent years, the parties are hereby committed to finding better ways for resolving disputes. Accordingly, and in addition to other measures agreed upon in the parties’ 1998 Common Issues Memorandum of Understanding, a joint committee comprised of two union and two management representatives will be formed in each union District to propose ways to reduce the number of cases coming to arbitration and to resolve cases more quickly with a view toward reducing the overall number of pending cases. In addition to exploring the applicable arbitration and mediation provisions for possible improvements, it is the intent of the parties to examine arbitration processing alternatives with the objective of achieving speedier resolutions. These committees will present their recommendations to the Vice President Labor Relations - South and to the applicable CWA District Vice President by November 1, 1998 for possible implementation in 1999. Further, it is the parties’ intent to maintain an open and ongoing dialogue through the Bargaining Agents relative to progress in this critical area, with the express intent of reducing the overall volume of cases as well as hearing cases more expeditiously.
This Letter of Understanding shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on
August 2, 2008."

Manhole Letter
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, regarding work assignments in certain manholes in the West Virginia Area only.
Any employee who is assigned to perform construction splicing in a manhole who expresses a concern for the safe performance of the job based on the condition or location of the manhole or the nature of the work to be performed therein may request that a second person be assigned to work in the immediate vicinity and such requests will be granted. The Company will determine the functions to be performed by the second person. The parties agree that such requests will not be made or granted in cases where no special safety concerns are expressed and the basis of the request is merely a preference for a companion at the site.

Operator Services_IVIon itorlng
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that effective January 1, 2001, Operator Services will implement paragraphs (3) and (4), (6) and the unnumbered paragraph following paragraph (6) of the Commercial Evaluative Observations provisions of this Agreement, changing “Consultant” to “Operator” and “one Consumer organization RSSC in each CWA Local” to “one Operator Services office in NJ and one Operator Services office in DC, MD, VA or WV,"
The parties agree to create a joint Mid-Atlantic Company-Union Operator Services Monitoring Committee, comprised of three representatives of the Companies, and three representatives of the Union (one from NJ, one from DE, and one from DC, MD, VA, WV),
The purpose of this Committee is to determine how to revise Paragraphs (1), (2) and (5) of the Commercial Evaluative Observations provisions of this Agreement to apply in the Operator Services work environment and work operations.

Overtime Administration
This confirms our understanding of August 3, 2003 that the | Company’s right to assign overtime to meet the needs of the business includes but is not limited to meeting operational needs to meet customer service requirements in a timely manner, or for safety reasons.
Management will first attempt to use volunteers to meet overtime needs. When there are not enough volunteers, and overtime is assigned, management will review an employee’s request to be excused if timely presented, and will accept excuses that are reasonable after considering the circumstances of the employee and the needs of the business. The above principles apply throughout the entire bargaining unit.
In seeking volunteers, the following guidelines will apply:
1)	Before requiring employees to work overtime, the Company will first seek available, qualified volunteers (who are on the job) from within the group normally used for administering overtime under existing practices.
2)	Before requiring any residential or business installation or repair technician within National Operations to perform work on an overtime basis, the Companies will seek available, qualified volunteers (who are on the job) in the Proactive Preventive Maintenance (PPM) organization, Wholesale, and then in the Construction organization. This commitment applies only to technicians who normally perform work in the geography where the work in question will be performed.
3)	Notification: Where the Company needs to have work performed on an overtime basis on a given day, and it may be necessary to require employees to perform work on an overtime basis on the same day, the Companies will notify affected employees (who are on the job) no later than two-and one-half (2.5) hours before the end of the employee’s scheduled tour that day (“the 2.5 hour point”). (This will not apply in situations where an employee must work overtime to complete a job or work in progress.) For applicable titles, notification may consist of paging the employee before the 2.5 hour point, with the employee responsible to return the page in order to receive notification, or requiring employees to call in to pre-designated telephone number(s) before the 2.5 hour point.
Commencing September 1, 2000, the limitation on forced
159
overtime (“cap”) for the remainder of 2000 shall be 10 hours per employee per payroll week. Commencing January 1, 2001, this cap on forced overtime shall be 8 hours per employee per payroll week. Voluntary overtime worked will be counted toward the overtime cap, except for the period from January 1,2001 to September 1, 2001. Upon request, the Union will assist in securing volunteers. These overtime limitations will not apply in the case of emergency, long term service difficulties or if an employee consents to additional overtime. Except in emergencies, no employee will be involuntarily scheduled or assigned to work six days in a week in consecutive weeks. For purposes of this paragraph only, an emergency is defined as an event of national importance, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, or severe weather conditions, e.g., hurricane, tornado, blizzard, severe ice damage or major flood. In addition, the Union will assume responsibility to make every effort to obtain sufficient volunteers in any condition of sustained bad weather. For Commercial employees, the cap on overtime for purposes of this paragraph is 7.5 hours.
During the final year of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement, employees requesting weekly vacation during the summer vacation period (May, June, July, August, September) will provide a minimum of one week advance notice for any such request.
A committee consisting of the Company and Union authorized bargaining representatives and an additional representative designated by each party will be established to review Union concerns regarding overtime administration. The Committee will meet quarterly, if requested by the Union.
This Letter of Understanding shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on August 2, 2008.

Limitations on Mandatory Overtime (Applicable to Commercial Employees Only)
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003 that the overtime limits (“caps”) of 10 or 15 hours specified in the existing overtime administration provision in the DC, MD, VA, WV, VSC, VADI collective bargaining agreement shall both be reduced to seven and one-half (7.5) hours. In addition, the following provision will apply:
The Company will give reasonable consideration to an employee’s timely request to be excused.
1.	An employee will not be required to work more than a total of seven and one-half (7.5) hours overtime in any payroll week except in case of emergency (as referenced in the overtime administration letter of understanding), long term service difficulties or employee consent to such overtime. For purposes of computing the 7.5 hour limits, both voluntary and mandatory overtime will count towards those limits. Upon request, the Union will assist in securing volunteers to work overtime.
2.	The Company will give reasonable consideration to an employee’s timely request to be excused.
3.	The parties recognize that long term service difficulties for an extended period may develop from time to time during which suspension of the above overtime limitations would be appropriate. In the event such service difficulties develop, the Company and the Union will meet to discuss the problem and determine how to best deal with the situation.
Notice for Mandatory Overtime
No mandatory overtime will be assigned to Service Representatives/Consultants with less than 24 hours notice before the start of the tour in which the overtime is to be worked to the affected employee, except for the following situations:
1.	To complete calls and/or clear calls in queue at the end of a tour, or
2.	Extenuating service conditions, in which case the Company will contact the Union in advance to explain the situation.
3.	Emergency conditions as defined in the existing contract provisions on overtime “caps".

Procedure to Resolve Claims Regarding Hiring Wage.Rates
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that the | parties agree to establish a new procedure to resolve claims regarding employees' hiring wage rates. This procedure shall be independent of the grievance-arbitration procedure and shall provide the exclusive remedy for any claim regarding an employee’s hiring wage rate.
If an employee or the Union has an issue regarding an employee’s hiring wage rate, the International Representative of the Union shall submit a written statement (by e-mail) to the Labor Relations Manager for the appropriate geographic area explaining this claim. The Company shall review this written statement and provide a written answer (by e-mail) within thirty (30) days. If the Union is not satisfied by this answer, it can submit the dispute to a neutral third party for resolution within thirty (30) days of the Company’s answer. The third party neutral shall be appointed in accordance with the procedures established by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
The only issue that the Union may raise or that a neutral third party can determine regarding an employee’s hiring wage rate is whether the Company properly considered all information provided during the employment interview in accordance with the Company's wage credit guidelines. Any remedy issued by the third party neutral shall have prospective effect only and shall not result in any wage reductions.
All claims under this procedure must be filed within sixty (60) days of the new employee's hiring date. Any claim filed more than sixty (60) days after an employee’s hiring date shall be time-barred in all respects.
Article 16 A, Section 3 is not applicable to any remedies issued under this procedure. No claims arising under this procedure can be submitted to the grievance-arbitration procedure.
Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this agreement, the parties will meet and mutyally agree upon a neutral third party. The Company will notify the Union of any adjustments in its wage credit guidelines at least thirty (30) days prior to implementation.
Either party may terminate this procedure for resolving claims regarding hiring wage rates with sixty (60) days notice to the other party, when in its judgment, the procedure is not workable.

Service Monitoring
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that service management observation programs are oriented toward service provided by the Operator Service Center, and will be taken only for the purpose of evaluating new or changes practices and procedures, customer acceptance, problems in providing service, etc. Service management observation programs are not designed to measure individual operator performance and will not be used for routine observation of individuals. No employee will be discharged or terminated as a result of these observations except for gross customer abuse, fraud or violation of secrecy of communications.
Our approach to monitoring and productivity measurements are based on a premise that fosters a work environment that builds on mutual trust and respect and that enhances job satisfaction. Our program for observations are tailored to the needs of each operator and Center, and the number of diagnostic observations will be consistent with that approach. Make-up observations will be taken only where necessary to insure reasonable statistical reliability of performance measurements. If possible, feedback will take place on the same day as the observations are taken.
Good service to the customers and enhancing revenues are of equal importance to productivity. The AWT measurement practices will continue to be evaluated and revised as required to maximize the objectives of good service and revenue enhancement. It is the Company's intent to develop operator's overall performance in such a manner as to provide operator services to the customer in an efficient, courteous and responsive way.

Technological Change
This will affirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that the Company and the Union recognize that technological changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation have a tendency to affect job security and the nature of the work to be performed. The Company and the Union, therefore, will attempt to diminish or abolish the detrimental effects of any such technological change by continuing a joint committee know as the Technology Change Committee to oversee problems and recommend solutions of problems in this area as set forth below:
It is agreed that for the duration of the 2003 General Agreement a Technology Change Committee be constituted at the Company headquarters level. Such committee will consist of not more than three (3) representatives of the Company and not more than three (3) representatives of the Union. Such Committee may be convened at the option of either party at mutually agreeable times.
The purpose of the Committee is to provide for discussion of major technological changes (including changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation) which may affect employees represented by the Union. The company will notify the Union at least six (6) months in advance of planned major technological changes. Meetings may be convened at the option of either party at mutually agreeable places and times, at least two (2) times each year. At such meetings, the Company will advise the Union of its plans with respect to the introduction of such changes and will familiarize the Union with the progress being made.
The impact and effect of such changes on the employees shall be appropriate matters for discussion. The Company will discuss with the Union:
(a)	What steps might be taken to offer employment to employees affected;
(1)	In the same locality or other localities in jobs which may be available in occupations covered by the collective bargaining agreements between the parties;
(2)	In other occupations in the Company not covered by the collective bargaining agreement;
(3)	In an affiliate or subsidiary company within the former Bell Atlantic Network Services Group.
175
(b)	The applicability of various Company programs and contract provisions relating to force adjustment plans and procedures, including, Income Security Plan, Reassignment Pay Protection Program, termination allowances, retirement, training or retraining, transfer procedures and the like,
(c)	The feasibility of the Company providing training for other assignments for the employees affected, (Example: sponsorship of typing training on Company time).
The Committee shall not formulate policy or arrive at binding decisions or agreements, but rather shall be charged with the responsibility to develop facts and recommendations so that the Company can make well-informed decisions regarding the matters covered by this provision.
This Letter of Understanding shall expire at 11:59 p,m. on August 2, 2008.

Termination Of Outside Contractors
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that | before initiating a layoff of regular employees in the titles of Systems Technician, Cable Splicing Technician, Services Technician and Outside Plant Technician in Network Operations, pursuant to Article 35 Section 5(c), the Company shall, where practicable, first terminate all arrangements with non-affiliated independent contractors for contracting out the work performed by these titles in Network Operations; only those contracting out arrangements within thirty-five (35) miles of the normal reporting location of the affected surplus employees holding one of these titles shall be terminated.

The Company may also retain contract labor while proceeding with the steps set forth in Article 35 (1) unless the Company's employees can safely, properly and economically perform those types of operations, or (2) where the Company's employees are not properly qualified for such work either under the law or under regulations or governmental authorities prescribing the qualifications thereunder.

Top Secret Security Clearance
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003, that the Company and the Union recognize the need to explore new, innovative methods for meeting customer requirements. To help assure quality service and consistent service coverage for key federal government contracts, the parties agree to the following:
Certain contracts may require the Company to utilize Technicians and other employees who hold Top Secret, Full Lifestyle Polygraph Security Clearances. For purposes of this agreement, Technicians and other employees who hold such clearances shall be called “qualified employees.”
When working under contracts that require qualified employees, the Company may choose, at its sole discretion, to designate the government facilities as normal reporting locations. The Company will pay Temporary Assignment pay for each day a qualified employee is assigned to and actually performs work that requires Top Secret Full Lifestyle Polygraph Security Clearance at a designated federal facility. Qualified employees shall receive Temporary Assignment Pay of fifteen dollars ($15.00) a day if they work a full tour and Temporary Assignment Pay of ten dollars ($10.00) a day if they work a half tour. Employees who work less than a half tour will not receive any Temporary Assignment Pay. The temporary assignment payment will not be considered as time worked for any purpose under the General Agreement and will be disregarded when computing any wage progression treatments.
The parties agree that the Company shall have the right to determine whether a contract requires qualified employees. The qualified employees will only receive temporary assignment pay pursuant to this Letter of Understanding when the Company determines that a contract requires Top Secret, Full Lifestyle Security Clearance.
The Company will compile a pool of qualified employees. If the Company determines that a contract requires qualified employees on a long-term basis, it will select volunteers from this pool. If there are more volunteers than assignments, the Company will select volunteers in seniority order. Those who volunteer and who are assigned to report to a Federal facility under long term assignments must agree not to seek other jobs through RAMP for the duration of the assignment. The Company retains the right to assign employees to work on any contract and will exercise this right if there are fewer volunteers than assignments.

Vacation Buy-Back
The Company may offer to buy back a full week or weeks of an employee’s scheduled vacation in order to meet unanticipated business demands.
The decision by the Company to make a week or weeks available for buy-back in a particulai group will be determined solely by the force and service conditions within that group.
All regular employees who are eligible for at least 3 weeks of vacation in the current calendar year will be eligible to sell vacation as follows:
Vacation Eligibility	Maximum No. of Weeks
Current Calendar Year	Eligible for Sale
3	1
4	2
5	2
Once the Company determines that “vacation buy-back" is appropriate, the opportunity to “buy-back vacation" is made available to employees scheduled to take that week in the designated group based on seniority. Acceptance by the employee of an offer to “buyback" full week or weeks of scheduled vacation is voluntary, however, once vacation is bought by the Company it is not available for reselection. Rather, the employee’s work scheduled will reflect a normal work week and the employee will be paid for the “vacation buy-back” on the same basis as provided for vacation payments in Article 31, Section 2 of the General Agreement. Vacation weeks bought by the Company shall not be considered time worked for any purpose under this provision. Payments made for vacation shall not be used in the computations of overtime, differential, or any other premium payments, nor in the determination of any benefits calculated on the basis of wages or other earnings. This provision applies only to full weeks of vacation including weeks with holidays.
Questions regarding the offer or acceptance of “vacation buyback" may be submitted to the grievance procedure; however, neither the provisions of this letter nor its interpretation or application shall be subject to arbitration.

Vacation Scheduling Percentages
This will confirm our understanding of August 3, 2003 that at least 18% of the employees in each vacation administrative work group shall be permitted to schedule off in a given week.
Where the application of the percentage specified above results in other than a whole number, the number yielded will be rounded up to the next whole number.
Regarding vacation availability during traditional fall hunting season and the December holiday season, management will make a reasonable effort to consider the need for higher vacation availability.
Those work groups whose vacation availability is currently greater than the percentages specified above, will not be required to reduce their vacation scheduling availability.

(b)	enlist for a period of "active duty" not exceeding four years (except that such period may be extended so that the total of all service does not exceed five years, provided that all service in excess of four years is at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government); or
(c)	are members of the “reserve components of the armed forces" and are ordered or called into “active duty";
provided that such employees are not ineligible for reemployment rights under the Viet Nam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended by reason of past “military duty."
SECTION 2.	Any leave of absence granted pursuant to this Article shall be effective until the employee is reemployed in accordance with the provisions of this Article or until the employee’s right to reemployment under the law expires, whichever occurs first.
SECTION 3.	The following provisions shall apply to employees granted military leaves of absence under this Article:
(a)	Vacation Treatment. Employees who have not received vacations to which they are entitled at the time their leaves of absence begin shall receive a lump sum payment in lieu of the vacation of any unused portion thereof.
(b)	Pay Treatment During Absence. Employees who are granted military leaves of absence pursuant to this Article shall, when their Company pay is greater than their Government pay, receive from the Company the difference between their Company pay and Government pay for the following periods, as applicable:
(1)	An employee with one year or less of net credited service when his military leave of absence becomes effective - the first two weeks of “military duty" or any shorter period he may serve.
2
(2)	An employee with more than one year of net credited service when his military leave of absence becomes effective - the first three months of “military duty” or any shorter period he may serve.
(3)	For this purpose Company pay shall include basic pay at the rate in effect when the military leave of absence first becomes effective plus the weekly average of evening and night differential payments received for the normal work week during the first four of the five calendar weeks worked immediately preceding the week in which the military leave of absence becomes effective. Government pay shall be determined as of the time the employee begins his “military duty” and shall include basic pay, pay for special or hazardous duty and, for those with dependents, the difference between quarters allowances established for members of the uniformed services with dependents and those established for members of the uniformed services of equal rank without dependents and, in addition, any other family allowances which may hereafter be prescribed by law.
(4)	Any periods of absence on military leave will be cumulative and will be considered as one period in computing the payments to be made in accordance with this Paragraph (b) and Paragraph (c) below. However, an employee’s eligibility for payments under this Article will be reinstated for additional tours for involuntary periods of “active duty” in cases of national emergency; provided that in no event shall an employee be eligible to receive payments for more than one tour of active duty unless the employee has been on the active payroll, following a previous tour of active duty, for at least a two year period.
(c)	Payments on Behalf of Dependents During Absence. In addition to the pay treatment prescribed in (b) above, employees, regardless of length of service, who are granted military leaves of absence pursuant to this Article and who have spouses, or dependent children under 18 years of age, at the commencement of their leaves, will, when their Company pay is greater than their Government pay, receive from the Company the difference between their Company pay and Government pay for an additional three months. For this purpose, Company pay and Government pay shall be computed as prescribed in Paragraph (b) above.
3
Such employees who have dependents other than spouses, or children under 18 years of age, at the commencement of their leaves shall, upon the submission of evidence of dependency satisfactory to the Company, receive special payments from the Company not to exceed those specified in the next preceding paragraph.
(d)	Employee Discount Telephone Service During Absence. Subject to Company’s applicable exchange tariffs, employees who are receiving employee discount telephone service at the time their military leaves of absence become effective, shall, if they so request, continue to receive such discount telephone service for the use of their immediate families during the period of their leaves.
Employees who are not receiving employee discount telephone service at the time their military leaves of absence become effective shall, to the extent that the same if provided for under the Company’s exchange tariffs, be eligible to receive such discount telephone service for the use of their immediate families during the period of such leaves.
Such employee discount telephone service shall be limited to the territory served by The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Companies.
The provisions of this Paragraph (d) are subject to such change or changes as may be necessary on account of any rules or regulations which may be hereafter prescribed by any regulatory or governmental body.
(e)	Reemployment.

(f)	Benefits During Absence. Employees who are granted military leaves of absence under this Article and who, upon their return from “military duty”, are reemployed by the Company in accordance with Paragraph (e) above, shall receive full service credit for the period of such military leaves of absence for the purpose of determining net credited service.
Employees who are granted military leaves of absence under this Article shall be eligible for death benefits during the peri
4
od of such leaves to the same extent and upon the same terms and conditions as if such employees had continued in the regular employment of the Company. However, such benefits, where payable, shall be based upon the term of net credited service credited to an employee at the time the absence began plus service during such absence until time of death and shall be computed at the rate of Company pay which the employee was receiving at the time the military leave of absence became effective.
Employees returning from military leaves of absence granted pursuant to this Article, who are reemployed in accordance with Paragraph (e) above, but who are unable to return to work because of sickness disability, shall be eligible for sickness payments as of the date on which they would have returned to work except for the disability, to the same extent and upon the same terms and conditions as such payments are provided for regular employees of the Company. Such payments, where made, shall be based upon the term of net credited service credited to the employee at the time his military leave of absence began plus the period of such leave of absence and shall be computed at the rate of Company pay applicable to the employee upon his reemployment.
(g)	Treatment upon Return from Military Service. Employees who are granted military leaves of absence under this Article and who, upon their return from “military duty", are reemployed in accordance with Paragraph (e) above, shall be accorded the following treatment:
(1)	Reemployment shall be at the rate of pay the employee would have received if he had been continuously on duty with the Company during the period of absence in the job classification he was in at the time he left; provided, however, that in the case of any such employee who has become incapacitated while on leave of absence on “military duty" to the extent that he is physically unable to do the same work or work similar to that which he was doing before entering military service and who is reemployed in different work, his rate of pay upon reemployment shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with the circumstances of his particular case,
(2)	In the year in which the employee returns he shall be entitled, during that calendar year, to the vacation he would be entitled to under the Agreement between the parties, as if
5
he had been continuously on duty with the Company during the period of absence, providing there remains in that calendar year a sufficient number ol days to make this possible. Otherwise the employee will receive that portion of his vacation which can be taken within the calendar year in which he returns.
(3)	In addition to the pay treatment described above, employees granted military leaves of absence under this Article who, upon their return from “military duty”, are reemployed in accordance with Paragraph (e) above, shall be accorded any other reemployment rights, privileges and benefits to which they may be entitled under then existing law by reason of their “military duty".
SECTION 4.

SECTION 1.

a.	the amount of the August 6, 2006 adjustment shall be: (i) one-half of the increase above four percent (4.0%) in the “CPI-W" (1982-84=100) for May 2006 over May 2004, applied to (ii) the scheduled rates in effect in each wage schedule on August 5, 2006, (iii) rounded to the nearest 50 cents.
