(a)	manufacture, fabrication, assembling, handling, erection, installation, dismantling, conditioning, adjustments, alteration, repairing and servicing of all ferrous or nonferrous metal work and all other materials used in lieu thereof and of all air-veyor systems and air handling systems regardless of material used including the setting of all equipment and all reinforcements in connection therewith;
(b)	all lagging over insulation and all duct lining;
(c)	testing and balancing of all air-handling equipment and duct work;
(d)	the preparation of all shop and field sketches whether manually drawn or computer assisted used in fabrication and erection, including those taken from original architectural and engineering drawings or sketches; and

SECTION 2.02 Subject to other applicable provisions of this Agreement, the Employer agrees that when subcontracting for prefabrication of materials covered herein, such prefabrication shall be subcontracted to fabricators who pay their Employees engaged in such fabrication not less than the prevailing wage for comparable sheet metal fabrication, as established under the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE III
SECTION 3.01 The Employer agrees that none but journeymen, apprentice and pre-apprentice sheet metal workers shall be employed on any work described in Article I and, further, for the

(b)	If the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board believe the dispute might be adjusted without going to final hearing before the National Joint Adjustment Board, each will then designate a panel representative who shall proceed to the locale where the dispute exists as soon as convenient, attempt to conciliate the differences between the parties and bring about a mutually acceptable agreement.
(c)	If such panel representatives or either of them conclude that they cannot resolve the dispute, the parties thereto and the Co-Chairman of the National Joint Adjustment Board shall be promptly so notified without recommendation from the panel representatives.
(d)	Should the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board fail or decline to appoint a panel member or should notice of failure of the panel representatives to resolve the dispute be given, the parties shall promptly be notified so that either party may submit the dispute to the National Joint Adjustment Board.
(e)	In Addition to the mediation procedure set forth above or as an alternate thereto, the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board may each designate a member to serve as a subcommittee and hear the dispute in the local area.

(1)	The applicants shall file with the Dispatching Office a written request for review of the disputed matter.
(2)	The Dispatching Office shall immediately refer the request to the Local Joint Adjustment Board who shall review the matter at its next regular meeting. The applicant may appear before said Board and present all materials and pertinent evidence. After review thereof, the Board's decision shall be conclusive.
