Dear Gary:
CAGNY and the BCA recently executed new agreements (“New Agreement”) effective July 1,2008 through June 30,2013, superseding the agreement in place for July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2008 (“Old Agreement”).
The New Agreement modifies when an OSS must be employed on new construction and renovation projects. We agree, however, that the New Agreement will not be applied in a way that causes the loss of employment for any OSS currently assigned to a project.
