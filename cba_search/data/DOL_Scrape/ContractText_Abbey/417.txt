ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
1,1	This Agreement is made and entered into by and between Verizon Southwest Incorporated, hereinafter referred to as the "Company," and the Communications Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as the "Union.” The parties enter into this Collective Bargaining Agreement in good faith.
1.2	This Agreement shall become effective as of March 6, 2005, and shall remain in effect until midnight, February 27, 2010, and shall continue in effect thereafter until terminated by sixty (60) days written notice given by either party to the other expressly stating its intention to terminate the Agreement.
1.3	Either party may notify the other of its desire to negotiate amendments or modifications (if not terminated by the other party) by serving written notice sixty (60) days immediately prior to February 27, 2010, or at any date thereafter with sixty (60) days written notice.
1.4	In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall at any time be made invalid by applicable legislation or be declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such action shall not invalidate the entire Agreement, it being the express intention of the parties hereto that all other provisions not made invalid shall remain in full force and effect.
1.5	This Agreement shall be subject to amendment at any time by mutual consent of the parties hereto. Such amendment shall be reduced in writing, state the effective date of the amendment, and be executed by said parties.
1.6	Verizon (the Company) recognizes Communications Workers of America (the Union) as the exclusive representative of the employees for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, hours, and conditions of employment.
ARTICLE 2 JURISDICTION OF WORK
2.1	The Company agrees that it will not work supervisory employees who are excluded from the bargaining unit on work normally performed by bargaining unit employees. Supervisors may perform work only when it is necessary during the process of actually training an employee or during periods of emergencies. The parties, however, recognize that there are proper exceptions to this general practice made in the
1
interest of training, service, and, in such cases, nothing herein is intended to prohibit the Company from working such supervisory employees on such non-supervisory work for short periods of time.
ARTICLE 3
DEDUCTION OF UNION DUES
3.1	Company to Deduct Dues and Initiation Fee
3.1.1	The Company agrees to make deductions of an initial initiation fee and of monthly Union membership dues from the pay of any eligible employee upon receipt from the Union of written authorization property executed by the employee.
3.1.2	The only recognized form will be that entitled "Payroll Allotment Authorization for Union Dues or Amount Equivalent to Union Dues" as mutually agreed upon.
3.1.3	The Company will forward amounts so deducted to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union or, upon direction, to the duly designated representative.
3.2	Cancellation of Union Dues
3.2.1	It is understood that any authorization of dues deductions shall be irrevocable for the period of one (1) year from the date of the authorization or until the expiration of this Agreement, whichever first occurs. This also applies to any dues increase in such period.
3.2.2	After the period of one (1) year, and prior to the expiration of the Agreement, employees may cancel and revoke their dues authorizations by giving written notice to the Company with a copy to the Union not more than forty (40) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the anniversary date of this Agreement.
3.3	Suspension of Dues Deductions
3.3.1	Dues deductions shall be suspended during payroll periods in which sufficient earnings and benefits payments are not available, and such dues deductions shall be automatically resumed when there are sufficient earnings and/or benefits in the payroll period in which dues are deducted.
2
3.4	Company to Furnish List
Each month the Company shall furnish the Union by computer tape:
3.4.1	The names of employees for whom initiation fees and dues deductions are made and the amount for each employee.
3.4.2	The names of employees who have dues deduction cards on file and for whom no deductions are made together with reasons therefore.
3.5	The Company will provide a list of all employees on a monthly basis.
3.6	Company Liability
3.6.1	The Union agrees that the Company assumes no responsibility in connection with deductions of dues except that of forwarding monies deducted as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Article. It is understood and agreed that neither Verizon Southwest Incorporated nor any of its Officers or Agents shall be held liable in any way by virtue of its honoring this assignment nor for any loss by action of the Union or its Officers.
ARTICLE 4
UNION BUSINESS & RESPONSIBILITIES
4.1	Union notices of a non-controversial nature may be posted on the Company’s bulletin boards in a space reserved for Union notices and will be maintained by a designated Union Representative. The Union will notify the appropriate manager as to the employee who has been given the responsibility for Union postings. The Union agrees to use the bulletin boards only for the posting of notices of social functions, meetings, elections, and Union appointments.
4.2	Employees are prohibited from using Company equipment in support of Union or personal business. Literature may not be distributed in work areas even though some employees may remain there to eat their lunch. Distribution of literature will be made during the non-work time of both employee Union Representatives making the distribution and employees receiving the literature. Furthermore, the Union will assure that all undistributed literature is removed and cleaned up from the distribution points at the end of each non-worked period.
4.3	Neither the Union nor its members shall conduct Union activities on Company time, nor shall such activities occur in work areas except for time spent attending a formal grievance meeting.
3
4.4	The Union will be allowed a fair amount of time during the new-hire orientation to present applicable Union issues.
ARTICLE 5
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS & RESPONSIBILITIES
5.1	The Company has and will retain the exclusive right and power to manage its business and direct the working forces, including but not limited to the right to hire, classify, grade, monitor and record customer calls, suspend, reassign, layoff, discharge, promote, demote or transfer its employees, to assign or reassign work functions, to use new or improved methods, material or equipment, to prescribe reasonable work rules, to contract work out, to establish schedules of work, to develop and administer work standards and performance requirements, to decide the number of full-time, part-time, occasional and temporary employees needed at any particular time or place, to create new classifications or revise them, and to be the sole judge of the quality and acceptability of the service, except as such rights may be directly and specifically limited by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or is to be construed in any way to interfere with the recognized prerogative of the Company to manage and control the business.
ARTICLE 6 RESPONSIBLE RELATIONSHIP
6.1	The Company and the Union recognize that it is in the best interests of both parties, the employees, and the public that all dealings between them be characterized by mutual responsibility and respect. To ensure that this relationship continues and improves, the Company and the Union and their respective representatives at all levels will apply the terms of this contract in accordance with the language contained therein and consistent with the Union's status as exclusive bargaining representative of all employees in the unit. The grievance and arbitration provision shall be the sole remedy for all grievances which are qualified subject matter for arbitration.
6.2	Each party shall bring to the attention of all employees in the unit, including new hires, their purpose to conduct themselves tn a spirit of responsibility and respect and of the measure they have agreed upon to ensure adherence to this purpose.
4
ARTICLE 7
NON-DISCRIMINATION
7.1	The Company and the Union agree that they will not discriminate against any employee because of membership in the Union or because of any Union activity in which the employee properly engages. Both parties reaffirm their intention that the provisions of this Agreement will continue to be applied without discrimination because of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, handicap, or veteran's status of the employee.

11.1.	2 "Working Days" as used in this Article shall not include Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.
Section 2.	Intent of Grievance Procedure
11.2 It is the intent of both parties that grievances filed shall be processed with sincerity and dispatch.
Section 3.	Reporting of Grievances
11.3.	1 In presenting grievances, the statement of grievance shall describe in substance the specific matters complained of, briefly, but in sufficient detail that dates, time if pertinent, occurrences, and the nature of the circumstances causing the grievance can be identified readily. The names and locations of employees concerned shall also be given where the grievance relates to specific employees as opposed to a general complaint.
a)	There shall be a statement as to the specific section, or sections, of this Agreement believed to have been violated or misinterpreted. If the grievance is not based on the foregoing, then the statement shall include information as to the foundation for the complaint.
b)	Grievances to be presented to Step Two of the grievance procedure, and thereafter, shall be in writing and contain the above required information.
11.3.	2 Grievances (except involving discipline, discharge, suspension or disciplinary demotions) shall be presented to the Company within thirty (30) days of the action complained of or within thirty (30) days from the time when the employee first learns of the grievance, whichever is later. If the grievance is not presented within these time limits, it shall not be considered a grievance under the terms of this Agreement except by mutual consent.
11.3.	3 Grievances arising as a result of a discharge, suspension, disciplinary demotion or discipline shall be presented within ten (10) days.
11.3.	4 Requests for meetings shall include notice of time, place, purpose and names of those expected to attend on behalf of the Union. The place and time shall be mutually agreed upon with each party giving due consideration to the convenience of the other.
9
a)	At any meeting held under this Article for the adjustment of a grievance, any person present shall be afforded full opportunity to present any facts and arguments pertaining to the matter under consideration.
b)	The Union and/or the Company may take minutes or notes during the meeting for its own purpose by stenographic or other similar means. Either party alternately may secure the services of a professional stenographer or court reporter, in which case the other party, at request, shall be provided a copy at its own cost for reproduction.
Section 4.	Grievance Steps and Disposition
11.4.	1 Generally, grievances shall be presented by the Union representatives and processed through the following procedure:
Prior to the first step meeting, an informal resolution meeting between the supervisor and employee should take place. The employee may request to have a local Union steward present for this discussion. If the issue is not resolved at this meeting and the Union desires to move forward with the grievance process, a joint investigation may be appropriate. Such investigation should be performed by the first level supervisor and the local Union steward prior to the first step meeting.
Step 1 - The Company will be represented by second and third level management or their designated representatives. The Union will provide a committee of local Union representatives, including the grievant. Pay shall be allowed for not more than three (3) employees including the grievant.
Step 2 - The Company will be represented by a Labor Relations Manager or a representative with authority to settle the grievance. The Union will be represented by a Staff Representative and a local Union representative(s). The grievant may only be present for grievances involving suspension or termination, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties. Pay shall be allowed for up to two (2) employees.
11.4.	2 Circumstances permitting, the Company agrees to meet with the Union representative within ten (10) working days after a request for grievance meeting is received. If the Company fails to meet within ten (10) working days and if no mutual agreement exists for a later date, the Company shall be considered in default and the Union may immediately request a meeting at the next higher step.
11.4.	3 If the grievance is not settled at the initial step and the Union elects to
10
present the grievance to the second step, it must do so within fifteen (15) working days following receipt of the Company's decision.
a) The Union will explain the appeal to the second step so as to present its position in each such appeal.
11,4.	4 When the Union has presented a grievance in writing, the decision of the Company shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Union within ten (10) working days after the final conclusion of any negotiations at first step and within fifteen (15) working days of second step. Failure of the Company to submit its decision within the time limits specified shall be considered a default unless the parties agree to a later date, and the Union may immediately request a meeting at the next higher step.
a)	Failure of the Company to meet at Step 2 within the time limit specified, or to submit its decision at Step 2 within the time limits specified, shall be considered completion of the grievance procedure.
b)	Time limits shall be measured from the postmarked date of the written instrument, when properly addressed, from verified date of hand-delivery or from verified date of electronic delivery.
11.4.	5	If the grievance is not submitted to the next applicable level as outlined
in this Article within the time limits specified, it shall be considered settled and shall not be eligible for further appeal except by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
11.4.	6 By mutual agreement between representatives of the Company and the Union, time limits as outlined in this Article may be modified.
11.4.	7 Once a grievance has been presented by the Union to the Company, representatives of the Company will not settle nor attempt to settle such grievance with an employee or employees unless a Union representative has been given an opportunity to be present.
11.4.	8 Nothing in this Article shall be construed to deprive any employee or group of employees from presenting individually to the Company any complaint, and to have such complaints adjusted without the intervention of the Union, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and provided further that a Union representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
11
Section 5.	Grievance Meetings During Working Hours
11.5.	1	When representatives of the Union attend grievance conferences with
representatives of the Company, they shall suffer no loss of basic pay at straight time rate plus any applicable differential and/or premium payments for time spent in actual meeting and such necessary travel time as may be mutually agreed to, subject to the following provisions:
a) Pay shall be allowed only if such meetings are held during such employee's scheduled working hours and only if such employee would have worked had they not attended such meetings.
11.5.	2 Such time paid for in accordance with this Section shall be considered as time worked.
Section 6.	Investigation of Grievances
11.6 The Company agrees to cooperate with the Union in investigation of any grievance, provided prior notice has been given and approval obtained at the proper level of the organization.
Section 7.	Other Methods of Settling Grievances
117 Nothing in the foregoing procedure shall be interpreted to prevent either the Company or the Union from, by mutual choice in unusual cases, dealing directly with one another or on other basis than herein set out, by mutual agreement between them.
Section 8.	Discussion of Other Matters
11.8 Union representatives may meet with the Company at any reasonable time for the purpose of discussing informal complaints concerning working conditions or problems not specifically covered by the provisions of this Agreement. The parties will strive toward solution of any such problems presented, but failure to reach agreement shall not, of itself, qualify the subject matter as a grievance.
ARTICLE 12 ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
12.1	A grievance which has not been satisfactorily settled after it has been presented in writing and processed completely through the grievance procedure contained in this Article may be submitted to arbitration by the Union notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days and the American Arbitration Association within ninety (90) days from the
12
date of the Company answer at the third step (or the date of the default by the Company) provided the grievance concerns:

a) The arbitration shall be conducted under the then existing rules of the Association.
12.4	The arbitrator shall be confined to the subjects submitted for decision and may in no event as a part of any such decision impose upon either party any obligation to arbitrate any subjects which have not been agreed upon as subjects for arbitration, nor may the arbitrator as a part of any such decision effect reformation of this Agreement or otherwise alter any of its provisions.
a)	In rendering the decision, the arbitrator shall be confined to the specific issue and to the matters set forth in 12.1a and 12.1b of this Article as may be appropriate.
b)	The arbitrator shall not possess authority to assess damage or punitive payments against either party to the other.
c)	The arbitrator shall have authority to include in the order an award for money restitution to any employee, or employees, when improper payment, or failure to make proper payment, is a point at issue in the specific complaint. In making any such award for restitution, however, the arbitrator will follow the "make whole" concept and no more.
12.5	The decision of the arbitrator shall be rendered without delay and shall
be final and binding on all parties and shall be enforceable in a court of law.
12.6	Each party shall bear the expense of presenting their own case and
13
shall share equally the expenses of the arbitrator and the general expense of the arbitration.
12.7	The grievance procedure and arbitration provided herein shall constitute the sole and exclusive method of determining adjustments for settlement between the parties of any and all grievances as herein defined, and the grievance procedure and arbitration provided herein shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy to be utilized by the parties hereto for such determination, decision, adjustment, or settlement of any and all grievances as herein defined.
a) Nothing in this Section is intended to impair the right of either the Company or the Union to apply to the National Labor Relations Board for relief from unfair labor practices as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.

13.3	Job briefs will be posted on the Verizon Intranet site. The posted job briefs provide only a general outline of the work functions assigned to a classification. The specific job duties and qualification requirements for a particular job vacancy may vary within the same classification.
13.4	A qualified employee may be awarded a transfer if the employee has not had a job change within eighteen (18) months. This time limit may be waived at management’s discretion.
13.5	It is understood and agreed that in all cases consideration shall be given to knowledge, training, ability, skill, performance, adaptability, safety, and attendance record. When qualifications are relatively equal, seniority shall govern. If there are no qualified bidders within the bargaining unit, management may fill the vacancy at its discretion.
14
ARTICLE 14 BOARD & LODGING, PER DIEM, & TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCE
14.1	Any Company-authorized travel will follow Company policy for pay and reimbursement and the provisions of the primary Texas Collective Bargaining Agreement as it would apply.

All other employees who are laid off will have recall rights for one (1) year from the date of separation if they complete the Company-provided recall form and return it by the last day worked. Failure of an employee to complete and return the recall form will terminate recall rights.
16.6	While on recall, the Company must be kept informed of the current mailing address at which the laid off employee can be reached. Reemployment shall be offered in person or by certified mail addressed to the latest address provided to the Company. When an offer of reemployment has been made, the Company shall be advised of
15
acceptance or refusal within five (5) calendar days of the date of delivery of the offer of re-employment. If accepted, the former employee shall report for duty at the designated work location as soon as mutually agreed but in no case later than seven (7) calendar days (fifteen [15] calendar days if currently employed) from the receipt of notification of the offer.

ARTICLE 17 ACCREDITED SERVICE & SENIORITY
17.1	Accredited service means the aggregate of the years and months of active employment in the service of the Company, its predecessors, and its associated Companies affiliated with Verizon that is recognized for service purposes. Accredited service shall include all active employment for which a wage or salary was paid and any additional excused absence time or leave of absence time that has been or will be specifically approved for service credit purposes in accordance with the policy, procedures or published statements established by the Company.
17.2	Regular employees accrue accredited service under this Agreement governed by the most recent date of employment unless adjusted as a result of a break in service. Temporary employees do not accrue accredited service; however, if a temporary employee becomes a regular employee, the employee's accredited service reflects the total accumulated straight time hours from the date of hire.
17.3	Accredited service will continue to accrue during an extended military leave or FMLA leave from which the employee returns to active employment status immediately following the leave, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement.
17.4	Accredited service entitles an employee to a specific amount of vacation, service awards, short-term disability benefits, and retirement benefits.

17.6	Seniority under this Agreement is the length of continuous service as an employee covered by the bargaining unit except as modified by the Service and Seniority Memorandum of Agreement.
17.7	Regular employees accrue seniority rights under this Agreement governed by the most recent date of hire.

17.8	The Company agrees to furnish the Union with a list showing seniority dates and accredited service dates for all employees covered hereunder.
17.9	Where two (2) or more employees have the same seniority date, the employee with the earlier birth date will be considered the most senior.

18.1.1	Departmental Leave. A departmental leave is an unpaid excused leave of absence, service requirements permitting and for valid and reasonable purposes, of at least ten (10) days but less than thirty (30) days. A departmental leave does not require the completion of a Leave of Absence form. During the departmental leave, the employee’s position will be held open and the employee will continue to
17
receive current benefit elections (medical, dental, and basic life). Employees are expected to have used all vacation before being granted a departmental leave.
18.2	Union Business Leave. During initial staffing of this Center, the Company will allow a maximum of three (3) employees five hundred twenty (520) hours per year when the business of the Local requires unpaid time off for Local officers and/or designated Union representatives. Once the Center is fully staffed (two hundred fifty [250]+ employees), the maximum number of employees will change to six (6). When such absences are less than thirty (30) days, no leave of absence shall be required. Schedules will be submitted to the Company for approval. With adequate notice given, such request shall be granted provided such time off will not impair the orderly scheduling of work or the operation of the Company. Employees granted unpaid time off for Union activities shall be treated as any other employee when overtime is required.
18.2.1	Should either the Company or the Union encounter unforeseen circumstances that create a need to modify a pre-planned unpaid absence, a timely discussion shall be initiated to cooperatively attempt to address both parties' scheduling needs.
18.3	Except under unusual circumstances, no employee will be granted more than one (1) leave of absence in any calendar year.
18.4	No leave of absence, other than military, will ordinarily be granted to an employee with less than twelve (12) months of continuous employment.
18.5	No absence shall be authorized for the purpose of pursuing another vocation or accepting gainful employment while on a leave of absence, with the exception of approved military leave. Any employee who violates this provision automatically terminates his/her employment. No leave may be granted without assurance from the employee that he or she definitely intends to return.
18.6	Military Leave. Military leaves of absence will be granted to regular employees of the Company entering military services of the United States under any law which is now in effect or may in the future be enacted by the United States in accordance with Company policy.
18.7	Military Reserve Training. If a regular employee is a member of the National Guard, Air National Guard, or a reserve component and is subject to annual training duty, the employee will be paid as follows:
a)	Employees who receive military pay will be paid
18
the difference between the employee’s total military pay and the Company base pay. In no event shall said pay cover any more than two (2) weeks in a given calendar year in which the employee performs such training duty.
b)	Employees who do not receive military pay will be paid a maximum of two (2) weeks pay by the Company in any one (1) calendar year.
18.7.	1 Employees should request training leave well in advance to avoid work schedule conflicts. An employee, to be eligible for payment as provided above, shall in writing request time off for annual training duty and, at the conclusion thereof, furnish the Company written evidence of the amount of military pay received.
18.8	Bereavement A regular employee shall be paid at the basic hourly rate for a period not to exceed three (3) scheduled working days due to a death in his/her immediate family.
18.8.1	A regular employee may request up to three (3) additional days off without pay or use his/her earned and unused personal holidays or vacation for such time. Management will make reasonable effort to accommodate such request. The three (3) days off without pay will not count against the employee's attendance or occurrence rates.
18.8.2	An employee with less than six (6) months of service will be excused for up to three (3) days without pay, and such time will not count against his/her attendance or occurrence rates. Such employee may use unused personal holidays if available.
18.8.3	“Immediate family” shall be understood to mean spouse, children, step-children, parents, spouse’s parents, stepparents, brothers and sisters (including half), grandparents, great-grandparents, spouse’s grandparents, grandchildren, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, nieces and nephews, foster children and wards of the court, or anyone who lives in the immediate household as a member of the family.
18.9	Jury and Witness Duty. A regular employee who is called and serves on a jury or is subpoenaed as a witness in a County, State, or Federal Court will be paid at the employee's basic rate for the time lost from work except if the employee is a defendant, plaintiff, or other party to the proceedings.
19

26.7	Benefit Prorate. Part-time Equivalent Workweek (PTEW) will be the tool to manage part-time entitlements. New hires or transferees will be assigned a PTEW based on the hours an employee is expected to work. PTEW will be recalculated annually, no later than January 1 each year, based on the hours worked. PTEW will be used to determine prorated pay for vacation, short-term disability benefits, holiday pay, bereavement leave, employee benefits contribution, etc.
26.7.1	Part-time Equivalent Workweek is calculated as follows:
1.	Determine the employee’s actual average number of straight time hours worked per month during the preceding three-(3) month period (or for new hires, the estimated scheduled hours per month for the initial three (3) months of employment) and divide by 3; then
2.	Divide by 4.33 (average weeks in a month), and round the result to the next higher whole number; then
3.	Divide by 5 (the number of days in a week); the result
4.	Equals the hours a part-time employee is to be paid per day for each holiday, vacation, or sick day for a three-(3) month period.
Example: Average of 68 hours per month divided by 4.33 equals 15.7; rounded to a “part-time equivalent workweek" prorate of 16 hours divided by 5 days equals 3.2 hours. This employee would be paid 3.2 hours per holiday, vacation, or short-term disability day.

Additional tours/hours will be offered in rotation to the degree practical. Any error in the rotation will be corrected at the next opportunity. The establishment of the rotation list will begin with the most senior employee.
27.5	The Company may assign overtime or extension of tours, both scheduled and non-scheduled. All employees are expected to perform overtime extension work upon request from the Company. Under extenuating circumstances, the overtime requirement may be waived at supervisory discretion.
ARTICLE 28

1.	A $15 co-payment, or a $5 co-payment for children under age 13, per FHS physician visit per day, regardless of the length of the visit or the number of visits on a given day. Outpatient diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgery services and supplies provided by Shannon Hospital are fully covered.
2.	A $15 co-payment per FHS physician visit for the first visit only for maternity as explained in Item E below.

E.	Eligible participants will be offered a Free Babies Program which includes delivery services at no additional cost by FHS physicians for inpatient services, outpatient services, physician services and routine diagnostic testing (sonograms included, amniocentesis excluded).

F.	Employees and their eligible dependents may participate in a Primary Care Physician Introduction Visit once every two (2) years at no cost to the Participant.

The selection of the Health Care Plan Administrator, the administration of the Family Health Service and all the terms and conditions relating thereto, and the resolution of any disputes involving the terms, conditions, interpretation administration, or benefits payable shall be determined by and at the sole discretion of the Company.
If administratively and economically feasible, the Company, at its sole discretion, may choose at a later date to terminate the Family Health System.

Upon termination of FHS the sole Verizon Company-sponsored plan will be the Comprehensive Medical Plan.
I.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 6, 2005, and shall expire on February 27, 2010. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement, including the Family Health Service, shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

The following Guidelines shall apply for the application of the Plan:

4.	ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The Company will have the sole and exclusive responsibility of establishing and administering the Plan through the implementation of objectives associated with each of the performance measure areas.
64
The Company reserves the exclusive right to adjust the objectives as required to ensure equitable treatment of all parties.
The Plan will be administered by LiveSource.
a.	ELIGIBILITY
In the event that an individual becomes a participant in the Plan during a quarter, eligibility for incentive compensation will begin on the first day of the following month. Payouts will be pro-rated based on the number of full months that the employee was on the Plan.
Regular full-time employees must work a minimum of six weeks or 240 hours in a quarter to be eligible for an incentive award.
Part-time and temporary employees must work a minimum of 240 hours in a quarter to be eligible for an incentive award which will be prorated to the actual number of hours worked (not to exceed 520) in the Plan quarter.
b.	MODIFICATIONS OR SUSPENSIONS
The provisions of the Plan may be modified or suspended, in whole or in part, at any time. If suspended, any or all of the provisions may be reinstated. Any modifications or suspensions shall not affect a pro-rata incentive earned during a particular quarter up to the date immediately preceding the modification or suspension.
c.	RESIGNATION, LAYOFF, TERMINATIONS, RETIREMENT, DISABILITY OR DEATH
In the event that a participant resigns, is laid off, terminates, retires, becomes disabled or dies during the Plan quarter, he/she or the designated beneficiary(ies) will be eligible to receive an award based on performance up to the effective date of resignation, layoff, retirement, disability or death, provided that a minimum of six weeks or 240 hours was worked during the quarter and all other eligibility requirements have been met. The amount of the award will be computed by the Company and payment made when awards are paid to other plan participants.
d.	OFF-LINE TIME
To calculate schedule time for compliance to schedule, the Company will use total “working” time, as defined by the scheduling tool. Scheduled lunch and break are not included in “working" time. All exception off-line time defined as “working" time is included in scheduled time. This off-line time includes (but is not limited to):
65

Deductions for federal, state and local tax liabilities will be calculated and withheld as appropriate from all awards.
i.	GRIEVANCE/ARBITRATION
The Incentive Compensation Plan shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
66
j.	OVERTIME PAYMENT DETERMINATION
Incentive dollars are payments for hours worked and must be included in the regular rate for overtime payment purposes.
An employee’s wage incentive award for overtime payments will be calculated as follows:
Incentive dollars paid divided by total hours worked x .5 x number of overtime hours in the same period of time for which the incentive dollars were paid.
This calculation should be done when incentive dollars are paid and overtime hours are worked. The hours worked and overtime hours used in the calculation should represent the same period of time for which the incentive payment is being made. As an example, if the incentive payment is quarterly, the total hours worked and the total number of overtime hours worked for that same quarter would be used in the calculation.
Example Calculation:		
Quarterly Incentive Award	$55.00	T
Total Hours Worked	470	=
Incentive Hourly Rate	$0.1170	x
Vi Overtime Rate	0.5	=
Hourly Overtime Rate of Pay	$0.0585	x
Total Overtime Hours	24	—
Overtime Payment	$1.40	
The overtime-incentive payment is not included in benefit plan calculations.
The incentive award overtime payment will be included in the regular quarterly incentive award payout.

PENSION PLAN SURVIVOR BENEFITS
1.	Verizon Southwest Incorporated and Communications Workers of America agree to modify the Plan for Hourly Employees' Pensions. Such modifications will be effective March 6, 2005, and are subject to applicable law.
2.	The existing pre-retirement survivor pension benefit provisions of the Pension Plan shall be amended to provide a pre-retirement survivor pension benefit for an employee who dies, either during active service or prior to commencing a pension benefit, at a time when he or she is unmarried and has accrued at least five years of vesting service.
3.	An unmarried employee may, at any time prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying, designate any living person as the designated beneficiary for the pre-retirement survivor pension benefit. The employee may likewise revise the beneficiary designation at any one or more times prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding when the benefit is payable, the pre-retirement survivor pension may be distributed as a 65% survivor annuity, or the lump sum equivalent, based upon the beneficiary's election.

6.	If a vested employee terminates employment on or after the effective date, the named survivor will be eligible for the survivor pension payable on the date the employee would have reached the age 65. An actuarially reduced benefit may be payable before age 65 if the vested employee would have been eligible for an earlier commencement.

7.	In addition, the Pension Plan shall be amended to allow an employee, at the time of commencing a pension benefit, to designate any living person as the beneficiary for any of the forms of joint and survivor annuity offered under the Pension Plan or any of the term-certain forms of benefit. In the case of an employee who is married at the time of commencing a pension, the employee may not designate any beneficiary other than the spouse without complying with the spousal consent rules of the Plan.
8.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 6, 2005, and shall expire on February 27, 2010. The parties specifically agree that all the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also expire on February 27, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement, unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
between
VERIZON SOUTHWEST INCORPORATED
and
COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA
VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEES BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION (VEBA)
Verizon Southwest Incorporated (hereinafter referred to as the Company) and Communications Workers of America (hereinafter referred to as the Union) hereby mutually agree to the establishment of an Internal Revenue Code Section 501 (c) (9) trust (also known as Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trust) to provide for the payment of medical or other permissible welfare benefits and administrative service costs ("Retiree Medical Benefits") for eligible employees who retire between January 1, 2009, and February 27, 2010. with a service or disability pension under the GTE Southwest Inc. Plan for Hourly-paid Employees' Pensions and their beneficiaries (hereinafter referred to as the Eligible Participants). This trust is being established to provide benefit security for the term of this Memorandum of Agreement.
1.	The funding and operation of this trust will be determined by the Company based on reasonable financial standards (and where applicable, regulatory approval for recovery).
2.	The Company agrees that funds placed into this trust will be used exclusively to pay for the benefits and administrative costs described below or for any other purpose permitted by law.
3.	Effective January 1, 2009, the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits for the Eligible Participants shall be governed by the RETIREE OPTIONS Summary Plan Description, which may be amended or discontinued by the Company at its discretion subject to paragraph 8 below.
4.	In order to receive Retiree Medical Benefits, the retiree must pay a percentage of the Retiree Medical premium ("Retiree Contribution Percentage"). Similarly, the Company will pay a percentage of the premium ("Company Contribution Percentage"), subject to Section 5 below. During the term of this Memorandum of Agreement, the Company and Retiree Contribution Percentages will be based on the following contribution schedule:
Years of Accredited Service at Retirement	Company Contribution Percentage	Retiree Contribution Percentage
Less than 10	0	100
10 through 14	20	80
15 through 19	40	60
20 through 24	60	40
25 through 29	80	20
30 and over	90	10
85
5.	(a) The Company shall determine the cost of providing Retiree Medical Coverage
("Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums"). Further, it is the Company's intention to cap the amount it pays toward such Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2009.
(b)	When the Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums for the $400 deductible coverage option under RETIREE OPTIONS reach the figures set forth in the chart below ("Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums"), the Company Contribution Amount shall be capped and the Company shall make no additional contributions towards Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums.
Coverage Category	Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premium
Retiree only (primary coverage)	$11,500
Retiree plus one dependant coverage	$23,000
Family coverage	$26,000
Medicare covered Retiree (per eligible life)	$4,900
(c)	The Maximum Company Contribution Amount applicable to each Coverage Category shall be determined by multiplying the applicable Company Contribution Percentage times the Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premium as set forth above for that coverage. The applicable Maximum Company Contribution Amount shall not increase when the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium exceeds the amount set forth in the chart above.
6.	In order to receive Retiree Medical Benefits, the retiree must pay the Company the amount the Retiree Medical Premium exceeds the Company Contribution Amount as described in paragraphs 4 and 5 above ("Retiree Contribution Amount"). When the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium reaches or exceeds the Capped Retiree Medical Benefit Premium, the retiree must pay the Company the amount the Retiree Medical Benefits Premium exceeds the Maximum Company Contribution Amount.
7.	The Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premium and the Maximum Company Contribution Amount set forth in paragraph 5 above is based upon the $400 deductible coverage option. If the retiree elects the $200 deductible coverage option, the Retiree Contribution Amount will increase by the amount the $200 deductible coverage option exceeds the $400 deductible coverage option. If the retiree elects the $1000 deductible coverage option, the Retiree Contribution amount will decrease by the amount the $1000 deductible coverage option is less than the $400 deductible coverage option (not to exceed zero). When the Retiree Medical Benefit Premiums for the $400 deductible coverage option reach the amounts set forth in the chart in paragraph 5, the Company Contribution Amount for all coverage options, including the $200 and $1000 deductible coverage options, shall be capped at that time and the Company shall make no additional contributions toward Retiree Medical Benefits.
8.	The Company agrees to notify the Union and to discuss its actions should the Company determine that the funding or operation of the trust and/or applicable sections of this Memorandum of Agreement, other than pooling of claims experience
86
and those sections relating to the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits, need to be modified or rescinded prior to the expiration of the Articles of Agreement. This notification will take place, in writing, within fifteen calendar days prior to the date of modification or rescission. This notification will specify the cause for and affect of this action. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on such changes, the funding or operation of the trust and/or applicable sections of this Memorandum of Agreement, other than pooling of claims experience and those sections relating to the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits, will be modified or rescinded at the Company's discretion.
9.	The funding and operation of the trust; the level and administration of the Retiree Medical Benefits; amount or cost of premiums; premium pricing mechanisms; the attainment of the Maximum Company Contribution Amount; the selection of the claims administrator, alternate health carrier or insurance carrier; eligibility for the benefits; all terms and conditions related hereto, and the resolution of any disputes involving the terms, conditions, interpretation, administration, or benefits payable shall rest with the Company and shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
10.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 6, 2005, and shall be in effect for the duration of this Agreement. The parties specifically agree that this Memorandum of Agreement, the Retiree Medical Benefits described herein, and the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement relating to Retiree Medical Benefits, including but not limited to the Maximum Company Contribution Amount and the level and type of Retiree Medical Benefits shall terminate on February 27, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

HOURLY SAVINGS PLAN (HSP)
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter "CWA" or "the Union") and Verizon Communications companies which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies" or "the Companies" or "the Company") have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
1.	The Company and the Union will make the Hourly Savings Plan (HSP) available to regular full or part-time hourly employees of the Company who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, by action of the Board of Directors, to modify or amend in whole or part, any or all of the provisions of the HSP, but no such amendment or modification shall have the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of members, retired members, former members or their beneficiaries or of diverting any part of the Trust Fund to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of members, former members, or their beneficiaries and the payment of reasonable HSP administration expenses.
3.	The Company reserves the right, by action of the Board of Directors, to terminate or partially terminate the HSP at any time. Upon termination or partial termination of the HSP or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions under the HSP, the member accounts of the members affected by the termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions as the case may be shall be nonforfeitable.
4.	The HSP may be merged into or consolidated with another plan, and its assets or liabilities may be transferred to another plan; provided, however, that no such merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be consummated unless each member and beneficiary under the HSP would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, if the transferee plan then terminated, that is equal to or greater than the benefit he/she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer, if the HSP had then terminated.
5.	The Company and the Union agree that every provision heretofore contained in this Agreement is contingent upon the Company's receipt of a favorable determination that the HSP, as amended, continues to be qualified under Section 401 (a) et. seq., of the Internal Revenue Code.

In the event any portion of this Agreement is determined by a court or government agency to be in violation of existing law or is voided by a change in existing laws, the Company retains the unilateral right to make whatever modifications it deems necessary and appropriate to comply with the law, including the right to rescind the Agreement, if it deems no such modification is
93
feasible. The Company shall have no obligation to bargain or negotiate with the Union in the event that this Agreement is modified or eliminated or in the event the Company does not implement any or all of the provisions of this Agreement because it does not receive Internal Revenue Service approval, any or all of these plans are deemed not qualified, or because of a change in existing laws.
7.	The HSR will be administered solely in accordance with its provisions and no matter concerning the HSP or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement but rather shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the HSP and the interpretation of the HSP Committee.

NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter "CWA" or "the Union") and Verizon Communications companies which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or "the Companies" or “the Company") have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as fallows:
This agreement between Company and the Union covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing; access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, market!ng/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon's business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and Consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct ah effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs tg the employee. With the parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established
96
principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti-management.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Un ion (s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a “third party” or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature, cards of the appropriate unit.
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
97
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a Labor Union. Management's role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the
Union.'
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election." This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election".
(2)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of
support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The “show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
7.	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the CWA for access, Verizon Labor Relations Staff, in conjunction with local management and CWA representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the CWA representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the CWA that the access agreed upon will not interfere with
98
the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the CWA are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the CWA commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate CWA representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the CWA that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either Verizon or the CWA can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
if, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
99
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and CWA believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the CWA agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and CWA.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the CWA, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
