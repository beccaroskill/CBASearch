These rights in no way abridge the right of the Association to bargain with the City over any changes in existing conditions that are mandatory subjects of bargaining or any contracting out of bargaining unit work in accord with Oregon law.
ARTICLE 3	- NON-DISCRIMINATION
In conformance with Oregon law, employees shall have the right to form, join and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing, for the purpose of representation matters of employment relations.

ARTICLE 4	- ASSOCIATION SECURITY
4.1	Time
The Association agrees to identify to the City in writing its representatives. The City agrees to allow time without loss of pay for its members who are designated Association representatives or shift representatives for the purpose of handling and processing grievances and collective bargaining activities. All efforts shall be made to schedule such activities so as not to interfere with departmental operations or staffing levels.
4.2	Checkoff
Any employee who is a member of the Association or who has applied for membership, shall sign and deliver to the Association, who shall forward to the City, an original assignment authorizing deductions of membership dues in the Association.

Pursuant to each authorization, the City shall deduct such dues from the salary check of said employee each month. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted within ten (10) working days to the Association.

4.5	New Hires
The City will notify the Association of all new hires in the unit within two (2) weeks after their having been employed, furnishing the Association with the new employee's name, mailing address and position for which the employee was hired.
4.6	Bulletin Boards

4.7	Use of Buildings
The City agrees to the reasonable use of City meeting rooms for the purpose of holding Association meetings. Such meetings may be held after reasonable notice is given to the City and must conform to the City policy so long as such policy does not unreasonably restrict the use intended by this clause. Such use shall be consistent with the operating needs of the City and not in conflict with any prior scheduled use of the building.
ARTICLE 5	- HOURS AND OVERTIME
5.1	Workweek
The employees’ workweek shall consist of a seven (7) day work schedule with five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour days, with two (2) days off or four (4) ten (10) hour workdays with three (3) consecutive days off (i.e. the seven (7) day work schedule will begin at the start of the employee’s first day of work and end 168 hours later) or a 12-hour shift with rotating days off. If the City changes the employee’s regularly scheduled shift, it will post the available shift starting times two (2) weeks before the shift rotation. The employees who have bid for that shift will select by seniority. It shall be permissible for employees and management to utilize any of the above schedules, or a combination thereof, in order to meet the overall staffing needs of the Department.
When shift changes occur and result in less than eighty hours being worked in a two week pay period, the time less than eighty hours shall be deducted, at an hour per hour rate, from accrued vacation or comp time. If the employee is without accrued vacation or comp time, the time, less than eighty hours, shall be without pay. Any time worked in excess of eighty hours in the two-week pay period will be paid at time and one half.
5.2	Workday
The workday shall consist of an eight (8), nine (9), ten (10), or twelve (12) hour day within a twenty-four (24) hour period, including rest periods, briefing and training periods and the meal period per Article 5.6 (i.e., the twenty-four (24) hour period will begin at the start of the employee's workday and end twenty-four (24) hours later).
City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement
4
5.3	Work Shift
Each employee shall be scheduled to work on a regular shift, and each employee shall have regular starting and quitting times. This shall apply with the following exceptions: Those employees whose special assignment requires a flexible work schedule. These will include officers assigned to Detectives, employees in Trial Service while attending-formalized training to include FTEP, School Resource Officer, Crime Prevention Officer or any other recognized assignment. Their WORK SHIFT will be flexible within a 40-hour week. Therefore, for the purpose of overtime, these employees shall work a 40-hour week.
5.4	Work Schedules
Employees shall select their shift by seniority. Employees shall select shifts on an annual basis for three (3) four (4) month periods. With the exception of persons assigned to a 12 hour patrol shift an employee may work in the same shift for no more than two (2) consecutive periods. Employees assigned to the Lead Dispatcher position will be required to rotate every four months, allowing for each Lead to work a different shift during the calendar year. An exception to the mandatory rotation would be the mutually agreed upon trade between two Lead Dispatchers to trade all or part of the other’s next scheduled shift rotation. This trade may not exceed a period of four (4) months, at which time the Lead Dispatchers must rotate to their next regularly scheduled rotation.
If the City adjusts starting times it will post the available shift starting times two (2) weeks before the shift rotation. The employees who have bid for that shift will select starting times by seniority.
A blank schedule shall typically be posted September 1 for the year's shift beginning January, May and September respectively. Each employee, by seniority, shall fill in their schedule preferences. In order to accomplish the sign-up in a timely manner, each employee will have no more than 48-hours to make a selection. After making a selection, the employee shall initial their selection and document the date and time of their selection. By initialing, the employee is also confirming that they have notified the next senior employee scheduled to bid that the 48 hour time period has started. If an employee fails to make a selection within the allocated 48-hours, the next senior employee shall be entitled to make a selection. The senior employee who missed making a selection will then be entitled to select again. The Association shall turn in the bid schedule to the Deputy Chief within 60 days of posting. The final shift schedule shall be posted at least 30 days prior to its implementation.
If a vacancy occurs during the year, employees will be offered the opportunity to fill the vacancy based on seniority, subject to the City’s reasonable operating needs (including training needs). If an employee volunteers to take the vacant schedule, that employee will fill in the vacancy for the remainder of the rotation. If an employee does not volunteer, an employee will be assigned for the remainder (or duration) of the rotation. Such involuntary assignment will be based on seniority, subject to the City’s reasonable operating needs (including training needs).
5.5	Rest Period
Each employee shall be granted a rest period of 15 minutes during each half (1/2) shift, consistent with the operating needs of the Department.
City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement

5.6	Meal Period
All police officers and community service officers working patrol, dispatchers, property specialists and sworn personnel assigned to Detectives shall be granted a paid meal period during each work shift. All other personnel shall be granted an unpaid meal period. To the extent consistent with operating requirements of the Department, each meal period shall be scheduled in the middle of the work shift, or as near thereto as possible. The paid meal period shall be 30 minutes and shall be considered duty time.
With prior approval from their supervisor, employees assigned to a 12-hour work shift may combine a 15 minute break with a 30 minute meal period. The meal period may be interrupted by emergency calls. If an employee is called out during a meal period due to an emergency, then the employee shall not be entitled to extra compensation for that.
5.7	Overtime
Employees shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1and1/2) times their regular rate2 for over time under the following conditions:
A.	All work in excess of any scheduled workday as defined in section 5.2, except those assigned to a flexible schedule.
B.	All	work	in excess of 40 hours in any one (1) workweek, for non-sworn personnel.
C.	All	work	outside the employee's regularly scheduled workweek as defined in 5.1
Work Schedule.
D.	All	work	in excess of 80 hours in any one (1) pay period for sworn personnel.
E.	In	no event shall any member be compensated twice for the same hours.
In the event that an employee elects to be compensated overtime in compensatory time, such time shall be applied at one and one-half (1and1/2) times the greater of the actual time worked or at the minimum number of hours required under 5.8 Callback.
5.8	Callback
Employees called back to work shall receive overtime pay for the work which they were called back, and if called back, shall be credited with not less than three (3) hours at the overtime rate.
Employees scheduled for court time on their scheduled days off shall be compensated for not less than three (3) hours at the overtime rate, unless short notice of court time is given. Short notice is defined as 24 hours or less. If short notice is given, the employee will be compensated for four (4) hours at the overtime rate. (Short notice does not include grand jury.)
Scheduled day off as used in this article includes regular days off, approved vacation days (regardless of bank utilized) and mutually agreed upon flex days. Employees called back during vacation will be paid for not less than three (3) hours at the overtime rate and vacation leave will be

reduced by three (3) hours. (i.e. Employee is scheduled 8-hours vacation, but is called back to court. Employee will be charged 5-hours vacation and paid 3-hours OT Callback.) Should the employee be required to remain in court for more than 3-hours, the vacation leave will be adjusted accordingly.
In no event shall any member be compensated twice for the same hours.
Callback applies when:
1.	An employee is called back to work during off-duty hours, when the callback is not annexed to the beginning or end of the employee’s regularly scheduled shift.
If at the end of his workday (shift) the employee had departed the City's premises for more than 30 minutes before being called back, the same shall not be considered as holdover time, but shall be considered as callback.
2.	An employee is scheduled for a mandatory meeting at a defined time on the employee’s regularly scheduled day off or during off-duty hours not annexed to the beginning or end of the employee’s regularly scheduled shift.
3.	An employee is required to report to court or grand jury hearings pursuant to a subpoena on the employee’s regularly scheduled day off or during off-duty hours not annexed to the employee’s regularly scheduled shift.
4.	An employee is required to report to court on a scheduled day-off (such as vacation) if the scheduled day-off was approved prior to the receipt of a court subpoena or hearing notice.
Callback does not apply, and employees will be paid based on actual hours worked, when:
1.	Employees works hours annexed to the beginning or end of the employee’s shift.
2.	Employees attend pre-noticed non-mandatory meetings, such as the Safety Committee.
3.	Employees sign-up for an overtime opening of less than 3-hours.
For specifics regarding Training and Mandatory Time, see Article 5.11.
5.9	Distribution of Overtime
The Public Safety Director will maintain a procedure for distributing overtime among the employees in as equitable a manner as possible. In distributing overtime, such things as special qualifications and desires of the employee(s) shall be considered.
5.10	Form of Compensation
Overtime/Callback shall be paid at time and one-half (1 %). Employees may earn up to a total of 120 hours of such compensatory time. Accumulations over 120 hours must be paid as overtime.

City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement
7
During the month of November, up to 60 hours of compensatory time will be paid off at the employee's straight time rate at the employee's request. This compensatory pay off will be granted so long as the employee makes the request prior to November 1.
5.11	Training and Mandatory Time
It is the intent of the City that all department employees receive adequate and appropriate training. To this end, notice of training classes shall be posted and all employees will be given the opportunity to apply for appropriate training classes, workshops, and seminars.
Any training time or mandatory classes, seminars, or other time required by the City such as physical tests, firearms, shoots, etc., outside an employee's regular schedule shall be compensated as overtime. If out-of-town travel is involved, the City shall compensate the employee for all expenses related to the training being received, including the current IRS rate if the employee's personal vehicle is driven.
5.12	Work Schedule
The Grants Pass Police Association and the City of Grants Pass may, through a memo of understanding, implement any mutually agreed upon work schedule for the purposes of functional evaluation and potential adoption by both parties.
ARTICLE 6	- HOLIDAYS
6.1	Designation
In lieu of holidays, an employee shall be assigned 12 holidays on July 1. The employee may elect to use these holidays at a time mutually agreeable to the Department Director or their designee and the employee. If an employee leaves the City service during the year, the employee shall repay the City for holiday compensation if the employee has used more than eight (8) hours for each calendar month of employment.
Employees requesting a day off on a recognized City holiday, as defined in the Personnel Rules, Regulations & Policies, are required to utilize holiday hours. The holiday shall be the actual holiday and not the observed day. Employees working a schedule in excess of 8 hours will only be required to use 8 hours of holiday compensation and may elect to use vacation or earned compensation for the additional scheduled hours. Employees who are within 24 hours of their vacation accrual maximums will be permitted to utilize vacation leave for the full shift.
Employees assigned to the Detective Section shall have the option to choose to work official holidays at their normal rate of pay; however, should the employee elect to take the holiday off; the employee shall utilize holiday compensatory time. If the on-call detective elects to work the holiday, the on-call detective may work half the day and take the remainder of the day off without any deduction from their compensatory time. If the on-call detective chooses to take the recognized holiday off only an amount equivalent to one-half their regular working hours will be deducted from their holiday compensatory time.
Any credits remaining on June 30 of each year will be compensated for in cash at the employee's straight time rate or may be rolled over into the employee's compensatory time bank as long as the cap is not exceeded.
City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement

6.2	Scheduling
Holidays shall be scheduled on a first come first served basis at a time mutually agreed upon by employee and the Department Director. When conflicts occur, seniority shall prevail so long as the senior employee schedules that day off 30 days prior to the actual date. Holidays scheduled during the 30 day period shall be on a first come first served basis as described in 6.1 and shall not be subject to seniority. Only regular employees shall have seniority.
ARTICLE 7	- VACATIONS
7.1	Rate of Accrual
A regular employee shall be eligible for annual vacation time with pay on his anniversary date in accordance with the following:
Completed Service	Hours of Accrual for Each 80 Pay Hours	Days	Annual Accrual	Annual Maximum
6 through 36 months	3.08	10	80	200
37 through 60 months	3.85	12.5	100	200
61 through 84 months	4.62	15	120	240
85 through 120 months	5.39	17.5	140	280
121 months or more	6.16	20	160	320
After 20 years of continuous service, a one-time bonus of 40 hours shall be credited to the employee.
Vacation leave shall not accrue during a leave of absence without pay.
7.2	Continuous Service
Continuous service, for the purpose of accumulating vacation leave credit, shall be based on the regular paid hours worked by the employees. Except that paid time spent by an employee on military leave, sick leave resulting from an injury incurred in the course of employment and authorized educational leave required by the City shall be included as continuous service. Time spent on other types of authorized leave shall not be counted as service, provided that employees returning from such leave and employees on layoff status shall be entitled to credit for service prior to leave or layoff.
7.3	Accrual Limitations
Employees may accrue up to a maximum of 200 hours of vacation leave or twice their annual accrual, whichever is greater. The City shall establish a procedure to notify an employee 30 days in advance of impending loss of accrued vacation time. Such vacation shall be deemed forfeited if not taken unless mutually agreed in writing in advance. An employee who was about to lose vacation credit because of accrual limitations may, by notifying his supervisor 15 days in advance, absent himself to prevent loss of this vacation time. Such action taken by the employee shall not constitute a basis for disciplinary action or loss of pay.
City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement
9
No payment shall be made for vacation time lost by an employee because of accrual limitations, unless the failure to take vacation is caused by the City's insistence that the employee be at work during a scheduled vacation period.
7.4	Vacation Buy-Back
An employee who utilizes at least one-half of his annual vacation accrual each fiscal year may convert up to forty (40) hours of accrued vacation to cash at his straight time rate. Employees may request buy-back during the month of May to be paid in the month of June, or at the time the employee takes one-half of his annual vacation. Buy-back is subject to available budget.
7.5	Scheduling

ARTICLE 9	- OTHER LEAVES OF ABSENCE
9.1	Extended Leave of Absence
A.	Criteria and Procedure.

Within the first three-month period, the employee may apply for an additional 3 months. Once approval is given for the second three months, the City may terminate or cancel such leave by 30 days written notice mailed to the address given by the employee on his written application for such leave.

EXHIBIT D - PHYSICAL AGILITY TEST
GRANTS PASS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY PHYSICAL AGILITY TEST (OFFICERS AND APPLICANTS)
POLICY:
It is the policy of the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety to administer physical agility testing to sworn personnel and applicants applying to the Department.
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this testing is to assure that officers are able to perform the duties of a police officer. It is essential that officers are fit when hired and continue to maintain a minimum level of physical fitness/agility during the course of their careers. The safety and life of the officer, fellow officers and the public we serve, may depend on the officer being able to perform the various, and sometimes strenuous duties of a police officer.
PROCEDURE:
OVERVIEW OF THE TESTING PROCESS
A job analysis of police officers in the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety revealed that they perform certain essential or important physical functions which are vital to their job duties. Many essential functions identified from this job analysis were included in the physical agility examination. A subject matter expert panel meeting comprising law enforcement personnel from this municipality also confirmed that the functions included in the physical agility test were job-related and essential for successful performance as a Grants Pass Department of Public Safety Police Officer.
In Grants Pass, police officers must be able to run (speed and distance), climb through windows, climb over obstacles (i.e., fences), lift, carry, walk, sit or stand for long periods of time and arrest resisting individuals. The Grants Pass Department of Public Safety Agility Examination measures job-related physical skills such as these which are necessary for successful performance as a police officer. Only those skills which do not require training to become proficient are assessed.
The examination is equally valid for assessing the physical skills of candidates with police experience and those without. For example, one portion of the test requires the applicant to climb a chain link fence. It is not necessary to have prior experience as a police officer to possess the physical agility to climb a fence.
TEST PREPARATION
The following suggestions should help you prepare yourself physically for the test:
1.	Avoid junk food and concentrate on a well-balanced diet for several days before the test;
2.	Avoid tranquilizers and stimulants such as caffeinated beverages, especially on the day of the test;
3.	Get a good night’s sleep before the test;
4.	Do not drink a lot of liquids or eat a big meal before the test; and
5.	Avoid alcohol several days prior to and especially on the day of the test.
39
City of Grants Pass / Grants Pass Police Association
Collective Bargaining Agreement
On the day of testing, all officers are required to wear long pants with belt loops. Sport shoes are highly recommended. You will not be allowed to participate in the examination if you are not wearing long pants with belt loops. Belt loops are required because a police utility belt needs to be attached during testing. Sweat pants are not allowed. Shorts are not allowed for safety reasons.
DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST
The test will require the officer to complete several specified physical tasks in a given sequence within an allotted time frame. An orientation is conducted prior to testing.
To simulate a police officer on duty, officers will be provided with and will be required to wear police equipment during the physical testing session. This includes items such as a utility belt, handcuffs, a non-firing pistol in a holster, two magazine pouches containing two magazines and a ballistic vest. Officers are required to bring their own equipment. Applicants will be provided this equipment by the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety at the time of testing.
TEST COMPONENTS
All officers and applicants will be given an orientation and walk through. No one will be allowed to take the test unless they fully understand what is expected of them. The tests is explained in Appendix “A”
To begin the test, the officer will sit in the driver’s seat of a patrol car, a police utility belt and the equipment listed above, and will await further instructions.
A test monitor will give the officer verbal instruction to pursue a fleeing felony suspect (fictitious) by providing a description of what the suspect is wearing (for example a baseball hat and a red t-shirt). The test monitor will provide two pieces of descriptive information. The officer must then complete the following physical tasks:
1.	The officer must get out of the car and run a distance of about 150 feet. Timing begins when the candidate opens the car door.

Grants Pass, OR Public Safety Department Police Physical Agility Examination Test Administration Script
Instructions for preparing all candidates:
Prior to testing applicants, tell all of them:
“The physical agility examination which you are about to take assesses whether a person has the basic physical skills necessary to be a Grants Pass Department of Public Safety police officer. Before having you complete the exam, I will walk all of you through the entire course allowing you to become familiar with the events you will encounter. Please ask any questions that may arise at any time throughout the walk-through. PLEASE REMOVE ALL WATCHES, RINGS, PAGERS AND GLOVES FOR THIS TEST.”
Walk applicants through the entire course and briefly describe each event. If applicants have any questions, stop walking and answer them; then proceed with the rest of the course.
When you get to the suspect identification event, be sure to tell all applicants that the suspects are not real but are mannequins and they must shout out the proper suspect ID number before going to the next exercise.
Bring all applicants to the starting point after the walk-through. Ask applicants if they believe they are physically capable of safely performing all events prior to them going through the course. If any applicant indicates they are not capable for some reason, determine if a reasonable accommodation can be made.
If a reasonable accommodation cannot be made, do not have the applicant go through the course and contact a department representative.
Regarding scoring of the applicants, tell all of them:
“You must successfully complete all events in 58 seconds or less to pass this course. Unsuccessful completion of any event will result in failure of the physical examination”
Finally, in order to test applicants one at a time, tell all of them:
“Applicants will proceed through the course one at a time. When I call your name, please step up to take the exam. For everyone else, please wait patiently until your name is called.”
Testing an applicant
Make sure the applicant is wearing only the necessary equipment (the utility belt, handcuffs, gun in holster, two magazines and one bullet proof vest). Reminder: no rings, watches, pagers, and gloves.
Prior to having the candidate sit in the police car, say”
“As a reminder, once a physical description of a criminal suspect has been provided you will begin the examination and timing will start when you open the car door. Do you know what you are expected to do?”

COURSE LAYOUT
Most of the components of the physical agility course are not movable. The curbs, fence climb, terrain changes, stair climb, asphalt, concrete, and grassy areas are fixed objects. The placement of traffic cones, the patrol car, stairs for stair climb (1), dummy and mannequins are the only objects which must be consciously placed in the same location as they were during field testing. Use the markers on the course and the objects within the course to guide the placement of these moveable objects. It is important for standardization purposes that testing is conducted with the course layout exactly as it was during field testing.
