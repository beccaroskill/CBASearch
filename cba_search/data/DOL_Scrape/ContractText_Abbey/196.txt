2 . New Wage Rates for Changed Jobs
3.21 When changes are made in equipment, method of processing, material processed, or quality or production standards which would result in a substantial change in job duties or requirements; or where over a period of time an accumulation of minor changes of this type have occurred which, in total, have resulted in a substantial change in job duties or requirements, adjustments of hourly, incentive, piecework and tonnage rates may be required. In reviewing changes for hourly, incentive, piecework and tonnage rates, only changes from the original study shall be considered. In such cases new wage rates shall be installed in the following manner:
3.21a a. Negotiations may be instituted by the General Plant Grievance Committee representing affected employees or by Management. Management will develop an appropriate hourly, tonnage, incentive or piecework rate. In addition, the proposed rate will be explained to the General Plant Grievance Committee with the objective of obtaining its agreement to the installation of the proposed rate.
3.21b b. If Management and the General Plant Grievance Committee are unable to agree upon the new rate for the changed job, Management shall, within 30 days, have the alternative of (1) establishing the new rate; (2) setting a temporary rate for a reasonable trial period. In either event, Management shall submit copies of the new rate to the Chairman of the General Plant Grievance Committee. If Management elects to set the new rate for the changed job, the employee may file a grievance at any time within ninety (90) days (except where the parties otherwise mutually agree) from the installation of the new rate, and any change in the rate so determined shall be retroactive to the date of the assignment of the employee to changed job. If Management adopts the
11
alternative of a trial period, the employee, during such trial period, shall be guaranteed his straight time average hourly earnings for the three months immediately preceding the change in the job content. After the expiration of the trial period, the employee or employees affected may, at any time within thirty (30) days, file a grievance and any change in the rate so determined shall be retroactive to a date no earlier than the date of the assignment of the employee to the changed job but no later than the date immediately following the expiration of the trial period. Such grievance shall be adjusted under the grievance procedure of this Agreement and the decision shall be governed by the principle that the new rate shall be in line with other rates in the plant.
3.21c c. The details of applying this provision to cases in which an employee has worked at more than one job during the three months and to other exceptional situations shall be left to negotiations between the General Plant Grievance Committee and Management. The General Plant Grievance Committee and Management may agree to the computation of guaranteed earnings on a group or departmental rather than on individual basis.
3. Settlement of Grievances
3.22	In the processing of grievances under paragraphs H-l-c and H-2-b of this Section, insofar as the comparison of incentive earnings may be necessary, it is agreed that among other things the following factors will be considered: (a) The evaluated hourly rate; (b) Incentive earnings opportunities; (c) Out-of-line incentive earnings shall not be considered in such comparisons.
I.	Cost of Living
3.23	The language of this Subsection I providing for cost-of-living adjustments is suspended and deemed inoperable during the term of this Agreement. *
3.24	The BLS Consumer Price Index (1967-100) following the formula used in the Labor Agreement dated January 1, 1984, that is each employee will receive a IC per hour increase for each .3 point increase in said index, was frozen at 293.6 with the effective roll in on January 1, 1983.
3.25	No further Cost-of-Living Adjustment will be made under the terms of this Agreement.

Work Schedules, Overtime and*Holidays	-
4.0	This Section defines the normal hours of work, provides
the basis for calculation of overtime, and defines holidays. Nothing in this Section is to be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week or a guarantee of days of work per week.
A.	Hours of Work
4.1	Eight (8) continuous hours (except as the same may be
interrupted by such lunch periods as may be provided in accordance with the present practices of the Company) shall constitute a day's work and forty (40) hours shall constitute a week's work. However, work in excess of eight (0) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week is permitted upon the payment of overtime as hereinafter provided.
4.2	A day for any employee shall be defined as a
consecutive twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the time the employee begins work, except that a tardy employee1 a work day shall begin at the time it would have begun had he not been tardy.
B.	Operating Week, Work Schedule and Reporting On and Off
1. Regular Operating Week
4.3a a. The regular operating week shall be confined to five (5) days per week worked between Monday and Friday, inclusive, except, however, in the case of continuous operations departments - Steam & Power Plant & Substation personnel, and Maintenance and Repair employees - in which cases the regular operation week shall be confined to five (5) days per week worked in any seven (7) consecutive day period as scheduled by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion operate the workshops on the basis of six (6) or seven (7) days per week where essential either to effect deliveries or otherwise. However, except as may be required for emergency maintenance and emergency repair work involving breakdowns or protection of life or property or for carrying on highly skilled operations which cannot be reasonably cared for by the employment of additional personnel, or where essential to effect deliveries, no employee shall be requested to work more than sixteen (16) hours overtime in any payroll week of seven (7) days and furthermore, no employee shall be discriminated against or disciplined for his inability to work overtime. It is agreed that inability to work scheduled overtime or on Saturdays and/or Sundays for
13
reasons other than physical or advanced age, shall be of equal validity to any reason for not working nonovertime hours.
4.3b b. If the regular operating week schedule of an employee or a group of employees is changed to less than five days per week as defined in B-l-a hereof for more than five weeks, the Company wherever it is reasonably possible shall put into effect the following:

the extent of the reduced work and inform the committee of the expected duration of such a condition so that the General Plant Grievance Committee may consider the question of working a short workweek or reducing the force.
4.3b3	3. The Company may continue short workweek operations
for a period of ten weeks in any calendar year. Following such ten weeks, the Company will be required to reduce the forces so that a normal five-day schedule may be established.
4.3b4	4. None of the foregoing shall serve to prevent an
employee from using his seniority in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 to claim another job at a similar or a lower classification.
2.	Determination of Starting Time and Work Schedules
4.4	The Company may operate the workshops as may.be
required by the volume of work on hand, at its discretion, on the basis of one or more shifts. Furthermore, determination of starting times and work schedules shall be made by the Company and may be changed by the Company from time to time to suit varying conditions of the business, provided, however, that indiscriminate changes shall not be made in such starting times or schedules and provided further that changes deemed necessary by the Company shall be made known to the General Plant Grievance Committee of the Union as far in advance of such changes as possible.
4.5	Schedules of the employees' regular work days shall be
posted or otherwise made known to employees in accordance with prevailing practice not later than the end of the day shift Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which they shall be effective, provided, however, that in the case of breakdowns or other conditions beyond the control of the Management or because of the requirement of
14
the'business the Management may change such schedules.- An employee required to work a sixth or seventh day in his payroll week shall be advised a minimum of forty-eight (40) hours prior to the sixth or seventh day.
3.	Reporting On and Off
4.6	In recognition of the difficulties imposed upon the
Company through failure of employees to comply with working schedules, an employee reporting late for or absenting himself from work without just cause may be subject to discipline. Employees shall, whenever practicable, give prior notice to the Company whenever they expect to report late for or to absent themselves from work. Such notice shall be given by telephoning to the location designated by Management or, in event telephone facilities are not available, by such other practical means as may be at the employee's disposal. An employee reporting expected absence from work shall state at the time of notification, if possible, when he will return to work. If this is indeterminate at the time, the employee shall notify the Company when he will return to work as soon as such information is available and in no case less than the minimum interval to be established jointly by Management and Union.
C.	Conditions for Payment of Overtime Rates
4.7	1. Time and one-half shall be paid for all hours or parts
of hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any one day or for all hours or parts of hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any payroll week, whichever be greater.

4.11	4. Overtime opportunities will be shared equally by employees in the same job classification, when an employee is bypassed for an overtime assignment in his job classification, he shall be offered the next overtime assignment in the classification. However, such compensating overtime work shall only be offered to an employee when he has been wrongfully overlooked in favor of another employee in the same job classification. Otherwise, a wrongful downgrade shall prompt a settlement under Section S of this Agreement. Overtime downgrading shall not take place until all incumbents in the affected job classification have refused or are not available. For purposes of comparing equal distribution of overtime opportunities at year-end among eligible employees in a job classification, the amount of overtime opportunities in the prior calendar year shall be used.
4.12	5. Overtime and premium time for an hourly rated employee and for an employee employed on a piece rate or tonnage basis or under an incentive plan, shall be computed on the basis of his average earnings for the payroll period.

During such periods of probationary employment, employees may be laid off or discharged as
26
exclusively determined by” the-'Company. Upon completion of such periods, if retained in the employ of the Company, seniority shall date from the original date of employment.
D.	Application of Seniority
7.3	The application of seniority shall be on an employee’s
continuous service with the Company, as well as, in accordance with the following principles:
E.	Demotion, Layoff and Recall
7.4a. a. Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees in any department, employees shall be reduced in their department by reverse promotional sequence on the basis of plant seniority provided the senior employee is qualified to do the available work, those having the most seniority being displaced last from the department and returned first to the department. In evaluating an employee’s qualification to displace a junior employee, Management will consider, among other factors, a comparison of the job classification rates (i.e., "A" "B" or "C" rate) achieved by both employees in the job classification to which the senior employee seeks to bump. If an employee disagrees with the Company’s determination that the employee is not qualified to perform a particular job, and so indicates his or her disagreement to Management, Management may provide the employee with an opportunity to perform the job for a trial period. The length of such trial period shall be at the discretion of Management ,-but, in no event, shall such trial period be more than five (5) working days.
7.4b. b. If no bump is available within the department, the employee may displace a less senior employee as provided below within the plant by plant seniority, if the more senior employee is qualified to do the available work.
7.4b. 1	Bumping procedures when laid off from Home
Department:
a.	Permanent Layoff:
1.	Permanent closure of a Department.
2.	Layoff due to permanent job elimination.
3.	Layoff in excess of one (1) year from Home
Department. "First Option" only may be selected after six (6) months of layoff from Home Department.
27
The permanently laid-off employee will establish a new Home Department and job incumbency by exercising options one through four:
First Option -- Bump to job previously held in another Department on a permanent basis. If more than one job was held on a permanent basis, bump in reverse order of job sequence.
Second Option -- Enter a new Department of choice at the entry-level position, displacing most junior incumbent. See "Entry-Level Jobs" listed below.
Third Option -- Bump, in accordance with the designated bumping procedure, a more junior incumbent in a job listed on the "Bumpable Job List" (Jobs requiring experience and qualifications are identified). Permanently laid-off employees may select any job on the Bumpable Job List including one from his/her Home Department.
Fourth Option -- Employees who believe they have the experience and qualifications to perform a job they have not held on a permanent basis in other than their Home Department, may request a review of their case. If the Company and Union mutually agree, the employee(s) will be permitted to displace the most junior employees in the job, regardless of Department. Employees permitted to bump under this provision will be given up to five (5) days to demonstrate their ability to perform the job.
Fifth Option -- Bump to the Labor Pool. Selection of this Option will not establish incumbency. Incumbency may only be established by successfully
28
bidding on a job which is posted on a plantwide basis.
b.	Long-Term Layoffs of Five (5) Weeks or More:
First Option -- Bump, in accordance with the designated bumping procedure, a more junior incumbent in a job listed on the "Bumpable Job List" {Jobs requiring experience and qualifications are identified).

Employees may be granted their vacation prior to the completion of such service but in such event shall not receive vacation pay until the pay period following the completion of the required length of service.
9.2	2 .	For the purpose of vacations, continuous service shall be defined as and shall be the sum of:	
9.2a	a.	The aggregate of the time prior to September 1, 1956, during which an employee actually worked for the Company and received wages for his services commencing from the time an employee is first employed by the Company or reemployed by the Company after continuous service has been broken pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B of Section 7 hereof, plus
9.2b	b.	The amount of seniority accumulated and retained on and after September 1, 1956.
9.3	3.	a.	It is agreed that the intent of this section is to provide vacations to eligible employees who have been consistently employed. An employee shall be deemed to have been consistently employed for vacation purposes if he worked at least 920 hours within the twelve (12) calendar months immediately preceding January 1 of the year in which the vacation is to be taken. However an employee having worked less than 920 hours, but at least 750 hours, will receive fifty percent (50%) of his
45
vacation, based on years of service. An employee who completes one year of service after December 31st of the preceding calendar year shall have such computation based on the 12 months following the date of his employment. An employee with more than one year of continuous service, who in any year shall be ineligible for a vacation by reason of not having been consistently employed within the meaning of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph as a result of an absence on account of layoff or illness, shall receive one week's vacation with pay in such year if he shall not have been absent from work for six consecutive months in the 12 consecutive calendar months next preceding September 1,
9.4	b. An employee who fails to qualify as having been
consistently employed in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 3-a, Subsection A, of this Section 9 because of absence due to compensable injury shall nevertheless be considered to have been consistently employed provided that compensation was paid to such employee and provided further that the employee actually had worked and drawn wages in some part of the base year for vacation computation. The base year for an employee who completes one year of service after December 31st of the preceding calendar year is the 12 months period following the date of his employment. An employee reinstated to employment following military service in a base year shall have such time of military service considered as time worked in considering his. eligibility, for a vacation in his vacation year.
9.5	c. Notwithstanding the employee's accumulation of one
or more years of continuous service, the payment of accident compensation during the period of absence shall be in addition to such service eligibility.
B.	Length of Vacation
9.6	Each week of vacation shall consist of seven (7)
consecutive calendar days and employees shall take their vacations in one continuous period, provided, however, that in the event the orderly operations of the plant permit, vacation weeks to which an employee is entitled may by mutual agreement be scattered.
C.	Scheduling of Vacation
9.7	1. Time off will be granted for vacations between January
46
1st and December 31st of each calendar year. The Company may shut down the plant or any department for a period of one (1) week or two (2> weeks (a two (2) week period may or may not be consecutive) to grant time off for vacations or it may schedule time off on an individual employee basis. In case the plant or a department is shut down for vacations, such shutdown shall occur between June 15 and the weekend preceding Labor Day. The Company will furnish to the Union and will post a ninety (90) day prior notice of a one or two week shutdown of the plant or a department for vacation purposes. The foregoing requirements of notice and time limitation may be waived by mutual agreement between the Company and the General Plant Grievance Committee for a one-week period of vacation for the employees of a department or a group at some time other than the period between June 15 and the weekend preceding Labor Day.
9.8	2. In the event vacations are scheduled on an individual employee basis, each eligible employee will be requested prior to January 1st of each calendar year, to designate the vacation period which he desires. If this plan is followed, vacations will so far as possible be granted at times most desired by employees, (by Plant Seniority within the Department), but the final right to change such allotments is exclusively reserved to the Company in order co insure the orderly operation of the plant.
9.0	a In the scheduling of vacations on an individual basis, an employee who works 51% of his time in the Labor Pool in the base year shall select vacation in the Labor Pool. If an employee works 51% of his time in his Department, he will select his vacation in the Department.
D.	Vacation Pay
9.9	Each employee granted a vacation will be paid at his
average rate of straight time earnings per hour paid during the calendar year preceding the year in which the vacation is taken. Hours of vacation pay for each vacation week shall be the average hours per week worked by the employee during the calendar year preceding the year in which the vacation is taken, but not less than (a) forty (40) hours per week, or (b) the scheduled workweek of the plant, whichever is larger, nor more than (c) forty-eight (48) hours per week, or (d) the scheduled workweek of the plant, whichever is larger. Calculation of average hours per week and the average rate of straight time earnings per hour shall include the allowed hours for holidays not worked and holiday pay.
47
9.10	Vacation pay shall be paid to employees at the time vacation is taken after February 15th and only in the amount due for the vacation being taken at the time. Employees who take vacation between January 1st and February 15th shall be paid an estimated allowance at the time the vacation is taken and for the number of weeks taken. The difference, if any, is the allowance paid and the actual amount calculated according to the preceding paragraph, shall be paid with the pay received for the first full pay period worked following February 15th.
E.	Special Vacation Benefit
9.11	In addition to any vacation benefit payable in accordance with other provisions of this Section 9 and to any benefits payable in accordance with the Pension Plan of the Company, each employee who retires under the terms of the Pension Plan and is entitled to receive either normal retirement benefits or a benefit applicable to early retirement as set forth in Article 3 of Pension Plan, shall receive at the time of retirement additional vacation benefit in accordance with the following table:
Years of Service for
Pension Purposes	Weeks of Pay
15 or	more	3
20 or	more	4
25 or	more	5
9.12	The amount of additional pay for each week of special vacation benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as set forth in Subsection D of this Section 9 for regular vacation pay.
F.	Vacation Allowance in Lieu of Vacation
9.13 The Company may, with the consent of the employee, pay his vacation allowance in lieu of time off. The vacation allowance due such employee shall be calculated in the same way that vacation pay is calculated for an employee to whom a vacation is granted and shall be paid to such employee not later than the thirty-first day of December.
G.	Quits and Discharges
9.14 No employee shall be eligible to receive any benefits under this Section 9 if he quits or is discharged prior to January 1st of the vacation year.
43
