THIS AGREEMENT, entered into on this 14th day of September, 2003, by and between Meijer Great Lakes Limited Partnership, hereinafter referred to as “Meijer Stores” or the “Employer", and United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 951, as chartered by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, AFL-CIO and CLC, hereinafter referred to as the "Union”, as the collective bargaining agent for and on behalf of certain employees of the Employer as specified herein.
ARTICLE 1:	PREAMBLE
This Agreement shall constitute the complete and only statement of contractual relationship between the Employer and the Union, and it is specifically agreed that any understandings or practices that may have existed contrary to the specific terms and conditions of this Agreement dated September 14, 2003, prior to September 14, 2003, will be given no force or effect hereafter. The parties further agree that understandings or practices include, but are not limited to, resolutions of conflicts on an informal basis. The Employer and the Union accept the provisions of this Agreement as commitments which they will cooperatively in good faith honor, support, and seek to fulfill. The employees covered by this Agreement agree to work for the Employer in accordance with the terms and conditions specified, and the Employer agrees to maintain the terms and conditions specified herein for the life of the Agreement.
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement.
Therefore, the Employer and the Union, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, except for participation in the grievance procedure as specified in the contract, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement, except by mutual understandings.
ARTICLE 2:	COVERAGE
2.1	The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent with respect to rates of pay, hours, and all other terms and conditions of employment for employees in job classifications covered by this Agreement at those units of the Employer located in Michigan in which the Union has been established as bargaining representative as of September 14, 2003.
2.2	This Agreement shall also apply to any remodel of a covered unit, replacement of a covered unit in the same market area, or expansion of any covered unit at the same site, provided that the nature of the operations and/or format of the business after the remodel, replacement or expansion is the same as that which existed at the affected unit prior to the change.
2.3	This Agreement shall also apply to all traditional Supermarket and/or General Merchandise and Warehouse units that are opened by the Employer in Michigan after September 14, 2003, in which the nature of the operations and/or format of the business is the same as that which presently exists at the units identified in paragraph 2.1 above, provided the Union properly establishes its right to be recognized as the bargaining agent for the employees at such unit.
7
2,4	The Employer recognizes the Union as the collective bargaining agent for all full-time and regular part-time Grocery, Meat, Produce, General Merchandise, Warehouse and Property Management and Services employees at the covered units, excluding employees of any lease operation, employees of any existing or future operations which are either not physically attached to a covered unit or are not operated within the same premises as a covered unit, Manager Trainees, Store Directors, Line Managers, Department Managers, Property Management and Services Supervisors, Distribution Center Supervisors, Working Supervisors and the management to which such Managers report, Auditors, Registered Pharmacists, Pharmacy Technicians, Professional, Confidential, Office, Clerical, Systems Monitors, Managerial employees, Security employees and other Guards and Supervisors as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act as amended, and all other employees.
2.5	It is agreed that the Employer may designate certain persons as Managers-in-train-ing and such persons are excluded from this Agreement.
Manager Trainees shall not be used to replace bargaining unit employees. In no case will an employee be assigned as a Manager Trainee for longer than eighteen (18) months in the Company.
ARTICLE 3:	UNION SECURITY
3.1	The Employer agrees not to enter into any other Agreement with any other labor organization during the life of this Agreement with respect to employees covered by this Agreement.
3.2	It shall be a continuing condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the execution date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing and those who are not members on the execution date of this Agreement shall, following five (5) weeks of active employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
It shall also be a continuing condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after the date of execution shall, following five (5) weeks of active employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
For the purposes of the Union Security provision of this section, the execution date of this Agreement shall be considered its effective date.
To be a member of the Union in good standing, as required by this section, an employee must tender to the Union the periodic dues and the initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. Any employee who is required to be a member of the Union by this section and who fails to render such uniform dues and initiation fees shall not be retained as an employee in the bargaining unit so long as the Union has given written notice to the Company and employee of such failure, and such failure is not cured by the employee within seven (7) days of such notice.
The Employer reserves the right to secure new employees from any source whatsoever.
Those employees who maintain a non-member status or change their status to a non-member status and are covered by the terms of this Agreement shall be required to pay as a condition of employment, an initial service fee, monthly (or
8
2003
otherwise) service fees to the Union for the purpose of aiding the Union in defraying cost in connection with the Union’s obligations and responsibilities as the exclusive bargaining agent of the bargaining unit herein.
3.3	The Employer agrees, for the term of this Agreement, to deduct Union dues and/or service fees from the wages of the employees who individually certify in writing authorization for such deduction in a form authorized by law. The Employer agrees, in the case of new Union members, to deduct the Union initiation fee and in the case of a non-member, an initial service fee from the wages of any new or non-member Union employee who certifies in writing authorization for such deduction in a form authorized by law. It is the responsibility of the Union to obtain and deliver to the Employer such written authorization.
The Employer agrees to deduct an amount from the pay of each employee who is a Union member and who executes an appropriate voluntary checkoff authorization for the UFCW 951 Foundation. Deductions shall be in the amount specified in the checkoff authorization form signed by the employee and deducted each pay period. The deduction shall continue for the life of this Agreement for those employees who sign UFCW 951 Foundation checkoff authorization forms unless they are revoked individually and in writing.
The Employer agrees to deliver all sums deducted in this manner to the designated financial officer of the Union, payable to the Local Union. The Employer further agrees to advise the Local Union Office within ten (10) days after information on any permanent transfers, promotions, discharges, or new hires as recorded by the Payroll Department in the Corporate offices.
3.4	The Union agrees to indemnify the Company against any liability received or imposed upon the Company by reason of any action taken by it as directed by Articles 2 and 3.
The Union further agrees to provide legal defense to any claims or to reimburse the Company for costs of legal defense of claims arising under the provisions of Articles 2 and 3.
Stewards
3.5	Stewards shall be selected or elected by the Union from employees at each building location in accordance with its Bylaws and Constitution. There shall be a maximum of seven (7) stewards in each location.
Employees in the following classifications or assignments cannot serve as stewards: Bookkeeper
Lead Store Clerk
Back Door Receiving Clerk
In the event two (2) stewards are from the same department, only one (1) can be on Union business at any time both are working. The Union will not have more than one (1) steward per department, other than in Grocery and Service where there will be a maximum of one (1) steward per shift. The Union will maintain a minimum of one (1) steward per shift.
If two (2) stewards from the same department have jurisdictional coverage for more than one (1) department, only one (1) can be out of the department on Union business at any one (1) time. If stewards come in to handle Union business on their own time, the Company shall have no responsibility or liability to pay for said time.
All stewards will be given one (1) paid personal holiday per year, which shall be
9
paid at the fringe day rate, to be used in conjunction with Union authorized steward training conferences. This day will be granted upon thirty (30) days written notification to the Labor Relations Department by the Local Union.
ARTICLE 4:	MANAGEMENT CLAUSE
4.1	The management of the business in all its phases and details shall remain vested in the Employer, except as specifically relinquished herein. The rights of the Employer, the Union, and the employees shall be respected and the provisions of the Agreement for the orderly settlement of all questions regarding such rights shall be observed.
ARTICLE 5:	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
5.1	It is the intent of the grievance procedure that, should any difference, disputes, or complaints arise over the interpretation or application of this Agreement that cannot be resolved between the employee and his immediate supervisor, there shall be an earnest effort on the part of the parties to settle such with reasonable promptness through the following steps.
STEP I: By a conference to be held between the aggrieved employee, his steward and the management of the Employer, or the Business Representative and the management of-the Employer. The conference will be held and management's response will be given promptly.
The Step I grievance must be initiated by the aggrieved employee and his steward or the Business Representative with dated, written notification identifying the specific nature of the grievance filed with the Store Director’s office.
STEP 11: If the grievance is not resolved in Step I, the Union may process the grievance to Step II of the grievance procedure. The Step II grievance must be initiated by the Union Business Representative with a written grievance signed by the Business Representative and identifying the specific nature of the grievance and submitted to the Store Director's office and a copy forwarded to the Labor Relations Department. The Step II grievance will be met on by the Union Business Representative and the Grievance Committee of the Employer. The parties will make every reasonable effort to meet and respond to Step II grievances promptly.
If the grievance is not resolved at Step I the Union may process the grievance to Step II only by requesting such meeting in the manner provided within thirty (30) days of the response to the Step I conference.
Any grievance matter resolved by the parties at Step I or Step II of the grievance procedure shall be considered non-precedent setting and without prejudice to the rights of either party in any further grievance that may arise.
STEP III: If the grievance is not resolved in Step II, either party may, within ninety (90) calendar days from the Step II grievance conference, in writing, request arbitration and the other party shall be obliged to proceed with the grievance in the manner provided:
Grievance Adjustment Board
When arbitration has been requested, the parties may agree to present the grievance to the Grievance Adjustment Board. In order to present a grievance to the Grievance Adjustment Board, both parties must agree to utilize this process. The Grievance Adjustment Board shall consist of the Vice-President of Labor Relations of the Employer or his designee and an Executive Officer of the Local Union or his
10
IWW 200$
designee and a neutral third party selected by the Employer and the Union. The neutral third party shall be selected by mutual Agreement of the parties.
Any costs incurred by the third party shaft be shared equally by the parties. The parties may submit evidence, oral arguments, and witnesses at the Grievance Adjustment Hearing. Each member of the Grievance Adjustment Board shall have one (I) vote and upon majority vote the decision of the Grievance Adjustment Board shall be binding. This decision will be deemed to satisfy either parties’ request to arbitrate the issue, and shall be considered final and binding.
If the Union determines that particular standards of work performance instituted by the Employer are resulting in unfair disciplinary action against members, the parties will immediately attempt to resolve such issue by submission to the Grievance Adjustment Board for an advisory opinion.
Arbitration
When arbitration has been requested and if either of the parties refuse to submit the grievance to the Grievance Adjustment Board, an Arbitrator will be selected from a panel of Arbitrators on a rotating basis. The panel of Arbitrators will be selected by the parties and will be at least five (5) Arbitrators who have been mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall select the Arbitrator from a panel of names obtained from the American Arbitration Association in the manner prescribed by the rules of the Association.
5.2	The authority of the Arbitrator and the Grievance Adjustment Board shall be limited to the consideration of unresolved grievances timely raised under this Agreement. They alone shall have the authority to interpret the meaning of this Agreement but shall not have the authority to modify, add to, or detract from this Agreement. With respect to discipline or discharge grievances, the Arbitrator or the Adjustment Board alone shall determine if the discipline or discharge was for just cause, and shall review the penalty imposed. They shall have the sole authority to order back pay in whole or in part. The decision shall be final and binding upon both parties and is exclusively and expressly reserved for the parties to this Agreement.
5.3	Grievances must be taken up promptly and no grievance shall be considered or discussed which is presented later than ten (10) days after the events took place that are the basis of the grievance, with the exception of wage claims which are limited to sixty (60) days.
Wage claims shall be defined as, and limited to, the following:
A.	Overdue progression step increases.
B.	Incorrect wage rates.
C.	Computer error.
D.	Errors in the mathematical calculation of wage or wage rates or failure to pay for holidays, sick pay or vacation.
E.	Improper recall of laid off employees.
5.4	The responsibility of the cost of the Arbitrator's fees shall be paid by the party against whom the judgment is rendered by the Arbitrator. It shall be the responsibility of the Arbitrator to declare which party is deemed to have lost and, therefore, is responsible for such costs. If the Arbitrator is unable to make such a determination, the cost will be shared equally by the parties.
♦
11
5.5	The Local Union shall have the right to determine whether or not the employee’s grievance is qualified to be submitted to Arbitration. This may include either the Grievance Adjustment Board or Arbitration.
5.6	A steward shall notify his immediate supervisor or supervisor-in-charge in the immediate supervisor's absence, when the steward is leaving his work station for Union business.
The Employer reserves the right to limit the time and number of grievance discussions between the grievant and his steward which are held during the working time of either employee, so long as reasonable periods are permitted for the discussion and writing of the grievance, within the grievance time limits.
Every reasonable effort shall be made by the Employer to provide an opportunity for confidential discussions between the grievant and the steward.
5.7	Employees are entitled to steward representation during a disciplinary interview of record or a corrective action that is recorded which could subsequently be used as a basis for future discipline. The steward will be invited to attend at the employee's request. The employee affected will be given a copy of that record.
5.8	The Employer shall have the right to discipline, demote or discharge employees for just cause. Any questions surrounding discipline, demotion or discharge may be processed by the Union through the grievance procedure. Grievances concerning discharges shall proceed immediately to Step II of the grievance procedure.
The Employer may disqualify an employee from the award of a job, transfer or promotional opportunity if the Employer demonstrates substantial reasons why such employee should be disqualified. Employees disqualified will be notified of such action.
5.9	Every reasonable effort shall be made to schedule and hold grievance meetings during the scheduled working time of the aggrieved employee and the aggrieved employee’s steward when their schedules coincide.
5.10	Discussions of grievances which are not processed according to the procedures described in this Article are not required of the Company or the Union. No grievances will be considered at any step, unless it is processed within the respective time limits and according to the procedures set forth in the Agreement.
However, nothing in this article shall prevent the parties mutually agreeing to extend the time limits imposed.
5.11	The Union shall be the sole representative of the interests of employees or groups of employees within the bargaining unit. Only the Union, through its properly designated representatives, shall have the right under arbitration procedures or in any judicial or adjudicatory forum to assert and process against the Employer a claimed violation of the Agreement.
5.12	The Employer, including all supervisors, shall grant to any accredited Union Representative, who is an employee of the Local, access to the units for the purpose of administering the terms of the Agreement. Such Union Representatives shall sign in and out on appropriate sign-in sheets. There will not be lengthy discussions with employees which might interfere with the Employer’s business.

ARTICLE 6:	PEACEFUL RELATIONS
6.1	In view of the arbitration provision, the grievance procedure, and other provisions of the Agreement, the Union, its agents and members agree that individually and/or collectively, they will not engage in any strike, any interference with or interruptions of the business, picketing, handbilling, or public announcements adverse to the Employer for the duration of this Agreement. Persons who authorize or engage in such action shall be subject to immediate discharge. The Employer will not engage in any lockout for the duration of the Agreement.
6.2	In no event will the Union authorize its agents or members individually and/or collectively, to engage in any strike directly or in sympathy with any other employees, withholding of services in whole or in part, in connection with any secondary picketing or handbilling at any Meijer location.
6.3	The Union, on behalf of itself, its agents and members, agrees that during the duration of this Agreement no sympathy strike shall be caused or sanctioned and that no member shall refuse to cross any picket line at any of the Employer’s properties or facilities. Persons who authorize or engage in such action shall be subject to immediate discharge.
ARTICLE 7:	SENIORITY
7.1	A complete seniority list by departments for both full-time and part-time employees shall be compiled and furnished to the Union. Regular employees will be on probation for the first thirteen (13) weeks of active employment. Probationary employees shall be covered by all provisions of this Agreement except such employees may be terminated by the Company, for any reason, and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
7.2	Seniority shall mean the length of continuous service with the Employer and upon completion of the probationary period be dated from the first day actually worked and shall be on a department basis unless specifically provided otherwise herein. Seniority shall be applied according to the terms of the Agreement. The Employer may continue to designate and create new or different departments as the situation warrants. However, the Employer will meet and discuss with the Union any conflicts that arise concerning employee’s seniority when new departments are designated or created.
7.3	Seniority shall be of two (2) types, full-time and part-time. Full-time seniority shall be convertible to part-time. Full-time seniority shall not accumulate during periods of part-time jobs and part-time seniority shall not be convertible to full-time seniority if a part-time employee becomes full-time. Part-time seniority shall not be lost by transfer to full-time work. In no case wiii part-time employees accumulate seniority over full-time employees.
If two employees have the same full-time seniority dates, part-time seniority will determine who is more senior.
When two (2) or more employees have the same part-time seniority date, the most senior employee(s) will be determined by the lowest last four (4) digits of their social security number.
Those employees who have a phantom full-time seniority date as of November 29, 1987, will maintain that date unless they change from full-time to part-time status.
7.4	A regular employee’s seniority shall be broken if he quits, if he is discharged for cause, if he faits to report for work for three (3) consecutive work days without

13
notifying the Employer, or if an employee is laid off continuously for twelve (12) months. Part-time employees with less than one (1) year of seniority who are laid off to the street for a period of six (6) weeks or less may be returned to work without a break in seniority.
A regular employee's seniority shall be considered broken if he fails to report for work while on layoff within seven (7) calendar days after being notified to report unless extended by mutual agreement.
Full-Time Job Openings
7.5	A. 1. Where there are open jobs for permanent full-time vacancies, the Company will survey employees in line of seniority within the department, classification and unit where the opening exists. The most senior employee indicating a desire for the job in that department, classification and unit will receive the job, provided such employee is fully available for full-time work. The foregoing shall not apply to change in assignments within a job classification.
Where a permanent full-time opening exists in a classification that contains no employees in that classification within the department and unit, the employees in the next lowest classification within the department and unit will be surveyed in line of seniority for the opening.
2.	If the full-time opening is not filled by the above procedure, the Company will survey in line of seniority by classification within the expanded department and unit where the opening exists. The most senior employee indicating a desire for the job in that expanded department by classification and unit will receive the job, provided such employee is fully available for full-time work.
B.	If the full-time opening is not filled by the above procedure, the most senior full-time employee in that department and classification within the Company who has a valid transfer request on file in the Company's Labor Relations Department will receive the job.
Transfer requests must be renewed yearly and once a transfer is granted, all other requests that employee has on file will be voided.
C.	Any employee awarded the job shall be given a ninety (90) day break-in period to familiarize himself with the job duties by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level. If, for justifiable reasons, the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level during this break-in period, the employee may be returned to his original job.
During the ninety (90) day break-in period, the Employer may fill, on a temporary basis, the vacancy created by the employee who bid.
D.	The Employer may fill in accordance with Articles 7.5 and 7.6 full-time openings which will be based on structuring full-time shifts consisting of five (5) second and/or third shift schedules. It is further understood that these full-time openings will include Friday, Saturday and Sunday work in most cases. Employees will be informed of the nature of the full-time opening when the job is filled.
It is further understood that employees awarded such jobs will remain on such shift assignment until an alternate shift is open on a full week and permanent basis. In the event of such an opening, the opening will be offered in line of seniority.

Hatai 2003
E.	When a part-time employee averages more than thirty-six (36) hours per week for two (2) consecutive individual accounting quarters in one (1) department, classification and in any single unit, he shall be awarded full-time status. Hours worked in replacement of an employee on Workers’ Compensation or sickness, accident, or other approved leave, will not be considered in computing the thirty-six (36) hour average. Hours credited are those hours actually worked. It is further understood that employees awarded such jobs must be fully available and will remain on such shift assignment as their seniority allows until an alternate shift is open on a full week and permanent basis. In the event of such an opening, the opening will be offered in line of seniority.
When a full-time employee averages less than thirty-six (36) hours per week for two (2) consecutive individual accounting quarters, he may be reclassified to part-time status. Hours credited are those hours actually worked. Vacation and Personal Paid Days off will be considered as hours worked for the computation of the thirty-six (36) hour average. Approved leave weeks will not be considered in computing the thirty-six (36) hour average.
E Employees with one (1) or more years of full-time seniority may indicate their interest in transferring to any full-time position in another store, by submitting and having a valid transfer request on file in the Company’s Labor Relations Department.
Employees with one (1) or more years of full-time seniority may indicate their interest in transferring to any full-time position within their store, by submitting and having a valid transfer request on file with the Store Director.
The Employer will review such requests and may offer such transfers before the application of 7.5A and 7.5B.
7.6	When a new unit is opened, the Company will honor full-time transfer requests on file, on or before the date selected for staffing decisions, for all full-time openings in accordance with Articles 7.5B and 5.8.
In addition, the Company will post a notice a minimum of 60 days before grand opening to determine which part-time employees wish to be considered for transfer to the new unit. A list of such part-time employees will be maintained in the Labor Relations Department. Those employees selected for transfer will be notified when the final staffing decisions are made.
7.7	Section 1. Layoff Management may layoff employees for lack of work or other reasons that require a reduction of the work force. The reason for the reduction of the work force and the number of employees to be laid off is to be determined solely by management. Layoff shall be made in inverse order of seniority at each unit by department and classification, and shall be effective the first work week following notification.
A.	Full-time employees
When a full-time employee with more than one (1) year of full-time seniority is notified of a layoff of two (2) weeks or more, the full-time employee may exercise layoff options within the work week following notification.

1.	Accept a layoff to the street.
2.	Bump the least senior person in his expanded department, classification and unit.
15

4.	Accept reclassification to part-time in his department, classification and unit.
5.	Bump to the unit where the least senior employee in the same department and classification is located out of the four (4) closest retail units from their home unit. However, the employee may choose to bump to any of these four (4) units where there is an employee with less than one (1) year of seniority. This will be considered a permanent transfer.
Full-time employees with less than one (1) year of full-time seniority will be reclassified to part-time status, and based on their seniority, will be given part-time layoff options as listed in section 7.7B.
B.	Part-time Employees
When a part-time employee with more than one (1) year of seniority is notified of a layoff of two (2) weeks or more, the part-time employee may exercise layoff options within the work week following notification.
Part-time employees with more than one (1) year of seniority may:
1.	Accept a layoff to the street.
2.	Bump the least senior person in his expanded department, classification and unit.
3.	Bump the least senior person in the next lower classification in his department (hourly rate commensurate with seniority).

2.	Hardlines
3.	Fashion area
4.	Bakery, Ice Cream, Cafeteria

6.	One Hour Photo, Pharmacy, Replenishment, and all other departments will be treated as individual departments.
Section 2. Recall Once the decision is made to take a layoff to the street, bump an expanded department, or bump the next lower classification, the employee must await recall to the employee’s original classification, department and unit. The original classification, department, and unit is defined as that job the employee held when first affected by layoff. Employees with more than one (1) year of seniority will have recall rights back to the job the employee held when first affected by layoff for a period of twelve (12) months. If the employee is not recalled within this time period, he will be permanently reclassified in his current position or his seniority shall be broken if he has been laid off to the street for twelve (12) months. Employees will be recalled in line of seniority, by department, classification and unit. Employees with less than one (1) year seniority shall have no recall rights.
Employees recalled, as provided in this section, will be required to report to work within the time limits specified in Article 7.4 unless extended by agreement between the employee and the Employer.
Section 3. Any cost incurred in changing units as provided for in this section of the Agreement shall be at the employee's expense.
16
Hatai 2003
7.8	An employee transferred from one (1) department in the bargaining unit to another shall retain past seniority and continue to accumulate seniority in the new department.
Promotional Opportunities
7.9	Employees with twelve (12) months or more seniority may indicate their interest in possible permanent part-time openings in the Food Clerk and Cashier classifications.
Specialty Clerks with twelve (12) months or more seniority in the Service Meat area will be given first consideration for permanent part-time openings in the Food Clerk classification in the Meat department.
Employees who wish to be considered for possible openings in these classifications shall submit written notice of such interest each calendar year to the Store Director. The Store Director will maintain a list in each unit. The Company will not fill any position in the above mentioned classifications, until it has reviewed the file of interested employees from the unit and has offered the opening to the most senior of such employees who meet the qualifications for the opening. In order to qualify for such openings, the employee must not have been disqualified from consideration by reason of Article 5.8 and it is understood that an employee selected for such openings will assume the new job at the beginning rate of the classification. During the first thirty (30) days after the employee has been transferred to an open job under this section, management may assign the employee a schedule not in compliance with the seniority scheduling provisions of this Agreement, and neither the employee nor the other employees in the department and classification shall be able to make a claim on the basis of those hours, provided the other employees have been scheduled at least as many hours as the promoted employee. If for justifiable reason the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level during this ninety (90) day period, the employee may be returned to his original job. The Company’s effort to give consideration for movement to these higher rated jobs to current employees shall be consistent with the efficient operation of the Company and due consideration for the need for qualified employees in all areas.
In the event an employee is transferred to an open job under the provisions of this section, the employee will continue to be eligible for health and welfare benefits to which the employee was entitled on the date of transfer until the first day of the calendar month following completion of ninety (90) days in the new classification, at which time the employee will be eligible for health and welfare benefits applicable to the employee’s status in the new classification.
ARTICLE 8: WAGES AND HOURS
8.1	The job classification and rates of pay for employees are as shown in the wage schedules attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement. The Employer is to establish classifications as needed, and is to classify employees. Although the Employer may change job classifications and job content, the rates applicable to new or materially changed classifications shall be subject to negotiations between the parties hereto. Special aptitude or competitive situations may be recognized by the Employer in hiring and/or advancing employees at rates faster than as shown in the wage schedules, however, an employee’s rate will not exceed the top rate negotiated for the employee’s classification.

17
8.2	Employees shall perform any work which a Manager may direct with the understanding that when an employee is assigned a job with a lesser rate, he will be entitled to his regular rate of pay unless he has been assigned to a lower rated job and desires to retain such job rather than accept layoff. If an employee is assigned to a higher rated job for a period of fifteen (15) minutes or more, he will receive a premium in addition to his regular hourly rate of twenty-five cents (25£) for each hour worked in that higher classification that day.
8.3	In all payroll computations, the payroll week shall be a seven (7) day period beginning on Saturday midnight and ending on the following Saturday at midnight. However, a scheduled work week may overlap payroll weeks. The payroll week will be calculated separately from the scheduled work week.
8.4	All work schedules, for Monday through the following Sunday, will be posted on or before Friday at 2:00 p.m. prior to the scheduled work week and remain posted for the balance of that week. The posted schedule will be written with the employees -. listed in descending order of seniority.
Work Schedules
8.5	Scheduling
A.	Weekly Guarantees
1.	The Employer agrees to offer at least eighty percent (80%) of the most senior full-time employees in each department and classification a minimum of forty (40) hours per scheduled work week. The guarantee of this provision excludes holiday weeks and layoffs. In cases where the application of this percentage results in a fraction, such fraction will not apply.
The forty (40) hour week will be worked in five (5) days of eight (8) hour shifts or four (4) days of ten (10) hour shifts. In holiday weeks employees will be scheduled four (4) days of eight (8) hour shifts or three (3) days of ten (10) hour shifts. In the event the Employer schedules employees ten (10) hour work days, these schedules will be offered to volunteers in line of seniority by department, classification, and job assignment grouping.
Full-time employees shall be scheduled to have two (2) days off in any scheduled work week of five (5) days of eight (8) hour shifts or three (3) days off in any scheduled work week of four (4) days of ten (10) hour shifts unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Employer and the employee. Such days off shall not necessarily be consecutive.
2.	Part-time employees who are scheduled and work Sunday, Friday and Saturday will be guaranteed twenty-four (24) hours per week. It is understood that part-time employees are scheduled separately from full-time employees and may be scheduled eight (8) or ten (10) hour shifts without claim from full-time. Part-time employees who do not work Sunday, Friday and Saturday hours will have a basic work week of twelve (12) hours.
3.	All full-time and part-time employees who are instructed to report for work shall be guaranteed four (4) hours work or pay at their normal rate, including holidays.
This clause shall not apply when the Employer schedules employees for meetings, but employees will be paid for time spent in meetings. The Employer may assign work available even though it is outside of the employee’s regular classification.
18
Ratal 2003
4.	It is understood that the guarantees of these provisions may include Friday, Saturday and Sunday work and do not apply in cases of lateness, injury, illness, or other personal reasons of the employee and in circumstances beyond the control of the Employer, such as fire, flood, civil disturbance, power and equipment failure, or acts of God. If the employee is notified not to report before he leaves home, the Company shall not be required to pay call in pay. Same applies if the Company attempts to notify the employee by the last phone number or address on the Company records and it is incorrect due to a change not recorded by the employee.
B.	Construction of the Work Schedule
In constructing a weekly work schedule, the Employer will determine first the needs of the department based on the requirements of the business. Once that determination is made, the following procedure will be utilized:
1.	For full-time employees the Employer will recognize seniority for the earliest start time for a shift, the amount of hours and regular days off, To accomplish this the Employer will offer and/or assign up to eight (8) hour shifts to full-time employees in line of seniority recognizing the regular days off and desirability of earliest start times on a daily basis for these full-time shifts. As provided in 8.5A this guarantee will apply in line of seniority.
2.	When scheduling part-time employees the Employer’s first obligation is to fulfill the weekly guarantees outlined in 8.5A.
Part-time employees shall be scheduled in line of seniority for the largest block of hours on a scheduled day, up to twenty-eight (28) hours per week within department, classification and job assignment grouping, such that senior part-time employees’ weekly scheduled hours shall exceed or equal the weekly scheduled hours of junior part-time employees. An employee’s scheduling limitations may affect the Company’s ability to give that employee equal or more hours than less senior employees.
In constructing the schedule, if there are shifts with the same number of consecutive hours, but one (1) starting time is earlier in that work day, the senior part-time employee scheduled to work that day will be offered the earliest start time.
If the application of the scheduling language results in twenty-eight (28) hours or more on the posted schedule, the Employer has no further obligation to schedule more hours for that employee. However, this will not prevent the Employer from requiring more than twenty-eight (28) huuis from any employee if business conditions so warrant.
C.	Additional Hours
If additional hours which are not on a posted schedule become necessary, these additional hours will be offered in line of seniority within department, classification, (and job assignment grouping in the case of Cash Office), first to available full-time employees who are offered less than forty (40) hours. After this obligation, in line of seniority within department, classification, (and job assignment grouping in the case of Cash Office), to part-time employees not scheduled to work that day who are available for such work.
To be eligible for such additional hours, part-time employees must certify in writing their availability for additional hours on a daily basis and submit their written
19
availability for additional hours to their Manager’s office by 2:00 p.m. on Saturday. It is understood that such additional hours must consist of at least the minimum call-in guarantee in order to be offered to employees not scheduled to work that day. If the additional work is less than the call-in guarantee, it will be offered in line of seniority and required in inverse order of seniority within department, classification, (and job assignment grouping in case of Cash Office), to employees at work who are available and able to do the work at straight time. When additional hours are assigned to employees at work, the employees so assigned will be given reasonable advance notice. In no case will the Employer be obligated to offer additional hours to an employee which would cause that employee to have daily or weekly overtime as defined in Article 8.10A or a sixth or seventh day as defined in Article 8.1 OB.
D.	Any full-time employee not scheduled forty (40) hours per week may claim hours from part-time employees within the same department and classification such that the claim does not reduce the part-time employee below his weekly or daily guarantee of hours, although the full-time employee may claim a whole daily shift or the total weekly schedule reducing the part-time employee to zero (0) hours for the day or week. No claiming of hours will be allowed that could cause daily or weekly overtime as defined in Article 8.1 OA or a sixth or seventh day as defined in Article 8.1 OB.
E.	Sick Calls
If the Employer chooses to replace sick calls, he will accomplish this by either extending shifts or calling employees in early for their shift or replace the sick call in its entirety by offering it in line of seniority within department, classification and job assignment grouping, first to available full-time employees who are offered less than forty (40) hours. After this obligation, in line of seniority within department, classification and job assignment grouping, to part-time employees who are fully available for all hours during the work week not scheduled to work that day. Those part-time employees must certify, in writing, their availability for these sick call hours on a daily basis and submit their written availability for these sick call hours to their Manager by 2:00 p.m. on Saturday.
E Schedule Adjustments
In the event the work schedule is not believed to be in conformance with an employee’s seniority and the other provisions of this Article, the employee shall, have until Saturday 2:00 p.m. to bring the matter to the Department Manager’s attention so that adjustments can be made if needed. In the event the employee fails to bring the matter to the Department Manager’s attention by Saturday 2:00 p.m., the schedule will be deemed acceptable and not subject to the grievance procedure. It is understood that a junior employee cannot seek adjustment of their schedule based on the schedule of a senior employee. It is also understood that no schedule adjustment will be allowed that affects the minimum guarantee on a daily or weekly basis, except as provided in Article 8.5D.
Employees are expected to inform themselves of the schedule and are responsible to work their scheduled hours.
There will be no trading of scheduled hours among employees without the expressed advance approval of the Department Manager.
G.	Job Assignments
1.	The Employer may assign employees to or remove employees from job
20

assignment groupings. Employees assigned to these job assignments will be placed in a separate group for scheduling purposes as required by the operation of the business. Employees will be scheduled according to the operational requirements of the job assignment. Such employees will not be displaced from their schedule so long as they remain on this assignment.
2.	In the following job assignment groupings, employees will not be scheduled more total hours than their seniority will allow:
Dairy/Frozen Clerks
Service Desk
Cash Office
U-Scan Operators
Service Coordinators
Floor Machine Operators
In the Cash Office job assignment grouping, an employee may be scheduled more total hours if all of the hours are scheduled in the Cash Office.
3.	In the following job assignment groupings, employees may be scheduled more total hours than their seniority will allow:
Lead Store Clerks
Head Dairy/Frozen Clerks
Order Writers
Paperwork Processors
Back Door Receiving Clerks
Salvage Clerks
Trailer Unloader
In-Store Trainers
Layaway Clerks
Employees not classified as Head Dairy/Frozen Clerks or Lead Store Clerks who are assigned as such will be upgraded for the time spent worked in that job assignment.
Employees placed in the Head Dairy/Frozen Clerk or Lead Store Clerk classification prior to April 25, 1999 will remain in such classification unless disqualified under 5.8.
4.	Job assignments may be added, deleted, or modified.
H.	Overnight Crews
All full-time employees assigned to overnight crews will remain on such shift assignment until the Employer determines that a permanent full-time opening exists on days or evenings.
In the event there are temporary vacancies in the department on first or second shift that are known in advance and will exist for a two (2) week period or more, the vacancy, if filled, will be offered in line of seniority to employees who regularly work exclusively on third shift and have previously designated their interest, in writing, for these vacancies.
When the Employer elects to schedule full-time employees third shift hours for an entire work week, they may be assigned Sunday hours as part of their normal work week at their regular hourly rate, provided their weekly schedule contains two (2) consecutive days off. Such weekly work schedules will be
21
offered in line of seniority and assigned by inverse seniority within department and classification.
8.6	In the event the Employer schedules full-time employees or part-time employees ten (10) hour days, these schedules will be offered to volunteers in line of seniority by status, department, classification and job assignment grouping.
8.7	There shall be no mandatory split shift schedules.
Holidays
8.8	Any work performed on a holiday shall be paid for at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee’s regular hourly rate.
The Employer shall poll employees by department, classification and job assignment grouping three (3) times per year on February 1, June 1, and October 1, to determine their availability for holiday hours of work.
Holiday hours of work will be assigned in line of seniority by department, classification and job assignment grouping, to those employees who signed the holiday poll sheet. The assigning of such hours shall be consistent with the provisions of Article 8.5.
It is understood that the scheduling of holiday hours shall be separate for full-time and part-time employees.
If after exhausting the poll sheet, hours remain, the balance of the hours will be assigned by inverse seniority, by department, classification and job assignment grouping, to employees who have not signed the poll.
8.9	Full-time employees scheduled to work on a holiday will be scheduled to work a normal holiday work week in addition to the holiday hours.
Overtime
8.10
A.	All employees are to receive one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular hourly rate for hours actually worked over forty (40) hours in any one (1) week or over eight (8) hours in any one (1) day but not both.
Employees who are scheduled to work ten (10) hour days as part of their basic work week will receive the daily overtime rate for hours worked over ten (10) hours daily and forty (40) hours weekly.
There is to be no pyramiding of overtime.
In any week in which a paid holiday falls, any full-time employee who is manda-torily assigned to work a fifth day in addition to the holiday (or fourth day in the case of a ten (10) hour employee) will be paid time and one-half (1-1/2) his regular hourly rate for hours worked on this day unless the employee volunteers for such work.
For purposes of computing overtime, a work day shall be defined as the consecutive hours worked commencing with the beginning of the employee's scheduled work day. Unpaid lunch breaks shall not be considered to break the consecutive hours and a break between shifts of less than five (5) hours shall not constitute a break in consecutive hours.
When overtime work is available, the Employer will offer such work in line of seniority in the department by classification and job assignment grouping (in the
22
taal 2003
case of Cash Office) to employees at work. In the event senior employees do not want the overtime work, the Company will require employees at work, using inverse order of seniority by classification, to remain and work. The Employer will make every reasonable effort to give advance notification of such overtime work. If overtime is offered to off duty employees, it will be offered by classification to the most senior employee who is available to work in that department. It is understood to be eligible for overtime work, the employee must be capable of performing the work.
B.	Any full-time employee who is mandatorily assigned to work six (6) consecutive days within any work week will be paid time and one-half (1-1/2) his regular hourly rate for hours worked on the sixth consecutive day. Any full-time or part-time employee who is mandatorily assigned to work seven (7) consecutive days within any work week shall be paid double his regular hourly rate for hours worked on the seventh consecutive day.
C.	Under no circumstances may an employee through any privileges set forth in this entire Agreement force the existence of any time and one-half (1-1/2) or double time hours.
Rest Periods
8.11	Employees who work six and one-half (6-1/2) hours or more per day shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period during the first half of the working hours and a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period during the second half of the working hours of each day. Employees who work between four (4) and six and one-half (6-1/2) hours are eligible for one (1) fifteen (15) minute paid rest period. No employee will be required to work more than five (5) consecutive hours without being offered an unpaid lunch period of at least thirty (30) minutes.
Breaks and lunches will be scheduled as near as possible to the middle of each half shift and shift.
Employees who work overtime shall be entitled to one (1) additional ten (10) minute paid break after working nine (9) consecutive hours if the employee works more than nine (9) consecutive hours. No rest period shall be scheduled until the employee has worked at least one (1) hour unless agreed otherwise by the employee.
8.12	Any unit employee requested by the Employer to work temporarily for Employer convenience in another unit beyond a fifteen (15) mile radius from his home unit shall be paid the current corporate mileage rate per mile (if he drives a motor vehicle) from either his home unit or his home, whichever is closer to the unit in question, for all extra miles over his regular trip. The same amount for mileage shall he paid to an employee whu uses his vehicle for assigned Company business. When new employees are being trained for new store openings, no mileage compensation will be paid if the training assignment is within a fifty (50) mile radius of the new store location.
8.13	The intention of the parties as expressed in this Agreement is to seek to continue full-time employment in those areas where the business conditions so warrant and to increase the number of full-time positions in the areas where the efficient operation of business are best served.
8.14	Overpayments to employees or monies owed to the Employer by the employee will be repaid by the employee based on a reasonable schedule of repayment by payroll deduction.

ARTICLE 9: PAID TIME OFF BENEFITS
9.1	Eligibility and Benefit Calculations
A.	The Benefits described in this Article 9 have been modified as of September 14, 2003. For employees hired prior to September 14, 2003, benefit improvements to Bereavement Leave (9.5) and Jury Duty (9.6) will take immediate effect. However, the eligibility requirements for all Benefits described in this Article will change for all employees hired prior to September 14,2003, on the employee’s anniversary date commencing on or after January 1, 2004, and will be subsequently adjusted on the employee’s anniversary date commencing on or after January 1, 2005, pursuant to the Paid Time Off “fringe day hours average" requirement described in Section 9.7A. Employees hired on and after September 14, 2003, will have the eligibility provisions applied during their first year of service and in subsequent years as defined in Section 9.7B.
B.	For the purpose of calculating benefits that are based on an employee’s fringe day amount, this is calculated by taking the employee’s total Active Service Hours (ASHs) during the previous anniversary year, divided by fifty-two (52) weeks, and then divided by five (5) days. There is no maximum applied to this calculation. This equals the fringe day hours average. The fringe day amount is equal to the fringe day hours average times the employee’s rate of pay in effect when the benefit is payable. An Active Service Hour (ASH) is any hour that the employee is paid for active work, Holiday pay, Paid Vacation, Personal Paid Days, Bereavement Leave pay, or Jury Duty pay.
For the purpose of using the fringe day amount for benefits paid during the first year of employment, an employee's fringe day amount will be calculated after the completion of thirteen (13) weeks of service, based on total ASHs at that time, divided by thirteen (13) weeks of employment, divided by five (5) days.

An employee who is absent all or part of his scheduled day before or his scheduled day after the holiday will not receive holiday pay unless the absence is excused in advance in writing or is caused by proven illness. However, if absent such day before or day after the holiday due to any reason other than paid vacation as provided in Section 9.4, an employee must actually work at least one (1) day in the week in which the holiday falls in order to receive holiday pay.

YEARS OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE	PAID VACATION
1	year but less than 3 years	1 week
3 years but less than 8 years	2 weeks
8 years but less than 15 years	3 weeks
15 years but less than 18 years	4 weeks
18 years or more	5 weeks
B.	All paid vacation is available for use on a weekly basis. However, an employee may use up to two (2) weeks of this vacation as ten (10) single vacation days.
This provision is not intended to expand the number of days that an employee may be away from work. Employees who use paid vacation to be away from work for a week will be paid for at least one full week (5 days) of vacation, provided they have a week (5 days) or more of vacation available for use.
When using vacation time in single day increments, at least one day must actually be worked during the week in which a vacation day(s) is granted. This provision is not intended to allow employees to combine single vacation days and non-paid time off in order to increase the number of full weeks off per year.
C.	An employee’s seniority anniversary date for all purposes of vacation eligibility shall be the day and month of the employee’s seniority date as established in the
34
RMJ2000
seniority provisions of this Agreement, unless his seniority anniversary date for purposes of vacation eligibility was otherwise set by a change from part-time to full-time or full-time to part-time under the practices in existence prior to August 9, 1969.
D.	Weekly or daily vacation pay will be determined on the basis of the employee’s total ASHs paid during the previous vacation anniversary year as defined in subsection 9.1 B.
1.	Weekly vacation hours and pay is computed by taking the employee’s total hours paid as defined above and dividing by 52 (weeks) times the employee’s base rate of pay in effect when the vacation is paid.
2.	Daily vacation hours and pay is computed by taking the weekly vacation hours and pay as computed in subsection 9.4D1 above, and dividing by 5 (days).
E.	Vacation pay for a vacation week(s) taken shall be paid in advance if requested in writing by the employee, so that the employee may have the money at the beginning of his vacation. Requests must be made in writing three (3) weeks in advance of the beginning of the vacation. Advanced vacation pay is not available for vacation days.
E All vacations will be granted at the discretion of the Employer as business operations permit. In order to facilitate the granting of vacations, a blank vacation schedule shall be posted January 1 of each year and remain posted until March 1 for all employees to designate vacation week(s) desired. During the months of June, July and August a minimum of one (1) week (or 5 days) of vacation will be granted to employees who are eligible and desire vacation during this time period, if business operations permit. Consideration will be given to the wishes of the employees according to their seniority, within Department, Classification, (and work group in the case of the Distribution Centers) provided that such wishes can be carried out in accordance with the efficient operations of the business. The remaining weeks (or days) of vacation available during the June, July, August period will be distributed to the more senior employees based on requests received on the blank vacation schedule.
It is understood that the posting of a vacation schedule and the granting of requested vacation shall be separate for full-time and part-time employees.
Once an employee's request for vacation is approved and such approval is reflected on that department’s vacation schedule after the posting period, the employee’s vacation will not be changed by management and no other employee may exercise seniority rights to displace the employee from the scheduled vacation.
It is understood that employees may choose not to indicate desire for vacation week(s) or days on the posted schedule. However, those employees’ vacation requests will be granted solely at the discretion of management, so long as the vacation week(s)/days available as of the last seniority anniversary date will be granted during the current vacation anniversary year.
G.	All vacations are to be taken in the year following qualification. A vacation may not be carried over and taken advantage of during any following year, nor can any be taken prior to being eligible. However, if an employee is unable to schedule available vacation time before his next seniority anniversary date because of business conditions or unusual circumstances beyond the control of

35
the employee and/or the Employer, and is subject to lose unused vacation, up to one week of unused vacation may be paid without taking the corresponding time off from work.
H.	Termination of service because of misconduct involving violations of Company rules, policies, procedures or guidelines or other conduct which is detrimental to or which demonstrates a disregard for customers, employees or Company interests results in forfeiture of all vacation privileges; vacation pay in such cases shall not be granted.
Unused vacation pay (that became available on the last seniority anniversary date) of any employee voluntarily leaving the Employer’s service or terminated for reasons other than misconduct (as described in this subsection 9.4H above), death, or retirement (if the employee has at least one (1) year of service), will be paid after termination only when a minimum of two (2) weeks advance written notice is given to the Employer and the employee completes the remainder of his scheduled shifts prior to the end of his employment.
The unused vacation pay of any employee whose service has been terminated by death is to be paid to the employee’s beneficiary as shown in the employee's group life insurance policy (or, if the employee is not insured, it is to be paid to his spouse or to his estate).
The unused vacation pay of any employee whose service has been terminated by retirement is to be paid at retirement.
I.	Vacations normally will not be granted during the holiday weeks due to business demands.
J.	Employees may not receive pay in lieu of vacation, except as provided by subsection 9.4G above. Vacations earned must be taken unless otherwise agreed to due to unusual circumstances.
K.	If a holiday as recognized by the Agreement occurs during a week in which the employee is using a vacation week, holiday pay, in addition to vacation pay, will be given rather than additional vacation time.
