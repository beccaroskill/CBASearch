ARTICLE 7
UNION DEDUCTION FROM WAGES
Dues Deductions
7.01 The Company shall make collection of Union dues, agency fees and initiation fees through payroll deductions upon receipt of a properly executed authorization signed by the employee for whom the deductions are to be made, and shall pay over to the Union each month the total amount thus deducted from all employees. Authorization by employees for such deductions shall be in a form mutually acceptable to the Union and the Company.
7.02 The Secretary-Treasurer of the Union shall certify the amount of Union dues, agency fees and initiation fees to be deducted in each interval by the Company. Such certification shall be made to the Company on or before Friday, the eighth (8th) calendar day preceding the last day of the pay period for which the deduction is to be effective. The Company shall forward monthly such deductions to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. Mass changes of deduction amounts shall be submitted ninety (90) days or more prior to the month in which such changes are to occur. Deductions from employees paid bi-weekly shall be made in the first and second pay periods of each month. It is understood that the Company will not be liable except to deduct and forward such deductions to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. The Union assumes full responsibility for the disposition of the monies so deducted once they have been forwarded to the Union Secretary-Treasurer.
7.03 The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from all claims, damages, costs, fees or charges of any kind which may arise out of or result from the honoring by the Company of dues or fees deduction authorizations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the transmitting of such deducted dues or fees to the Union.
7.04 Cancellation by an employee of such written authorization for payroll deduction shall be in writing and signed by the employee. The signed cancellation authorization should be provided to the Company’s Payroll Department. Upon
8
receipt thereof, the Company shall honor any such cancellations. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the Local Union. Any employee who cancels their payroll dues deduction authorization will still be obligated to tender amounts equal to periodic dues to the Union subject to Article 6 of this Collective Bargaining Agreement. An employee’s authorization shall be deemed automatically cancelled if the employee leaves the employ of the Company, is transferred or is promoted out of the Bargaining Unit.
7.05 Payroll deduction of dues or fees will be handled as follows:
(A)	Deduction of dues or fees shall be suspended during the period of an employee’s leave of absence and automatically reinstated upon return.
(B)	When an employee has insufficient pay to cover all authorized deductions, then deductions for dues or fees and deductions for allotments to the Savings and Security Plan for non-salaried employees shall have priority over all other authorized deductions except those deductions required by law and authorized deductions for insurance.
The Company will provide for the make-up of missed Union dues deductions for up to four (4) consecutive deduction weeks where failure to deduct is the result of insufficient pay for the reasons other than unauthorized absence. If Union dues are missed for five (5) or more consecutive weeks, there will be no make-up through payroll deduction of any such missed deductions.
7.06 When an employee who has authorized the Company to deduct dues or fees is temporarily promoted or transferred to a non-bargained-for position for a period of one (1) full week or more, the dues or fees deduction authorization shall continue in effect until the temporary promotion or transfer exceeds four (4) full weeks. However, such deductions shall not exceed the amount deducted immediately prior to the temporary promotion or transfer. If such temporary promotion or transfer exceeds this four (4) week period, any authorization for the deduction of dues or fees shall be automatically suspended. Upon return to the Bargaining Unit, dues and fees will be automatically reinstated.
7.07 When an employee who has authorized the Company to deduct dues or fees is temporarily promoted to a higher classification within the Bargaining Unit and is shown on payroll records as being in the higher classification, dues or fees will be based on the higher rate of pay for as long as the employee remains in the higher classification.
Information Provided To The Union And From Union
7.08 The Union agrees to notify the Company of mass changes of deduction amounts ninety (90) days or more prior to the month in which such changes are to occur.
9
7.09 The Company shall furnish the Union a monthly statement including the following information for each employee having dues or fees deduction authorization on file:
(A)	Amount of dues or fees deducted.
(B)	Bargaining Unit employees for whom the Company has not made a dues or fees deduction and an appropriate explanation.
In addition, the statement will include a list of employees engaged by the Company who are assigned to Bargaining Unit job titles, such statement shall show the employee’s Name, Title, NCS Date, Local Number, Rate of Pay, Employee Classification, Responsibility Code, Report Location, Social Security Number and Mailing Address.

7.11	The information listed above will be taken from Company records and will be furnished on a timely basis; however, the Union recognizes that errors and delays may and will occur and, in using the information furnished, assumes all risks associated therewith.
Committee On Political Education (C.O.P.E.)
7.12	The Company and the Union shall provide for a program and procedure (subject to payroll system capability) whereby eligible employees of the Company may make voluntary contributions through payroll deduction to the Committee on Political Education (“COPE”), a separately segregated political action committee sponsored by the Union.
7.13	Eligibility to participate in contributions to COPE through the payroll deduction program is restricted to those employees of the Company who are certified by the Union as eligible to participate under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and any applicable state laws.
Participation by any such employees shall be on a voluntary basis and employees shall be so informed by the person soliciting their participation on behalf of the Union. The Union shall be responsible for notifying the Company promptly when any such employee is no longer eligible to participate.
7.14	Representatives of the Union may solicit participation of employees who are Union members on Company premises, but such solicitation shall not occur during working hours nor in work areas. Any such solicitation shall be limited to
10
small groups of employees and of short duration so as not to disrupt the work place.
7.15	Employees wishing to participate must complete a payroll deduction authorization card available from a representative of the Union. The authorization card shall be in a form acceptable to the Company. When completed by the employee, the authorization card will be forwarded by the Union to the payroll office appropriate for that employee. The Union will be responsible for satisfying its own requirements for records retention.
7.16	Employee deductions shall be in the minimum amount of one dollar ($1.00), or fifty-cent ($.50) increments thereof, per month. Deductions from employees’ pay shall be made each pay period.
7.17	On a monthly basis, the Company shall remit to the Treasurer of COPE the full amount of authorized deductions for the preceding month. In addition, the Company shall transmit to the Treasurer of COPE monthly a list of contributors through payroll deduction showing the contributor’s name and amount contributed.
7.18	Any employee’s payroll deduction shall cease upon the occurrence of any of the following:
(A)	Termination of a participating employee’s employment with the Company.
(B)	Retirement of a participating employee.
(C)	Transfer of a participating employee out of the bargaining unit.
(D)	Receipt in the payroll office of written notice to cancel contributions to COPE signed by the employee.
(E)	Receipt in the payroll office of written notice from the Union that an employee is no longer eligible to participate.
(F)	Leave of absence (unpaid) of a participating employee.
7.19	Except as otherwise provided herein, deductions shall continue for employees while receiving disability benefits, or while temporarily promoted to management. No deductions will be made to employees receiving payments under the Supplemental Income Protection Plan (SIPP), or the Long-Term Disability (LTD) Plan.
7.20	Deductions shall not be made if the employee has insufficient earnings to contribute to COPE.
11
7.21	This Article is subject to applicable laws and regulations and shall not be placed in effect where prohibited by any such law or regulation.
7.22	The Parties agree that the Company assumes no responsibility other than the collection of contributions pursuant to employee authorization of payroll deductions and forwarding of such amounts collected to COPE. The Union agrees to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from all claims, damages, costs and expenses of any kind which may arise in connection with the program covered.
7.23	As provided for in the regulations of the Federal Elections Commission, the costs for the administration of the payroll deduction system for COPE are the responsibility of the Union and will be handled as mutually agreed by the Company and the Union.
7.24	Any change in the aforementioned program shall be bargained for by both the Company and the Union.
ARTICLE 8

12.30	A grievance which the Union has elected to submit to arbitration under the provisions of this Section will be deemed to have been withdrawn if not submitted for final decision and processed within the time limitations prescribed in this Section.

Expedited Arbitration
12.33	Any grievance involving the suspension of an individual employee, except those which also involve an issue of arbitrability, contract interpretation, or work stoppage (strike) activity and those which are also the subject of an administrative charge or court action may be submitted to arbitration under this expedited arbitration procedure within fifteen (15) calendar days after the filing of a request for arbitration. In all other grievances involving disciplinary action which are specifically subject to arbitration, as specified in paragraph 12.25 Section: Arbitrable Topics above, both Parties may, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the filing of the request for arbitration, elect to use this expedited arbitration procedure. The election shall be in writing and, when signed by authorized representatives of the Parties, shall be irrevocable. If no such election is made within the foregoing time period, the full arbitration procedure specified in “Arbitration” above shall be followed.

Each umpire shall serve until the termination of this Agreement unless his or her services are terminated earlier by written notice from either Party to the other. The umpire shall be notified of such termination by a joint letter from the Parties. The umpire shall conclude his
24
or her services by settling any grievance previously heard. A successor umpire shall be selected by the Parties. Umpires shall be assigned cases in rotating order designated by the Parties.

(D)	Within five (5) working days after the hearing, each Party may submit a brief written summary of the issues raised at the hearing and arguments supporting its position. The umpire shall give his or her decision within five (5) working days after receiving the briefs. The umpire shall provide the Parties a brief written statement of the reasons supporting the decision.
(E)	The umpire’s decision shall apply only to the instant grievance, which shall be settled thereby. The award of the umpire shall be final and binding upon the Parties, subject to law, and the Company and the Union agree to abide by the decision of the umpire. The decision shall not constitute a precedent for other cases or grievances and may not be cited or used as a precedent in other arbitration matters between the Parties unless the decision or a modification thereof is adopted by the written concurrence of the representatives of each Party at the third step of the grievance procedure.
(F)	In emergency situations only, the time limits in (A) and (D) above may be extended by agreement of the Parties or at the umpire’s request. Such extensions shall not circumvent the purpose of this procedure.

15.02 The Union shall have the right, within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial wage rates or wage schedules established as temporary by the Company.

15.06 In the event the neutral third party determines that a different schedule of rates is appropriate, the new schedule shall be placed in effect as of the date of the neutral third party’s decision and shall remain in effect until expiration of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 17
SCHEDULING AND PAYMENT FOR TIME WORKED
Scheduling
See Article 27 for provisions applicable to specified Operator Services job titles.
17.01 Insofar as service requirements and the conditions of the business permit, selection of schedules for tours shall be when practical by seniority. The responsibility for determining the requirements and conditions rests solely with the Company. However, the length of the schedule selection may be determined locally by the Union and the Company. No provision of this Agreement will constitute a guarantee as to the minimum or maximum number of hours of work per week which may be required on the part of any employee.
17.02 Not later than 3:00 p.m. on Thursday of each week, assignments for the next calendar week shall be posted or otherwise be made available to show the assigned tours each employee is to work during the following week.
17.03 Assignments will be adhered to unless the Company determines that service requirements and business conditions dictate otherwise. Should the Company make shift or tour assignment changes after 3:00 p.m. on Thursday of the preceding week, the hours outside of the originally scheduled shift or the changed tour day(s) will be paid at the premium rate without shift differential but otherwise considered as scheduled. Shift differentials will be included in the computation of such premium rate when the changed shift or tour would have been paid for at the premium rate or when the worked shift occurs on Sunday.
17.04 Changes, at the employees’ request or by local agreement, will be granted if service requirements and conditions of the business permit provided that such requests or agreements do not violate the terms of this Agreement.
17.05 Daylight Savings Time
(A)	On the night the change is made from Standard Time to Daylight Savings Time, no deduction in pay shall be made for shifts scheduled to end after 2:00 a.m. for employees whose actual hours of work are reduced by one (1) hour.
(B)	On the night the change is made from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time, an employee scheduled to work a shift ending after 2:00 a.m. may be assigned to work until the clock hour end of their assigned shift. This additional hour shall be paid in accordance with Section: Overtime & Premium Pay.
47
Lunch Period
See Article 27 for additional provisions applicable to specified Operator Services job titles.
17.0	6 A lunch period, not to exceed 1 hour, will be granted to employees except when their job assignment requires continuous duty. In the event of such continuous duty, the employee will be permitted reasonable paid time to eat on the job.
17.0	7 If taken, the normal lunch period for full-time employees shall be non-paid between one-half (1/2) hour and one (1) hour in duration and shall be taken between the third (3rd) and sixth (6th) hour of a shift, as scheduled by the Company.
Overtime & Premium Pay
17.0	8 The basic hourly wage rate including applicable differentials shall be paid for all time worked, except where overtime rates or premium rates are specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement.
17.0	9 Overtime hours worked shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the basic hourly wage rate including applicable differentials except as provided in paragraph 17.10 below.
17.10	Hours worked in a calendar week which exceed forty-nine (49) shall be paid at the rate of two (2) times the basic hourly wage rate including applicable differentials, except as otherwise provided herein.
17.11	A premium payment at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the basic hourly wage rate including applicable differentials shall be paid to employees for hours worked as scheduled Sunday shifts. Premium payments for Holidays will be paid as described in Article 21, Recognized Holidays.
17.12	No combination of overtime, premium and/or any other payments for time worked and/or any payments for time not worked, may produce an effective rate greater than two and one-half (2 1/2) times an employee’s basic hourly wage rate excluding applicable differentials.
17.13	For the purpose of crediting time not worked towards an employee’s eligibility for overtime payments (as defined in paragraphs 17.09 & 17.10 above) only the following absences during a scheduled shift shall be considered:
•	Illness (Paid)
•	Death in Family (Paid)
•	Jury or Other Court Duty (Paid)
•	Severe Weather (if employee reports to work)
48
•	Visit to Medical Facility or Company-Designated Physician at Company’s Request
•	Travel Time at Company’s Request
•	Civic Affairs (such as Community Fund, Red Cross, Etc.) when Assigned by Company
•	Joint Meetings with the Company including Joint Union-Company Committee Meetings, Grievance Meetings and Union-Management Review Board Meetings
•	Absence for Union Business (Unpaid)

•	Recognized Holidays
•	Excused Work Days (Paid and Unpaid)
•	Excused Time Requested by Company

•	Sickness and Accident Disability (Paid)
•	Leave of Absence (Paid)
17.14	The Company will distribute overtime as fairly as is practicable between employees within the work group affected by such overtime, or as locally agreed.
Call Outs
17.15	When an employee is called outside of his/her regularly scheduled shift for immediate reporting, pay will begin with the time called and continue until the employee returns home unless the time worked continues into the employee’s next scheduled shift. Should the assignment continue into the employee’s next scheduled shift, the employee will only be compensated for the time actually worked and reasonable travel time from his/her residence using the most direct route. A minimum of two (2) hours pay at the overtime rate will be paid unless the call occurs less than two (2) hours before the start of the employee’s next scheduled shift.
Out-Of-Hours Calls
17.16	When an employee is called by telephone, outside of his/her regular shift, while on vacation or on a non-scheduled day, to discuss matters related to the job and the call has been authorized by management, the employee will be paid an out-ofhour call differential of Fifteen Dollars ($15) for discussions taking from one (1) to thirty (30) minutes. Discussions which take in excess of thirty (30) minutes shall be compensated at the employee’s basic hourly wage rate or at the overtime or premium rate if applicable. This differential does not apply if the call is made to arrange or cancel overtime or if the employee is receiving an on call differential.
17.17	If an out-of-hours call is prompted by the error or omission of the employee, no payment shall be made.
49
Work Done By Supervisors
17.18	Supervisory employees will normally perform supervisory duties. Nothing herein is intended, however, to prevent supervisory employees from receiving or giving training.
ARTICLE 18

18.03 Payments to a regular employee for absence due to the employee’s personal illness shall be made in accordance with the following:
(A)	If an employee with one (1) year or more of service reports to work and becomes ill during his/her shift, the time not worked during the remaining hours of the shift shall be paid for at his/her basic wage rate, plus applicable shift differential for which the employee is eligible pursuant to Article 19, Differentials, Section: Shift Differential.
(B)	If an employee with less than one (1) year of service reports to work and becomes ill during his/her shift, the time not worked during the remaining hours of the shift will be unpaid.

50
Absences of longer than seven (7) consecutive days will be governed by the Sickness and Accident Disability Plan.
(D) The first full shift (other than non-scheduled sixth shifts) for which an employee does not report or is unable to begin work because of personal illness shall be considered as the first day of absence for illness pay purposes. If after the first day of such absence, the employee returns to duty and is subsequently unable to report for duty on a shift (other than nonscheduled sixth shifts) because of personal illness, the latter day of absence shall be considered as the first day of absence for illness pay purposes, and any subsequent returns to duty and absences because of personal illness shall be similarly treated.
Death In Family
18.04 Payments for absence due to a death in the family may be allowed for full-time or part-time employees with a minimum of nine (9) months service as described below. Pay for this purpose shall include applicable shift differentials for which the employee is eligible pursuant to Article 19, Differentials, Section: Shift Differential.
18.05 Employees absent due to death of a child, step-child, spouse or Registered Domestic Partner, parent or any relative listed in paragraph 18.06 or 18.07 who resides in the same house with the employee will be excused from duty without loss of pay for up to a maximum of three (3) work days (including travel time) beginning with the day of death through the day of the funeral. In addition, in the event of a death as noted herein, employees shall upon request be excused from scheduled time for two (2) additional unpaid days. Paid Vacation Days or Excused Work Days may be substituted for these days at the employee’s option.
18.06 Except as provided for in paragraph 18.05, employees absent due to the death of a step-parent, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent or grandchild will be excused from duty without loss of pay for up to a maximum of two (2) work days (including travel time) beginning with the day of death through the day of the funeral.

18.	09 In no event, shall an employee receive payment for a day per paragraphs 18.05, 18.06 or 18.07 above, if the employee would otherwise be paid for that day (such as holiday, vacation or disability) or not be expected to report for work on that day (such as when on leave of absence or layoff).
Jury Or Other Court Duty
18.1	0 Employees under subpoena or summons shall receive regular pay for time lost on account of jury or other court duty without deduction for any amount received from civil authorities, except that fees received by an employee in connection with a legal action directly or indirectly pertaining to Company matters or Company record become the property of the Company. The employee should notify the Company of the jury or other court duty as soon as possible. Employee hours will be changed to coincide with the above mentioned obligatory jury or other court duty assignment. When employees’ shifts/tours are rescheduled for this purpose, no premium will be paid for shift/tour change.
18.1	1 Evening and night shift employees who are expected to attend such jury or other court duty during the day are not expected to work their scheduled evening or night shifts. Pay for this purpose shall include applicable shift differentials for which the employee is eligible pursuant to Article 19, Differentials, Section: Shift Differential. If such jury or other court duty continues into a second calendar week, the Company may re-schedule an employee who normally works an evening or night shift to a day shift, without differential.
18.1	2 “Other Court Duty”, as referred to in this Section, is intended to cover those circumstances where an employee acts in the interest of good citizenship such as when an employee who is a witness to an accident, assault, robbery, etc. is requested to appear in court as a witness. The employee’s appearance would qualify as “Other Court Duty” since such an appearance is considered to be meeting a civic responsibility.
18.1	3 Notwithstanding any of the above, “Other Court Duty” as referred to in this Section, does not include lost time associated with criminal or civil actions, whether under subpoena or summons or not, if the employee is a plaintiff or defendant, or is otherwise a direct or indirect party to the action. Absence requests for court appearances in connection with such matters are considered personal, however, employees may be excused without pay.
18.1	4 Employees involved with any jury or other court appearances must report back to work immediately upon being released from attendance at court that day, unless otherwise directed by management.
52
18.1	5 Employees completing jury or other court appearances, must obtain documentation of attendance and provide this to management upon return to work.
Voting
18.1	6 If necessary to allow the employee a reasonable opportunity to vote, time off without pay will be granted. Application for such time off must be made prior to election day.
Severe Weather
18.1	7 During severe weather employees will be required to be available for such work as may be necessary to maintain telephone service or such other work as may be assigned.
18.1	8 If an employee is excused for the remainder of his/her shift because no work assignment can be provided, no scheduled time will be lost. Such excused time will be paid on the same basis as though performing productive work including applicable shift differentials pursuant to Article 19, Differentials, Section: Shift Differential.
ARTICLE 19

55
ARTICLE 20
CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF REGULAR PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
20.01 The classification of a regular part-time employee is based on the employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” which shall be determined prospectively by dividing the employee’s total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6, rounded to a “part-time equivalent work week” classification of 16.)
20.02 The “part-time equivalent work week” classification of each regular part-time employee shall be reviewed by the Company no less often than every six (6) months on April 1 and October 1 of each year and adjusted on a prospective basis, if appropriate. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked per month (excluding overtime hours) during the preceding six (6) month period and the likelihood that such number of work hours will continue for a reasonably foreseeable period of time. Classification review information will be provided to the Union.
20.03 Where applicable, payments to a regular part-time employee under Company benefit plans shall be prorated based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” classification to a forty (40) hour work week. A regular part-time employee shall not be paid for time not worked for absence due to sickness (not under the “AT&T Retirement & Savings Plan” and/or the “Ameritech Sickness and Accident Disability Plan” or their successor Plans), unless such absence due to sickness occurs on a day of the week on which the employee is scheduled to work. Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31,1980, and who works part time on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items listed above on the same basis as was applicable to a part-time employee on December 31,1980.
20.04 Benefit levels and associated premium payments for regular part-time employees are defined in the Company benefit plans. Regular employees who were on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, shall continue to be eligible for such coverage on the same basis as a regular full time employee regardless of classification.
20.05 Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a regular part-time employee in an Emerging Product Center (EPC) and any equivalent service center operation, shall be paid at the equivalent basic hourly wage rate for a comparable regular full-time employee working a normal daily shift in the same job title, classification and work group.

26.23	Supplemental Income Protection Program payments for employees who so elect to leave the service of the Company in accordance with paragraphs 26.21, 26.22, or 26.40 shall be based on the employee’s basic weekly wage rate, prorated for part-time employees, and term of employment at the time of leaving service and shall be computed in accordance with the following schedule:

If the number of weeks from the effective date of leaving service to the date of employment or reemployment is less than the number of weeks pay upon which the total payment was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be considered as an advance to the employee by the Company and repayment shall be made through payroll deductions by the employing Company at the rate of fifteen (15%) of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate until the amount of the excess is repaid.
26.28	No portion of this Section: Supplemental Income Protection Program, shall be subject to arbitration.

Force Adjustment
26.35	The Company shall decide the necessity for and shall determine the extent of any force adjustment. Changes in employee job titles in the normal course of operations of the business, either at the employee’s request or as a manager-initiated action, shall not constitute a force adjustment. There shall be no layoff of regular full time employees if there are any outside contractors performing the same work, in the same work group, at the same work location, as performed by the Surplus Employee Group.
26.36	Definitions:
These definitions shall apply for purposes of force adjustment only.
(A)	Lateral Transfer - A lateral transfer is a change to another place of reporting with the same job title or to another job title, for which the maximum basic rate of pay is within or equal to plus Twenty-Five Dollars ($25) or minus Ten Dollars ($10) of the established maximum basic rate of pay for the employee’s prior job title.
(B)	Downgrade - A downgrade is a change to a job title with an established maximum basic rate of pay which is more than Ten Dollars ($10) lower than the employee’s prior job title.
(C)	Upgrade - An upgrade is a change to another place of reporting with the same job title or to another job title, for which the maximum basic rate of pay which is more than twenty-Five Dollars ($25) of the established maximum basic rate of pay for the employee’s prior job title.
(D)	Surplus Employee Group - A Surplus Employee Group, as determined by the Company, is the group in which the surplus exists.
(E)	Force Adjustment Area (FAA) - A group of Company work locations combined for force adjustment purposes. The FAAs under this Agreement are set forth in Attachment 1.
(F)	Surplus Transfer Request - A Surplus Transfer Request (STR) is a transfer request that affords a surplus employee the opportunity to receive priority consideration for any available non-management position at any location within the Company provided the surplus employee has qualifications for the job. STR forms must be submitted within twenty-one (21) days of an employee’s surplus orientation meeting.
81
(G)	Voluntary Supplemental Income Protection Program (VSIPP) Candidate Request - Any regular full-time, non-surplus employee who has met time-on-title requirements may express interest in receiving SIPP by submitting a Voluntary SIPP Candidate Request. Such a candidate shall have two (2) business days following a Voluntary SIPP Payment offer by the Company to confirm acceptance of the offer. Failure to confirm acceptance within this time frame shall result in the Request being canceled. In such a case, a new Request may not be submitted for sixty (60) calendar days following the cancellation of the prior Request. A former surplus employee who has been placed in an upgrade position vacated by the acceptance of a Voluntary SIPP Payment by a Voluntary SIPP Candidate must reestablish time-on-title prior to submitting a Voluntary SIPP Candidate Request.
(H)	Transitional Leave of Absence (TLA) - The Transitional Leave of Absence is a leave that may be offered to eligible surplus employees as business needs dictate in order to eliminate a surplus condition. The TLA only applies to surplus employees who, as of their force disposition date, are within twenty-four (24) months of achieving eligibility under the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan - Midwest Program, AT&T Pension Benefit Plan or successors or assigns thereto and who have not declined a lateral job offer in their FAA. A TLA may be offered no earlier than twentyeight (28) calendar days following the surplus notification.
26.37	When the Company determines that a force surplus exists, it shall, prior to notifying the affected employees, advise the Union in writing with respect to the employee group(s) involved, job title(s) and approximate number of employees affected, the location(s) or geographical area(s), and the anticipated force disposition date. Notification to the affected employees shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the anticipated force disposition date. No affected employee shall be involuntarily terminated prior to ninety (90) calendar days following such notification. Any employee who elects not to accept a job in his/her FAA which does not result in a downgrade shall be considered to have resigned from the Company and will not be paid a termination payment.
Surplus orientation meetings shall be held with affected employees as soon as practicable. During these meetings the procedures and due dates described in this Section shall be explained.
26.38	The Company shall first attempt to reduce or eliminate the surplus within the Surplus Employee Group by offering lateral transfers by order of seniority, upgrades by order of seniority, offering downgrades by order of seniority and involuntarily moving employees by inverse order of seniority to lateral positions within the appropriate FAA, in that order.
82
26.39	An affected employee shall notify the Company of their acceptance of any “follow-the-work” job offer, where applicable, within twenty one (21) calendar days following the affected employee’s surplus notification or by such later date as is determined by the Company. Failure to so notify the Company by the deadline date shall constitute rejection of the offer.
Whenever a surplus situation exists which requires that employees within the Surplus Employee Group have the opportunity to “follow the work” to another employee group, the employees from both employee groups shall be considered on a “pooled seniority basis” to fill available jobs within the then consolidated employee group.
26.40	In the event that a surplus remains following the application of paragraph 26.21(A), preceding, the Company shall canvass non-surplus employees who have filed Voluntary SIPP Candidate Requests for confirmation that they are willing to accept Voluntary SIPP Payments under Section: Supplemental Income Protection Program, above, and voluntarily terminate from the Company.
(A)	Voluntary SIPP Payments shall be offered to non-surplus Voluntary SIPP Candidates beginning no earlier than thirty-two (32) calendar days following the affected employees’ surplus notification. Such a Candidate will have two (2) working days following a Voluntary SIPP Payment offer to confirm acceptance of the offer.
(B)	The canvassing of Voluntary SIPP Candidates and the placement of qualified surplus employees in the vacancies thus created, shall be in seniority order and in the following order of consideration:
(1)	The same job title in the applicable FAA;
(2)	A lateral position in the applicable FAA;
(3)	A upgrade position in the applicable FAA;
(4)	A downgrade in the applicable FAA;
Note: Steps 1 through 4 above will be completed for all surplus employees in an FAA before application of 5 below.
(5)	The same job title, a lateral position, upgrade position, or a downgrade (in that order) in up to six (6) additional FAAs, as specified by the surplus employee on the Surplus Transfer Request.
83
(C)	If a surplus employee refuses a job offer under paragraph 26.40, (B) no further job offers for that job title and location shall be made to the employee.
(D)	Any surplus employee who does not receive a job offer as outlined above may elect to replace the most senior Voluntary SIPP Candidate (for whose job the surplus employee is qualified) who has confirmed interest in accepting the Voluntary SIPP Payment and who holds the same job title as the surplus employee within the state.
Note: Paragraph 26.40 (B) 1 through 5 will be completed for all impacted surplus employees before the application of paragraph 26.40 (D) above.
(E)	Any remaining surplus employee who does not receive a job offer as outlined in paragraph (D) above may elect to replace the most senior Voluntary SIPP candidate (for whose job the surplus employee is qualified) who has confirmed interest in accepting the Voluntary SIPP Payment within the state.
Note: Paragraph 26.40 (D) will be completed for all impacted surplus employees before the application of paragraph 26.40 (E) above.
26.41	If a surplus remains after application of paragraph 26.40, preceding, any remaining surplus employees within the Surplus Employee Group may, upon election:
(A)	Displace, if such displacement can be achieved with limited or no training, the least-senior occasional, temporary or regular limited term employee within their FAA. A surplus employee who displaces an occasional, temporary or regular limited term employee shall assume that employee’s work completion date and the surplus employee’s force disposition date shall be extended to coincide with the completion date. The employee shall also retain surplus status and job title up to the date of the extended force disposition date.
(B)	Be allowed to fdl an available, open requisition which has been submitted under the classification of regular limited term which requires more than little or no training for which the surplus employee is qualified. A surplus employee who accepts such a position will assume the work completion date established for the regular limited term position. The employee shall also retain surplus status and job title up to the date of the work completion date. Should the position be reclassified as regular full-time, or after twenty-four (24) months on the assignment, the employee would assume non-surplus status. If the employee should be work completed on the work completion date of the regular limited term assignment, the
84
provisions of this article regarding termination pay and other related issues would apply.
26.42	At the force disposition date, any remaining surplus employees within the Surplus Employee Group who have not previously accepted a SIPP offer, or have not previously accepted a Job or VSIPP offer in their FAA for a job title for which the Company has vacancies shall be laid off by inverse order of seniority until the surplus is eliminated. Such employees shall receive termination payments in accordance with Section: Termination Payments following.
26.43	Wage treatment for employees who accept or receive jobs pursuant to the Force Adjustment procedures, set forth in this Section, shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement.
26.44	The force adjustment procedure herein shall not preclude limited, mutually agreed upon Union-Management modifications with respect to the geographic scope of the FAA (“Union” shall mean the Vice President of District 4, CWA, or other designated representative. “Management” shall mean the Vice President-Labor Relations or other designated representative.) Any such modifications will apply on a one-time basis and will not serve as precedent for other current or future force surplus adjustment procedures.
26.45	Surplus employees who accept a job under paragraph 26.36 (F) and who meet the conditions outlined under Section: Relocation, above, shall receive relocation payments. Those relocated employees and those surplus employees that transfer out of their FAA may utilize the Non-management Staffing Plan to be considered for either a lateral job or a downgrade, for which they are qualified, in their former FAA. This opportunity shall remain in effect for two (2) years following the placement necessitating the employee’s relocation or transfer and the employee shall, in order of seniority with other employees similarly situated, be given first preference, after surplus for a lateral job or a downgrade. The relocated employee shall not receive reimbursement for relocation expenses back to their former FAA.
Recalls & Reemployment
26.46	If additions to the work force are required in any work group within two (2) years of the last layoff made in such work group under a program of layoffs, the Company shall proceed as follows before hiring new regular employees.
26.47	The Company shall offer reemployment in order of seniority to regular full-time laid off employees within their Market Business Unit, provided that the period of layoff of such former employees does not exceed two (2) years, in the following order:
(A)	Former employees who were laid off from the work group.
85
(B)	Former employees whose work location at the time of layoff was less than forty (40) road miles, by the most direct route, from the work location of the work group being added to and who were qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(C)	Former employees the same as described in (B) above except who were not qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(D)	Former employees whose work location at the time of layoff was forty (40) road miles or more, by the most direct route, from the work location of the work group being added to and who were qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(E)	Former employees the same as described in (D) above except who were not qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
26.48	Former employees under paragraph 26.47 (C) and (E) above who are offered a job and who wish to pursue the job opportunity, must demonstrate qualifications to the satisfaction of the Company which shall be identical to those the Company requires of newly hired employees. Failure to make such demonstration will not result in the former employee being removed from the recall list, but will entitle the Company to consider the next appropriate candidate.
26.49	Former employees must keep the Company informed of the telephone number and address at which they can be reached. When an offer of employment has been so made, the former employee shall indicate their acceptance within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of the Company’s offer.
26.50	The following actions on the part of a former employee will constitute a forfeiture of reemployment rights and the employee’s name will be removed from the recall list:
(A)	Failure to notify the Company of their acceptance of an offer of reemployment within twenty four (24) hours;
(B)	Failure to report for duty on the date specified after acceptance of the offer of reemployment; or
(C)	Refusal of the offer of reemployment within their former FAA as set forth in Section: Force Adjustment, preceding.
26.51	When a former employee is recalled and assigned to the same, a lateral or a lower rated job title than their job title at the time of layoff, they shall be placed on the
86
new wage schedule at the same monthly step which they were at when laid off. In the case of an upgrade, wage treatment will be in accordance with Article 13.
26.52	Former employees whose new work location is forty (40) or more road miles, by the most direct route, farther from their residence than was their work location at the time of layoff shall be granted a relocation allowance of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000). However, if the former employee participated in the Training Opportunity Plan (TOP) upon layoff, they will not be eligible for this relocation allowance. If paid, this relocation allowance must be returned to the Company if the former employee does not both report to their new work location and relocate their residence within one (1) year of the date of reemployment unless an extension has been specifically authorized by the Company. This relocation allowance is in lieu of any other payment for relocation expenses and shall be applied against the amount of termination payment to be repaid, if any, under the provisions of paragraph 26.57 of Section: Termination Payments.
Termination Payments
26.53	A termination payment, plus compensation for any vacation days, Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays to which the employee is eligible at the time of leaving the Company’s service, shall be paid to a regular employee laid off because of lack of work, or may be paid at the discretion of the Company to an employee whose services are terminated for reasons such as unadaptability or inability to properly perform assigned job duties.
26.54	In no event shall an employee receiving a termination payment be eligible to receive payments in accordance with the provisions of Section: Supplemental Income Protection Program, above. Further, regular employees who are discharged or who resign from the service of the Company shall not be eligible for termination payments except as provided in paragraph 26.53 above.
26.55	The amount of a termination payment shall be based on the employee’s basic weekly wage rate, prorated for part-time employees, and term of employment at the time of leaving service and shall be computed in accordance with the following schedule:
Term of Employment
Less than 6 months
6 months but less than one year
1	year but less than 2 years
2	years but less than 3 years
3	years but less than 4 years
4	years but less than 5 years
5	years but less than 6 years
6	years but less than 7 years
7	years but less than 8 years
Amount of Payment
None
1	week pay
2	weeks’ pay
3	“
4	“	“
5	“
6	“
8	“
10 “
87
8	years but less than 9 years 9	years but less than 10 years 10	years but less than 11 years 11 years but less than 12 years 12 years but less than 13 years 13 years but less than 14 years 14 years but less than 15 years	12	“ 14	“ 16	“ 19	“ 22	“ 25	“ 28	“ +4 weeks each additional full year
The maximum number of weeks payable as termination payments shall in no event exceed eighty-eight (88) weeks of pay.
26.56	Termination payments shall, at the employee’s option, be paid as follows: (1) One-half of the total amount calculated above shall be paid as a lump sum within sixty (60) days after the employee has left service and the remaining half will be paid in monthly amounts of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) beginning within thirty (30) days after the employee has left service and continuing until the total amount has been paid; or (2) The total amount calculated above shall be paid as a lump sum within sixty (60) days after the employee has left service; or (3) the total amount calculated above shall be paid out in twelve (12) equal monthly payments; or (4) the total amount calculated above shall be paid as a lump sum within sixty (60) days after start of the following calendar year.
26.57	An employee who has left the service of the Company and who has received a termination payment and who is employed or reemployed by any of the companies referred to in paragraph 26.59 will be treated as follows. If the number of weeks from the effective date of leaving service to the date of employment or reemployment is less than the number of weeks’ pay upon which the termination payment was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be considered as an advance to the employee by the Company and repayment shall be made through authorized payroll deductions at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate until the amount of excess is repaid.
26.58	A re-engaged employee who has received a termination payment and who is again laid off will be paid the difference between the computed payment to which he or she is eligible and the net amount of any payment which he or she may have received due to any previous layoff.
26.59	The provisions of this Section do not apply in case of an employee leaving service voluntarily, an employee on a leave of absence, or an employee transferred to any other AT&T Midwest Company or a Company directly or indirectly owned by AT&T Midwest which participates in the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan - Midwest Program, AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, or successors or assigns thereto.
88
Extended Medical Coverage
26.60	Employees who are not eligible for a service pension and whose employment is terminated as a result of layoff or application of the force adjustment procedures, or who elect to leave the service of the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Supplemental Income Protection Program, shall continue to remain eligible for coverage for up to eighteen (18) months under the employee benefit plan providing medical coverage the employee would be eligible for under Article 16 if the employee remained an active employee or its successor Program, as follows:
(A)	An employee whose Net Credited Service is five (5) years or more will be eligible for continued coverage in accordance with the terms of Article 16 that would apply if the employee remained an active employee for a period of six (6) months following the month in which employment is terminated. The employee may elect to continue such coverage for an additional twelve (12) months at the employee’s expense by paying the full monthly premium amount.
(B)	An employee whose Net Credited Service is at least one (1) year but less than five (5) years will be eligible for continued coverage in accordance with the terms of Article 16 that would apply if the employee remained an active employee for a period of three (3) months following the month in which employment is terminated. The employee may elect to continue such coverage for an additional fifteen (15) months at the employee’s expense by paying the full monthly premium amount.
(C)	An employee with less than one (1) year of Net Credited Service who is eligible for coverage at the time of termination of employment may elect to continue such coverage at the employee’s expense for a period of eighteen (18) months following the month in which employment is terminated by paying the monthly premium amount.
Payment of extended medical coverage by the Company, however, shall not extend the period of coverage beyond that required to be provided by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) of 1986.
26.61	The extended medical coverage shall be on the same basis and in the same amount to which the employee was entitled immediately prior to leaving the service of the Company. If during the period of any extended medical coverage, as set forth above, the medical expense coverage is changed for employees who remain on the payroll, the same changes will be applied to persons participating in this extended medical coverage program.

Scheduling
27.01 Insofar as service requirements and the conditions of the business permit, selection of schedules for shifts shall normally be by seniority. The responsibility for determining the requirements and conditions rests solely with the Company. No provision of this Agreement will constitute a guarantee as to the minimum or maximum number of hours of work per week which may be required on the part of any employee.
27.02 Weekly schedules will be prepared by the Company and will show the employee’s tour, shifts, non-scheduled days, lunch periods and breaks. Not later than 3:00 p.m. on Thursday of each week, schedules for the next calendar week shall be posted or otherwise made available to show the assignments for each employee during the following week.
27.03 Assignments will be adhered to unless the Company determines that service requirements and business conditions dictate otherwise. When the starting or ending time of an assigned shift (with the exception of the Sunday following the posted schedule) is changed on an assigned day after 3:00 p.m. Thursday of the preceding week by the Company, the employee whose shift has been changed shall be paid at one and one-half (1 16) times their basic hourly wage rate for all hours worked outside of the hours of the originally assigned shift on that day. Such payment will not be paid in the cases of emergency (including events of national or local importance, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, civil strife, severe weather conditions, or any other occurrence which restricts the Company in meeting service demands).
27.	04 The Company may agree to schedule changes requested by employees and approved by the immediate Supervisor provided such changes do not violate any other provisions of this Section. When schedules are changed by mutual consent

27.	09 All full-time employees shall be assigned a fifteen (15) minute break during each session of their assigned shift. Such breaks shall be assigned no earlier than one (1) and one half (1 ¥2) hours after the start of a session nor later than one (1) hour before the end of a session. In the case of full-time employees assigned to six (6) hour shifts, two (2) consecutive breaks shall be assigned as near to the middle of the shift as feasible.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
TRAINING OPPORTUNITY PLAN
This Memorandum of Agreement covers understandings reached by the Union and the Company regarding the Training Opportunity Plan hereafter referred to as “TOP” as follows:
1.	Eligibility: - A regular employee who, after the effective date of this Agreement, is declared surplus pursuant to Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment, and who has not been offered any position in their Force Adjustment Area (FAA) or in an additional FAA as specified in paragraph 26.40(B)(5 ) (the Expanded Voluntary SIPP option) prior to the Force Disposition Date may participate in TOP after layoff, if previously elected by the employee.
2.	Participation: - No later than five (5) working days prior to the Force Disposition Date, an eligible employee may elect participation in TOP.
•	An employee who elects to participate in the Training Opportunity Plan (TOP) cannot participate in the Employment Security Commitment (ESC) or the Extended Employment Opportunity Period (EEOP).
•	The TOP participant must maintain a Surplus Transfer Request (STR) on file indicating the employee’s preference on laterals, downgrades and upgrades in their FAA for purposes of placement consideration as further defined below in paragraph 5, Reemployment While in TOP Status. The TOP participant to whom a job offer has been made has one (1) working day to accept the offer, after which it will be considered rejected.
3.	Income Continuation: - A TOP participant will receive their termination payments in income continuation installments equal to their basic weekly wage rate (less appropriate taxes) at the time of layoff. Income continuation installments will continue until whichever of the following occurs first:
•	The TOP participant refuses a lateral or upgrade job offer in their FAA. Termination payments will stop immediately and the balance will not be paid to the TOP participant.
•	The TOP participant refuses a downgrade job offer in the FAA or a job offer outside the FAA and receives the balance of their termination payments.
•	The TOP participant obtains other full-time or part-time employment as defined by the Company with a non-AT&T Company and receives the balance of their termination payments.
105
The TOP participant’s termination payments are exhausted.
•	The TOP participant fills a regular full-time job vacancy in another AT&T Midwest Company. Termination payments will stop immediately and the balance will not be paid to the TOP participant.
•	The TOP participant fills a job vacancy with the Company in accordance with contractual reemployment rights. A TOP participant may be selected for recall from layoff to fill an available job opening for a job never held by the TOP participant utilizing a “most qualified” over basic qualified selection process, irrespective of the recall from layoff provisions as set forth in the Parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.
•	The TOP participant elects to voluntarily terminate participation in TOP and receives the balance of the termination payments.
4.	Duration of Participation: - In no event may an individual remain in TOP for more than one (1) year from the initial date of layoff. At the end of that year, the balance of a TOP participant’s termination payment, if any, will be paid to the participant as a lump sum. However, the TOP participant will be reimbursed to a maximum of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000) for approved actual expenses incurred for training/retraining for up to two (2) years from date of layoff. (See “Reimbursement Feature” following.)
5.	Reemployment While in TOP Status: - Although laid off, a TOP participant will receive the same priority consideration as that afforded a surplus employee described in Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment, paragraph 26.36(E) for positions only in their FAA. The NonManagement Staffing Plan will not be available to TOP participants. Once the participant’s termination payments are exhausted or at the end of one (1) year (whichever occurs first), reemployment rights under the provisions of Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Recalls & Reemployment will continue to apply for the duration of the two (2) year Recall & Reemployment period.
•	The Company will retain the undistributed balance of termination payments in the event of reemployment.
•	A TOP participant who is reemployed within the Company or any other AT&T Midwest Company and who is again laid off will be paid the difference between the termination payment at the time of layoff and the amount of termination payment previously received while in TOP. Said employee is not eligible to enroll again in TOP.
•	Tuition expenses approved by the Program Administrator prior to reemployment will be paid for under the reimbursement feature.
106
6.	Benefit Continuation: - A laid off employee who elects TOP participation becomes eligible for a maximum of one (1) year of medical, dental, vision, and basic group life insurance benefits the employee would have been eligible for under Article 16 had the TOP participant remained an active employee Benefits provided under TOP shall run concurrently with the extended medical coverage to which the TOP participant may be entitled under the Parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement and shall not extend the period of coverage beyond that required to be provided by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) of 1986.
Such benefits will continue until whichever of the following occurs first:
•	Termination payments are exhausted.
•	The TOP participant is reemployed in a regular full-time position within an AT&T Company, or obtains other regular full-time or part-time employment, as defined by the Company, with a non-AT&T Company.
•	The TOP participant elects to voluntarily terminate participation in TOP and receives the balance of the termination payments.
•	A maximum of one (1) year has passed from the beginning date of TOP participation.
7.	Reimbursement Feature: - TOP participants are eligible to receive up to a maximum of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000) for actual expenses incurred for tuition, training, job placement services related to seeking employment, or for moving expenses if the TOP participant is required to move their residence in conjunction with a job elsewhere within an AT&T Company.
•	Any such expense must be approved by the Company prior to being incurred.
•	The Program Administrator will provide assistance to the TOP participant in selecting appropriate educational or training classes or programs; will conduct skills, interest and aptitude assessment, if necessary; and will recommend outplacement counseling where appropriate.
•	Reimbursement will be made for approved expenses incurred within two (2) years from the date of layoff.
•	The Program Administrator may recommend that a TOP participant take a Company training class. Such a class if approved, may be taken during TOP participation and up to one (1) year following the date of layoff.
107
During the period of TOP participation, if a TOP participant’s spouse or registered domestic partner is unemployed, that spouse or registered domestic partner is also eligible to participate in the TOP reimbursement feature with the following limitations:
•	Said participation shall not exceed Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) of Company approved expenses incurred for tuition/training.
•	Any such expense must be approved by the Company prior to being incurred.
•	Reimbursement will be made for approved expenses for one (1) year from the date the spouse’s or registered domestic partner’s TOP participation begins but in no event later than two (2) years from the date of the TOP participant’s layoff.
•	If the TOP participant is reemployed by an AT&T Company, voluntarily terminates participation in TOP, refuses any job offer or obtains other regular full-time or part-time employment, as defined by the Company, with a nonAT&T Company, the spouse or registered domestic partner will only be eligible to complete the current term of enrollment in training.
8.	Plan Administration:
•	Will be through a designated Company Program Administrator.
•	Nothing in the Plan or its administration will be subject to the grievance and arbitration processes as set forth in the Parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
FOUR DAY TOUR
The Union and Company recognize that in certain work groups it may be beneficial to the employees and in the best interest of the business to establish a four day schedule as a normal tour. Accordingly, in a work group where local management and the local union agree, the number of hours which presently constitute a normal five day tour will be scheduled in equal amounts over four days.
The work groups selected for such four day tours will be solely at the discretion of the Company. The local management and the local union will discuss the process by which the number of employees who volunteer will be assigned their shifts and tours. It is further agreed that if the needs of the business require the Company to discontinue the four day tour, the Company will notify the Union in advance.
Four day tours will be scheduled in advance as full tours. No daily overtime payment shall be made for any of the scheduled hours worked which constitute the normal four day tour.
Subject to the above, and before implementing a four day schedule in any work group, the local management and the local union will establish the parameters and implementation procedures for such four day tours. Unless otherwise agreed, the following will apply:
(1)	Weeks in which holidays fall will revert to a normal five-day tour.
(2)	Employees scheduled for a week of vacation will have their tours revert to the normal five-day tour.
(3)	Employees pre-scheduled for Excused Work Days, Day-At-A-Time Vacation, Floating Holiday(s), or jury duty will revert their tours to the normal five-day tour. Non-scheduled Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Day-At-A-Time Vacation within a week in which the employee’s tour is four ten hour days will be treated as ten hour days. Employees may take no more than four ten hour unscheduled days (i.e., forty hours) on a day-at-a-time basis. These unscheduled days include Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Vacation days.
(4)	Payment will be based upon a ten hour day for employees who are absent because of sickness or accident disability during the course of the four day tour. If the disability continues into the next week, the employee’s tour will revert to the normal five day tour.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
SUCCESS SHARING PLAN
Based on the Union and Company’s desire to have employees share in the success of AT&T Inc. (“AT&T’), the parties agree to a Success Sharing Plan (“SSP”). Eligible employees may receive annual contributions into a Health Reimbursement Account (“HRA”) established under an employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations, based on AT&T stock price appreciation and AT&T dividend rate.
A.	Plan Components
1-	Success Units
Employees will be awarded 150 success units at the beginning of each award year (October 1, 2009, October 1, 2010 and October 3, 2011). Those success units will only be valid for that award year and will not carryover to the next award year. A success unit is only used as a multiplier in the payout calculation and is not a share of stock nor has any other value.
2.	Determining Stock Appreciation Award Value
Award Year	Beginning Award Value	Ending Award Value
2010 (October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010)	October 1, 2009 closing AT&T stock price	September 30, 2010 closing AT&T stock price
2011 (October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011)	October 1, 2010 closing AT&T stock price	September 30, 2011 closing AT&T stock price
2012 (October 3, 2011 to September 28, 2012)	October 3, 2011 closing AT&T stock price	September 28, 2012 closing AT&T stock price
The stock price used in establishing the award value will be the closing AT&T stock price on the New York Stock Exchange.
114
The award value will be adjusted proportionally to reflect any stock split.
3.	Determining Dividend Rate Value
For Award Year 2012, the payout will include a dividend rate value. This value will be determined by adding each AT&T declared quarterly dividend during the award year (December 2011, March 2012, June 2012, and September 2012) and multiplying this total by 150 success units.
4.	Payout
A.	For Award Years 2010 and 2011:
Employees will receive a total payout based on the difference between the ending award value and the beginning award value for the award year times 150 success units. For example:
Stock Appreciation Value:
Beginning award value - October 1, 2009 closing AT&T stock price $25.00 Ending award value - September 30, 2010 closing AT&T stock price $30.00 Total Payout - $30 - $25 = $5 x 150 success units = $750.00
B.	For Award Year 2012:
Employees will receive a total payout based on the difference between the ending award value and the beginning award value for the award year times 150 success units plus the dividend rate value. For example:
Stock Appreciation Value:
Beginning award value - October 3, 2011 closing AT&T stock price $25.00 Ending award value - September 28, 2012 closing AT&T stock price $30.00 Payout - $30 - $25 = $5 x 150 success units = $750.00
Dividend Rate Value:
December 31, 2011 dividend	$.41
March 31, 2012 dividend	$.41
June 30, 2012 dividend	$.41
September 30, 2012 dividend	$.41
Total Dividend	$1.64
Payout - $1.64 x 150 success units = $246.00
Total Payout
$750.00 stock appreciation value + $246.00 dividend rate value = $996.00
115
The Company shall contribute the total payout value into the HRA of each eligible employee as soon as practicable after the award year and will normally occur by December 31 st.
B.	Eligibility
Employees eligible for contributions as described above are those regular, temporary and term employees who are on the payroll on both the beginning and ending dates of the award year and who work for a minimum of three (3) months within the award year in a position covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. Eligible employees who are on approved leaves of absence or short-term disability absence and meet the other eligibility requirements on the ending date of the award year shall receive a contribution, provided they return to duty on or before December 31 of the year in which the contribution is made.
C.	Part-Time Employees
Eligible part-time employees will receive prorated contributions based on their part-time classification (or “part-time equivalent work week”) on the ending date of the award year.
D.	Dispute Resolution
Company determination under this plan shall be final and binding. The Union may present grievances relating to matters covered by the SSP, but neither the plan nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.
This Memorandum of Agreement will remain in effect through the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

CONTRACTING OUT
This Memorandum of Agreement covers understandings reached between the Company and the Union regarding the use of contractors by the Company.
The Parties have discussed both the Company’s need to contract out work and the concern of employees about the potential effects on them. The Company has stated that its objective in making decisions regarding the contracting out of work is to carefully consider the interests of customers and employees, as well as all other factors relating to management of the business.
While the Company cannot make specific commitments regarding the contracting out of work, it is the Company’s general policy that traditional telephone work will not be contracted out if it will currently and directly cause layoffs or part-timing of regular employees in the Bargaining Unit. When reviewing bids received regarding contracting out, the Company will give consideration to utilizing available Union contractors, but the Company shall retain the sole discretion to select the contractor to receive the work.
This Memorandum of Agreement will remain in effect through the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

CONTRACTING OUT REVIEW
This Memorandum of Agreement covers discussions between the Company and the Union regarding the periodic review of contracted out work during the term of the Parties’ 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
1.	On a quarterly basis, the Company’s Assistant Vice President - Labor Relations (or the designated Labor Relations representative), along with two (2) other Company representatives and the appointed representatives of the Union’s Vice-President District 4 will meet to review traditional telephone work identified by the Union which has been contracted out. Union members shall consist of not more than three (3) Union Representatives. Committee members who are employees shall be compensated for attending Committee meetings authorized by the Company during the employee’s scheduled shift at the employee’s basic wage rate in accordance with Article 10.06 of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Company will also pay associated reasonable transportation expense and/or lodging expense of employees, when authorized by the Company.
2.	In advance of any scheduled review meeting, the Company will provide the following information regarding the identified subcontracted work to be reviewed: The name(s) of the contractor(s); the nature of the work; the zip code(s) of the location(s) where the work was performed; and, if available, the number of hours of work subcontracted and associated costs, provided such information is not considered proprietary information and the disclosure of such information is not detrimental to the operation of the business. The focus of such reviews shall be to afford the Union an opportunity to suggest ways in which the Company could, in the future, use Bargaining Unit members to perform the same contracted out work at the same or lower total cost to the Company and within the same completion time requirements.
3.	Where such suggestions are presented by the Union, the Company will give them due consideration and will advise the Union of its determination.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
AT&T MIDWEST NON-MANAGEMENT STAFFING PROCESS
This Memorandum of Agreement reflects the agreement reached between the Company and the Union regarding the AT&T Midwest Non-Management Staffing Process.
This staffing process applies to all regular employees, except regular limited term employees unless mutually agreed to by the Union and the Company.
This memo does not change any of the contractual provisions for placement of surplus as defined in Article 26 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
If it becomes necessary to make changes to this agreed-upon staffing process such changes will be discussed with the Union prior to implementation.
Employees are encouraged to have a skill profile and test request on file prior to selfnominating for an open position, however, it is not mandatory to be considered for an open position.
Employees will be scheduled for testing based on projected job needs and employee availability (e.g. vacation, etc). If an employee is considered to be a candidate for an open position, but is unavailable for 5 business days or less to be scheduled for testing, regardless of whether there is a test request on file, the open position will not be filled until the employee can be tested.
If an employee, considered to be a candidate for an open position, is unavailable for 10 business days for test scheduling due to vacation and has had a test request on file for at least 30 days prior to the posting date of the open position, the open position will not be filled until the employee can be tested.
Employees who have not completed time on assignment requirements will be able to submit a request to be scheduled for testing three (3) months prior to the end of their time-on-assignment period.
Employees who are selected for positions through this agreed-upon AT&T Midwest Staffing Process will be required to serve time-on-assignment when their job title changes and/or the content of their job changes. Generally a change in job content is a result of movement between Market Business Units. Time on assignment must be served prior to an employee’s transfer to a different job unless waived by management and agreed upon by Labor Relations.
123
Open positions will be posted for seven (7) calendar days. Employees will be able to selfnominate for these positions twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Employees may bid on an unlimited number of open positions.
All employees who have nominated for the open positions, including employees who are test qualified and those awaiting testing as noted above, will be considered for open positions provided such employees meet the requirements for satisfactory attendance and performance pursuant to the AT&T Midwest Staffing Process and have satisfied time on assignment.
Selection for open positions will be made by the Company in accordance with Article 15 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
If an employee selected for an open position is unable to satisfactorily complete training or is unable to satisfactorily perform the duties of the job during the first six (6) months following formal training, the employee will be retreated to his/her former job or a job of like status and pay, in comparison to his/her former job.
Employees who have accepted a promotion or a position involving a job content change may, within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the transfer, notify their supervisor in writing that they wish to retreat to their former position. Employees will be retreated to their former jobs or equivalent jobs as the needs of the business permit. However, new time on assignment requirements must be met before an individual voluntarily retreating may be considered for other open positions in the future.
The Company will provide the Union with copies of revised Job Briefs for its review and will consider the Union’s input for future revisions.
A designated member of the Union may contact the designated Company counterpart to address the appropriateness of qualifications for a posted job vacancy. The Company will respond within two (2) business days as to the appropriateness of the qualifications for the posted job vacancy.
Skills verification will be required in situations where the skill is a factor in the selection of the candidate. Hiring Managers must return completed skills verification forms to the AT&T Midwest Staffing Center.
On a requisition, twenty-five (25) points will be added to the most senior candidate, per job opening. If the most senior candidate declines the job, or is otherwise disqualified, the points will be reassigned to the next senior candidate. If that candidate declines the job or is disqualified, these same twenty-five (25) points will be successively assigned in seniority order until the requisition is filled.
If the Company determines it is necessary to make changes to the Additional Qualification points, currently within the range of 98-103, it will discuss the changes and any impact they may have with the Union.
124
An Oversight and Review Board composed of three (3) AT&T Midwest representatives and three (3) members of the Union will meet quarterly, when necessary, and will:
•	Monitor the ongoing operation of the AT&T Midwest Staffing Process.
•	Analyze its overall results.
•	Provide a forum to address concerns raised about the staffing of jobs through the AT&T Midwest Staffing Process, including skills verification.
The Company and the Union will continue, through the use of joint teams, to review the appropriate adders for each official job title within the Company. The teams will be made up of representatives of the Labor Relations and Company Staffing organizations, front line managers, a representative from the CWA Oversight Committee and Union-represented employees that are currently performing the job being reviewed.
As the Administrative Guidelines are updated, the Company will provide copies to the CWA International and each Local Union.
The Company will supply the CWA International the ability for “view only” access to the AT&T Midwest Staffing system at a location of the Union’s choice.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
CWA/AT&T MIDWEST CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSE TEAM
The Company and the Union mutually recognize that responsive interaction and communication with customers by front line employees is essential to providing quality customer service and successfully meeting the challenges of a competitive marketplace.
Also recognized is the need to assure the front line employees a customer focused workplace wherein efficient high quality customer service is promoted in an environment supportive of employees’ needs for professional growth and sensitive to their need for personal consideration.
Accordingly, the Company and the Union hereby agree to continue CWA/AT&T Midwest Customer Service Response Team(s) which will bring together key Union leaders and Company executives to review and discuss on an oversight basis those issues concerning front line employees in their provisioning of customer service in the Market Business Units that have traditionally participated in such meetings. Company executives may represent a specific Market Business Unit, or multiple Market Business Units.
Such oversight discussions and reviews by the team are intended to encompass the broad range of issues which may affect front line employees and the management team in their joint commitment to provide high quality customer service. These will include service levels, performance standards AWT/CST, monitoring, adherence, job stress, sales objectives, training, vacation scheduling, employee attitudes, staffing, and other issues as appropriate.
The Company team(s) will consist of at least a Vice President and an HR representative from the Market Business Unit(s) and the Director of Labor Relations-CWA. In addition to the appropriate International Representative, the Union will appoint a number of key representatives equal to the number of AT&T Midwest states in which the participating Market Business Unit(s) has operations.
The Team will meet at least annually, and up to four (4) times a year if mutually agreed by the Parties. Time spent during the meetings will be considered as Company-Union meeting time. Payment for such time will be paid as detailed in Article 10.06, Section: Payment for Joint Meeting Time of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Company will pay associated transportation and lodging expense as agreed to prior to each meeting.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
MONITORING
The Company and the Union acknowledge that there is a responsibility to provide high quality service to customers and the need to be in a position to effectively compete in today’s increasingly competitive communications industry. It is the intent to develop overall performance to provide service to customers in an efficient, courteous and responsive way.
Monitoring is a tool to evaluate the on-line effectiveness of employees to reach and maintain quality service. The approach for monitoring will continue to be based on a premise that fosters a work environment that builds on mutual trust and respect which enhances job satisfaction.
Monitoring includes, but is not limited to, the following:
a)	Service Observations: Monitoring of this type is intended to randomly review the performance of the work group to determine their effectiveness in providing quality service to customers. Official Service Observations, made at the direction of the Company for the primary purpose of determining the overall quality of service furnished to customers, are not intended nor will they be used for the purpose of identifying or rating the performance of individual employees except as noted below. The Company will not publish any result data of any official observing for small offices that would allow for identification of individual employees.
b)	Diagnostic: Monitoring of this type is intended to review and evaluate new or changed products, practices and procedures.
c)	Evaluative/Developmental: Monitoring of this type is intended to be handled in a professional and confidential manner and to document performance of the individual employee for evaluation purposes. This type of monitoring will be conducted by management personnel and will generally be done at the work address/location. While conducting remote evaluative/developmental monitoring, management must display a visual indicator that employee monitoring is in progress. Evaluative/Developmental call monitoring will be from a sampling of calls. Such calls will not be arbitrarily selected for evaluative purposes. The monitoring results should be reviewed with the employee within twenty-four (24) hours after the monitoring has taken place. Other managerial steps, such as training sessions, visual observations, individual discussions and coaching may be used in addition to monitoring to evaluate and improve an employee’s performance.
129
Individual notification will be given to employees to be monitored the day the Evaluative/Developmental Monitoring takes place. Employees’ preference for side by side or remote observations will be honored where existing facilities permit.
Exception: Individual notification and preference are applicable once an employee has six (6) months' on job experience after completion of formal training.
Where an employee demonstrates difficulty meeting established performance expectations, he/she may lose the privilege of receiving notification and choice of preference until performance expectations are met on a consistent basis.
Monitoring used for Service Observations or Diagnostic review, will not result in employee discipline unless customer abuse, fraud or violation of the Company Code of Business Conduct are involved.
To administer monitoring, the Company will set guidelines on the monthly number of Service Observation and Diagnostic calls handled by employees which will be subject to managerial monitoring. These guidelines will provide for reasonable Company-wide consistency in the number of monitored calls needed to obtain a valid sample of the employee’s grade of service and to determine his/her training needs. Monitoring is not intended to harass an individual employee or any group of employees, nor should it be used to create an atmosphere of pressure in the work environment.
The Company’s reasons for engaging in monitoring will be explained to employees subject thereto. They will be informed of the proper use of such monitoring by their managers.
Managers will be trained in analyzing observation data, in planning appropriate training, and in improving their interviewing skills, including placing emphasis on the positive aspects of an employee’s job performance.
At their request, employees will be allowed reasonable time during working hours (normally during a feedback of the results of manager’s monitoring) to review their monitoring records and work performances summaries.
It is not the Company’s primary intent to use GPS, AMAs or electronic reports to monitor and discipline employees. However, should the Company become aware of misconduct through the normal use of GPS, AMA’s or electronic reports the Company can not ignore such information and reserves the right to take appropriate action, including application of appropriate discipline.

Therefore, the Parties agree to initiate a joint Labor Advisory Forum for the purpose of ensuring such open dialogue and to forge a stronger partnership dedicated to the promotion of mutually beneficial objectives.

•	Those Union representatives assigned responsibilities for contact with the respective Market Business Units;
•	Key Labor Relations staff managers, including Labor Relations liaisons to the respective Market Business Units;
•	Key Market Business Unit leaders as agreed upon.
The Forum may be scheduled to meet at least twice per calendar year, but may meet more or less often as mutually agreed upon by the co-chairs. Forum meetings may be convened as appropriate to include additional participants upon mutual agreement of the co-chairs, e.g., convene a larger group meeting to include all local Union presidents region-wide and additional Market Business Unit leaders.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMITMENT
This Memorandum of Agreement - Employment Security Commitment (“Memorandum”, “Commitment” or “ESC”) covers understandings reached between the Company and the Union regarding employment security. This Memorandum supersedes the Memorandum of Agreement - Employment Security Commitment and the Memorandum of Agreement - In Lieu of Employment Security Commitment contained in the Parties’ 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement (“Agreement”).
In response to CWA and employee concerns regarding employment security and in addition to the existing provisions in Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment, of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the Union, the Parties agree as follows:

NOTE:

139
(A)	Is already test qualified for consideration, or becomes so qualified by passing the Technical Mechanical Test (TMT) and the Customer Contact Interactive Assessment (CCIA) or their replacements.
(B)	Meets current job requirements.

After the sixty (60) day election period, or by such later date as is determined by management, an employee who elects the ESC cannot change their election and choose TOP.
NOTE: The provisions of Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment, paragraph 26.41 will not apply to employees who invoke the Job Offer Guarantee.

The Company may make a guaranteed job offer for positions with companies not signatory to this 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement consistent with the terms of the Inter Subsidiary Movement Process referenced in the National Transfer Plan, Section: (“IMF”). Employees accepting a job offer outside their current bargaining unit shall be treated as if they had transferred under the terms and conditions of the IMF process and shall be subject to all applicable receiving company practices, policies, collective bargaining agreement provisions and benefit plan eligibility standards, including those related to or affected by Net Credited Service.
(A)	An employee to whom a guaranteed job offer has been made has one (1) working day to accept the offer after which it will be considered rejected.

140

(C)	A qualified surplus employee who, at his/her force disposition date, is entitled to, but has not yet received, a guaranteed job offer shall remain on the payroll at his/her existing wage rate and shall be assigned such work within the FAA as management deems appropriate until a guaranteed job offer is made.
NOTE:	Any employee who has been retained on the Company payroll beyond
his/her force disposition date pursuant to this ESC and who then rejects a guaranteed job offer, in their Market Zone for which the companies listed in the IMF process have vacancies shall be terminated. The amount of wages paid said employee between the force disposition date and termination shall be deducted from any termination payment due.
4.	The terms of this Commitment shall not apply to “Union-Management modifications” to the force surplus disposition procedures as provided for in paragraph 26.44 of Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment, unless Union and Management mutually agree.
5.	The force surplus conditions contemplated and dealt with in this Commitment are those which occur in the normal course of business for reasons such as technological change, etc. The Company retains the right, however, to suspend or cancel at any time the application of this Commitment when a force surplus is declared because of any significant change or extraordinary fluctuation in economic or business conditions as determined by the President of the Market Business Unit.

(B)	An interexchange carrier takeback of billings and collections functions.

RE: Neutral Evaluation Process
Dear Mr. Schaeff:
The Parties agree to continue the use of the neutral evaluation process for the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
As soon as is reasonable, following ratification of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Parties will each select five (5) new arbitrators who will comprise a special panel of ten (10) neutral evaluators (“evaluators”) to be utilized for the purpose of this process. The Parties will schedule neutral evaluation days with the evaluators, where the evaluator may hear up to three (3) dismissal and/or suspension cases per day. Each case will be limited to one hundred and twenty (120) minutes as set forth below. The cases will be evenly distributed among the evaluators as practicality permits. The Parties agree to equally share the compensation and expenses of cases evaluated, except in instances where cases are withdrawn less than twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the scheduled time for the evaluation. In such event, the withdrawing Party will be responsible for any cancellation fees and/or expenses incurred.
Proceedings before the evaluator shall be informal in nature. The presentation of evidence and the issues heard will be limited to that which has already been presented or asserted during the grievance and/or Union-Management Review Board process. Formal rules of evidence will not apply. The Parties will be represented by Labor Relations Case Managers and local Union Representatives, and no official record of the neutral evaluation will be kept.
Each Party may have no more than two (2) individuals attend the neutral evaluation proceeding; and, each Party will be limited to a forty-five (45) minute presentation. When unusual circumstances warrant, the Parties may mutually agree, prior to the date of the evaluation, that one additional representative may attend for either Party; or, that the presentation time for each Party may be extended by a period not to exceed thirty minutes.
147
The evaluator will be provided one half hour to question both Parties in the presence of one another, and to render his or her advisory opinion. This advisory opinion will resolve any procedural or substantive arbitrability issues and/or determine whether the Company acted with or without just cause and, where the disciplinary action lacked just cause, what remedy, if any, should be imposed. Under no circumstances will the Company be liable for back pay for more than six (6) months after the date of the disciplinary action.
Within two (2) working days following the evaluator’s advisory opinion, a Party must notify the other Party in writing if the Party rejects the evaluator’s advisory opinion; otherwise it will be treated as accepted by the Party. In instances where the Parties accept the evaluator’s advisory opinion of no just cause, the Company agrees to implement the remedy within ten (10) working days. In instances where the Parties accept the evaluator’s advisory opinion of just cause, the Union agrees to withdraw the grievance in writing within ten (10) working days.
In instances where the Company or the Union rejects the evaluator’s opinion the case will be deferred to the regular arbitration process. No statements made by either Party at the neutral evaluation proceeding may be introduced as evidence at an arbitration hearing by the other Party.
This neutral evaluation process will be in effect and will include all applicable cases appealed to arbitration through December 31, 2012.
This letter will remain in effect through the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

RE: Proper Use Of Union-Management Review Board
Dear Mr. Schaeff:
When properly used by both Parties, the Union-Management Review Board process has facilitated the resolution of cases short of arbitration, including, in a number of cases, the reinstatement of employees with backpay when warranted by the facts. The Company is fully committed to the proper use of the Review Board process and will not tolerate its misuse.

RE: OSA Temporary Assignment
Dear Mr. Schaeff:
This letter confirms understandings concerning Operator Services issues reached by the Company and the Union during the course of the 2009 Collective Bargaining discussions:
1.	The method for assignment of schedules and weekly days off for employees in the title Operator Services Assistant (OSA) temporarily assigned as Service Assistants (SA) for one or more shifts in a week will be locally determined between the Local Union president and the Operator Services Center (OSC) Manager. Either of two (2) methods shall be chosen:
(1)	The OSA may be assigned in seniority within the SA title group or
(2)	The OSA may be assigned in seniority within the Operator title group
The method selected will remain in effect for a minimum of one (1) year, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
2.	The method for selection for employees in the title Operator Services Assistant (OSA) temporarily assigned as Service Assistants (SA) for one or more shifts in a week will be locally determined between the Local Union president and the OSC Manager. Either of two (2) methods shall be chosen:
(1)	The OSA may be selected by rotation.
or
(2)	The OSA may be selected by seniority
The method selected will remain in effect for a minimum of one (1) year, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
3.	Lead Person differential will be paid to a Service Assistant (SA) who is assigned non-supervisory management responsibilities, over and above those duties
150
assigned to the Service Assistant due to the absence of all Operator Services managers assigned to an OSC on a normally scheduled shift. Lead Person differential will not be paid for a shift with no regularly scheduled Operator Services manager.
This Letter of Understanding will remain in effect through the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.
Please confirm your understanding of these arrangements by signing both copies of this letter and returning the second copy to me.

In response to discussions between the Company and the Union during the 2009 collective bargaining process relative to the Union proposal regarding Surplus Employee Training/Retraining Procedures, Surplus Orientation Meetings are held with the Surplus Employee Group as referenced in Article 26.36 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Given the unique circumstances of each anticipated force adjustment, the Company agrees to discuss with the appropriate Union representatives other issues, such as an interview process and the training needs of the surplus employees prior to any formal declaration of force surplus.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
REGARDING SERVICE OPERATORS
The Company and Union have agreed to include the title “Service Operator” in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, dated April 4, 2009 through April 7, 2012.
The Service Operator title will perform Wholesale Operator Services work, which includes directory assistance and information services for wireless and other noncompeting carriers.
Service Operators will be exempt from shift differentials and Article 27 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Scheduling will be in accordance with Article 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the follow exception: “Full-time employees shall be assigned a fifteen (15) minute break during each session of their assigned shift. Such breaks shall be assigned no earlier than one and one half (1 fi) hours after the start of a session nor later than one (1) hour before the end of a session.”
In the event AT&T Midwest Operator Services requires employees to work split shifts, the Company and the Union will meet and discuss the parameters for split shifts prior to implementing split shifts to the Service Operators.
Non-Wholesale Market work will not be transferred to Service Operators if such transfer of work would result in a force adjustment, office merger, and/or surplus condition within AT&T Midwest Operator Services.
All other provisions of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement will apply unless specified in this Memorandum of Agreement.
The Company and Union agree to meet and discuss any and all other issues that may arise concerning the inclusion of the Service Operator title in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS
The Company and the Union recognize the competitive nature of the business and the desire to encourage and reward employees for their contributions. The Company may implement voluntary incentive plans associated with established goals which include but are not limited to sales, service, productivity, customer experiences and/or other business considerations.
Plans may be designed and implemented for employees or groups of employees based on individual or team results.
The payments may be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Awards may be in cash or other forms of payments pursuant to Company sponsored programs, for example Ipoints or Blue Points. Such payments will be subject to all applicable taxes and withholdings.
The Company and the Union will meet, prior to implementing a plan, to provide the Union with an opportunity to have input concerning the terms of the plan. The Company reserves the right to amend, modify or discontinue any incentive plan with advance notification to the Union.
The Union may only challenge general disputes that arise over the Company’s enforcement of the terms of an incentive plan, and then only through the grievance and arbitration process. A general dispute is one that involves a plan enforcement issue that commonly affects all employees (as opposed to individual employees) who participate in the same incentive plan. Grievances for such disputes shall begin at Step 3 of the grievance procedure, and should be sent to the Director of Labor Relations or designee. If the issue is not resolved with Labor Relations, the grievance may be appealed to arbitration. Disputes may not be brought over differences that may exist in the treatment of employees who participate in different incentive plans. Individual employee disputes regarding an incentive plan payment or plan application to an individual employee may be brought to the employee’s supervisor for resolution.
This Memorandum of Agreement will remain in effect through the term of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
REGARDING
LEVERAGED TITLE
The Company and the Union recognize the importance of rewarding performance with compensation in today’s competitive marketplace. This Memorandum of Agreement covers understandings reached between the Company and the Union concerning the creation of a new leveraged title, Sales Consultant. It is the intent of this Memorandum to provide for the creation of the Sales Consultant title under a leveraged compensation plan to ensure compensation is earned commensurate with results.
The Company may establish the Sales Consultant title for new hires with compensation paid under a leveraged compensation plan consisting of base pay and incentive pay. The Company may establish, modify and/or discontinue target incentive compensation plans, provided that any such plan shall be consistent with this Memorandum. The maximum wage rate of the Sales Consultant title will be 60% of the maximum base wage rate of the current job title performing like functions. The Sales Consultant title will have a thirty-six 36 month wage schedule with six (6) month wage progression steps within the appropriate wage zone. In addition to base wages, new employees in the Sales Consultant title will be eligible for compensation under a target incentive compensation plan once they exceed 50% of their established targets. The target incentive dollar amount will be the same for all wage zones and will be considered eligible compensation under any benefit plans for which the employee is eligible. The dollar basis upon which target incentives are initially created may be adjusted. Annually, the target incentive amount will be increased in accordance with the general wage increases provided in Article 13. The incentive plan will be capped at 300% of target incentive. Employees in initial training will be eligible to receive 100% of the target incentive amount during initial training.
Existing Temporary and Regular Limited Term employees performing functions that are the same or similar to functions to be performed by a Sales Consultant may be reassigned to such title(s) and will be placed on the lowest step of the new title that would not result in loss of pay or, if there is no such step, then they will be placed on the highest step of that title.
Except as provided in this Memorandum, the terms of the Core Agreement would apply to these employees. Employees performing like functions within the same work group of a Sales Consultant may choose to convert to the Sales Consultant title and associated compensation plan. In addition, on a one-time basis and at the employee’s request, the Company will retreat the employee to their former title within six months of the transfer. Employees covered by the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan- Midwest Program who transfer into a Sales Consultant title will have their pension calculated using the pension band that would be applicable to other employees performing like functions in the same Wage
157
Zone. In the event a force surplus condition occurs at any location in which Sales Consultant employees are part of the same Work Group as employees in a different job title performing the same or similar functions, the titles will be combined and considered as one Surplus Employee Group for purposes of Article 26 administration.
Employees in leveraged titles may be hired in any employee classification such as, but not limited to, Regular Full Time, Regular Limited Term, and Temporary. Leveraged titles may be created in any Market Business Unit affiliated with the Consumer, Business or Finance organizations. Job assignments performed by leveraged titles will generally include sales and/or collections.
This Memorandum of Agreement will remain in effect through the terms of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

1.	A surplus employee who meets the provisions of Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement will be pooled by title (or as described in 3 below), in order of seniority, within their Combined MBU, if applicable, within their Force Adjustment Area (FAA), provided the employee meets the basic qualifications of the job.
2.	For surplus purposes, certain Market Business Units will be combined during the term of this Agreement. The names and vice president level decision makers of Market Business Units existing on April 4, 2009 that will be combined for such purposes are listed in Attachment 1.

a.	Pool #1: Customer Service Specialist, Construction Technician and Service Technician
b.	Pool #2: Clerical Associate, Administrative Specialist, Technical Associate, and Technical Specialist
4.	Should the Company reorganize in such a way as to alter the Market Business Units (MBU’s) as they existed on April 4, 2009, the Parties agree to meet to identify new combined MBUs and pooled titles in order to accomplish the intent of this Memorandum.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
CORE INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING SURPLUS EMPLOYEES
This Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) covers understandings reached between the Company and the Union regarding the job titles of Customer Service Specialist (“CSS”) and Service Technician (“ST’) when a surplus is declared in the Core Installation and Maintenance Midwest Market Business Unit (“IM”) and/or the Construction & Engineering Midwest Market Business Unit (“C&E”) which results in the pooling of CSS/ST’s within IM and C&E.
A surplus CSS/ST in IM or C&E who meets the provisions of Article 26, Training and Employment Security, Section: Force Adjustment of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement (“Core Agreement”) and has:
a) fded a Surplus Transfer Request within the requisite time frame, b) not received a job offer prior to the Force Disposition Date, and c) not had any Voluntary SIPP Candidates identified for him/her in accordance with Article 26.40 (B-E)
shall, by order of seniority, displace the least senior Premises Technician in the U-Verse Field Operations Midwest Market Business Unit within his/her Force Adjustment Area, provided that he/she meets the basic qualifications of the Premises Technician job title and is meeting job requirements in his/her current title. However, no surplus CSS in C&E shall displace a Premises Technician if 10% or more of the employees in the Premises Technician job title within the Force Adjustment Area came to the Premises Technician job title from CSS/ST job titles in IM and/or C&E with economic protections pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Economic Protection Following Placement Into Appendix F of Surplus Core Employees and Global Service Employees Identified for Layoff (“Economic Protection MOA”) and the Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Force Movement of Employees (“Movement MOA”), both of which are Attachments to Appendix F of the Core Agreement and its predecessor Agreement.
Such a displacement opportunity will be considered a valid job offer for purposes of ESC eligibility of the CSS/ST.
The displaced Premises Technician shall be laid off within fourteen (14) calendar days following notification of displacement.
If a surplus CSS/ST is placed into a Premises Technician job pursuant to this MOA, and the surplus CSS/ST’s current weekly pay rate exceeds that of a Premises Technician, there will be no change in the surplus CSS/ST’s weekly rate of pay until it is exceeded by that of the Premises Technician title. Until such time, the surplus CSS/ST shall not be eligible for any wage increases.
160
Any displacement that occurs as a result of this MOA shall be pursuant to the Movement MOA, and any surplus CSS/ST placed into a Premises Technician job pursuant to this MOA shall be afforded the economic protections provided for in the Movement MOA and the Economic Protections MOA.
This Memorandum of Agreement will expire at the end of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties, unless the Parties mutually agree to extend.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT NATIONAL TRANSFER PLAN
In response to the CWA’s concern for its members’ employment security and its expressed interest in removing impediments to movement between various AT&T Companies identified in the attachments to this Memorandum, the Company agrees to extend the Intersubsidiary Movement (IMF) process and the CWA Surplus Exchange (CSE) process with the following modifications:
IMF:
1.	Southeast companies for the bargaining units listed below will be added to the list of participating companies (Attachment A):
•	Southeast Core Bargaining Unit
o BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.
o BellSouth Communication Systems, LLC
o BellSouth Corporation
o BellSouth Long Distance, Inc.
•	Southeast Billing Bargaining Unit o AT&T Billing Southeast, Inc.
•	Southeast Utility Operations Bargaining Unit o BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.
2.	Eligible employees will receive priority placement before external hires after regional contract processes for any bargaining unit job for which they qualify. The qualification criteria utilized will be the same qualification criteria utilized for the regional contractual processes.
3.	In situations where there are equally qualified employees eligible and interested in the same position at the receiving Company, eligible employees will be offered the position in order of seniority. If needed, the tie breaker for employees with the same seniority will be the last four digits of their social security number with the higher number being the more senior.
4.	When a bargained-for employee moves among bargaining units of the Company covered by this Memorandum of Agreement treatment of vacation time, the Designated Holiday (DH), Floating Holidays (FHs), and Excused Work Days (EWDs) or their equivalent (covered time) will be treated as follows:
•	A covered employee will be eligible for covered time for the current vacation year at the new entity based on the existing labor agreements at that entity. Any covered time already taken at the former entity will be deducted from equivalent covered time for which the employee is eligible at the new entity; the remaining covered time will be scheduled at the new entity subject to needs of the business.
•	Covered time carried over from the prior vacation year must be disposed of, i.e., paid in lieu of or taken at the former entity.
•	In no case will an employee’s movement from one entity to another result in the double payment for covered time.
163
5.	Employees who have held the Premises Technician job title, or any job title in an agreement or appendix to an agreement that provides for the terms and conditions of employment for Premises Technicians (“Premises Technician Agreements”), are eligible for IMF, but shall be treated as provided in this paragraph. Any employee who has ever held a position in a Premises Technician Agreement will be treated by any receiving company that is party to this IMF agreement and that also is party to a Premises Technician Agreement as if they were received from their own Premises Technician Agreement for all purposes. If the receiving company does not have a Premises Technician Agreement, then employees transferring to that company shall receive the benefits applicable to other bargained-for employees with similar service in the receiving company, except for pension and post-retirement medical and dental benefits; instead, 1) such employees shall participate in the Bargained Cash Balance Program 2 and 2) if such employee meets the eligibility requirements for post-retirement benefits upon termination, the former employee will pay contributions equal to 50% of the total cost of coverage for post-retirement medical and dental coverage if the former employee is not Medicare eligible and will not be eligible for medical or dental post-retirement coverage if Medicare eligible.
6.	Employees selected to fill openings in accordance with terms outlined above, will have their Term of Employment (TOE, which was previously known as Net Credited Service or NCS) or Seniority at the departing company recognized by the receiving Company’s pension plan or program, subject to the receiving Company’s service bridging rules. However where pensions are applicable, the TOE or Seniority will be recognized by the receiving company’s pension program only for vesting, participation and eligibility service purposes, but not pension credit or accrual purposes. Further, the service performed at the receiving company will be counted in the departing company’s pension plan or program, but only for vesting, participation and eligibility purposes (not for pension credit purposes). In no event will a period of service count as pension credit or accrual service in more than one AT&T pension plan or program (in other words, no double counting of service for pension credit or accrual purposes).
7.	Unless expressly provided to the contrary by the Benefits Agreement in the 2009 Core Collective Bargaining Agreement, employees transferring to companies under this Agreement will receive active benefits and any post-retirement benefits under the benefit plans or programs and subject to the terms of the contractual Benefits provisions of the receiving company.

The qualification criteria utilized will be the same qualification criteria utilized for the regional contractual processes.
4.	Employees who are declared surplus and subsequently involuntarily laid off who express interest in available positions in participating companies will receive priority placement before external hires after regional contract processes for any bargaining unit job for which he/she qualifies for a period of twelve (12) months following their involuntary lay off. The qualification criteria utilized will be the same qualification criteria utilized for the regional contractual processes.
5.	In situations where there are equally qualified employees eligible and interested in the same position at the receiving Company, eligible employees will be offered the position in order of seniority. If needed, the tie breaker for employees with the same seniority will be the last four digits of their social security number with the higher number being the more senior.
6.	Any CWA-represented regular employee covered by a CWA Labor Agreement held by a participating company whose work is moving from that company to another participating company may be offered the opportunity to follow their work. Such offer will be subject to the need for additional employees at the receiving Company and all applicable qualifications and selection criteria at the receiving Company. Employees who select this option in lieu of any severance payment and who are placed at and report to, the receiving Company, will receive payment for Relocation Allowance per the applicable terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement at their former Company. This Relocation Allowance will be paid when 1) the employee relocates his/her home residence as a result of following the work; and 2) the employee’s new place of reporting is fifty (50) miles or greater road miles by the most direct route farther from their residence than was the old report location.
7.	Any CWA-represented regular employee covered by a CWA Labor Agreement held by a participating company who becomes surplus and is offered a job, through the CSE process, in another participating company, will receive payment for Relocation Allowance per the applicable terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement at their former Company. Employees who accept a job offer in lieu of any severance payment and who are placed at and report to, the new location will receive payment for this Relocation Allowance when 1) the employee relocates his/her home residence; and 2) the employee’s new place of reporting is fifty (50) miles or greater road miles by the most direct route farther from their residence than was the old report location.

•	A covered employee will be eligible for covered time for the current vacation year at the new entity based on the existing labor agreements at that entity. Any covered time already taken at the former entity will be deducted from equivalent covered time for which the employee is eligible at the new entity; the remaining covered time will be scheduled at the new entity subject to needs of the business.
•	Covered time carried over from the prior vacation year must be disposed of, i.e., paid in lieu of or taken at the former entity.
•	In no case will an employee’s movement from one entity to another result in the double payment for covered time.
9.	Employees who have held the Premises Technician job title, or any job title in an agreement or appendix to an agreement that provides for the terms and conditions of employment for Premises Technicians (“Premises Technician Agreements”), are eligible for CSE, but Shall be treated as provided in this paragraph. Any employee who has ever held a position in a Premises Technician Agreement will be treated by any receiving company that is party to this CSE agreement and that also is party to a Premises Technician Agreement as if they were received from their own Premises Technician Agreement for all purposes. If the receiving company does not have a Premises Technician Agreement, then employees transferring to that company shall receive the benefits applicable to other bargained-for employees with similar service in the receiving company, except for pension and post-retirement medical and dental benefits; instead, 1) such employees shall participate in the Bargained Cash Balance Program 2 and 2) if such employee meets the eligibility requirements for post-retirement benefits upon termination, the former employee will pay contributions equal to 50% of the total cost of coverage for post-retirement medical and dental coverage if the former employee is not Medicare eligible and will not be eligible for medical or dental post-retirement coverage if Medicare eligible.
10.	Employees selected to fill openings in accordance with terms outlined above, will have their Term of Employment (TOE, which was previously known as Net Credit Service or NCS) or Seniority at the departing company recognized by the receiving Company’s pension plan or program, subject to the receiving Company’s service bridging rules. However, the TOE or Seniority will be recognized by the receiving company’s pension program only for vesting, participation and eligibility service purposes, but not pension credit or accrual purposes. Further, the service performed at the receiving company will be counted in the departing company’s pension plan or program, but only for vesting, participation and eligibility purposes (not for pension credit purposes). In no event will a period of service count as pension credit or accrual service in more than one AT&T pension plan or program (in other words, no double counting of service for pension credit or accrual purposes).
11.	Unless expressly provided to the contrary by the Benefits Agreement in the 2009 Core Collective Bargaining Agreement, employees transferring to companies under this Agreement will receive active benefits and any post-retirement benefits under the benefit plans or programs and subject to the terms of the contractual Benefits provisions of the receiving company.
166
Order of Consideration:
Job offers made under IMF or CSE will follow the order of consideration below after regional contract processes for any bargaining unit job for which he/she qualifies.
(1)	Surplus employee currently on the payroll and surplus employees involuntarily laid off within the last twelve (12) months
(2)	Current employee using the IMF process
For both IMF and CSE, the Union agrees that it will not seek to alter any existing bargaining units in any AT&T Company on the basis of any movement or transfer of employees between said companies as a result of this Agreement. Further, the Union will not, on the basis of this Agreement or change in operations or practices made by Participating Companies as a result of this Agreement in any pleading, petition, complaint or proceeding before the National Labor Relations Board, an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, or any court, assert, claim, charge or allege that such companies are a single or joint employer or enterprise, alter egos, accretions or successors of one another, or that any bargaining units of said entities represented by or sought to be represented by the Union are a single bargaining unit, or are or should be otherwise altered in their scope or composition. This commitment on the part of the Union will survive the expiration of this Memorandum, unless and until such time as this commitment is terminated by the mutual written agreement of the parties.
This Agreement shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures of the affected employee’s collective bargaining agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
REGARDING NEUTRALITY AND CARD CHECK RECOGNITION
AT&T Inc. (“the Company’”) and Communications Workers of America (“the Union”), enter into this Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Neutrality and Card Check Recognition as of the last date of the parties’ signatures on this Agreement.
1.	Duration. This Agreement is effective as of the date stated above, and shall remain in effect for the life of the 2009 Core Collective Bargaining Agreement, unless extended, modified or terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties or their successors. The parties expressly understand, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated, all of the terms hereof nevertheless shall survive said termination and remain in effect with respect to any reorganization or restructuring of any bargaining unit as a result of which management creates any new subsidiary, division, or operating entity as to which no Union representation then exists.
2.	Applicability.
(a)	. All card check procedures and any Union recognition provided for by this Agreement shall be applicable to all non-management employees of the Company effective with execution of this Agreement.
(b)	. As used herein, “the Company” means AT&T Inc. and all other present and future companies, divisions, subsidiaries or operating units thereof, except Pacific Bell Directory where the employees are represented by the IBEW, AT&T of Puerto Rico, Inc., AT&T of the Virgin Islands, Inc., AT&T Government Solutions, Inc., AT&T Support Services Company, Inc., and BellSouth Corporation and its subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.)
(c)	. As used herein, “non-management” means employees who normally perform work in non-management job titles as determined by the Company, in accordance with the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and applicable decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and reviewing courts. If the Union disagrees with any such determination, the parties agree to submit the issues of unit definition to arbitration as set forth in paragraph 3. below, using the aforesaid statutory requirements and decisions as the governing principles. At the request of the Union, the Company will discuss with the Union neutrality as to Union representation of employees who are not defined above as “nonmanagement.”
(d)	. In addition to the foregoing, the parties further agree that any proposed bargaining unit shall exclude all professional, managerial, and confidential employees, guards and supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.
(e)	. The Company agrees that, for future divisions, subsidiaries or operating units that are not wholly owned, it will, at the request of the Union, discuss with the other owners the extension of this agreement to such divisions, subsidiaries, or operating units.
3.	Card Check Recognition Procedure.
(a)	. When requested by the Union, the Company agrees to furnish the Union lists of employees in the bargaining unit in each applicable company entity. This list of employees will include the work location job title, and home address.
(b)	. The Union will give twenty-one (21) days notice for access to Company locations. Access will be limited to one sixty (60) day period in any twelve months for each unit agreed upon or determined as provided herein.
170
(c)	. (1). The Union and the Company shall meet within a reasonable period, but not to exceed ninety (90) days, after the effective date hereof for the purpose of defining appropriate bargaining units for all presently existing potential bargaining units. During this process, the Company will share job titles, job functions, work locations, and management structure with the Union representatives in order to facilitate agreements on the appropriate bargaining units. In the event that the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to arbitration administered by, and in accordance with, the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The Arbitrator shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act. The parties agree that the decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding. The Company and the Union agree that the permanent Arbitrator to hear disputes with respect to this sub-paragraph shall be Thomas Angelo and the alternative Arbitrator will be Richard Bloch. If either of these Arbitrators cannot serve, the parties shall select an Arbitrator from a list or lists of prospective Arbitrators provided by the AAA.
(2)	. If either the Company or the Union believes that the bargaining unit as agreed or determined in (c). (1). above, is no longer appropriate due to organizational changes, then the parties shall meet and confer in good faith for the purpose of re-defining the appropriate unit. In the event that the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the re-definition of an appropriate unit, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to arbitration as provided in (c). (1).
(d)	. The Company agrees that the Union shall be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent for any agreed-upon or otherwise determined bargaining unit(s) not later than ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the AAA that the Union has presented valid authorization cards signed by a majority of the employees in such unit(s).
(e)	. For the purposes of determining the number of employees that constitute a majority of the bargaining unit, the employee population will be composed of only those employees employed in the bargaining unit on the earliest date which appears on the cards presented to the AAA. The cards so presented must be dated within sixty (60) days of each other, but no earlier than the date of execution of this Agreement, and each card so presented must contain at least the language set forth in Attachment 1 hereto. The Company shall provide the AAA all employees, job titles and other information required for the AAA to verify the existence of more than 50% of employee authorizations as provided for in this Agreement.
(f)	. In the event the Union fails to deliver to the AAA valid authorization cards signed by a majority of employees in any aforesaid bargaining unit upon completion of its card signing effort, the Union agrees not to begin any further card signing effort in such unit for a period of one year from the date on which access was first granted as provided in (b). above.
(g)	. As soon as practicable after the aforesaid recognition and upon written request by the Union, the Company, or the appropriate subsidiary, division or operating unit thereof shall commence bargaining in good faith with the Union with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment for the employees
171
employed within the agreed upon or otherwise determined appropriate bargaining unit.
4.	Neutrality.
(a)	. The Company agrees, and shall so instruct all appropriate managers, that the Company will remain neutral and will neither assist nor hinder the Union on the issue of Union representation.
(b)	. For purposes of this Agreement, “neutrality” means that management shall not, within the course and scope of their employment by the Company, express any opinion for or against Union representation of any existing or proposed new bargaining unit, or for or against the Union or any officer, member or representative thereof in their capacity as such. Furthermore, management shall not make any statements or representations as to the potential effects or results of Union representation on the Company or any employee or group of employees. The Union also agrees that, in the course of any effort by the Union to obtain written authorizations from employees as provided for in paragraph 3. (b)., above, neither the Union nor any of its officers, representatives, agents or employees will express publicly any negative comments concerning the motives, integrity or character of the Company, AT&T, Inc., or any of their officers, agents, directors or employees.
(c)	. This agreement supersedes and terminates any and all other agreements, Memorandum of Understanding, commitments or statements of intent regarding neutrality or card-check procedures that may exist as of the date hereof between the Union and any Company entity.
5.	Valid Authorization Cards. For purposes of this Agreement, a valid written authorization card shall state specifically that by signing the card, the employee agrees to be represented by the Union, using the language set forth in Attachment 1.
6.	Recognition for New Entities and New Work.
(a)	. The Company agrees that it will give the Union reasonable advance notice, once a firm management decision has been made, of its intent to effect any reorganization or restructuring, or to engage in any new line(s) of business, as a result of which management expects to create any new subsidiary, division, or operating entity as to which no Union representation then exists. After execution of this Agreement, should the Company acquire new companies or engage in a new line of business or enter a new market in which there is no active labor agreement or bargaining agreement in place, the parties agree that this Agreement shall apply to that acquired company or new line of business or enterprise in a new market after that company has been operating for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.
(b)	. If management determines that more than fifty percent (50%) of the employees employed within an appropriate unit for bargaining by a new entity were, immediately prior to such employment, employed in a bargaining unit represented by the Communications Workers of America, the Company agrees that it shall recognize and bargain with the Union as the duly constituted bargaining representative of such bargaining unit employees, and the Union agrees to acknowledge such new entity as a Successor Employer for all applicable purposes under the labor laws of the United States and any relevant state.
(c)	. If management determines that fifty percent (50%) or less of the non-management work to be performed by any such new entity will consist of work previously performed by members of a pre-existing Union bargaining unit, then the Company agrees that, within a reasonable time after the said determination has been made, or
172
concurrently with the giving of the notice referenced in paragraph 6. (a)., above, whichever is later, the Company will so inform the Union in writing. To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall presume, in making any determination as set forth in this paragraph 6., that each employee of the new entity who was a member of a pre-existing Union bargaining unit wishes to remain represented by the Union. These employees shall be counted as having signed valid authorization cards should a card signing effort be undertaken in the new entity within one year after the new entity begins operations employing such employees.
(d)	. Except as specified in paragraph 9., below, the Union shall retain any legal rights it may have to challenge any management decision or determination described in this paragraph 6.
7.	Regulatory and Legislative Support. The Union hereby agrees to continue its support before the appropriate regulatory and legislative bodies for the Company’s efforts to remain competitive in, and/or to gain entry to, all telecommunications and related markets in which the Company chooses to participate, unless the Union determines such support to be in conflict with its interests. If the Union determines such a conflict exists, the Union will promptly so notify the Company and, at the request of the Company, meet to discuss and confer on such conflict.
The Company hereby agrees to support Union efforts before regulatory and legislative bodies unless the Company determines such support to be in conflict with its interests. If the Company determines such a conflict exists, the Company will so notify the Union and will, if requested by the Union, meet to discuss and confer on such conflict.
8.	Job Offers to Employees in Existing Bargaining Units. In connection with any reorganization, restructuring or other event that gives rise to application of the terms of this Agreement, and which involves either:
(a)	the transfer of non-management work from any Union bargaining unit to any other entity of the Company or of any subsidiary of AT&T Inc., or
(b)	the elimination of bargaining unit work while new jobs are created in any other entity of the Company or any subsidiary of AT&T Inc.,
the Union agrees that, once the recognition has occurred, an offer of a job in another entity to an employee in an existing bargaining unit shall have the same effect as if the same job or one of similar status and pay were offered by the employer under the collective bargaining agreement(s) for that bargaining unit. This shall include, without limitation, application of any contractual reassignment pay protection provisions and the satisfaction of any bargained-for employee right to a job offer. Except as specified in paragraph 10., below, nothing in this paragraph 8 shall be construed as a waiver by the Union of any legal rights it may have to challenge or contest the reorganization, restructuring, or other event described in 8.a. and/or 8.b. above.
9.	Dispute Resolution. Except as to disputes referenced in paragraph 3. (c). of this Agreement, all disputes concerning the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement shall be handled and addressed by the meeting of designated representatives of the Company and the Union. Either party may request such a meeting and each party pledges its best efforts to address any and all concerns raised as to the meaning or application of this Agreement. With the exception of matters referenced in paragraph 3.(c). above, the meaning or application of this Agreement shall not be subject to arbitration. Each party reserves its right to seek judicial or
173
other relief provided by law to enforce this Agreement. However, the parties agree that prior to seeking such relief, they will meet and confer as set forth above.
10.	Waiver of Certain Other Claims.
(a)	. The Union promises and agrees that, in connection with any arbitration provided for in this Agreement, and in connection with any legal or administrative suit, proceeding or charge arising subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement between the Union and any AT&T company, including but not limited to any proceeding before the National Labor Relations Board or its delegate, the Union hereby waives any claim, allegation or argument, and agrees to refrain from presenting this Agreement as evidence in support of any claim, allegation or argument, that AT&T Inc. and/or any of its current or future subsidiaries, and/or their divisions, units, agents or affiliates, are or have been a single employer, joint employers, accretions or alter egos with respect to each or any of them, to the extent that any such claim, allegation or argument is based upon:
(1)	any change on or after the execution date of this Agreement, in the administration and/or control of labor relations by AT&T or any of its entities, companies, divisions, or subsidiaries; or
(2)	any change in the scope, availability to employees, or administration by management of any program or practice for the effectuation of employee-initiated transfers between or among different subsidiaries or bargaining units;
provided, however, that this paragraph shall not be construed as having any effect on the Union’s right or the Company’s obligation, to the extent the same may exist under applicable law and/or any preexisting collective bargaining agreement(s), to negotiate changes in the terms and conditions applicable to such transfers.
(b)	. T he provisions of this paragraph 10 shall survive the expiration of the remainder of this Agreement, and shall have full force and effect until specifically voided by mutual written agreement of the parties.
11.	Severability. Should any portion of this Agreement be voided or held unlawful or unenforceable by the National Labor Relations Board or any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of this Agreement.

The Communications Workers of America, District 4 (“CWA” or “the Union”) and AT&T Teleholdings, Inc. d/b/a AT&T Midwest, Illinois Bell Telephone Company, Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company, Wisconsin Bell, Inc., Michigan Bell Telephone Company, Ameritech Services, Inc. and AT&T Services, Inc. (collectively “the Company”) hereby agree to the following terms with respect to the movement of surplus employees and/or employees identified for layoff covered by the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the CWA and the Company (the “Core Agreement”), the 2008 National Internet Contract between the Communications Workers of America and SBC Internet Services (the “National Internet Contract”), and Appendix G to the Core Agreement which applies to employees of SBC Global Services, Inc. (the “Global Services Agreement”) (collectively referred to as “Labor Agreements”) into Appendix F job titles under the Core Agreement and the treatment to be afforded to such employees, and employees who voluntarily move into or are newly hired directly into these job titles. In the event of a discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions in Appendix F and any applicable provisions of the Core Agreement other than Article 16, the terms contained in Appendix F and any associated agreement(s) shall prevail. However, in the event of a discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions in Appendix F or any associated agreement(s) and Article 16 of the Core Agreement, the terms contained in Article 16 of the Core Agreement shall prevail.
I.	TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NEWLY HIRED INTO AN APPENDIX F JOB TITLE
Individuals who are newly hired into an Appendix F job title (“new hire”) will be eligible to participate in benefit plans as provided in Article 16 of the Core Agreement.
II.	TREATMENT OF SURPLUS EMPLOYEES WHO MOVE TO AN APPENDIX F JOB TITLE FROM A JOB TITLE UNDER THE CORE AGREEMENT
The Company, at its discretion, may offer employees identified as surplus under the Core Agreement jobs in Appendix F job titles through the Core Agreement force adjustment/surplus process. Any job offer to a job title within Appendix F will meet the commitment of a guaranteed job offer under the Core Agreement memorandum of agreement regarding Employment Security Commitment. Surplus employees who refuse such offers will be treated under the same terms and conditions as other employees who refuse a job offer under the Core Agreement and the aforementioned memorandum. Surplus employees covered by the Core Agreement who are placed in a job title in Appendix F who meet the eligibility requirements of the Core Agreement’s Employment Security Commitment shall continue to be eligible for the Core Agreement’s Employment Security Commitment if they are subsequently declared surplus while in the
231
Appendix F
job title in Appendix F to which they have been placed as surplus. Any job offer from such Appendix F position to a job title within the Core Agreement, which may include lateral, downgrade, or upgrade offers, will meet the commitment of a guaranteed job offer under this provision. In addition a surplus employee covered by the Core Agreement placed into Appendix F may utilize the AT&T Midwest Non-Management Staffing Process to be considered for either lateral or downgrade positions, or former titles for which they are qualified for the term of this Agreement without serving the time in title referenced in section III below. The former surplus employee shall, in order of seniority with other employees similarly situated, be given preference after surplus, but prior to “Lifeline Employees” covered under Article 26.45 of the Core Agreement.
The terms and conditions of Appendix F will apply to surplus employees who accept a position within Appendix F. If a surplus employee accepts a position in Appendix F, and the employee’s current weekly rate of pay is above the maximum weekly wage rate for the new title, there will be no change in the employee’s rate of pay until the weekly rate of pay in the new job title exceeds the employee’s weekly rate of pay at the time of the transfer. If, however, the employee’s current weekly pay is at or below the maximum weekly wage rate for the new Appendix F title, the employee will be placed on the lowest step of the new wage schedule that will not result in a wage reduction.
III.	TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEES WHO VOLUNTARILY MOVE FROM A JOB TITLE IN APPENDIX F
Regular full-time employees in Appendix F job titles are eligible to transfer to a position under the Core Agreement once they have reached at least thirty (30) months time in title (unless waived by the Company) and have satisfactory attendance and work performance, using the “JOBS” transfer process. All requirements of the ’’JOBS” transfer process are applicable for such transfers, including, but not limited to, eligibility requirements, in addition to any additional eligibility requirements provided for under this Memorandum.
IV.	TREATMENT OF SURPLUS EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE NATIONAL INTERNET CONTRACT OR GLOBAL SERVICES CONTRACT WHO MOVE TO A JOB TITLE IN APPENDIX F
The Company, at its discretion, may offer employees identified as surplus under the Internet Agreement and/or employees identified for layoff under the Global Services Agreement jobs in Appendix F job titles through the force adjustment/surplus process provided in those Agreements.
The terms and conditions of Appendix F will apply to the Internet or Global Services surplus/layoff employees who accept a position within Appendix F. In addition a surplus/layoff employee covered by the Internet or Global Services Agreement placed into Appendix F may utilize the AT&T Midwest Non-Management Staffing Process to be considered for either lateral or downgrade positions for which they are qualified for the term of this Agreement without serving the time in title referenced in Section III. above. The former surplus/layoff employees shall, in order of seniority with other employees
232
Appendix F
similarly situated, be given preference after surplus, but prior to “Lifeline Employees” covered under Article 26.45 of the Core Agreement.
Regarding wages, if the employee’s current weekly rate of pay is above the maximum weekly wage rate for the new Appendix F title, there will be no change in the employee’s rate of pay until the weekly rate of pay in the new job title exceeds the employee’s weekly rate of pay. If, however, the employee’s current weekly pay is at or below the maximum weekly wage rate for the new Appendix F title, the employee will be placed on the lowest step of the new wage schedule that will not result in a wage reduction.

In no case will an employee be eligible for more than or less than ten (10) paid holidays in a calendar year.
17.03 Employees will be compensated with eight (8) hours pay for observance of the holidays identified in Section 17.01 or 17.02 above as long as they work on the scheduled work days preceding and succeeding the holiday or are excused by the Company from working on those days.
Employees who work on the above holidays shall be compensated as specified in Section 11 of this Memorandum.
Section 18	- Vacations
18.01 Employees shall be granted annual vacation with pay based on seniority, as defined in Article 14 of the Contract, as follows:
A.	One (1) week vacation after the completion of six months of service. If completion of six months of service falls on or after November 1, such vacation may be carried into the following year, provided it is completed no later than the last full calendar week of May and prior to granting of any of the current year's vacation.
B.	Two (2) weeks vacation during each vacation year in which the first to sixth year anniversary date falls. If an employee completes six months of service and the first service anniversary falls within the same year, only two weeks of vacation shall be granted. The first week may be granted anytime after the completion of six months of service, and the second week granted after the completion of twelve months of service.
C.	Three (3) weeks vacation during each vacation year in which the seventh to fourteenth year service anniversary falls.
249
D.	Four (4) weeks of vacation during each vacation year in which the fifteenth to twenty-fourth service anniversaries fall.
E.	Five (5) weeks of vacation during each vacation year in which the twenty-fifth and subsequent service anniversaries fall.
F.	The vacation year shall be from December 31st through December 30th of the following year.
18.02 The selection of vacation dates shall be made on the basis of seniority. The number of employees in any group who are permitted to be on vacation at the same time shall be governed by the needs of the business and the needs of the employee shall be considered.
In the event an employee selects a vacation week which begins during the last week of December of the vacation year, any portion of such vacation week which falls in the next vacation year shall be treated as though it occurred in the vacation year in which the week began for purposes of vacation scheduling.
Employees who are eligible for a vacation in any calendar year may schedule in the following calendar year a part of the vacation for which they are eligible in the current calendar year, provided any vacation "carried over" from one calendar year into the next must be scheduled and taken no later than the last full calendar week of May of the following year. In no case shall an eligible employee schedule less than one (1) week of vacation in any calendar year nor schedule more than two (2) weeks as carry over vacation into the succeeding year.
18.03 Vacation pay shall be based on the employee's basic weekly wage rate in effect at the time of vacation, including any wage increase which normally would be made effective during the vacation period. Vacation time shall be considered as time worked in the calculation of overtime.
18.04 When a Recognized Holiday, as defined in Section 17 of this Memorandum, falls within an employee's paid vacation period, the employee shall be granted a day off with pay in lieu of the holiday. Such day off may be scheduled by the employee, with Company approval within the same calendar year of the holiday and shall not necessarily be continuous with any vacation period.
18.05 When an absence due to sickness or disability begins during an employee's scheduled vacation and the employee notifies the Company within the calendar week in which the sickness or disability begins, such week shall be treated as vacation and any subsequent consecutive weeks of scheduled vacation shall be treated as sickness or disability, as appropriate.
18.06 When an absence due to sickness or disability begins prior to an employee's scheduled vacation and continues into such scheduled vacation period, the time off shall
250
be treated as sickness or disability, as appropriate. When the employee's sickness or disability is terminated and he returns to work, the employee shall reschedule his vacation from remaining time available in the current vacation year. If such employee does not return to work in the same vacation year, his vacation shall be deferred until his return to work in the subsequent vacation year. Any deferred vacation should be selected by the employee within one (1) week after his return to work and taken as soon as practicable.
18.07 An employee who leaves the service of the Company shall receive payment in lieu of any unused portion of the vacation for which he is eligible.
Section 19	- Excused Work Davs
19.01 Each employee who has at least twelve (12) months of seniority on January 1 of each calendar year shall be eligible for four (4) paid Excused Work Days and one (1) non-paid Excused Work Day. Employees who do not have twelve (12) months of service on January 1 of a calendar year shall be eligible for two (2) paid Excused Work Days to be taken after they have attained twelve (12) months of service.
Employees shall be paid for the Excused Work Days as if for a normal or standard eight (8) hour day worked.
Subject to the needs of the business and force requirements of the assigned work group, time off not scheduled during the vacation scheduling process may be selected by an employee on the basis of the earliest request to the employee’s manager.
Not more than one (1) Excused Work Day may be taken in two (2) hour increments however it cannot be pre-scheduled as part of the vacation selection process. The incremental use of the Excused Work Day will be granted on a first come, first serve basis, based on the needs of the business.
All Excused Work Days will be considered as time worked for purposes of overtime compensation.
Employees who resign or are discharged will not be paid for unused Excused Work Days.
Excused Work Days must be used during the current calendar year and cannot be "carried over" to the following year.
19.02 If an employee agrees to work on a day he has requested as an Excused Work Day and the Company determines that the day cannot be rescheduled, the employee shall be paid for all time worked at his basic hourly wage rate in addition to regular pay for the Excused Work Day.
19.03 One (1) paid Excused Work Day in each calendar year may be designated by the Company. When the Company designates one (1) Excused Work Day, it shall inform the employees of such designation no later than January 31st of the current year. Employees
251
who are not eligible for a paid Excused Work Day shall be shown as excused not paid for such designated day.
Section 20	- Absences
20.01 Employees who are not probationary may be paid up to five (5) work days during an absence due to illness. Payments for absence due to such illness shall be as follows:
YEARS OF SERVICE
5 AND OVER
2 BUT LESS THAN 5
1 BUT LESS THAN 2
LESS THAN 1
PAYMENT STARTS
1ST FULL WORK DAY OF ABSENCE 2ND FULL WORK DAY OF ABSENCE 3RD FULL WORK DAY OF ABSENCE NOT APPLICABLE
The first regularly scheduled work day (excluding a sixth day) on which an employee does not report for duty because of illness shall be considered as the first day of absence for disability and pay purposes. All such time is considered as “unexcused” time off from work. Time so paid will not be counted in the calculation of overtime.
20.02 In the event of a death in the immediate family of an employee, who is not considered probationary, he shall be granted time off with pay for his regularly scheduled shifts (excluding a sixth shift) beginning with the day of death through the day of the funeral, up to a maximum of three (3) scheduled work days (including travel time) can be taken to make arrangements for the funeral and attend the same. If the funeral is held more than two hundred (200) miles away from the employee’s normal work location, such time shall not exceed four (4) work days.
Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, step-child, parent, step-parent, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, Registered Domestic Partner or any relative living in the same house with the employee.
Paid time off for the above reason shall be considered “excused” time off and shall be counted as time worked for overtime calculations.
20.03 An employee who is not considered as probationary and who is required to appear in court for jury service on any day on which he has a regularly scheduled shift shall be excused from work with pay for such day so served. Employees are required to report to their work assignments if they are excused from jury duty at a time that will permit returning to work part or all of their scheduled work time.
Employees must present to their supervisor their jury summons for payment authorization. Jury duty will be considered “excused” time off from work and shall count as time worked for the calculation of overtime.
252
Section 21	- Severe Weather
21.0	1 During periods of severe weather, employees will be required to be available for such work as may be necessary to meet the needs of the business. Employees who do not report for work or who arrive late for work, due to severe weather, shall not be paid for the time not worked. However, if work is available, tardy employees will be allowed to make up tardy time during the same calendar week and paid at the straight time rate. If working conditions permit, the supervisor may allow employees to take the day as a day of vacation, paid Excused Work Day, unpaid Excused Work Day, or unpaid excused absence.
21.0	2 During periods of severe weather, the Company may, at its sole discretion, release some but not necessarily all of its employees on an early release basis. Employees who are released early will be paid for the balance of their scheduled work day on a straight time basis. Such time shall not be used in the overtime calculation.
Section 22-	Workforce Adjustment Procedures
22.01 When layoffs are necessary due to lack of work in a given service area (Attachment 2), the Company agrees to notify the Union as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of the layoff.
22.02 In the event of a layoff, the Company shall bargain with the Union with respect to the method to be employed for the purposed layoff. If an agreement cannot be reached within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of notification, the Company shall layoff employees by service area and job title in the inverse order of seniority and in accordance with the following:
The Company shall layoff Term Employees. If additional layoffs are necessary, the Company shall layoff part-time employees. If additional layoffs are necessary, the Company shall layoff full-time employees.
An employee with less than five (5) years of seniority designated for layoff in a service area and job title shall be laid off in the inverse order of seniority.
An employee with five (5) or more years of seniority designated for layoff may avoid such layoff by assuming the job of the least senior employee with the same job title covered by this Memorandum. That employee would then be laid off.
The Company reserves the right to retain employees who possess the essential skill or knowledge necessary to perform the work available. The Company has the right to retain a maximum of 10% of the force to be laid off. Any fraction in computing the formula will be rounded to the next higher whole number. A minimum of one (1) employee may be
253
retained for special skills, if less than 10% of the force. There may be situations that this process will not provide for a sufficient number of employees to perform the work available. In such cases, the Company shall discuss the situation with the Union in an attempt to retain a sufficient number of employees.
The Company shall attempt to notify employees who are subject to layoff at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the effective date of layoff. If an employee is laid off with less than forty-five (45) calendar days notice, the employee shall be provided with eight (8) hours of pay, at the regular hourly rate of pay, for each regular work day the employee was laid off short of such notice.
22.03 In the event that the application of seniority with respect to layoffs, as set forth above, would require an employee to be laid off and workload requirements necessitate his replacement, such employee shall not be laid off unless a replacement is obtained from within the service area. An employee who is not subject to layoff in accordance with the foregoing, but who is surplus in either a job title or service area and has the least seniority therein shall accept any transfer or reassignment offered by the Company with relocation pay as provided in Section 23 of this Memorandum, or shall be laid off. The Company shall not be obligated to offer more than one reassignment to an employee. Such employee shall receive the wage rate provided for the employee's wage schedule service by the wage progression schedule for the new assignment.
22.04 In rehiring laid off employees, the Company shall offer re-employment to regular full-time laid-off employees having the most seniority, as defined in Article 14 of the Contract, who at the time of layoff were the same job title as required for the vacancy; provided that the period of layoff of such former employee does not exceed one (1) year. Such rehiring shall be subject to the following conditions:
A. Such former employee must keep the Company informed of the address at which he can be reached. Any offer of such re-employment shall be made by registered, return receipt requested mail addressed to the last address so furnished by the former employee. When an offer of employment has been so made, the former employee shall indicate his acceptance within a period not to exceed five (5) work days and shall report for duty within five (5) work days from the day when such re-employment is accepted.
If such former employee is re-engaged and is assigned to essentially the same type of work as that at the time he was laid off, he shall be paid at the rate then in effect for that assignment and for the period of service which was credited to him for wage purposes at the time of layoff.
Section 23	- Relocation
23.01 An employee transferring at the Company's request to a new location, fifty-five (55) road miles further from his residence than was the old location, may elect to relocate
254
his principal residence to the new location and shall be eligible for the following move treatment:
$4,500 to an employee who owns his principal residence;
$3,500 to an employee who rents his principal residence.
23.02 The above payments will be grossed up for taxes and are contingent upon the employee moving his principal residence within one year from the effective date of the change to the new work location and the employee remaining on the payroll for the same period of time. If the employee does not report for work, the payment shall be reimbursed to the Company or the Company may withhold the amount of the payment from any monies otherwise due to the employee.
23.03 In addition to the above payments, the employee shall be excused with no loss of basic pay for a maximum of three (3) scheduled days to perform tasks associated with relocation.
Section 24	- Service Leader
24.0	1 The Company may, as it determines necessary, appoint a qualified nonmanagement employee who volunteers to act as a Service Leader. The Service Leader will have the responsibility for directing the efforts of the work group while at the same time performing his normal duties. When an employee is appointed by the Company to perform the duties of a Service Leader for one or more days in a week, he shall be paid a Service Leader differential of Sixteen Dollars ($16) for each day so worked.
24.0	2 An employee acting as a Service Leader shall not take or recommend disciplinary action against another employee.
Section 25	- Tools
The Company shall supply employees with the tools necessary to perform their job duties. Employees shall take appropriate steps to care for and secure tools and equipment issued to them by the Company. The Company on an exchange basis will replace worn or broken tools.
Section 26	- Training
Both the Company and the Union recognize the benefit of offering product and technical training to employees. The Company shall, at its sole discretion, offer such training to its regular employees, at Company expense. The Company shall give due consideration to the employee's ability, job performance, request for training, seniority and skills, in addition to the needs of the business, and training availability, when selecting employees for training.
255
Section 27	- Career & Personal Development
27.01 Employees may become eligible for the Company's educational assistance in accordance with certain provisions of the Career & Personal Development Plan (CPDP).
The CPDP shall include the following:
•	Assessment of employee's aptitude/skills through a counseling process;
•	aid to employees returning to school (including where to focus formal education and how to develop a support network at the school);
•	assist in sharpening training skills, studying and testing; and
•	assessment of prior formal and informal education for college credit.
Each employee eligible for and participating in CPDP will be eligible for any or all portions of the Plan, provided a CPDP counselor finds such portions of the Plan appropriate for the employee.
27.02 Those employees eligible for CPDP must be:
•	Classified as full-time employee, excluding full-time employees classified as Term;
•	on the active payroll;
•	in possession of at least one (1) year net credited service; and
•	not concurrently enrolled in any Company-sponsored tuition reimbursement program.
27.03 Eligibility to remain in the Program will be forfeited by those who on two (2) occasions fail a course during their participation in CPDP and/or fail to complete a course while participating in CPDP. Disability or business reasons may be grounds to waive such ineligibility at the Company's discretion. Employees dropped from the Program may be reinstated to the Program after waiting for at least one (1) academic year.
27.04 Enrollment by employees in CPDP will be voluntary and time spent by employees in the Program will be outside of scheduled working hours and not paid or considered as time worked for any purpose.
27.05 Employees eligible for CPDP may receive counseling, testing and Company prepaid tuition assistance.
27.06 Selected educational institutions will be utilized to deliver services, courses and programs. The Company reserves the right to approve institutions, services, courses and programs.
27.07 Employees participating in CPDP will be reimbursed for fifty percent (50%) of textbook costs annually upon successful completion of approved courses and programs.
256
Participants will also be reimbursed for one hundred percent (100%) of fees up to a maximum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) annually upon successful completion of approved courses and programs.
27.08 The amounts of any refunds, charges for negligence, and outside assistance (grants, remissions, scholarships, veteran's assistance, etc.) shall be deducted from the Program payments.
27.09 In no event will the cost to the Company for each employee's direct CPDP expenses (i.e. tuition, books, fees, workshops, counseling) exceed three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) annually. Employees participating in the Program at the time this cost figure is reached will be able to complete the course in which they are currently enrolled.
27.10 The Company will make payments for any courses, testing and/or counseling that begins before the expiration of this Agreement.

Attachment IV
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN SBC Global Services, Inc. (The Company) AND COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA (The Union)
FOUR DAY WORK WEEK TRIAL
The Union and Company recognize that in certain work groups it may be beneficial to the employee and in the best interest of the business to establish a four (4) day schedule as the normal work week. Accordingly, in a work group where local management and the local agree, the number of hours which presently constitute a regular five (5) day work week will be scheduled in equal amounts over four (4) days.
The work groups selected for such four (4) day work weeks will be solely at the discretion of the Company. The local management and the local union will discuss the process by which the number of employees who volunteer will be assigned their shifts and work days within the calendar week. It is further agreed that if the needs of the business require the Company to discontinue the four day work week, the Company will notify the Union in advance.
Four (4) day work weeks will be scheduled in advance as full work weeks. No daily overtime payment shall be made for any of the scheduled hours worked which constitute the normal four (4) day work week.
Subject to the above, and before implementing a four (4) day schedule in any work group, the local management and the local union will establish the parameters and implementation procedures for such four (4) day work weeks. Unless otherwise agreed, the following will apply:
1.	Weeks in which a Recognized Holiday falls will revert to a normal five (5) day work week.
2.	Employees scheduled for a week of vacation will have their tours revert to the normal five (5) day work week.
3.	Employees pre-scheduled for Excused Work Days, Vacation, Floating Holiday or jury duty will revert their work week to normal five (5) day work week. Nonscheduled Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Vacation within a week in which the employee’s work week is four (4) ten (10) hour days will be treated as ten (10) hour days. Employees may take no more than four (4) ten (10) hour unscheduled days (i.e. forty hours) on a day-at-a-time basis. These unscheduled days include Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Vacation days.
272
4.	Payment will be based upon a ten (10) hour day for employees who are absent because of sickness or accident disability during the course of the four (4) day work week. If the disability continues into the next week, the employee’s work week will revert to the normal five (5) day work week.
This Memorandum of Agreement is effective April 5, 2009 and will remain in force and effect through April 7, 2012.
