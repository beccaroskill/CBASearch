ARTICLE G23 - CONTRACT WORK
1	In making decisions regarding contracting of work, it is management's objective to consider carefully the interests of both customers and employees along with all other considerations essential to the management of the business. Some of these considerations include but are not limited to law, regulations, changing industry structure, economic conditions, and business considerations.
2	Projects involving types of traditional telephone work which have regularly been performed by bargaining unit members in a work group will not be contracted cut if the contracting out of traditional telephone work on such a project will currently and directly cause layoffs of regular employees in the same work group which would have otherwise performed the work. "Work group" as used in this article shall be deemed to refer to the group of employees normally treated as a unit for purposes of layoff under Article G20 (Force Adjustment).
52
I
Article G23
3	From time to time, but no less frequently than every six (6) months, the Labor Relations Vice-President or his/her designee and the IBEW System Council T-3 Chairman or his/her designee will meet to review traditional telephone work which has been contracted out which, heretofore, was performed in a given locality by bargaining unit members. The focus of the meetings will be to afford the IBEW System Council T-3 Chairman or his/her designee an opportunity to suggest ways in which the Company could, in the future, use bargaining unit members in the same locality to perform the contracted out work at the same or lower total cost to the Company and within the same completion time requirements. Where such methods are presented by the Union, the Company will give them due consideration and will advice the Union of its determination. Where appropriate the Labor Relations VicePresident or his/her designee and the IBEW System Council T-3 Chairman or his/her designee will mutually authorize the formation of local committees to examine the contracted work to suggest ways that the work could be performed, in the future, by bargaining unit members in a given locality at the same or lower costs and within the same completion time requirements.
4	The provisions of this article will be subject to the grievance procedure contained in Article G7, but shall not be subject to the arbitration provisions contained in Article G8.
The parties mutually desire to provide a vehicle, other than litigation, by which certain subcontracting disputes can be amicably and expeditiously resolved in the future.
Because of the competitive nature of our markets, fluctuating work loads, and the need to provide prompt response to customer demands, the Company cannot agree that it will not contract work which might otherwise be performed by its employees. It has agreed, however, to provide for a neutral third party review of its compliance with the applicable language of the collective bargaining agreement concerning contracting, as well as the commitments set forth in the Wiliiams/Barry letter, which the parties have agreed to renew far the term of this new Agreement.
In furtherance thereof, the parties have agreed as follows:
In lieu of all other procedures set forth in Article G8 (Arbitration), the following procedure shall apply to grievances alleging that the Company has contracted work which would otherwise have been performed by bargaining unit employees in a RCA/FAA in which (1) layoffs of such employees are pending, (2) in which employees are on layoff with recall rights and are available to do the work which has been contracted.
(a)	Within thirty (30) days of the denial of the Union's grievance at the third step, the Union's T3 Council may request, in writing, that the grievance be submitted to a neutral third party, selected from a list of neutrals previously agreed upon by the parties.
53
Article G23
(b)	The parties shall schedule a meeting with the neutral third party within thirty (30) days of the Union's appeal. At a meeting with the neutral, the Union shall have the opportunity to explain why it believes that the contracting at issue either currently and directly caused layoffs or parttiming of employees in circumstances set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Article or whether, in circumstances addressed by the Williams/Barry letter, the Company had no other reasonable alternative but to contract the work in dispute. The Company shall then have the opportunity to respond.
(c)	Except as agreed upon by the parties, the meeting shall be informal. Normally, witnesses shall not be called. No transcript shall be made. The neutral shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days of the meeting on the form attached and both parties hereto agree to be bound by the neutral's decision. No other decision or opinion shall issue, and the decision of the neutral shall not be used or cited as precedent in any future cases.

JHCC Responsibilities
The JHCC is responsible for assuring successful implementation and continued operation of a quality health care program for current bargaining unit members.
The JHCC will be a forum for addressing and resolving issues involved in the implementation and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the managed cared programs of the Medical Plan. To accomplish these objectives the JHCC will:
■ review and comment on bid specifications for the Managed Care Programs of the Medical Plan, provide input on who should be invited to bid, meet with various vendors as they make clarifying presentations on their programs and capabilities, attend briefings on the outcome of the bid analysis, and make recommendations on the selection of the carrier to senior management.

Calculation of Required Retired Employee Contribution
For purposes of determining whether the average projected costs of the Plan for the six types of coverage (i.e., individual, two-person or family, pre or post age 65) will exceed the applicable Company contribution limit for the next succeeding calendar year and if so, determining the amount of the required applicable retired employee contribution, Avaya will annually:
1.	Determine the actual aggregate cost of all incurred claims (including the cost of administration) for the second preceding calendar year prior to the year for which premiums are being set for (1) retired employees with individual coverage under 65; (2) retired employees with two-person coverage under 65; (3) retired employees with family coverage under 65; (4) retired employees 65 and over with individual coverage; (5) retired employees 65 and over with two-person coverage; and (6) retired employees 65 and over with family coverage.
137
National Memorandum
2.	Based upon such actual aggregate costs, determine the average cost (including dependent costs) for such year per retired employee in each group,
3.	Adjust the six average amounts determined in item 2 by an amount to be determined by the Special Research Group, as described below.
4,	Calculate the difference between the amounts determined tn item 3 and the applicable Company contribution limits and subtract the average claim for each group from the applicable cap for the group, and determine whether the cap has been exceeded. If no cap for any group has been exceeded, then no retiree contributions are required. If one or more caps are exceeded then all caps are aggregated, on a weighted basis. If the result is a positive number, then retiree premiums are due from each group that has exceeded the caps. If the result is a negative number then retiree premiums are not due from any group.
Medical and Dental Inflation and Projected Costs
The determination of medical and dental inflation and projected costs used to calculate any required retiree contributions as described above in item 2 shall be made by a Special Research Group whose members shall include expert representatives from the Company and no more than two expert representatives from each union.
Adjustment to Retired Employee Contribution
Subsequent to each year, Avaya shall compare the aggregate costs for actual incurred claims (plus administrative expenses) for such year to the aggregate of the sum of all Company and retiree contributions, for retirees under age 65 and retirees age 65 and over, respectively.
For each of such two groups of retirees, the Company shall determine whether there has been a surplus or deficit and the amount of such for each year, If there has been a surplus in the amount of prior retiree contributions, the amount of such surplus will be used to offset any future retiree contributions. If there has been a deficit in the amount of prior retiree contributions, the amount of such deficit will be applied to increase any future required retiree contributions.
138
National Memorandum
COVERAGE FOR OTHER COVERED CHARGES (OCC) UNDER TRADITIONAL INDEMNITY OPTION
The Retiree Medical Plan shall be amended, effective January 1, 2004, to provide an opportunity for Traditional Indemnity Option participants to elect to purchase or increase OCC coverage as follows:

ATTACHMENT A
THE ALLIANCE FOR EMPLOYEE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
1 Avaya Inc. and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) mutually acknowledge their pride in the talents, abilities, creativity and commitment of Avaya's work force. The parties share a vision of the work environment in which all employees are encouraged to develop their skills, abilities and talents to the fullest extent possible and are furnished every opportunity to take the initiative to do so. Such an environment will not only offer the maximum opportunity to employees to attain their employment goals, but will also lead to increased commitment by employees to devote their maximum energies to improving Avaya's productivity and competitiveness. It is anticipated that this level of employee commitment will contribute significantly to marketplace success for Avaya and to the increased employment security for employees associated with such success.
(a)	To help achieve this vision, a separate and distinct jointly administered entity, known as the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development (the Alliance), will continue to operate as a not-for-profit corporation. The mission of the Alliance is to make available learning experiences to employees which will enhance their represented and work group skills; provide opportunities for personal and career development; stimulate and sustain their contributions to Avaya's success through improved communication skills, motivation, improved work habits and enhanced interpersonal skills; familiarize them with state-of-the-art technology, based on the present or anticipated needs of the business; and increase the probability that if they face displacement or dislocation, they will find alternative employment, either in Avaya or in the outside job market.
(b)	The Alliance focuses on both Personal/Career Development and Job Displacement Training curricula. It is envisioned that the Alliance will generally arrange and/or underwrite these curricula by contracting with accredited outside parties for delivery. In some cases, it may provide the curricula directly.
(c)	It is understood that the Alliance is not intended to replace Avaya’s existing job-specific training, nor does it limit the right of the parties to provide educational and training programs on the same, similar or other subjects as they may deem appropriate.
(d)	The Grievance and Arbitration procedures of this Agreement have no application to, or jurisdiction over, any matter relating to the Alliance.
154

From that information and other resources, the Alliance will recommend, arrange and/or underwrite training that will assist those employees who occupy jobs in which a decline is anticipated, or who may be displaced due to force surplus, to acquire new skills. The training will be designed to increase the probability that these employees will be in a position to compete successfully for new positions within Avaya, or to find alternative employment outside of Avaya.
(a) Where appropriate, successful completion of Personal/Career Development or Job Displacement curricula which are relevant to a job will be considered by Avaya when selecting employees for job opportunities.
Curricula Development, Implementation and Delivery
4	In identifying areas on which Alliance activities should focus, the Alliance will consult with Avaya and CWA officials, as well as with professionals in such fields as higher education, industrial psychology and vocational training. In addition, the Alliance will confer with, advise and offer professional and financial assistance to local training/retraining committees, in such areas as:
(a)	identifying educational, training and retraining needs, as well as the resources available to meet those needs
(b)	developing programs designed to meet identified employee needs
(c)	publicizing and encouraging employee participation in Alliance activities
(d)	undertaking to review, evaluate, and make recommendations on proposals for the use of Alliance funds by the local training/retraining committees

The Alliance will continue to underwrite any activity that a participant commences within that period, provided that the Alliance initially committed to underwrite it.
(a) Participation in either the Personal/Career Development or the Job Displacement curricula is voluntary and will be made available at convenient times and locations, such as after hours at the work site, local community colleges, or CWA offices. Time spent by participants in
' Alliance activities will be outside scheduled working hours, and not paid or considered as time worked. In selected instances, Avaya, at its discretion, may permit active employees to receive such training during working hours.

Re:	Tuition Assistance
The Company and the Unions agree that tuition assistance to represented employees is an integral and important aspect of the overall Avaya Inc. employee developmental process.

Negotiations shall then take place if requested by the Union. In the event of such negotiations, the changes proposed by the Company shall not be implemented until (a) agreement is reached, or (b) the Company determines that timely action is required by law, regulation, order, determination or ruling whichever occurs sooner.
In all other cases, the Company agrees that it will not make any changes in the Tuition Assistance Plan which would reduce or diminish the benefits or privileges provided by such Plan for employees represented by the Unions without negotiating such changes with the Unions.

EXTENDED COMPENSATION PARTICIPANT IN ALLIANCE OR ETOP
June 1,2003
Mr. R, V. Maly, Vice President, CWA
Mr, D. Slaman, Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Re: Extended Compensation Participant in Alliance or ETOP
This is to confirm our mutual understanding that an eligible represented employee who has chosen to participate in the Extended Compensation Option of the Avaya Career Transition Option Program and is available for temporary assignments through the Avaya Job Match Center, and who is also a participant in an Alliance and/or ETOP training program, may reject a Job Match Center temporary assignment if that assignment conflicts with a verified Alliance or ETOP training program in which the employee is participating at the time.
It is also the Company's intent to develop administrative practices for the Avaya Job Match Center that foster a reasonable approach to unanticipated personal situations beyond the control of the employee which result in the declination of a Job Match Center temporary assignment. Sincerely,

EMPLOYEE RESOURCE CENTERS
Purpose
1 Avaya, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, System Council T-3 (IBEW SC T-3) continue to recognize that, where practicable, the provision of certain services associated with employee training, career development, and various personnel and benefit programs should be made more readily available to employees.

(b)	Each Employee Resource Center will continue to represent strong physical evidence of the joint concern that Avaya and the Unions have for employees and their welfare, which is manifested by a shared commitment of the parties to jointly administer and staff the Centers.
(c)	Each Center will continue to augment services already provided by Avaya and serve as a means to centralize those information and service resources which most personally affect employees. The role of the Center is to assist employees in making decisions about future training and career plans, interfacing with various personnel programs and providing assistance and referral for employee benefit issues.
Services
2 The Employee Resource Center will continue to provide services to employees which include the following:
*	education and training
‘ • career and personal counseling;

It is not intended that such services be duplicated but rather that the Center will centralize and focus the services to facilitate access by employees.
187
National Memorandum
(b)	Employees interested in visiting the Employee Resource Center will, upon request, normally be granted reasonable time off with pay during their SCHEDULED DAILY TOUR to visit the Center.

This title shall be used in all references to this operation at the location and shall be prominently displayed at the entrance to the Employee Resource Center facility.
Staffing
3	Each Employee Resource Center will continue to be staffed by a mutually agreed upon number of UNION appointees. The selection of Employee Resource Center personnel is a Union responsibility
(a) Represented employees appointed to work in the Center will retain the Job Classification and wages they were receiving immediately prior to the assignment. For those coordinators within the Operations Job Classification who are assigned to the ATP/Operations ERC Coordinator title, the pay will be $62,400 (GWI will apply) and a pension band of 126 for the time in which they remain in the ATP/Operations ERC Coordinator title.
(1)	If such an employee subsequently accepts a promotion to another .	Job Classification within the bargaining unit, he or she may be
retained on the Employee Resource Center assignment. In such case, the employee will be assigned the Job Classification and wages which would have been applicable on the Job Classification to which promoted.
(2)	For movement of personnel purposes, such employees shall be exempt from displacement by surplus employees outside the Employee Resource Center but shall be subject to LAYOFF in accordance with the contract as a result of a lack of work situation in the bargaining unit.
(3)	In those instances where the employee would otherwise have '	been displaced, he or she shall be assigned the Job Classification
and wages which would have been applicable as a result of such displacement.

National Memorandum
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between CWA, IBEW and Avaya Inc. addresses Union organizing and consent elections in those job titles and occupations in Avaya organizations that are not covered by the 1986 Union-Management Relations Agreement, separately attached hereto.
The Unions and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to operate in the spirit of partnership and common vision. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development.
The parties also recognize the Unions' goal of growing membership. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election wiil be applicable to all wholly owned Avaya Business Operating Groups and Divisions throughout the country and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize non-management employees in the covered Avaya Business Operating Groups or Divisions.
1	Employee Choice
Both the Unions'and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a Union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a Union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management and local Union officials, i.e., those directly impacted by these discussions. The local Union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate Union and Company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
2	Neutrality
The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by Company conduct that neither helps nor hinders organizing efforts. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. The environment is intended to foster employee choice and information communicated by either party should be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
197
National Memorandum
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should vote against Union representation.
(c)	The Unjon(s) will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to communicate with employees.
(d)	Management may respond to individual employee questions, and may correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a "third party" or "outsider".	.
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be simultaneously shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire or seek the assistance of consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked, by name or by descriptive reference, in campaign literature or discussions.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct "captive" audience meetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3	Electron Procedures
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show that a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining have signed show of interest cards indicating their desire for a representation election. The cards must be dated within three months of the date they are presented to the Third Party Neutral (TPN). Cards signed by persons who are no longer employed by Avaya at the time of submission to the TPN will not be valid.
(b)	If an election is conducted and the Union is not successful, another election wilt not be scheduled for twelve months. During this time, no Union organizing campaign for that unit will be permitted.
(c)	A majority of those who vote, validated by the TPN, will determine the outcome.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots by following the NLRB's rules and decisions.
198
National Memorandum
4	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90 day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed 120 days. If the employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local union from having contact with the workers in the group outside of the workplace. If the employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and any resulting collective bargaining agreement will apply only to the agreed upon unit.
5	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact'based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including any obligations and responsibilities of the parties
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or any employee misunderstandings of information disseminated during the campaign process.
6	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other persons or entities during any part of this process. One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process called “Consent Election'. This process will work as follows:
199
National Memorandum
(a)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a third party neutral (TPN) proof of support by means of show of interest cards as described in Paragraph 3(a), above. The TPN will then notify Avaya and request a list of names, job titles and work addresses. The Company will furnish the list within three business days. The applicable Union will also be furnished with the list. The "show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union (s) has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(b)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role it is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two (2) weeks of the submission of the Union's show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their . individual preference in a secret ballot election. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with Paragraph 3(c) of this agreement, a majority of those who vote will control. Each party may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(c)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases in which there is no dispute about the composition of the . unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of the TPN and/or of using a neutral site will be shared equally by the parties.	.
if there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit, the TPN shall either decide the issue within an additional seven days or order an election as described above with the decision as to the composition of the unit to follow the election within no more than seven days.
7	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union(s) for access, local management and Union representatives will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by Union representatives. The Union(s) will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Avaya facilities. It is the intent and commitment of the parties that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Avaya generally and, specifically, the unit which is the subject of the organizing campaign. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times.
If Avaya and the Union(s) are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other Avaya units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Avaya and the Union(s) commit that they will negotiate an access agreement in an expeditious manner.
200
National Memorandum
8	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-rfepresented employees wiil, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, local Avaya management and appropriate Union representatives. It is the intent and desire of Avaya and the Union(s) that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between ’ the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. The TPN must be an active or retired attorney who has experience in, and is familiar with, NLRB procedures and precedents regarding unit determination issues. Either Avaya or the Union(s) can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three business days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all reievant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and an expeditious hearing shall be conducted. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
201
National Memorandum
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a Full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no exparte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Avaya and the Unions believe that these matters are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Avaya and the Union(s) agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses resulting from the use of the TPN process shall be shared equally by Avaya and the Union.
9	Acquisitions And Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications equipment industry. Avaya may acquire another entity, it has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in these entities may be unrepresented, represented in whole or in part by the CWA or IBEW, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement. Nevertheless, Avaya will, after an initial transition period of one year following the closing on an acquisition, and subject to any contrary legal or contractual requirements, apply this Neutrality and Consent Election agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary.
10	Annual Review
On an annual basis, the Avaya Vice President of Labor Relations, the President of the CWA and the President of the IBEW may review whether there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and, if the parties find repeated instances of violations or repeated instances of interference during the period up to the review, may implement a process for recognition based on "card check" to replace elections in all cases or, if not, this Agreement shall continue in effect for the remaining term of the Agreement.

When the Union represents that a majority of such employees have signed authorization cards designating the Union as their exclusive bargaining agent in an appropriate unit, the Company will recognize the Union as the bargaining agent of such employees without an NLRB-supervised election, provided the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)	The Company and the Union have mutually agreed that the bargaining unit in which the Union seeks recognition is an appropriate bargaining unit; and
(b)	The Company and Union have mutually agreed upon the number and identity of the employees eligible for representation in such a unit; and

(d)	The Union’s majority status in the agreed-upon bargaining unit is confirmed by the mutually selected third party.
If the Company and Union fail to agree upon either of the conditions set forth in Paragraphs (a) and (b), above, the matter may be referred to the NLRB for determination.

The Company further agrees to notify the Unions if it enters into a contract with the DOD which includes the “Drug-Free Work Force" clause currently prescribed by DOD regulations or has positions which are subject to regulations under the DOT, and to submit in written form its proposal regarding any testing program. Upon such notification, the Unions agree to enter into negotiations concerning the program. Should agreement not be reached within thirty days from such date of notification, the Company may implement the program only to the extent I necessary to meet the requirements of the Drug-Free Work Force clause and applicable DOD/DOT regulations.

STANDING JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON TESTING
June 1,2003
Mr. R. V. Maly, Vice President, CWA
Mr. D. Slaman, Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Re: Standing Joint Subcommittee on Testing
This will confirm our understanding reached during 2003 Bargaining that a CWA-IBEW-Avaya standing joint subcommittee on testing will be formed. The subcommittee, to be appointed by the bargaining chairs, will consist of two (2) representatives from the Unions, one (1) from IBEW and one (1) from CWA, and two (2) representatives from the Company.
Measurement and Selection Systems (M&SS), part of Avaya’s Labor Relations organization, is the organization with sole responsibility for the development or selection, validation, and authorization of all tests and policy and procedures used in the selection of candidates for Avaya represented positions. M&SS is responsible to ensure that such tests meet Federal and professional standards for relevance and non-discrimination.
If the committee identifies a test currently in use which has not been authorized by M&SS, the test will be suspended pending the outcome of a review and report to the committee by M&SS.
At least thirty days prior to implementation, M&SS will notify the members of the committee of the intent to implement a new test or to revise a test or critical test score. M&SS will communicate to members of the committee the following pertinent information concerning the test:
the purpose
the objective
the need for the test or change
the title(s) for which it will be a requirement
the business groups which will use it
After receiving the information described above, if the committee so requests, a meeting will be held to explore appropriate ways for the Company and the Unions to make available opportunities to assist employees in development of the new skills or job knowledge. The committee will also be expected to identify and recommend ways to maximize the many advantages and resources offered through the Alliance, ETOP, and ERC’s in meeting the goals described above.
211
National Memorandum
In addition, the committee may explore other issues with M&SS, including such matters as an apparent low percentage of employees qualifying on a specific test. Where the Committee agrees, a Third Party Neutral (TPN) may be selected to review any disputed new or revised test for relevancy and validity, applying appropriate legal standards. The TPN shall guarantee confidentiality of all tests under review and shall not release test items or scores to any person or entity. The TPN shall make recommendations to the Committee about the disputed test or score. Nothing herein shall prevent the implementation or use of a test during the TPN review.
The committee will meet upon request of the members, but no Jess than four (4) times a year to review new or revised tests.

EXTENSION OF NEW CATEGORIES AND TITLES FOR FLEXIBLE WORKFORCE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, AS AMENDED
June 1, 2003	•
Mr. R. V. Maly, Vice President, CWA
Mr. D. Slaman, Chairman System Council - T3, IBEW
Re: Extension of New Categories and Titles for Flexible Workforce Memorandum of Understanding, as amended.
INTRODUCTION
During negotiations for the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding, Avaya Inc. (“Avaya") and the Unions agreed that the respective agreements between Avaya and the IBEW and CWA, each entitled “New Categories and Titles for Flexible Workforce Memorandum of Understanding," effective September 30, 2000, as amended by the “Amendment to New Categories and Titles for Flexible Workforce Memorandum of Understanding," effective November 4, 2001 (referred to herein collectively as the “MOU"), requires further modification. While the MOU has proven effective to an extent, Avaya and the Unions agree that it requires modifications to increase its effectiveness and provide greater cost and expense flexibility in the manner in which it is implemented. Accordingly, the parties agree to amend the MOU as set forth herein (referred to herein as “MOU Extension"). To the extent that a provision in this MOU Extension conflicts with a provision in the MOU, the provisions of this MOU Extension shall govern.
DURATION
The duration of the MOU, as amended by the MOU Extension, is for a period of 18 months, commencing June 1, 2003, and concluding in its entirety effective December 1, 2004.
WATERMARK
The new watermark for the duration of the MOU, as amended by the MOU Extension, shall be the number of total core CWA and IBEW CSE’s, Software Associates, Senior Software Associates and Senior Technicians on the active payroll after completion of subscription for the 2003 Voluntary Pension Enhancement has concluded, minus fifty (50).
216
National Memorandum
ACTIVATION OF MOU IN GCA’S / RCA’S
To increase the cost effectiveness of the MOU, the parties agreed that it is advisable to utilize Support Customer Systems Engineers (“SCSE"), Support Customer Systems Engineers - Journeyman (“SCSE-J") or Support Software Associates (“SSA") (collectively sometimes referred to as “Variable Work Force [“VWF"] employees"), as the case may be, only in Geographic Commuting Areas ("GCA’s") or Reasonable Commuting Areas ("RCA's") which have work volumes sufficient to justify their use. As a result, the parties agree that there may be GCA’s ! RCA’s where the MOU shall remain in effect but inactive on a quarterly basis. This concept was referred to in our bargaining as the "Opt In / Opt Out” feature. The parties further agree that if Avaya determines that there is insufficient work volumes to justify activation of VWF employees in one or numerous individual GCA's I RCA's, Avaya will so notify the appropriate Union. The two parties will in good faith, considering the need for cost effectiveness and flexibility, discuss this decision and reach an understanding, by mutual agreement, on whether to de-activate the VWF employees in such GCA’s I RCA’s. This discussion shall be promptly held, understanding that time is a critical element in deciding in which GCA’s / RCA’s the VWF employees shall be utilized. Similarly, where the VWF has been de-activated in a GCA I RCA, the parties may, by mutual consent, agree to re-activate the VWF for one or more of the following quarters.
The decision whether to activate or deactivate the VWF employees in a GCA / RCA shall be made at least two (2) weeks prior to each quarter to allow the parties to understand the needs of the business and the needs of employees for a respective quarter.
PARTIAL ACTIVATION
The parties agree that there may arise a need for limited use of VWF employees in a GCA I RCA. It is the intent of the parties that limited or unplanned work requirements beyond the capacity, of the core technicians would continue to be met by the use of VWF employees. In such situations, the parties may mutually agree to a limited activation for all or a portion of VWF employees for all or a limited period of time during a quarter in those locations where VWF employees may otherwise be deactivated. Such Partial Activation may be instituted during the quarter if work requirements so warrant. Any such Partial Activations will apply to the particular situation in a respective GCA / RCA and will be by mutual consent of the parties.
MINIMUM WEEKS OF WORK
The parties agree that VWF employees not in de-activated GCA's / RCA’s shall work and receive pay for a minimum of three (3) work weeks per quarter. VWF employees in de-activated GCA’s / RCA’s shall not be eligible for such minimum work or pay during the de-activated quarter. The minimum weeks associated with a Partial Activation, as described above, will be mutually agreed upon as part of the Partial Activation.
217
National Memorandum
RETENTION BONUS
Paragraph H(2) of the MOU shall be amended to provide that the Retention Bonus is 10%, replacing the prior 20% payment. All other provisions of paragraph H(2) remain in effect.
MOTOR VEHICLE USAGE
An employee who uses a personal vehicle for work shall be reimbursed for either, mileage at the rate of the then current Internal Revenue Service regulations governing per mile reimbursement for use of personal vehicles for business use or $15.00 per day, at the employee’s option.
WORK ASSIGNMENT AND EQUALIZATION
The provisions of paragraph G of the MOU concerning Work Assignments and Equalization shall be null and void. Employees will be assigned work based on seniority, which includes Net Credited Service from predecessor companies to Avaya,
QUARTERLY NOTIFICATION
All VWF employees must notify Avaya on a quarterly basis as to whether they will be available for work during each quarter.

During this Transition Period, any and all agreements regarding minimum weeks of work shall not apply. Further, the provisions of paragraph G of the MOU shall not apply for the Transition Period or for the duration of this MOU Extension.

CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP
Over the years, the Company and the Union have developed and maintained a mutually constructive, responsible relationship characterized by trust, respect, and cooperation. Recognizing that the best interests of the Company, the Unions, employees, managers, and shareowners depend on vigorous and total commitment to product and service quality and customer satisfaction, it is the mutual goal of the parties to ensure that their relationship continues to improve in a positive, constructive manner consistent with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and that such a relationship promotes superior quality and customer satisfaction.
The parties firmly believe that through a positive, constructive relationship they can best fulfill their respective responsibilities. These responsibilities include meeting the service and financial goals of all parties; improving employment security and corporate and business unit effectiveness and competitiveness; nurturing member and customer satisfaction; achieving continuous quality improvement; removing barriers to successful operations; and building involvement, commitment and motivation among both managers and employees. To fulfill these responsibilities the Company and the Union are committed to a relationship where information is openly exchanged; problems are solved mutually and cooperatively; critical differences are accepted and accommodated; agreements are developed in good faith; commitments are honored; and day-today contacts at every level are stable and reliable.
During recent years profound changes have had major impacts on the operations and resources of both the Company and the Union. Such changes will continue, and it is understood that jointly anticipating and responding constructively and cooperatively to change is the key to both Union and Company vitality and prosperity.
The parties recognize that integrity, trust, respect, and cooperation in their relationship depend on action at all levels, particularly at local levels. Local union officers and managers are encouraged to identify and develop new approaches to issues which are appropriate for cooperative efforts. It is expected that progress in improving constructive relationships and taking initiative on cooperative efforts will be a primary mutual objective.
To sanction and encourage the initiation, growth, and perpetuation of cooperative activities and to sponsor the continuing exchange of useful information between the parties regarding such activities, a Constructive Relationships Council consisting of six (6) members (two Company, two CWA and two IBEW) from the bargaining committee will meet three times each year.
219
National Memorandum
At each meeting at least one member of the senior leadership team of the Company’s business groups shall participate in a CRC meeting At the meeting, the business leader will review with the Union’s leadership the state of the business, technological developments and projected initiatives that are expected to take place. The Union will be provided the opportunity to suggest and recommend alternatives to the anticipated initiatives and to discuss the impact of these technological developments upon employees the Unions represent and the Company agrees to give serious consideration to the Unions' suggestions and recommendation. The discussions are not intended to preclude the Company from decision making but allow the parties the opportunity to conduct open and thorough dialogue in understanding both the Company’s business needs and the Unions’ institutional needs. The parties may agree to schedule additional meetings with individuals in business groups or organizations to discuss issues raised in the meeting.

Accordingly, on this 30th day of May, Avaya Inc. (the “Company”) and IBEW Systems Council T-3 and the CWA (the "Union") have agreed to establish a Subcontracting Subcommittee during the life of the 2003 collective bargaining agreement.
During 2003 negotiations, the Company and the Unions expressed mutual concerns over the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees represented by the Unions and their desire to retain work traditionally performed by those employees. The parties also understand the Company’s need to maintain flexibility in making business decisions involving subcontracting of work traditionally performed by represented employees and the potential that such decisions may have a detrimental effect on the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees.
In recognition of these mutual concerns, the parties agree that a process should be developed to address the issues. Thus, it is agreed that the Unions will be provided, in advance, pertinent information such as but not limited to, the economics, skills necessary to perform the work, and the impact such subcontracting may have on the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees. In addition, the Unions will be given an opportunity to discuss such matters relating to the Company’s intentions to subcontract work traditionally performed by members of the affected bargaining unit. It is further agreed that any process cannot interfere with the Company’s right to make timely decisions consistent with the overall interests of the business, including the employment security of on-rolt Avaya employees.

May 27, 1909
Mr. John Barry
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
1125 15th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005
Dear Mr. Barry:
I am writing to respond to the expressions of concern raised at the Operations bargaining table regarding the Company's contracting out of work which have focused on situations in which a layoff is pending or has occurred (and exbargaining unit members retain recall rights) within the same force adjustment area where the work is to be contracted, and in job titles whose occupants would traditionally have performed such work.
I do not believe that IBEW and AT&T have diverse views on this subject.
As to such work normally performed by our employees, we have always preferred not to contract such work out if it would otherwise be performed by bargaining unit employees in job titles in a geographical commuting area (1) where layoffs of such employees are pending; or (2) where a layoff has already occurred and such laid off bargaining unit members retain recall rights and are available to perform such work.
In the future, the Company will not contract out such work, under the conditions outlined above, except when it has no other reasonable alternative. Under such circumstances, the Company will discuss its decision with the Union.
Very truly yours,
Is/ Raymond E. Williams
230
Other Agreements
(1} SUBCONTRACTING, ANNUAL REVIEW

During this meeting, the participants shall review the nature and the amount of the contracting which has occurred in these circumstances and shall explore other means, such as rehire to regular positions, by which the need for such contracting may be reduced in the future.
(J)	SUBCONTRACTING, INFORMATION

(K)	OVERTIME ADMINISTRATION
Overtime administration should be consistent with the heeds of the business with due consideration to the desires of Bargaining Unit employees.
Our stated policy on administration of overtime, which has been communicated to the Union, is that we will attempt to equalize overtime, to the extent feasible, among qualified employees over a reasonable period of lime, generally one year. It is consistent with good Labor/Management relations that managers review with local Union representatives any necessary changes to overtime administration guidelines and be prepared to articulate conditions that demand such changes.
(L)	MOTOR VEHICLE USAGE PLAN
The parties recognize that it may be in their mutual interest to negotiate new terms and conditions relating to the administration of the Motor Vehicle Usage Plan (MVUP). Accordingly, the Company and the Union agree that should the Company or the Union seek to negotiate new local plans during the life of the 2003 Agreement, the initiating party shall notify the other party in writing of its desire to open negotiations. Negotiations shall take place within ninety (90) days of such notice. Thereafter, the Company and the Union shall work together to design and negotiate a plan that meets the needs of the Company and the employees. Should the parties reach agreement, the new MVUP shall be implemented upon a mutually agreed upon date.

As we discussed, local agreements that violate the provisions of the Agreement will be null and void immediately upon the effective date of the Agreement. Other local agreements will continue in effect, unless and until either party gives forty-five (45) days written notice of their termination. During that forty-five (45) day period, either party may initiate negotiations pursuant to Article 2 (Collective Bargaining), Paragraph 2. of the 2003 Agreement. If no agreement is reached during that forty-five (45) day period, the local agreement will no longer be effective and binding upon either the Company or the Union.
