COPS Guiding Principles
Alaska Airlines’ COPS employees have earned a decades-long reputation for distinctive, industry-leading customer service. In order for us to continue to outpace our competition in this rapidly changing industry, we must strive everyday to provide a safe and reliable operation as well as a great experience for our passengers. We recognize that having our COPS employees enthusiastically engaged is critical for our future success.
The IAMAW and Alaska Airlines management recognize that an effective partnership, based on mutual respect and trust, will improve the long term profitability and competitiveness of Alaska Airlines and is beneficial to the COPS group. In order to take full advantage of all opportunities, labor and management must embrace collaboration as the means to build an innovative and effective team- a team fully focused on the future.
Alaska Airlines COPS employees should be well compensated and enjoy a high standard of living and job security. In order to make our career a continued success in this intensely competitive industry, we all must be committed to constantly making our business stronger and more successful.
Our mission is to be universally recognized as a high-performance company with a high performance culture. Leadership, employee relations, work rules and incentives should reflect this objective, and it will take the dedicated and unified efforts of leaders for both the company and the IAMAW to make this goal a reality.
Management recognizes that the IAMAW is the elected representative for the COPS employee group and we do want to work together to grow the company and improve the livelihoods of our COPS employees.
Neither party, through these principles, relinquishes any rights protected by law or the agreement.

ARTICLE 2,	RECOGNITION AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
A.	In accordance with the National Mediation Board certification in Case No. R-4416 dated March 8, 1974, the Company recognizes the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of Alaska Airlines, Incorporated, composing the class and craft as covered under this Agreement.
B.	The Company agrees that the work set forth in the Classifications in Article 4 of this Agreement, normally performed by employees in those Classifications, within the Company's airline operations in the U.S.A, and its possessions, comes within the jurisdiction of the IAMAW and is covered by the provisions of this Agreement.
C.	Except as provided in Article 4.E. and Letter of Agreement No. 3, // management and other employees will not perform work in the classifications as set forth in Article 4.
D.	The Company may continue to subcontract out work which has heretofore been customarily contracted out. It is the Company's intent to utilize its own facilities and equipment in performing work in its own organization where it is economically feasible because of the existence of the equipment, facilities and technology. However, the Company may subcontract out any work for which the Company's cost exceeds the charge of a vendor. Each twelve (12) months during the term of this Agreement, the Union may request a meeting with the Company, in writing through Labor Relations, for the purpose of reviewing the status of all stations wherein the classifications covered by this agreement are not utilized. Other work, not previously subcontracted and/or cost effective for the Company to perform, which is included in the classifications under the Agreement, shall not be subcontracted without the mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
E.	Employees covered by this Agreement shall be governed by the Company's General Policy and Operating Manuals, and the System Regulation and Customer Service Manuals and by all other applicable rules, regulations and orders issued by properly designated authorities of the Company which are not in conflict with the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to modify these manuals, policies and System Regulations during the term of the Agreement. A copy of the Company's manuals,

Upon review and approval by local management, such training may include one-on-one individual training.
G.	1. In the event of the introduction of “new equipment or technology” that will be used by employees in this bargaining unit and will directly affect the employees performance or process in functioning in his/her position, the Company and the IAM President/Directing General Chair or his/her designee will meet at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the scheduled implementation date for the “new technology”.

2.	The distribution of voluntary overtime by Company seniority shall not be required if it results in pay in excess of the one and one-half (1-1/2) rate. To prevent the double time (2X) rate, seniority may be bypassed, unless the only volunteers are at the double time (2X) rate. This provision shall not apply to overtime assigned by inverse seniority when there are no volunteers as set forth in "I" below.
G.	Overtime work at the end of the shift shall be offered to those volunteering in the classification on that shift or to the individual performing the actual work during the shift, if it is impractical to break the continuity of work.

In the event none can be contacted, any qualified employee who is on the volunteer list may be offered the work.
H.	When the Company is aware of a requirement for overtime two or more hours before the end of a shift, employees will be given at least two (2) hours notice of the contemplated overtime.
I.	1. An employee will not be required to work overtime against his/her wishes, except that, if emergency overtime has been declined by all eligible employees at the location, it may be assigned in inverse order (junior assignment) of Company seniority within the appropriate classification to qualified employees. In the event an employee is required to work overtime against his/her wishes, the Company will provide him/her the reason for such requirement, in writing, should the employee so request. When junior assigning for overtime, it shall be limited so that the employee so assigned will not be required to work overtime against his/her wishes for the next two (2) calendar days if another employee is available as set forth in F. above. The two (2) calendar day period begins at the end of the junior assignment. If overtime is needed during the aforementioned two (2) calendar days, the next senior employee will be assigned the overtime. No employee shall work more than fourteen (14) hours in a single work day, except in regards to the following scenarios; catastrophic situation, natural disaster, extremely severe weather 31

condition (i.e., snow storms in cities like SEA, extended fog, etc.) and critical community support.
2.	Prior to junior assigning as stated above, an employee may choose to volunteer for overtime during the identified needed time period, in lieu of being junior assigned. If the employee exercises this option, and the employee is assigned overtime, he will not be required to work overtime against his/her wishes for the next two (2) calendar days, if another employee is available as set forth in F. above.
3.	For the purpose of this paragraph, an emergency shall be defined as follows:
a.	Unforeseen peak work loads where it is impractical to alter the schedules and no solution other than overtime is feasible.
b.	Unanticipated absence or the illness of an employee(s) resulting in a work force unable to provide adequate service.
c.	The servicing of late flights and maintaining of flight schedules when all other means of overtime coverage have been exhausted.
d.	Protection of Company property against the weather.
e.	Insufficient volunteers for overtime.
4.	a. In the event an employee has exceeded his/her normal scheduled work week by ten (10) hours, any additional mandatory hours over the ten (10) hours will be paid at the double time (2x) rate of pay. Trade hours worked will not apply in this calculation.
b. The provisions of 4.a. above will not apply to situations where the mandatory overtime hours worked are the result of the following scenarios; catastrophic situation, natural disaster, extremely severe weather conditions (i.e. snow storms in cities like SEA, extended fog. Etc.) and critical community support.

J.	1. When an employee's days off are changed by direction of the Company and as a result, he works more than five (5) consecutive days, he will receive the applicable overtime rate for the additional days. When his/her days off are changed as a result of the employee's voluntary action, including bid schedule changes, the additional days worked will be paid at the straight time rate.
2.	When it is evident an employee will lose pay as the result of a bid schedule change which occurs between pay periods, the Company will allow such employee to work additional hours at the straight time rate within the affected pay period to preclude such loss. The Company may allow an employee who would receive more than eighty (80) scheduled hours in the pay period time off so that the employee does not exceed the eighty (80) regular hours. Such day(s) off or additional days of work will be determined by the manager, and every reasonable effort will be made to schedule them in a mutually agreeable but efficient manner. Requests for time off or extra days of work must be made within forty-eight (48) hours after the new schedule assignments are posted.
K.	1. When an employee covered by this Agreement has been relieved for the day and is recalled to work, he will be paid not less than four (4) hours pay at the applicable overtime rate, unless the employee agrees to work less than four (4) hours.
2. When an employee covered by this Agreement works on one of his/her regularly scheduled days off, he will be paid not less than four (4) hours pay at the overtime rate applicable, unless the employee elects to work less than four (4) hours.

ARTICLE 9,	SENIORITY
A.	Seniority under this Agreement shall be defined as length of service with the Company since the last date of hire and shall be by work classification and shall accrue from the date of entering said classification on a regular assignment, subject to Paragraph B.
B.	1. New employees working full time shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first one thousand forty (1,040) hours worked, (including trades worked) performing job duties as defined in Article 4. New employees working part time shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first seven hundred eighty (780) hours worked (including trades worked) performing job duties as defined in Article 4. After successful completion of the probationary period, the names of such employees shall then be placed on the Seniority List for their respective classification in order of the date of their original hiring. The probationary period affords the Company the opportunity to evaluate the employee’s qualifications and ability to perform the duties assigned. Articles 16 of this Agreement shall not apply to new employees terminated during their probationary period. Probation will begin subsequent to successful completion of required formal training. Minimum requirements for passing probation will include successful completion of required formal training (classroom training and/or testing). If a formal training class is not provided, on-the-job training, will be provided. All hours worked during on-the-job training will be applied toward the probationary period
2. Hours counted toward the time required to complete the probationary period shall be measured from the employee's last date of hire; provided, however, that employees whose employment is terminated for involuntary, non-disciplinary reasons prior to completing the probationary period and who are later re-employed by the Company in the same classification shall receive credit for hours worked during the prior period(s) of employment, provided no more than three hundred sixty-five (365) days has elapsed from any date of termination to the next following date of reemployment. An employee who completes his/her probationary period by virtue of this paragraph shall have an adjusted classification seniority date which is adjusted by the amount of hours away from the Company, (see Article 9.A. above)

ARTICLE 10,	VACANCIES
A.	Furloughs
1.	When it is necessary for the Company to reduce the work force at a station, it will reduce the employees in that classification at the bid location with the least seniority. Upon notification of furlough, the affected employee will be scheduled to meet with the Manager or designee and a Union Representative. S/he will discuss their options due to furlough and assist them in completing the required preference bid forms. The furloughed employee must // complete the Company Option Sheet indicating the position they were furloughed from and their status at time of furlough from either part-time or full-time. Employees // will also be required to file a preference bid for all classifications in which they hold seniority that are currently active at that station. Employees may file additional preference bids as described in Paragraph G in this article, within the COPS work group in any bid location they desire to fill. Notwithstanding Art 10.G.7., furloughed employees will not be reguired to renew such preference bids annually. The bids will remain on file until either an award is made, it is withdrawn by the employee, or their name is stricken from the seniority list at the end of the recall period per Art 9.F.6.
Example:
•	Manaoer/designee and Union Representative meet to discuss possible alternatives to furlough(s), and options available to affected emplovee(s).
•	Manaoer/designee and Union Representative schedule meeting(s) with affected emplovee(s). (If possible, in inverse seniority order)
•	Manaoer/designee and Union Representative meet with affected emplovee(s) a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to effective date of furlough(s).
•	Issue written furlough notice to affected employee.
•	Explain available options to affected employee.
•	Review company option sheet.
•	Review preference bid form(s).
•	Explain timeline for completing and returning form(s).
•	Seven calendar days after meeting with Manager/designee
and Union Representative, affected employee will return forms, or their name will be stricken from all seniority lists.

When an employee has exercised his/her seniority in A.2. and 3. above or was displaced from a work schedule as a result of furlough, bumping, returning from a temporary assignment or return from leave of absence, or either voluntarily or involuntarily returning to their former classification prior to passing probation, they will be allowed to exercise their seniority by selecting a shift that their seniority would entitle them to. As a result of this selection the local management may either conduct a new shift bid among the employees junior to the displaced employee or they can allow the displaced employee to work a schedule that mirrors an existing work schedule on the bid. This option will be solely at the discretion of the local manager.

A.	All employees subject to this Agreement shall become members of the Union within sixty (60) days after date of employment and shall thereafter maintain such membership in good standing as a condition of employment. The employer will, within seven (7) working days after receipt of notice from the Union, give any employee a discharge notice who is not in good standing in the Union as required by this provision.
B.	All new employees will meet with Union representative(s) for the purpose of union orientation.

Such assignment shall specify the amount of the initiation fees, dues and assessments, and shall provide that the amount of such deduction for membership dues or assessments will be subject to change upon receipt by the Company of a written certification by the President/General Chair of the District Lodge that such initiation fees, dues, or assessments, have been duly changed and specifying the amount thereof.
C.	Deductions provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be remitted to the Secretary-Treasurer, District Lodge, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers AFL-CIO no later than the end of the month in which the deductions were made.

It is further agreed that the carrier shall promptly notify the Union of any such action when and if filed and the Union shall, at its own option, defend such actions and/or settle under the circumstances above described.
F.

Chemical Dependency
LETTER #2
Chemical dependency abuse is one of the leading health problems, resulting in human tragedy and economic loss. We believe that Chemical dependence is an illness, which can be successfully treated. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will help any employee who needs and accepts treatment. To accomplish this, the Employee Assistance Program, in conjunction with the IAM and with the cooperation of the Alaska Airlines management, offers a program to diagnose and treat this disease.
YOUR JOB SECURITY WILL NOT BE JEOPARDIZED BY REQUESTING
AND/OR ACCEPTING HELP AND TREATMENT
The benefits under our Group Hospitalization and Medical Insurance Plan, as well as Alaska Airlines' Sick Leave benefits, will be provided for those employees requiring treatment for a chemical dependence problem.
The importance of this program to the afflicted individual cannot be over-emphasized. The need for his/her cooperation in responding to treatment by trained professionals also cannot be over-emphasized. Guidelines for the establishment of such a program will be agreed to between the representatives from the Union and representatives from the Company.
THE ALTERNATIVE in failing to accept help and treatment could be loss of job and, finally, life itself. Unfortunately, the problem may not be obvious to the person struggling with this terrible disease. It may be more evident to their family, friends and fellow employees. All employees must accept a responsibility in the control of this disease among their peers.
ALL INQUIRIES WILL BE HANDLED IN THE STRICTEST CONFIDENCE. Should you desire assistance, please contact your Employee Assistance Program Coordinator or the General Chair.

Dear Mr. Sandrin:
This will confirm the assurances I provided to you during these negotiations that no employee under the COPS or MRP Agreements will be laid off as a result of adding the Station Agent classification. Future Station Agent classification vacancies which are established by the Company at existing stations that previously were staffed by Customer Service Agents (CSA) will be filled by attrition if there are no incumbent qualified volunteers unless new positions are added. Additionally, no current CSA will be required to lose their job if physically unable to perform the requirements of the Station Agent classification. Also, no CSA will be forced to become a Station Agent.
Sincerely,
s/ Nick McCudden

Holiday Helpers
Letter #13
This will confirm our discussions during the course of Alaska COPS negotiations in 2013 regarding the use of non-represented (management) employees during the Holiday Season (“Holiday Helpers”).
Prior to the Company utilizing Holiday Helpers, and with as much advanced notice as feasible, the Vice President of Labor and/or the Vice President of the responsible division(s) will notify the appropriate General Chair of Air Transport District 142. The notification will include the level of support staff that will be utilized, the approximate duration of that support, and the nature of the support.
After the notification, the Manager of the Station that will be utilizing Holiday Helpers and the Station’s Shop Steward(s) will meet to discuss the proposed program and use.
This Memorandum of Understanding is intended to end the miscommunication that has surrounded the use of Holiday Helpers. In no way does this letter waive the Union’s right to seek remedy through the grievance procedure if an agreement of the usage of Holiday Helpers is not reached, nor does this letter waive the Company’s belief that non-represented management employees may assist during certain peak times. This letter is not meant to supersede either the Company’s or the Union’s rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
If there is agreement to this letter, please indicate by signing below and returning to me.

Staffing Adjustment
Letter #16
Dear Mr. Butler:
This will confirm our discussions regarding the use of earned vacation time as (HAT) in conjunction with an agent being awarded Staffing Adjust (commonly referred to as “SA,” or Day of LOA) -which is unpaid leave time awarded on a scheduled working day. Staffing Adjustment will be awarded by seniority within the classification in a bid location in accordance with COPS Article 12.F., and RSSA Article 11 .E..
When an agent has been awarded Staffing Adjust for a day or portion of a day, it will be the individual agent’s discretion to utilize any earned vacation time for the like time that has been awarded off. The time will be considered to be unpaid unless the employee indicates at the time of the award that they prefer to utilize HAT pay. Seniority will not be bypassed in favor of awarding an agent time off that wishes to forego pay; likewise, seniority will not be bypassed in favor of awarding an agent time off that wishes to utilize earned vacation. Time off will be awarded strictly based on seniority. However, once an agent has made their determination to utilize earned vacation, or take the awarded leave unpaid, and the time off has been awarded, the agent may not switch their pay status (from paid to unpaid, and from unpaid to paid).
Please indicate your agreement to this letter by countersigning and returning to me at your earliest convenience.

FOR
CLERICAL, OFFICE AND PASSENGER SERVICE EMPLOYEES
Health Care and Wellness
The Company and the Union will work jointly in quarterly meetings to learn more about the challenges of providing a benefits plan that can adapt with the market, fostering and encouraging quality care and good outcomes at costs affordable to the Company and to our employees.
The Company will develop and share medical plan claims data, at a level that is compliant with privacy requirements, on a regular basis to increase the awareness of trends and of the costs of our plan, and explore specific recommendations to reduce or minimize the impact of escalating health care claims costs.
We will share a willingness to explore, and if mutually agreed, test new plan designs and new tools which will help incentivize informed and thoughtful consumer behavior in our members’ choice of medical providers and discretionary treatments as well as encourage informed dialog with providers. These tools should promote and incentivize wellness programs to maintain and improve the health of all of our members and work to reduce wasteful medical treatments and procedures.
We share a commitment to work together during the term of the Agreement to implement agreed upon wellness programs and incentives, cost containment and “value based” benefits with applicable incentives and other mutually agreed affordable health care programs with demonstrated good outcomes, with flexibility on the part of both parties to remove, with mutual agreement, any contractual barriers which might otherwise impede a successful enhancement of such programs.

the company will credit 50% of the monthly premium for the retiree's (and eligible dependents') health care coverage until that "bank" is exhausted, or until the retiree (or eligible dependents) are no longer eligible for retiree health care, whichever comes first. If the 50% sick leave "bank" is exhausted prior to the retiree (or eligible dependents) reaching Medicare eligibility, the retiree may continue retiree medical coverage until he or she is no longer eligible by paying the full monthly premium.
2.	An employee retiring directly from active service at age 55 or older who has ten (10) years of vesting service or twenty (20) years of Company service will be paid a lump sum equal to the Employee’s current rate of pay multiplied by the sum of the Employee’s accrued sick leave balance multiplied by 25%.
3.	All other provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement remain in full force and effect. The parties understand and agree that the provisions of this Side letter of Agreement will terminate on the dates stated herein, and will not be applied to any future agreements.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed this Memorandum of Understanding this 22nd day of May, 2014.
