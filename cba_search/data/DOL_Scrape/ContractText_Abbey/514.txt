AMENDED AGREEMENT
This amended agreement entered into this 1st day of December, 2011, by and between San Diego Gas & Electric Company, of San Diego, California, its successors or assigns, together with such other properties of a public utility character as may hereafter be acquired, hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” and Local Union 465, of San Diego, California, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, hereinafter referred to as the “Local Union,” covering all classifications of employees as scheduled in Exhibit “A” attached hereto.
WITNESSETH: That for the purpose of facilitating the peaceful adjustment of differences that may arise from time to time, and to promote harmony and efficiency to the end that the Company, the Local Union, and the general public may mutually benefit, the parties hereto contract and agree with each other as follows:
1
ARTICLE I - INTRODUCTION
I.1	The Company is engaged in public service requiring continuous operation, and it is agreed that recognition of such obligation of continuous service during the term of this agreement is imposed upon both the Company and its employee members of the Local Union. The representatives of the Company will meet with the business manager or authorized stewards of the Local Union in reference to any grievance brought up by an employee hereunder.
I.2	It is expressly understood and agreed that the services to be performed by the employees covered by this agreement pertain to and are essential to the operation of a public utility and to the welfare of the public dependent thereon, and in consideration thereof, and of the agreements and conditions herein by the Company to be kept and performed, the Local Union agrees that, with respect to the employees covered by this agreement or any of them, it will not call upon or permit them to cease or abstain from continuous performance of the duties pertaining to the positions held by them under the Company in accord with the terms of this agreement, and the Company agrees, on its part, to do nothing to provoke interruption of, or prevent such continuity of performance of said employees insofar as such performance is required in the normal and usual operation of the Company’s business.
I.3	The Local Union agrees for its members (who are employees of the Company) that they will individually and collectively perform loyal and efficient work and service, that they will use their influence and best efforts to protect the property of the Company, and its service to the
2
public, and that they will cooperate in promoting and advancing the welfare of the Company and the protection of its service to the public at all times.
I.4	The Company agrees that it will cooperate with the Local Union in its efforts to promote harmony and efficiency among all of the Company’s employees.
I.5	All employees of the Company coming within the classifications covered by Exhibit “A” of this agreement shall be required to share in the cost of maintaining and operating the Local Union as their collective bargaining agency in accordance with its rules, and shall be members thereof. It is understood that no employee will be laid off, suspended, or discharged for the reason that the employee has not tendered the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership until three days after the employee’s department head, or higher Company official, is cognizant of the fact that the employee has been duly notified that the employee has not tendered such dues and fees. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed as denying the Company the right to hire its employees regardless of whether or not such employees are members of the Local Union, but it is the intent of the parties hereto that newly hired employees covered by Exhibit “A” of this agreement shall become members of the Local Union after thirty days from the date of their employment. However, summer student employees and employees hired for temporary employment shall become members in good standing of the Local Union after ninety days from the date of their employment. Part-time employees shall pay reduced fees based on hours worked compared to the normal 40-hour week.
3
I.6	The Local Union and the Company agree that no solicitation for membership in any labor organization shall be carried on the Company property or on Company time without the mutual consent of the parties hereto.
I.7	It is understood and agreed that if, during the term of this agreement, mandatory laws applicable to and in conflict with any of the provisions hereto shall become effective and thereafter govern the parties in respect to such conflicting provisions, this agreement shall be subject to modification by mutual agreement of the parties hereto, covering the provisions which conflict.
I.8	It continues to be the policy of the Company and the Union not to discriminate against any employee on account of race, color, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry, handicap, medical condition, marital status, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era. The reference to “handicap” or “medical condition” above shall not apply to an employee who, because of his handicap or medical condition, is unable to perform the employee’s duties, or cannot perform such duties in a manner which would not endanger the employee’s health or safety or the health or safety of others. The reference to “marital status” above shall not affect the right of the Company to reasonably regulate for reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale, the working of spouses in the same division, department, section or facility. Words used in this agreement in the masculine gender include the feminine.
I.9	Nothing in this agreement is intended or shall be used to violate any municipal ordinance, state law or safety standard, or any other legal public requirement, nor is it intended to allow public or personal danger to continue to the detriment of either the general public, the Company, or an employee.
4
I.10	This agreement shall be subject to amendment at any time by mutual consent of the parties hereto. Such amendment must be reduced to writing and state the effective date of the amendment.
I.11	Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as cause, for the Company to abrogate or reduce the scope of any plan or rule beneficial to the employees existing at the time of the adoption of this agreement with respect to vacations, holidays, sick leave, retirement annuity, or insurance. No employee whose classification remains unchanged at the time of the adoption of this agreement shall have the employee’s wages reduced by reason of such adoption.
I.12	The Company shall supply bulletin board space for the use of the Local Union in posting officially signed union bulletins.
I.13	In case the Company should contract any work which is normally done by employees of the bargaining unit, such as the construction of electric lines, gas lines or mains, the installation of switch gear, wiring of substations, etc., the Company shall, before awarding such contract, advise the contractor that the work is to be done under the terms and conditions of this agreement, and/or such other agreements as may be entered into between the contractor and bona fide local unions of international organizations affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. This section applies only to contracts for work which qualify under the construction job site exception defined in Section 8 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Company will not subcontract work consistently performed by the regular forces purely for the purpose of conducting a reduction-in-force, unless federal,
5
state, county or city ordinances require the Company to subcontract work previously performed by the regular forces.
When only one union contractor submits a bid for work which is to be subcontracted under the terms of the Amended Agreement, the Company may award the contract to a non-union contractor on a competitive basis.
I.14	The right to employ in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, to promote, discipline, and discharge employees, for proper cause, and the management of the property, are reserved by and shall be vested in the Company. The Company shall have the right to exercise discipline in the interest of good service and the proper conduct of its business.
I.15	The employees, through the representatives of the Local Union, shall have the right to a hearing on any difference of opinion as to the competency of any person to fill a new position or vacancy; of promotion or demotion; of discipline administered; or lay-offs or of discharge for proper cause. Such hearings shall be before the heads of the department to whom the employees involved are responsible, or the Manager - Labor Relations, and in case of failure to settle the differences, then before a mediator and/or arbitrator, as provided in Article IX.
When practical, if discipline administered constitutes time off, demotion, or termination, the Company will notify the Local Union business office in advance of such action. Such notification shall not be cause to delay or restrict the rights of the Company to administer discipline. Non-notification shall have no bearing upon the merits of the disciplinary action.
I.16	The Company will deduct the prescribed monthly Union dues from the wages of employees who
6
individually and voluntarily authorize such deductions. Any such authorization shall be made in writing, and on a form agreed upon by the Company and the Union. The Company will furnish the Union with a monthly record of those for whom deductions have been made, together with the amounts of such deductions. The Union will indemnify and save the Company harmless from any claims, suits, or any other form of liability as the result of making payroll deductions for membership dues.
I.17	The Company hereby agrees to honor contribution deduction authorizations from its employees who are union members in the following form:
I hereby authorize the Company to deduct from my pay the sum of one cent ($.01) for each straight time hour paid and to forward that amount bi-weekly to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, Committee on Political Education, 1125 Fifteenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20005. This authorization is signed voluntarily and with the understanding that the IBEW-COPE will use the money to make political contributions and expenditures in connection with federal, state, and local elections and that this voluntary authorization is in response to a joint fund raising effort by the IBEW and the AFL-CIO. (Effective August 17, 1987.)
The Union will indemnify and save the Company harmless from any claims, suits, or any other form of liability as a result of making payroll deductions described above.
I.18	Employees hired into the Bargaining Unit will be given an “Introduction to the Local Union” by a designated Union Representative as part of their New Employee Orientation, or within two weeks of their employment. Where practicable new employees will be
7
introduced to their applicable Shop Steward within 30 days of assignment to new work location.
I.19	No bargaining unit employee will be disciplined for a Company “Helpline” complaint or any other allegation where the submitter remains anonymous and there is no identifiable source that is willing to support the allegation.

ARTICLE II - GENERAL WORKING RULES
Scope
II.1	The following general working rules are to apply to all employee classifications covered by this agreement unless specifically covered in departmental rules as hereinafter set forth.
Definitions
II.2	Employees shall be designated as provisional and regular.
Provisional employees are employees with less than nine months of continuous service with the Company. Service with the Company will be considered as continuous in the case of a provisional employee when the employee’s time off without pay has been due only to recognized holidays or to sickness not in excess of five days in that nine months period.
In the case or cases of industrial injuries where the provisional employee is off work, or on light duty for longer than five days, their status as a provisional employee shall be extended in the amount of time off beyond five days, but not to exceed a total of nine months. (per June 4th, 2001 LOU).
Regular employees are employees with more than nine months of continuous service with the Company as defined in the preceding paragraph.
9
In the event service is discontinuous, they will be granted regular status if their total accumulated service amounts to nine months within the last 12-month period.
II.3	The application of the term “journeyman” to trades and classifications other than journeyman electrical workers as defined in Articles III to V, inclusive, may, in the future, be determined by mutual agreement of the parties hereto, as may likewise be the rules with respect to apprentices in these trades or classifications.
II.4	During the life of this agreement, in the event a new bargaining unit occupation is created by the Company, the rate for the new occupation shall be established by the Company with due regard to the content of the new occupation. If the Union disagrees with the rate as determined by the Company, such new rate shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
II.5	“Established Headquarters” is considered to mean any headquarters established by the Company, with proper advance notice, for the purpose of engaging in construction or maintenance work covered by this agreement, where such work will continue indefinitely.
II.6	The Company, at its option, may establish “Camp Jobs” at any location where suitable board and lodging can be obtained or provided, but the determination as to whether such work shall be a “Camp Job” shall be made, and the employees so notified in advance of the assignment.
“Camp Job” is considered to mean any location established by the Company for the purpose of engaging in work as covered in this agreement where such work will
10
continue for a temporary period. After the application of this rule, regular working rules shall apply. (See Sections II.69 and II.72 for “Expenses.”)
II.7	The Company, at its option, may establish “Reporting Locations” for the Construction and Maintenance workforce for the purpose of having employees report to such locations prior to the beginning of the shift. The Company will determine the need for employees to report to such “Reporting Locations” based on the length of time such a reporting assignment is necessary. Selection of employees for “Reporting Locations” will be made from a voluntary sign-up list first; if insufficient volunteers sign up in the district location the assignment will then be voluntary from the other district locations. The employees who volunteer for those jobs will be eligible for pre-arranged overtime assignments that don’t conflict with “Reporting Location” assignments. The Company shall provide for safe storage of employees’ tools. See Section II.67 under the heading “Expenses” for the information concerning the payment of fees and allowances for such assignments. The following rules apply;
Volunteers shall be selected from the pre-arranged overtime list.
All reporting location assignments will be posted in all districts ten (10) working days prior to the job start date in an effort to solicit volunteers. Volunteers in the designated district requesting the Reporting Location assignment will be selected first. If after five (5) working days there are insufficient volunteers from the designated district requesting the Reporting Location assignments, the Company will select a member/s will be selected by utilizing the pre-arranged
11
overtime lists and utilizing the member/s with the least amount of pre-arranged hours.
If the distance from the employee’s home to the Reporting Location exceeds the distance from the employee’s home to the employee’s regular established headquarters, the employee will receive payment for additional commuting time at the straight-time rate of pay calculated at two (2) minutes for each additional round trip mileage is 15 miles or less, the minimum allowance will be /2 hour of pay at straight-time rate.
Additionally the Company at its option may establish “Reporting Locations” for employees in different departments not traditionally considered construction and maintenance. These “Reporting Locations” shall be voluntary assignments. If not enough volunteers are enlisted, then a “Reporting Location” shall not be established for that particular work assignment. All rules and provisions of Article II, Section 7 pertaining to expenses (Article II, Section 67) shall apply as well as travel time and mileage payments.
On Call Crew
II.8	On Call Crew/Call Outs
1.	Each location may have On Call Crews/Supplemental crews. These Crews will not be used in other districts if those districts have not established the On Call Crews procedures unless they have exhausted their Call Out list.
2.	The Primary On Call Crew shall consist of an “A” and “B” on call shift. The “A” shift will run from 7:00 AM Monday to 7:00
12
AM Friday and the “B” shift shall run from 7:00 AM Friday to 7:00 AM Monday.
The Supplemental list will consist of a daily sign up list. This shall be used as described below.
3.	Employees shall receive a premium of $45.00/day for week days starting Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:00 A.M. and $45.00/day for days starting Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays when they have the On-Call Crew duty, provided they respond, when requested. Week days shifts are for four days from 7:00 A.M. Monday to 7:00 A.M. Friday. Weekend shifts are three days from 7:00 A.M. Friday to 7:00 A.M. Monday. (Note: Employees shall receive a premium of $47.50/day beginning09/01/2012 and $50.00/day beginning 09/01/2013 and thereafter)
4.	Primary shifts will be filled as follows:
A.	Primary shift assignments will be posted on the Wednesday* (11 days) before the two-week period in which the shift assignments are performed.

Shift assignments will be made using the “All Other” overtime list issued the Monday of the week in which the shift assignments are made.
B.	Voluntarily using the “All Other” overtime list by lowest number of hours.
C.	Assigning by “All Other”/Do Not Want overtime list by lowest number of hours.
13
D.	Or a combination of B and/or C above.
*If the Wednesday or Friday fall on a Holiday the preceding workday shall be used.
E.	Trading
a.	Trading of shifts and partial shifts including “Day Trading” will go first to eligible employees on “Supplemental List”, than to like classification base on least hours on the “All Other List”, followed by qualified “Relief” personnel for replacement of WFE positions only, lineman, apprentices, then line assistance. These rules will be known as “Trade Rules”
b.	A voluntary or forced employee will be responsible for making and following all “Trade Rules.”
c.	An employee failure to follow “trade Rules” will result in their being ineligible to trade or take trades for at least one (1) full quarter.
d.	No grievances will be accepted or processed with regards to trades.
5.	Employees are responsible for the entire shift. Employees who accept or are assigned to the primary crew will continue to be ineligible for assignments that interfere with their primary crew responsibilities.
6.	The employer will designate the devices to be used when making contact of which the employee will select the primary number.
7.	Employees who are forced will be allowed to work no more than two consecutive on call shifts without a shift off. Employees cannot be
14
forced on consecutive “A” and/or “B” shifts more than once in a quarter.
8.	“Call Out Crew” size will be determined by location. When crew size is determined, it will be posted prior to accepting sign ups. Once posted, the crew size will be in effect at least one full quarter. When utilizing the on call crew, the full crew complement will be utilized. However, with thirty (30) days notification, the crew size may be increased utilizing volunteers for a minimum duration of a three (3) day shift.
9.	In cases where a primary crew member cannot fulfill part or all of the shift:
A.	The Supplemental lists will be utilized. The employee will receive the premium if the employee accepts the assignment.
B.	If there are no volunteers on the Supplemental list, the “All Other”/Do Not Want overtime list will be used to fill the crew if there is a call out, no premium will be paid to that individual.
10.	An employee who does not fulfill all or part of their shift obligation without a bonafide reason will be subject to the following:
A.	Loss of premium for that instance.
B.	Immediately ineligible for prearranged overtime plus:
1st offense-ineligible for next 2 full pay period loss of prearranged
15
2nd offense-ineligible for next 4 full pay period loss of prearranged
3rd offense-to include additional discipline up to and including termination.
The employee’s prearranged overtime will be adjusted to reflect the average prearranged overtime in their classification at their location. The method would be to add up all prearranged hours for that period for that classification at that location. Divide it by the number of individuals that worked prearranged during that period for that classification at that location. That number would be added to the prearranged hours of the individual.
11.	All other call outs shall be made as follows:
A.	After the primary shift assignments have been posted, employees may sign up for individual days (Supplemental List) during the two-week shift period.

II.23	The wage schedules for employees covered by this agreement are set forth in Exhibits “A” and “B”, which are attached hereto and made a part hereof.
II.24	Pay days shall be at biweekly intervals. If a pay day falls on a holiday, the preceding work day shall be pay day. Employees who are missing pay for any hours worked in their paycheck, by no fault of their own, shall be compensated within 72 hours via a pay card. (Effective 10/01/2012)
II.25	In case an employee works at two classifications in the same half day, he shall receive the higher rate of pay for that half day. It is provided, however, that where there is a regularly scheduled job or class of work in which more than one classification is consistently involved, the employee so working shall receive the rate of pay for the actual time worked in each classification.
II.26	An employee placed on a temporary assignment of higher classification shall receive the prevailing rate of pay for the higher classification during the entire period of the assignment. The higher rate will prevail for holidays and jury duty only when the employee was upgraded
23
both the immediate work day before and the immediate work day after the holiday or jury duty.
If the employee is placed in different temporary assignments, of a higher rate of pay, on the immediate work day before and the immediate work day after the holiday or jury duty, the employee shall receive, for the holiday or jury duty at issue, the rate of pay in effect on the immediate work day before the holiday or jury duty. (per June 4th, 2001 LOU)

The second and subsequent years in the new job shall be at the book rate.
II.31	Laborers will be raised to the next higher Helper rate if promoted or upgraded to Helper.

(per July 5th, 2000 LOU)
Overtime
II.36	Overtime worked as a continuation of the regular shift will be paid at the rate of time and one-half for the first two hours of overtime, and double time thereafter. (Note Overtime worked as a continuation of the regular shift will be paid at the rate of time and one-half for the first three hours of overtime, and double time thereafter effective 09/01/2010). Intermission taken out for meals will be deducted in all cases, except if a crew is held over under standby conditions, and such crew is released immediately at the conclusion of the meal period without resuming work.
Employees who are promoted or demoted to a new job or new location or transferred to a new location in the same job classification will carry all previous overtime earned in the current calendar year into the new job/location. For new employees entering the Company, those employees will be averaged in for the first month, after which they will be placed with hours earned. This provision will not apply to temporary assignments. Employees on temporary assignment will stay on their home district “All-Other” overtime list.
II.37	Double time will be allowed for all work on days when an employee is scheduled for a day off.
26
II.38	Unless otherwise provided herein, all employees called out for overtime duty shall receive an amount not less than the equal of four hours straight-time pay. An employee will be considered as called out if the employee is required to work after the employee’s regular quitting time for the day, and after having been released. Notification to report for a regularly scheduled shift or any part thereof is not considered a call-out. A regularly scheduled shift is one of at least eight hours duration, posted in advance.
II.39	Employees who report for prearranged work on work days, and who continue to work into regular work hours shall be paid overtime compensation for actual work time up to regular starting time (i.e., no travel time or minimum). For the purpose of this section, prearranged work is deemed to be work for which advance notice of at least 12 hours (before the work is to start) has been given. If such 12 hours’ notice is not given, or if the work is scheduled to start more than 4 1/2 hours before the employee’s regular starting time, it shall be considered a call-out and the minimum and travel time provision will apply.
II.40	Should an employee receive more than one call-out within a two-hour period, the employee shall be entitled to the minimum of two hours at double time on the first call only. For any time worked in excess of the two-hour minimum the employee shall be paid at the double time rate for the actual time involved.
II.41	When an employee is called out for overtime duty, the employee’s pay shall start 1/2 hour before the employee’s arrival at headquarters or at the job and shall end 1/2 hour after the employee is released. Travel time is to be considered working time.
27
If the employee is requested to arrive, and does arrive, at headquarters or on the job at a certain time under call-out provisions, the employee’s pay shall start 1/2 hour before such stipulated reporting time and shall end 1/2 hour after the employee is released.
In cases where such call-out duty extends into the employee’s regular working hours, the terminal 1/2 hour shall not be allowed.
II.42	If an employee’s scheduled shift is canceled with less than eight hours notice the employee will be entitled to pay for at least two hours of work at overtime rates.
II.43	If an employee is called to report to work, and then later called and has that order canceled, or if prearranged overtime is canceled prior to the employee leaving the employee’s residence, the employee shall receive two hours at straight-time pay.
II.44	When contacted by telephone at home and required to give technical information necessary to the operations of the Company, an employee shall receive 0.2 hour at time and one-half for giving such information.
II.45	An employee who has earned 14 hours straight time pay at overtime rates during the 16 hours preceding the employee’s regular starting time may be relieved from duty for the employee’s succeeding regular work period unless the employee has been off duty for the five hours preceding the employee’s regular starting time or unless a majority of employees from the crew (over 50%) wish to work. They may work at straight time rates for the remaining hours of their regular shift if they have the 5
28
hours off (rest period) prior to 4 hours into their regular shift. If the rest period overlaps with the employees regular shift, the employee will be compensated for those hours that overlap, at their regular straight time rate, provided they report to work and finish their regular shift. If relieved from duty under these circumstances, the employee shall receive two hours straight time pay for the regular work period from which the employee has been relieved. If required to work during the employee’s regular work period under these circumstances, the employee shall be paid at the rate of double time, plus they will receive an additional 2 hours of straight time pay. (Except as stated in Flexible Work Schedule Section II.11).
Employees should not work more than 30 continuous hours without a five hour rest period.
II.46	If an employee is called out for overtime duty from the employee’s home, the employee is entitled to a minimum of two hours’ pay at overtime rates. If the two hours overlap into the employee’s regularly scheduled work shift, the straight time pay for that shift begins at the end of the two-hour period and ends at the regular quitting time. For example: If an employee whose regular starting time is 8:00 a.m. should be called to work at 7:00 a.m., the employee is entitled to be paid at the overtime rate from 7:00 a.m. until 9:00 a.m., and at the straight-time rate from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Should the employee continue on duty after 4:30 p.m., such additional time would be computed at the overtime rate.
II.47	If an employee is on the job waiting to begin the regular day and is instructed to start ahead of schedule, the employee shall receive double time up to the
29
regular starting time, but not less than one-half hour at double time.
II.48	The regular lunch period of any employee or crew may be either advanced one hour or delayed one hour where required by necessity, under which circumstances no extra pay will be given. Should the lunch period be advanced or delayed more than one hour, one additional hour of straight time pay shall be allowed for that day.
II.49	Except for relief employees relieving employees on rotating shifts, employees transferred from a day shift to a night shift shall be paid at the overtime rate, unless such transfer is for at least a normal five-day work week, consisting of Monday through Friday. (For an employee who does not work a normal Monday through Friday schedule, substitute the first through the fifth work days in the work week).
II.50	Overtime will be classified in two separate categories. One category will be “prearranged overtime,” which is all overtime that is scheduled and advance notice is given to the employee. The second category will be “all other overtime,” which excludes “prearranged overtime.” Overtime shall be divided as equally as is practicable in these two separate categories among those qualified and available in each classification.
II.51	For the purpose of Call-outs and Prearranged Overtime, employees on shifts may be utilized to perform work that begins up to four hours before their shift begins, and/or work that begins up to four hours after their shift ends, without regard to the “Pre Arranged” or “All Other” Overtime lists.
30
II.52	All employees must adhere to a minimum Call-Out overtime response of 25% per quarter to be eligible for Pre-Arranged overtime assignments. Employees must have a minimum of eight (8) calls per quarter. Employees reaching their 60th birthday with at least 10 years of service at their option will not be held accountable for maintaining a 20% call-out rate or be mandated to accept “On-Call” assignments. Upon exercising this option, these employees will be ineligible for accepting “Pre-Arranged overtime assignments. This paragraph is not applicable to individuals in “First Responder” positions as defined by Article Ii, Section 79. At no point shall these employees exceed more than 20% of a particular classification (one employee minimum) at a designated work location. In all cases for request designation, Company seniority will prevail.
Relief
II.53	In transferring an employee from one shift to another, no loss in regular pay shall result. Except in emergencies, or where otherwise agreed upon by the parties hereto, an employee may be transferred from one shift to another with eight hours off duty between shifts with no overtime penalty. If the employee does not have eight hours off duty between shifts due to overtime assignments, then the employee shall receive pay according to the following formulas:
Time Between Shifts	Pay Calculation
6 hours, but less than 8 hours	3 hours at double time 5 hours at straight time
4 hours, but less than 6 hours	6 hours at double time 2 hours at straight time
Less than 4 hours	8 hours at double time
31
The above pay calculations do not apply to situations covered in Section II.54.
II.54	In providing for emergency relief for shift employees (as, for example, in case of illness) other employees from either rotating or regular shifts (and not necessarily working the same schedule of hours as the employee relieved) may be transferred to the relief duty and shall receive no overtime therefore, provided they have received at least sixteen hours’ notice of the impending transfer to the relief duty and are not required to work in excess of an average of forty hours per week in any two weeks. Employees returning from sick, accident, or other unscheduled absence must give at least eight hours’ notice before returning to work.
II.55	If an employee who is normally free on holidays relieves an employee whose shift permits no recognition of holidays, the employee shall receive double time pay for holidays worked during the first twenty-one calendar days of such relief, and after that period shall receive additional days off, or a vacation, as provided for in Section II.60.

33
employees’ requests consistent with the operating needs of the Company.
**This shall be a holiday for all employees; provided that so many employees as the Company may deem necessary to retain for work will not be given a holiday on that day, but in lieu thereof shall receive one of the following at the Employee’s option:

Vacations will be granted throughout the year. In the scheduling of vacations, consideration will be given to employee requests consistent with the operating needs of the Company.
II.6	0 All shift employees who are regular employees whose shifts normally permit no recognition of holidays, shall be granted an additional vacation to the extent of holidays lost by reason of such shift work as compared with other regular employees working a normal Monday to Friday work week. The number of such additional days of vacation shall be based on the holidays lost between the end of the vacation of the prior year and the end of the vacation of the current year. If the total vacation exceeds fifteen working days, only fifteen days need be consecutive, and any excess shall be allowed at other times at the mutual convenience of the Company and the employee. Employees entitled to more than ten days’ vacation allowance will, in case the Company finds it impracticable to schedule more than fifteen days of such vacations, be given one day’s pay (when mutually agreeable) for each day of vacation not granted.
The foregoing rule is not intended to discriminate against those employees who might be granted an “extended” vacation by reason of special rules of the Company.
II.6	1 In computing pay for vacation (or sick leave), employees who carry dual classifications shall be paid in proportion to the time worked at the different classifications during the year in question.
II.6	2	Upon termination of employment with the Company, an employee shall be paid for
unused vacation allowance.
37
II.6	3 If an employee requests time off in addition to regular vacation, such request shall be granted at the employee’s expense, provided it does not inconvenience the operation of the Company, or increase operating expense.
II.6	4 Vacation requests must be submitted between November 1st and January 31st inclusive. Vacation schedules shall be posted on or before April 1st, and no change in schedule shall be made without the mutual consent of both parties unless thirty days notice is given of such change.

II.6	5 Effective January 1st, 2005, employees may carryover unused normal vacation hours into the following year, provided said employee did not buy vacation for that year. Eligible unused vacation hours up to 40 will automatically be carried over into the following year. Unused vacation hours over 40, will automatically be paid out to employees in the 1st check of the following calendar year (or as soon thereafter as administratively possible). All carryover balances will be paid out upon retirement or termination.
Expenses
II.6	6 The payment for mileage allowance will be made according to IRS published recommendations.
An employee being temporarily assigned from one established headquarters to another established headquarters,
38
as defined in Section II.5, may be furnished transportation at the Company’s option, or they may receive the following payment:
If the distance from the employee’s home does not exceed the distance from the employee’s home to the employee’s regular established headquarters, no payment will be received.
If the distance from the employee’s home to the location of the temporary assignment at another established headquarters exceeds the distance from the employee’s home to the employee’s regular established headquarters, the employee will receive payment for the additional commuting time at the straight-time rate of pay calculated at two minutes for each additional mile plus the current mileage rate for each additional mile. In the event the additional round trip mileage is 15 miles or less, the minimum allowance will be 1/2 hour pay at the straight-time rate plus the current mileage rate for each additional mile.
An employee must submit statements for the additional distance, if any, traveled by the most direct route from the employee’s place of residence to the location of the temporary assignment. Falsification of distances traveled will result in discipline up to and including discharge.
II.6	7 An employee reporting to a “Reporting Location” as defined in Section II.7 may receive the following allowances:
Mileage Zones:	0 - 9 miles =	$10.00
10 - 34 miles =	$20.00
35 + miles =	$25.00
39
Any additional parking fee and bridge tolls incurred when proper receipts are submitted.
An employee must submit statements as to the mileage traveled by the most direct route from the employee’s place of residence to the “Reporting Location.” Falsification of distances traveled will result in discipline up to and including discharge.
Section II.65 shall not apply to employees who volunteer to report directly to a “Reporting Location.”
An employee may request to be released from the “Reporting Location” requirement if an acceptable qualified employee can be substituted. Substitutes from the subject list of volunteers will have first preference.
II.6	8	Employees shall provide their own mid-shift meal on regularly scheduled workdays
and when working prearranged overtime.
For work performed before or after a regularly scheduled shift:
A meal will be provided if work commences 1.5 hours or more before the start of the employee’s regularly scheduled shift or prearranged overtime shift.
A meal will be provided if work continues for more than 2.0 hours after the end of the shift. Another meal will be provided if work continues for more than 5.5 hours after that meal, and another meal will be provided if work continues more than 6.5 hours after that meal.
40
Mealtimes on call-outs shall be provided using the foregoing rules:
For call-outs on an employee’s scheduled day off, the employee’s shift hours shall be considered the same as those on the employee’s last regular workday. If an employee is changing shifts and is called-out after midnight on the day the shift change occurs, the employee’s shift hours shall be the hours of the regular shift that day. If called-out before midnight, the shift hours shall be the same as those on the employee’s last workday.
For purposes of meals, prearranged work on Saturday, Sunday, holidays or when an employee is scheduled to be off, shall not be scheduled to start before 5:00 a.m. Prearranged overtime work scheduled to begin before 5:00 a.m., other than regularly scheduled shifts, shall be considered a call-out for determining meal allowances.
These mealtimes are to be subject to variations so that employees engaged in overtime work will continue to perform such duties and operations as are required for proper service to the public.
The Company may provide meals at the times indicated above, unless the employees are released on or before the mealtime. Where it is not practical for the Company to provide such meals, the Company shall reimburse the employee $13.00 as of 12/01/2011 for such meal, regardless of whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.
Meal reimbursement amounts will be increased to reflect the overall percentage of the negotiated General Wage Increase percentage effective the beginning of the
41
newly negotiated agreement. (Example Only: 2011 - 2.25% / 2012 - 2.5% / 2013- 2.5%)
II.69	Should an employee be away from headquarters more than one day on Company business, the Company shall provide the employee lodging and a sum of $50.00 for expenses. Any sum in excess of these amounts must be paid by the employee or will be deducted from the employee’s paycheck. This sum will be paid when an employee is assigned a camp job and must be away from home overnight. The daily allowance will be paid each full day the Company requires the employee to work at the remote location. As an example, if an employee leaves on Monday and returns on Friday evening, after working a full day on Friday, the employee would receive $250.00 for meals and expenses. If, however, the employee does not work a full eight hours on the last day of the assignment, but returns to his or her headquarters at the normal quitting time, the employee would only receive the normal meals allowance, as specified in Section II.68, for two meals on that last day.
The Company shall endeavor to give at least one week’s notice to employees who will be required to be away from their established headquarters for one week or more. Such notice shall not be required for emergencies or due to conditions caused by a customer, supplier or an act of God.
If an employee returns home on weekends, the allowance will not be paid for the weekend.
II.70	When traveling overnight for the purposes of training the following shall apply:
42
When traveling on a Saturday or Sunday, employees shall be paid at one half their normal straight time rate of pay. Travel time will begin upon departure from the employee’s home airport and end with their direct arrival at their hotel or designated training facility. Upon returning, travel time will be considered from the time the employees leave their hotel or designated training facility until their arrival at their home airport. In no case shall an employee receive pay exceeding the equivalent of eight hours pay at straight time rates.
When traveling Monday through Friday the employee’s appropriate rate of pay will be paid during normal working hours. If travel goes beyond normal working hours, the one half of straight time pay provision shall apply.
The company shall provide the employee lodging and reimburse the employee a sum of $50.00 per day for meals and all other expenses.
While in training, a maximum 8 of hours per day will be paid at the appropriate straight time rates. (per April 18 th, 2000 LOU)

A regular or provisional employee from an established headquarters who is transferred by Company request to another established headquarters and does not change the employee’s place of residence will receive round trip mileage at the current mileage rate for 20 working days. The sum will be paid for the miles from the employee’s place
43
of residence to the established headquarters only if the distance traveled is further than the distance from the employee’s place of residence and the original established headquarters. The sum paid is for a maximum of 20 working days and will not exceed the actual number of days the employee reported to the new headquarters if less than 20 working days.
II.72	A regular or provisional employee from an established headquarters who may be assigned to a camp job will be allowed expenses in an amount equal to contract provisions to be paid, via a pre-loaded expense card for the period while so assigned beginning 10/01/2012. An employee shall be allowed travel time and furnished Company transportation at Company expense to and from the camp job on weekends in lieu of board and lodging, if no work is scheduled or contemplated for that weekend.

44
necessary for the employee to perform the employee’s job. Reimbursement will not be made for any particular class of license, more frequently than once every four years.
Seniority
II.75	Promotion shall be based on seniority, ability and qualifications; ability and qualifications being sufficient, seniority shall prevail. The seniority referred to in this case is that seniority accumulated in the specific department or division thereof in which the promotion is to be made, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties hereto. Employees will be allowed to bid down or laterally once through their employment with the Company.
The departments or divisions referred to above are as follows:
Electric Transmission and Distribution Department:
Cathodic Protection Division
Headquarters Division
Line Division
Maintenance and Underground Division
Tests & Communications Division
Gas Department
Customer Service Field Division

The Company will bid the following positions: “Relief Locator” and “Relief District Crew Dispatcher” (Relief District Crew Dispatcher one North and one South) (Progression will follow existing CBA Relief language)
The seniority of a journeyman shall begin at the time the employee is first rated as an apprentice, and if transferred temporarily after being apprenticed shall lose no seniority thereby.
Upon request, the Company shall make available current seniority lists for review by Employees.
II.76	A written bid for vacancy shall be posted within two working days in the department
involved, and shall be considered open for two weeks. For the convenience of the Company, temporary assignments may be made for a period of thirty days until the bids are received and regular assignments are made. Employees shall not be required to exercise their seniority, but shall not sacrifice any future rights to bid on vacancies through failure to do so. Bids made for vacancies will be considered valid only for the current vacant position.
The Company and Union will collaboratively work to develop and implement an electronic on-line “Bid for Vacancy” system. The Company will provide the Union with a thirty (30) day notice of implementation.
46
II.77	Employees who bid and are awarded a job position or who are placed into a
position by mutual consent of both parties will be precluded, for a period of 9 months, from bidding on any other job position. The 9-month period will commence from the bid closing date. This provision will in no way hamper an employee’s normal progression in their new classification.
II.78	Employees who are accepted into the position have 30 calendar days from the start of training or break-in period to return to their previous classification. After the 30 day period, employees will have no right to return to their former classification(s).
II.79	All individuals entering one of the First Responder job positions below after
December 5th, 2011, must live within fifty-five miles of their assigned headquarters.
First Responder job positions:
1.	Electric Troubleshooter
2.	Relief Electric Troubleshooter
3.	Fault Finding Specialist
4.	Relief Fault Finding Specialist
5.	Service Technician
II.80	Regular employees may request transfer only from the specific job classification they currently hold to the same job classification at another Company location. The opportunity to transfer will be offered first to those who have so requested, commencing with the one having the longest record of continuous service with the Company, provided their ability, experience, and qualifications are sufficient and equal. Not more than three Requests for Transfer by any one employee shall be kept on file at any one time.
47
The Company and Union will collaboratively work to develop and implement an electronic on-line “Request for Transfer” system. The Company will provide the Union with a thirty (30) day notice of implementation.
A Regular employee may request transfer from any job classification to the lowest position in another department or division. Regular employees classified as Laborers and Helpers may transfer to Helper positions in any department where Helper is the entry level position.
Requests for Transfer will only be considered valid for twelve months.
Employees who are forced transferred to another location may request a transfer to return to their original location. These transfer requests will be honored prior to any other transfer request on file to that location. Employees must resubmit a new transfer request each time the previous request expires in order to continue this preferential transfer provision. An employee may have only one preferential transfer request on file at a time and will forfeit the right if the employee refuses a transfer offer to the location on file.
II.81	Employees may be transferred to other departments, and if returned to their original department within two years will not lose their seniority rating. If assigned to another department for longer than two years, they may be returned to their original department with seniority based on that established at the end of the two-year period. The seniority of an employee who terminates and later is re-employed, shall start on the day the employee returns to work. These provisions do not apply if Section II.88 is applicable.
II.82	When hiring new laborers it shall be the general policy of the Company, as far as
practicable, to assign
48
these employees to the gas distribution crews. When additional regular or provisional employees are needed in other departments, laborers already on the payroll shall be given first consideration, provided they have registered with the personnel office and filled out the proper forms requesting transfer. Employees with the longest continuous service with the Company will be given preference provided they are qualified.
II.83	In the event there is a reduction in force from a classification, the junior employee(s),
based on classification seniority in that classification, shall be reduced from the classification.
Such displaced employee(s) will then be assigned down to the next lowest classification in the department which (a) the employee(s) held on a regular basis and (b) the employee(s) has more departmental seniority than an employees(s) presently in that classification.
A reduction in force from this classification would result in the junior employee(s), based on classification seniority in this classification, being reduced from the classification in order to provide a position(s) for the previously reduced employee(s) with more departmental seniority.
This process would continue to the lowest classification in the department. Any reduction in force from this lowest classification would result in the junior employee(s), based on departmental seniority, being reduced from the classification and released from the department.
In the event a displaced employee(s) (a) has never held another classification in the department on a regular basis or (b) does not have more departmental seniority than an
49
employee(s) in a classification previously held, the displaced employee(s) may be assigned elsewhere in the bargaining unit as provided below.
Such displaced employees(s) will then be assigned down to the next lowest classification in the bargaining unit which (a) the employee(s) held on a regular basis and (b) the employee(s) has more departmental seniority (as defined in Section II.74) than an employee(s) presently in that classification.
Again, a reduction in force from this classification would result in the junior employee(s), based on classification seniority in this classification, being reduced from the classification in order to provide a position(s) for the previously reduced employee(s) with more departmental seniority.
Again, this process would continue to the lowest classification in the department. Any reduction in force from this lowest classification would result in the junior employee(s), based on departmental seniority, being reduced from the classification and released from the department.
In the event a displaced employee(s) is unable to obtain a position utilizing any departmental seniority, the employee may utilize Company seniority to obtain a position in the Laborer classification. Any reduction in force from the Laborer classification would result in the junior employee(s), based on Company seniority, being reduced from the classification and released from the bargaining unit.
A displaced employee(s) assigned to a classification previously held on a regular basis must be able to perform the basic elements of the job within one week. If the
50
employee(s) is unable to do so, the employee(s) will be assigned down to the next lowest classification as provided for in this procedure.
A displaced employee(s) assigned to another department shall retain the right to bid on the classification from which the employee(s) was displaced for a period of two years from such displacement date.
II.84	Employees with two or more years of service who are discharged in a reduction in force shall be given consideration for re-employment for a period of one year after their date of termination if job openings occur. If re-employed during that year, the employee will be reinstated with the credited service which the employee had accumulated at the time of his discharge. (Otherwise, the provisions of the next to the last sentence of Section II.81 will prevail.) Re-employment will be offered, as vacancies occur, in the job classification held by the employee on the date of termination. Persons will not be recalled to job classifications to which a Company employee has a superior promotional right.
Employees discharged under the above conditions shall keep Human Resources advised of their address. The Company shall notify former employees of offers of re-employment in writing by certified or registered mail to the last address on record. Offers will be withdrawn if not answered within five working days and/or if the person does not report for work within ten working days. Persons who reject an offer, or who fail to answer within five days, or who fail to report within ten days will no longer be eligible for rehire with reinstatement of seniority. Persons who are unable to accept an offer because of a bona fide illness or injury may be retained on the list for reconsideration;
51
however, no such injury or illness will be considered bona fide unless so diagnosed by a Company physician. The cost of such physical examination will be borne by the Company; but no travel or related costs will be paid or reimbursed by the Company.
II.85	No seniority shall be considered for an employee until the employee has been with the Company for nine months, but after serving this period seniority shall be computed from the date hired. The Union will not accept, nor process a grievance involving the termination of an employee as an unsatisfactory probationer during the first nine months of employment.
II.86	When it becomes necessary to determine the number of years, or the proportion of a year, that a regular employee has worked at a certain classification, and work therein has been intermittent, two hundred forty-one working days shall be taken as constituting a year’s work in such computations.
II.87	Any employee selected for office in the Local Union which requires part or all of the employee’s time, shall not lose seniority with the Company. It is understood that not more than two employees at one time will be granted leave of absence to accept such positions with the Union. Such leave shall be granted for one year at a time - such limitation being dependent on technological changes affecting the employee’s job -and not to extend beyond the employee’s normal date of retirement.
II.88	A bargaining unit employee who accepts a position out of the bargaining unit shall not accumulate seniority while occupying such position; such employee, if qualified, may be returned to a bargaining unit classification,
52
at the option of the company, if a vacancy exists. An employee returning to a bargaining unit classification will retain only the seniority previously accumulated while a member of the bargaining unit.
II.89	Working Foremen and employees in charge of other employees must enforce all safety rules and regulations and ensure compliance by such employees.
II.90	Employees who fail twice to successfully complete an apprenticeship, training program or training requirements for a position will not be permitted to bid on the same position for six (6) months from the time they dropped out or were removed from the training/program. Additionally, employees who fail twice to successfully complete an apprenticeship, training program, or training requirements will not be permitted to be selected for training on any subsequent bid for the specific apprenticeship, training program or training requirements.
Safety
II.91	An employee shall not work on live high potential wires carrying more than 750 volts, unless assisted by another journeyman or a third-year apprentice, except in cases of emergency where lives may be in danger.
II.92	The company agrees to furnish such safety devices and first aid sets as may be needed for the safety of its employees, and the employees shall use them in the manner prescribed. The Union shall cooperate in promoting the realization of the responsibility of the individual employee with regard to the prevention of accidents.
53
II.93	The Company shall establish a Safety Coordinator position at each location. The Union shall appoint one member at each district headquarters who, as the Safety Coordinator, shall act as a liaison between the Union and Company on safety issues.
II.94	Employees who have a combination of no doctors cases injuries, no preventable vehicle incidents and no safety violations within a calendar year will receive recognition in a manner to be determined by the company. The company will provide a list of eligible rewards available for recognition of achievement.
II.95	In all cases of a significant event: Firestorm, Earthquake, Heat Storm, Windstorm, etc the Company will take reasonable measures to utilize all available bargaining unit employees before any contractors.
Helicopter Operations
II.96	Appropriate Safety Rules and Work Method Guidelines shall be established and maintained by the Company to direct the utilization of helicopters to support Company operations. These guidelines shall be designed to maximize the efficiency of operations and safety of all personnel. All personnel involved with helicopter operations shall be familiar with and perform their jobs in compliance with these guidelines.
II.97	Employees whose job requires them to be transported by a helicopter shall receive $10 a day premium for those days the employee is transported by a helicopter. This premium is in addition to regular pay.
54
Severance Pay
II.98	In the event of a change in control of the Company, the following provisions shall be
applied:
A regular employee with four or more years of continuous service with the Company who is offered employment and required to move out of the existing service territory of the San Diego Gas & Electric Company and elects to terminate in lieu of accepting the position and moving, shall receive severance pay as indicated below or exercise the employee’s rights under Section II.82. The maximum severance pay will be 15 weeks’ pay. Severance allowance may be paid in a lump sum at the time of termination.

Severance allowance shall include continuation of health and basic life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, at 50% of the employee’s annual salary, for the period of severance allowance or a lump-sum for the present value to the employee, at the employee’s option.
55
Apprentices and Student Engineers
II.99	Apprentices shall remain at their third-year rate until such time as openings occur for journeymen. An apprentice having served the apprenticeship shall not be removed in favor of a new apprentice until the former has been made a journeyman.
II.100	Before an apprentice may be classified as a journeyman the employee shall be first examined by the Local Union Examining Board and certain persons who may be designated by the Company, who will pass on the employee’s qualifications. This section shall not apply to apprentice power plant electricians.
II.101	For the development of Apprentices, regional rotation will be allowed when workload allows. Line Assistants will choose their district by seniority and that will be their home district throughout their apprenticeship. The Company and Union will jointly determine if and how rotation of apprentices will occur. If rotating is needed it will be at six month intervals to coincide with evaluations and the Apprentice will be placed on the new base headquarters overtime list. Apprentices will spend their last twelve months and journey-out in their home district.
II.102	Student engineers employed in the operating department shall, after three months’
employment in any classification, be paid not less than the regular rate in that classification.

ARTICLE IX - NEGOTIATION AND ARBITRATION
IX.1	The Company and the Local Union agree to meet and deal with each other through their duly accredited officers and committees, representing the parties hereto, on matters relating to hours, wages, seniority, and promotions within the classifications scheduled in Exhibit “A” hereof, demotions, discriminations, discharges, and lay-offs not made in accord with seniority, and compulsory transfers from one department to another.
IX.	2 Any employee, steward, together with such committee as may be necessary, may present a grievance regarding the interpretation, application of this agreement or disciplinary action taken by the Company directly to the supervisor or through the authorized representative of the Local Union to the manager of the department involved. There is no responsibility on the part of the Company to accept for adjustment or to adjust a grievance which is presented after ten working days from the date of the occurrence which is the basis for the grievance.
If no settlement is reached in this step, the grievance shall be presented in writing to the Manager/Director of the Department by the steward or the authorized representative of the Local Union within ten days of the supervisor’s decision.
The manager/director of the department shall render a decision within a reasonable period. If no settlement is reached in this step, the grievance shall be presented in writing to the appropriate Vice President, or designee, within
104
ten working days after the departmental decision has been rendered.
Within ten working days from receipt of such grievance, the Manager of Labor Relations shall investigate the grievance and, with such Company representatives as may be deemed necessary, shall meet with the authorized representative of the Local Union, who may be accompanied by a committee of the employees of the Company, to endeavor to settle the grievance.
The Company and the Local Union may refer disciplinary and non-disciplinary grievances to a Mediator from either the Federal Mediation and Conciliation services or the State of California Conciliation Service for a final and binding resolution so long as both parties jointly agree to do so in writing prior to initiating the Mediation. This option is not intended to replace or eliminate the formal arbitration process set forth in Article IX.5.
In case of failure to agree, the matter in dispute shall be submitted within the next ten working days to a mediator from either the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or the State of California Conciliation Service, as jointly agreed upon by both parties. If the mediator fails to effect an agreement between the parties, the Union may refer the case to arbitration. Any such referral must be made within 30 calendar days of the date of the mediation.
The resolution of a timely grievance at any of the steps shall be final and binding on the Company, Union and grievant, except that, a resolution at a step below the third step, while final and binding, does not set precedent in future instances for either the Company or the Union, or may not be referenced or used in any other proceeding including
105
arbitration, unless mutually agreed to by representatives of the Labor Relations Department and the Union Business Manager.
Failure of either party to abide by the time limits set forth in this section shall result in a forfeiture of the grievance (without prejudice) to the other party, provided, however, that the parties may extend said time limits by mutual agreement.
IX.3 Any differences that may arise between the Company and the Local Union concerning wage reviews at dates specified in the agreement, or concerning amendments to the agreement at any termination date, which the representatives of the Company and the Local Union are unable to settle, shall be submitted, at the request of either party to arbitration. The Company and the Local Union agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.
IX.4 Each party shall bear the expense of preparing and presenting its own case. The expense of the arbitrator and incidental expenses mutually agreed to in advance shall be borne equally by the parties hereto.
IX.5 Procedures for Selection of Arbitrators
The parties agree to select a panel of arbitrators to which grievances will be submitted.
The panel shall consist of 14 arbitrators.
106
The panel will be selected in the following manner:
♦	Company and Union will each submit names of arbitrators to the other. Any arbitrator agreed to by both parties will be on the panel.
♦	If Company and Union are unable to agree on 14 arbitrators, a list of arbitrators affiliated with the National Academy of Arbitrators for Southern California shall be obtained. The Company and the Union shall then have alternate strikes from that list until the number of arbitrators needed to complete the panel remain on the list. Those remaining arbitrators shall become members of the panel.
♦	Individual arbitrators may be removed from the panel unilaterally by either Company or Union after one year.
♦	Neither party may unilaterally remove more than two arbitrators from the panel in any calendar year.
♦	No arbitrator may be removed from the panel unilaterally once the arbitrator has been selected to hear a particular grievance until all proceedings associated with the grievance have been concluded and the time allowed by law or agreed to by the parties to confirm, correct, or vacate the arbitrator’s award has passed.
♦	The selection, retention, and/or removal of arbitrators shall be confidential.
107
♦	If the number of arbitrators on the panel falls below 14, the procedures set forth above shall be used to select a number of arbitrators sufficient to comprise a full panel of 14.
An arbitrator for a grievance shall be selected from the panel in the following manner:
♦	Within 5 days of a grievance being moved to arbitration, the parties will meet to select an arbitrator.
♦	The names of 7 arbitrators from the panel shall be drawn randomly and shall comprise the “case panel.” The Company and Union shall alternatively strike names from the case panel until one name remains, who shall be the arbitrator. The party striking first shall be decided by a coin toss.
The Company and Union agree to jointly advise the arbitrator in writing of his/her retention.
If an arbitrator is unwilling or unable to serve, a new arbitrator shall be chosen from a new case panel.
The Company and Union will jointly advise the arbitrator that his/her decision is required within 30 days after receipt of closing arguments or briefs.
After 10 arbitrations have been completed under this procedure, either party may notify the other in writing that it no longer wants to use it. Should this occur, the parties will resume using the procedure set forth in the Amended Agreement in effect on March 1st, 1994.
108
ARTICLE X - TERM
This agreement shall take effect on the 1st day of September 2011, for the period from the 1st day of September 2011, to the last day of August 2015, inclusive, and shall continue in full force and effect from year to year thereafter unless written notice is given by either party hereto to the other at least 60 days prior to the annual anniversary date requesting that the agreement be canceled.
If not canceled, as above provided, then this agreement shall continue in effect from year to year; however, it is further provided that if either party desires to amend the agreement as of any anniversary date, then it shall so notify the other party in writing at least 60 days prior to that anniversary date. If a notice of amendment has been filed with either party by the other then this agreement shall remain in full force and effect until an amended agreement is concluded.
It is understood between the parties that the current provisions of the contract between the parties allows either party to provide written notice of cancellation.

SICK LEAVE AGREEMENT
This Agreement made as of the 11th day of June, 1973, between San Diego Gas & Electric Company, herein called “Company,” and Local Union No. 465, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, herein called “Union,”
Witnesseth:
Whereas, Company has a sick leave plan which has applied to Company employees for many years, and
Whereas, Section I.11 of the Amended Agreement between the Company and the Union has provided in part as follows:
“Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as cause for the Company to abrogate or reduce the scope of any plan or rule beneficial to the employees existing at the time of the adoption of this agreement with respect to...sick leave...”
and,
Whereas, Union is desirous of having such sick leave plan included in an Agreement with the Company and
Whereas, Company has no objections to such sick leave plan being included in such Agreement,
Now, therefore, it is hereby agreed by and between said parties as follows:
Key provisions of the Company sick leave plan for Union-represented employees are as follows:
135
General
1.	The allowance of sick leave with pay is for regular employees only. There must be a good-faith basis for the application for, and approval of any such compensation since it is not intended to be used to cover time lost as a result of excessive indulgence or hazardous pastimes. Sick leave will not be allowed when absence is due to, willful misconduct, or any injury incurred while self-employed or employed by others than the Company.
2.	“Current” sick leave is an annual allowance primarily intended to provide for illness during a particular year. “Extended” sick leave, accumulated from a portion of previous current allowances, is primarily intended to alleviate distress during prolonged illnesses when the current allowance has been exhausted.
3.	Application for pay from the extended sick leave reserve must be accompanied by a doctor’s statement; but, at the discretion of the Company, the doctor’s statement may be waived. Granting of pay from an employee’s current sick leave or extended sick leave allowance is subject to approval by the employee’s supervisor.
4.	Each employee who is a regular employee on or before January 1 of any calendar year will be allowed 10 working days (80 hours) current sick leave with pay during that year. An employee who attains regular status during the year will receive a prorated allowance.
5.	A regular employee whose absence continues into a new calendar year will receive the full 10 days (80) hours current sick leave allowance for the new year, effective at the beginning of that year, if employee received full pay on the
136
last normal work day of the preceding year. An employee who does not have sufficient continuous sick leave or vacation to provide full pay through the last normal work day of the year shall not be allowed to take time off without pay for the last work day of the year. If employee does not receive full pay on the last normal work day of the preceding year, the employee is not entitled to any current sick leave allowance until employee returns to work. At that time the employee’s current sick leave allowance will be prorated for the balance of the year.
6.	At the end of the calendar year, all of the employee’s unused current sick leave allowance will be transferred to the employee’s extended sick leave allowance.
Time Off - Medical and Dental Appointments
7.	Employees should attempt to receive necessary medical and dental attention while on their own time. Approval to charge such time off for medical or dental appointments to current or extended sick leave (in half hour increments) will be granted to an employee provided the following conditions are met:
(a)	Absence from work will be kept to a minimum.
(b)	The employee can be spared from the job without the necessity of providing a relief employee.
(c)	Approval for such time off is obtained in advance.
Time Off - Funerals
8.	An employee may be granted up to four days off with pay when there is a death in the employee’s immediate
137
family. “Immediate family” shall be defined as spouse, mother or father, son or daughter, brother or sister, and grandmother or grandfather.
An employee may be granted up to one day off with pay to attend the funeral of other relatives, provided that:
(a)	A close relationship or moral obligation exists.
(b)	The relative is a father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, aunt or uncle.
(c)	The Company is satisfied that the employee’s absence is valid.
Time Off - Illness in Family/Pregnancy of Wife
9.	An employee may be granted time off when their spouse or minor children, who reside in the employee’s household, are ill and their presence is required at home to care for them or to make arrangements for their care. Time off may also be granted to an employee when his wife, who resides in the employee’s household, reaches the end of pregnancy, and the employee is needed to take his wife to the hospital, to remain at the hospital during delivery of the child, or to care for other minor children in the family. Such time off may be granted by the employee’s department head. Time off, may be charged to current sick leave, with a maximum of ten days in a calendar year. Extended sick leave may not be used for time off for illness of a spouse or minor children or during the pregnancy and delivery of a newborn child by a spouse.
Leave of Absence
10.	A reduction in an employee’s current sick leave allowance will be made if an employee takes a leave of
138
absence in excess of thirty calendar days. The basis for such reduction will be a ratio of the number of working days off without pay to the total number of working days in a year (taken to be 261 days). This ratio, applied to eighty hours and rounded to the nearest half hour, will give the amount of reduction.
Example: Two months leave of absence spanning 44 working days
44/261=17%
17%X80 hours = 13.6 hours
The employee’s current sick leave allowance would be reduced by 13.5 hours.
Sick Leave of Absence
11.	A regular employee who will be off work for a pro-longed period without pay due to illness or injury, and who has exhausted all sick leave, vacation benefits, and floating holidays may be granted a Sick Leave of Absence. Such leave shall be equal to the employee’s length of service but not to exceed one year. If the employee is unable to return to work at the end of the leave, or if at any time during the leave it becomes conclusive that the employee will be unable to return to work, the employee will be terminated.
Military Leave
12.	A leave of absence for military duty will not cancel an employee’s extended sick leave reserve. Any remaining current sick leave the employee has will be transferred to their extended sick leave reserve in accordance with paragraph 6.
139
Illness During Vacation
13.	If an employee becomes seriously ill immediately preceding or during their vacation period and is confined to bed or to a hospital, they may request approval for such time to be charged to their sick leave. Such request (which should be accompanied by a doctor’s certificate) shall be submitted promptly and shall require Company approval.
Holidays During Sickness
14.	Employees who are off without pay on the work days immediately before and after a holiday, will not receive pay for the holiday.
Additional Vacation Allowance
15.	At the employee’s option, between their 62nd and 65th birthdays, additional vacation time will be given and will be charged to the employee’s extended sick leave reserve. Such additional vacation will be taken in compliance with the rules governing vacation.
16.	This additional vacation allowance shall be the following percentages of the employee’s extended sick leave which stand to their credit at the time the additional vacation is started:
(a)	Between employee’s	62nd and 63rd birthdays - 10%
(b)	Between employee’s	63rd and 64th birthdays - 10%
(c)	Between employee’s	64th and 65th birthdays - 20%
(with a guaranteed minimum of 5 days)
140
17.	An employee who elects to retire early, after reaching their 55th birthday and before their 62nd birthday, may receive additional vacation in the year they elect to retire. This additional vacation time will be 10% of the employee’s extended sick leave reserve which stands to their credit at the time the additional vacation is started. This additional vacation will serve as terminal leave and therefore can only be taken just prior to and in conjunction with the date the employee has elected to take early retirement. If, for any reason, the employee’s early retirement is canceled, the employee must pay back to the Company the cash equivalent of any additional vacation taken prior to the cancellation of the early retirement. (Effective May 30, 1982)
Protecting the Sick Leave Plan
18.	The Company recognizes that exchanging sick leave for vacation is occasionally beneficial to both the Company and the employee. In such cases, exchanges will be granted at the beginning of the period of illness. In special cases, exchanges will be approved following the absence for illness, at the discretion of the employee’s supervisor. Exchange of sick leave will not be approved if there is a history of sick leave abuse. (per May 5th, 1993 LOU)
19.	Disciplinary action will be taken by the Company in any case where it finds abuse. The Company may require a certificate from a physician or other evidence that an illness or injury is bona fide. Excessive time off which interferes with an employee’s performance on the job may be cause for dismissal. It is agreed that employees who consistently use up current sick leave allowances are unsatisfactory employees. The Union Agrees to share the responsibility in protecting the sick leave plan from abuses by any of its members, recognizing that the plan is intended to provide pay coverage
141
under situations of actual need outlined in the foregoing paragraphs.
The Group Health Plan, the Comprehensive Major Medical Plan, the Pension Plan, the Savings Plan and the Dental Plan are covered by separate Agreements between I.B.E.W. Local Union #465 and the San Diego Gas & Electric Company.
FMLA and Sick Leave
Employees who have filed for and receive an FMLA authorization for a qualifying spouse, domestic partner or minor child may utilize their yearly sick leave allowance (10 days) for such occurrences. Additionally, employees who have 750 hours or more in their “Accumulated Sick Leave Account” may use up to 40.0 hours from this account for such FMLA occurrences in a calendar year in addition to their regular sick leave allowance.

Use of Shift Employees 4 Hours Before or After
This Letter of Understanding is entered into this 20th day of May, 1999 by and between San Diego Gas and Electric
161
Company (Hereinafter referred to as “Company”) and IBEW Local Union #465 (Hereinafter referred to as “Union”).
Whereas the Company and the Union recognize that there is need for clarification on shift employees overtime, and
Whereas, the contract currently provides that:
For the purpose of Call-outs and Prearranged Overtime, employees on shifts may be utilized to perform work that begins up to four hours before their shift begins, and/or work that begins up to four hours after their shift ends, without regard to the “Pre Arranged” or “All Other” Overtime lists.
Therefore, the Company and the Union agree as follows:
1.	In the case where more than one employee would be eligible for the pre-arranged work or the call outs occurring before or after their shift, the “pre-arranged” overtime list or “all other” overtime list will be used to determine which order the shift employees would be allowed the opportunity to work the overtime.
2.	Relief employees filling shifts will be allowed to work either pre-arranged or call out overtime if it will result in a lower final cost to the Company. Reliefs will also be allowed to work pre-arranged or call-outs during the four hours periods prior to utilizing regular employees who are not assigned to the shifts.
3.	In the case of Electric Troubleshooters, the shifts involved are the early shift, which is considered the first shift of the day at a headquarters, and the late shift, or the last shift of the day at a headquarters. On the early shift
162
the permanent troubleshooters would be utilized first, then any relief working the early shift that day. After the last shift, only the permanent troubleshooters on that shift will be utilized before going to the appropriate overtime list.
IN WITNESS THEREOF, the parties have executed this instrument on the date indicated above.

Centralizing of Underground Transmission and Lead Work at Metro C&O
March 25, 2002
The intent of this Letter of Understanding is to centralize SDG&E Underground Transmission and Lead resources inclusive of; qualified employees, material and equipment at the Metro C&O Center.
The Metro Underground Transmission and Lead group will consist of Underground Transmission and Lead qualified individuals. They may perform all in-house splicing on 5,000 volts or less energized; all other voltages de-energized, and prep work on the Underground Transmission and Lead systems for SDG&E. These individuals will have annual training or refresher training for Underground Transmission and Lead skills, as appropriate. Lead assignments may take precedence over all other assignments.
Due to the critical nature of Transmission and Lead issues and the related skills being specialized and often being performed on an emergency basis to maintain service to our customers, a high call-out response is required. Transmission and Lead qualified individuals selected according to this agreement should be aware that this position requires overtime work which includes extended days, call-outs for emergency work, week end work and work on holidays. Those who do not regularly and consistently respond to this specialized work will be removed from this job and may be subject to discipline. Individuals in other permanent classifications such as Electric Trouble Shooters and Fault Finding Specialists will not be eligible for the formalized program.
164
The number of individuals needed for this program will be determined by the company’s operational needs but must include at least one rated Working Foreman E.
Employees in other districts or areas will be allowed to remove de-energized cable and equipment if there is no splicing required, without receiving the special skill rate of pay.
To qualify for this program all applicants will be subject to passing an Underground Transmission and Lead related skills proficiency test and passing a written exam concerning Underground Transmission and Lead skills. Qualifying individuals will be chosen from the composite test scores. Test scores being equal seniority shall prevail.
Volunteers from Metro C&O will be considered for the Underground Transmission and Lead program. Should there be insufficient volunteers from Metro C&O, volunteers solicited via written notice from other districts will be considered. If the addition of a qualifying individual from a district other than Metro C&O surpasses the allotted lineman count for Metro C&O, Metro linemen will be transferred to the district where the lineman vacated. This will be accomplished by transferring those journeymen linemen with the lowest job seniority first.
During the transition to centralizing Underground Transmission and Lead skills to Metro C&O all current agreements and right of assignment abilities will apply.
By the Letter of Understanding all work concerning Underground Transmission and Lead will be centralized at the Metro C&O District.
165

Employees may take two (2) days of a year, without pay, to conduct personal business. Requests will be granted only if Company operations permit. No time off without pay will be granted beyond the two-day maximum, unless absolutely unavoidable, and the burden of proof as to unavoidability is on the employee.

Requests will be granted only if Company operations permit. No time off without pay will be granted beyond the six (6) day maximum, unless absolutely unavoidable, and the burden of proof as to unavoidability is on the employee.

Overtime Administration - Distribution Operations
December 14, 2007
Whereas the Company and the Union are desirous of having an equitable system for the administrations of prearranged and all other overtime for the Electric Distribution Operations department for the classifications of Distribution System Operators and Apprentices, the following is agreed to:
There will be a trial period of one year for the process described below. At the end of the one year, either party can with 30 days notice cancel the agreement and the administration of the overtime will revert to existing bargaining unit agreement practices in force at that time. During the one year trial period, either party may bring forth suggested changes, and if both parties agree the changes will be implemented and documented in writing.
The administration of overtime for the Electric Distribution Operations department shall be:
•	The prearranged overtime and all other overtime lists will be updated weekly and posted by 10:00 AM on the first working day of the week, normally Monday.
•	Any available prearranged overtime for the ensuing work week will be posted at the same time.
202
•	All employees except those on vacation will be notified as soon as practical of any shifts added to the Prearranged Sign-up sheet after 10:00 AM deadline.
•	Any available prearranged overtime posted as above will be assigned as follows:
o Tuesday through Thursday will be assigned at 12:00 noon of the day the available overtime is posted.
o Friday through the holiday weekend will be assigned at 12:00 noon on Thursday.
o Adjustments will be made to the above to accommodate holiday weekends.
•	Any travel time paid will be charged to the appropriate overtime list.
•	Employees who are on vacation will not be called, except in an emergency, to fill overtime regardless of the category in which the overtime falls. Employees are considered to be on vacation at the end of the last regular shift prior to a vacation day until the beginning of the first regular shift after a vacation day. Employees may volunteer to be available for overtime while on vacation by notifying management via e-mail.
•	Employees will be offered overtime based upon the overtime lists. The lists will have the people with the least amount of overtime at the top and other personnel in descending orders by overtime hours.
•	Employees declining overtime will be credited with the hours of overtime refused. The hours refused will be those worked by the employee who accepted the overtime. The overtime lists published at the beginning
203
of each week will reflect all overtime hours worked as well as those hours refused in order to accurately determine the positions on the overtime lists for all employees.
The only valid exclusions to this rule are:
o The employee has a documented appointment with a medical professional
o The employee is sick
o The employee is on state or federally protected leave
•	Employees working overtime under Article II Section II.45 (also known as the “14 hour” rule) will only be charged for the overtime hours worked minus their normal straight time hours. For example, an employee who works 16 hours under the “14 hour” rule will be charged for the travel time, the two hours of additional straight time, the additional shift prior to the employee’s regular shift and the difference between straight time and double time for the 8 hours of the employee’s regular shift for a total of 27 straight time hours.
•	Employees who work rotating shifts and are scheduled to work a recognized holiday will be paid according to the bargaining unit agreement, however, for the purposes of overtime administration the hours will be charged to the all other overtime list rather than the prearranged overtime list. If the employee requests the holiday off, and the day is posted for prearranged overtime then both the employee that requested the day off and the employee that accepted the overtime will be charged for the hours worked on the prearranged overtime list.
204
•	Employees being called out to work will be called and if they turn down the overtime they will be charged with the hours worked by the employee who responded on the all other overtime list. Employees being called at an alternate number or paged for a callout will be given 15 minutes to respond to the page or voice message. If the employee does not respond and accept within 15 minutes of the page, the employee will be credited with the call out hours worked.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Training and Removing Employees from Call-Out List
October 14, 2009
Dear Mr. Hunter:
As you are aware, the Company and the Union have had a long standing past practice with regards to training and removing employees from the call-out overtime list while they are engaged in or have been scheduled for training.
This practice was agreed upon by David Moore & Richard Wagner in April of 1998 and continues to be consistent with our discussion on October 13, 2009 regarding employee training. This letter serves to re-emphasize the Company’s intent to continue the current practice.
I would like to provide clarification in regard to removing employees from the call-out overtime list. Employees will be removed from the call-out overtime list at the start of their shift on the first day of training and the employees will be placed back on the call-out overtime list at the conclusion of the last day of training.
Employee will not be removed from call out list without a minimum of 12 hours notice on the first day of training but will be removed from the call-out list thereafter until training has been completed.
Employees will be eligible for overtime opportunities on weekends regardless of the duration of the training.
206
I believe this clarification is consistent with the intent of the past practice and serve as documentation for the future for both parties

Light Duty -- Work Related Injuries
This Letter of Understanding is entered into this 2nd day of June, 1995 between San Diego Gas & Electric Company (hereinafter referred to as “Company”) and the IBEW Union Local #465 (hereinafter referred to as “Union”).
Whereas the parties are desirous of allowing greater flexibility in the assignment of Temporary Light Duty for work related injured employees,
The parties agree to the following:
The Company will assign initial periods of Temporary Light Duty for up to 30 scheduled days. Requests for extensions beyond this period will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
The Company will assign Temporary Light Duty, as determined available by the Company, first within the regular payrolled classification at the assigned headquarters.
Where the Company determines the productive Light Duty Work is not available within the regular payrolled classification at the assigned headquarters, then the Company may assign tasks outside the
207
individual’s regularly payrolled classification and/or headquarters.
The employee shall be paid at his/her normal classification rate regardless of work tasks assigned or classification in which they are working. Employees shall be paid for hours worked at the employee’s normal classification rate.
If the employee is asked to report to a different headquarters for the Light Duty, then travel mileage will be paid as appropriate as provided by the Amended Agreement.
Necessitated change of schedule during a payroll week to facilitate the assignment of Light Duty shall be made without penalty of overtime under the provisions of the Amended Agreement.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Service Order Management Technology
In the settlement of the 1995 Negotiations between San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Local 465 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the following understanding has been agreed upon:
With the introduction of the new Service Order Management Technology, the Union has raised the concern regarding how this technology will be used relative to disciplinary action against an employee.
The parties have discussed the purpose of the new technology and how it will be utilized to manage the
208
service order process, including efficient management of the workforce.
This letter is to address the assurance that the Company has made relative to its use of discipline.
•	The Company will not use the technology and the resulting volume of information for the sole purpose of disciplining employees.
•	The Company does not intend to assign someone in supervision to study the system information just to find an employee to discipline.
•	It is understood that the performance data in the system may be used to counsel an employee regarding performance issues and may be a part of documenting a progressive discipline case with an employee
•	It is further understood that data/information from the system such as employee location, timely response to automated dispatch/assignment to an emergency order, etc., (two areas as illustrative examples only), may be used by the Company to support disciplinary action given to an employee.
Agreed to on this 12th day of June, 1996.
