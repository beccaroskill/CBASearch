ARTICLE 5	- CLASS SIZE
The provisions of this Agreement are intended to maintain class size at a reasonable and equitable level.
The details of this commitment and mechanism for reviewing a questionable class size situation are as follows:
1. Staffing of the Fresno Unified School District's standard basic program shall be based upon a teacher-pupil ratio of :
K-3*
Grades 4-6
1:20
1:28
Grades 7-9**
Grades 10-12
1:27
1:29
*Subject to continued full funding of class Size Reduction Program by the State of California.
**Classes in grade 9 will be reduced subject to state and federal class size reduction program.
The utilization of such ratios will be established in conformance with the following provisions:
FTA-7
fii. Only standard classroom teachers shaft be included in the computation of ratios. Nurses, librarians, resource teachers, work experience supervisors, teachers on special assignment, special education teachers, or any personnel whose assignment function consists of other than instruction of pupils shall not be included in computation of ratios (except as covered in section 1-C).
B.	The numerical expression of teachers in the ratios shall be computed in the modality of ftjJMime equivalencies.
C.	Persons whose assignment consists partially of classroom teaching shall be
included in such ratios only to the extent of the percentage of their assignment devoted to instruction of pupils.
D.	Neither Adult School nor Summer School teachers/stu dents shall be included in the computation nor be covered by the provisions of this article.
2.	Within standard secondary schools, grades 7-12, an augmentation to the teaching staff responsible for instruction in the core curriculum shall be applied as follows:
A.	This augmentation shall be based only on the number of students assigned to instruction in the core curriculum.
B.	Using the ratios identified in Section 1 above, the number of teachers required for care curriculum instruction shall be determined.
C.	That number of teachers shall then be augmented by 1 /5 of one teacher for each 200 students enrolled in the core curriculum except that the District shall not be required to exceed the 1983-84 augmentation staffing level. This augmentation of teachers will be used to lower class size in classes where the primary responsibility is in the instruction of the core curriculum.
D.	There shall be equitable distribution (up to the maximum stated in "C”) of such teachers to individual schools eligible for staff augmentation.
3.	Nothing shall prohibit directly involving teachers within a department, grade level grouping, or a total school from effecting mutual agreement with appropriate management personnel to vary size groups or classes so as to afford more flexibility in instructional program. This provision shall not be construed so as to constitute license for such agreed upon variance to inequitably affect the loads/class sizes of other teachers not directly involved with the program mechanism as described.
4.	It is recognized that within individual schools it is desirable to equitably level classes as soon as possible in the school year and to effect a balance among classes in the several disciplines. To enhance such balance in each instructional area, it is expected that schools will be governed by the following process.
FTA-8
A After augmentation identified in Section 2 above, the number of sections required in each instructional area will be determined.
B.	The average class size in each instructional area will then be established by dividing the number of students enrolled in that area by the number of sections identified. The augmentation of teachers used in basic skills shall not be used in determination of averages.
C.	All classes that are more than twenty percent (20%) above this average or more than thirty percent (30%) below must then be justified by the principal with the advice of the teaching staff within that instructional area. The provisions of this sub-paragraph are not subject to the grievance procedure.
5.	In grades 4-6, all classes having thirty-three (33) students or over shall be assigned a three and one-half (3-1/2) hour aide, unless it is mutually agreed upon between the teacher and the District that no aide shall be provided. The District cutoff date for determining classes with thirty-three (33) or more students will be the end of the 1st and 5th reporting periods. Within three weeks following the cutoff date all aide assignments for the remainder of the semester will have been made for classes of thirty-three (33) or more students. The Association shall have the right to appeal to the Superintendent or his/her designee any alleged manipulation of the distribution of students to avoid compliance with this section.
6.	Both parties endorse improving staffing of certificated school nurses. Toward that end, staffing will increase by 5 FTE's over 1999-2000 General Fund staffing levels for 2000-2001, and an additional 5 FTE’s for 2001 -2002.###

tion, nor otherwise subjected to adverse action as a result of alleged misconduct, without "just cause'’. Applicable standards of ''just cause" are those promulgated by the American Arbitration Association Department of Education and Training herein included as an addendum to this article. While conformance with such standards is an expectancy during all disciplinary considerations, satisfaction of such standards shall not constitute a "threshold issue” to a full merits review.

The District will offer an employee, prior to a disciplinary meeting, the opportunity to be accompanied by an Association representative if one is reasonably available, provided, however no claim by an employee or by the union of an alleged breach of this section by the District shall be introduced into evidence in any grievance or arbitration and no such claim shall be considered by an arbitrator hearing a grievance under this Agreement.

Grounds for ’'progressive discipline” under this article shall consist of the following dismissal categories derived from the California Education Code:
A.	Immoral or unprofessional conduct;
B.	Dishonesty;
C.	Unfitness for service;

F.	Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude
4.	Levels of Progressive Discipline:

B,	Written Warnings
Written warnings issued to the bargaining unit member constitute the first level of formal discipline,
C.	Written Reprimand
Written reprimands for placement into the bargaining unit member's personnel file constitute the second level of formal discipline. The District must append to the reprimand any prior written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied upon for any purpose.
D.	Suspensions Without Pay
A second written reprimand for placement into the bargaining unit member’s personnel file, including suspensions without pay [not to exceed twenty (20) working days], shall constitute the third level of formal discipline.

FTA-46
E.	While progressive discipline levels ma/ not be bypassed arbitrarily or capriciously, it is mutually recognized that certain conditions warrant full or partial bypass of such levels:

2)	"Gross Misconduct” warranting immediate implementation of dismissal proceedings in accordance with the California Education Code;
3)	Serious misconduct of such a critical nature that, in the evaluation of the arbitrator, it justifies bypassing earlier levels of progressive discipline
5.	Procedures and Sequence Governing Implementation of Formal Discipline:
A.	If informal discussions do not resolve the matter, prior to implementation of formal discipline, bargaining unit members will be provided with written statements of concerns, charges and/or attegations along with pertinent circumstancesffacts giving rise to such concerns, charges and/or allegations.

D.	Bargaining unit members shall then have the right to generate full review of formal discipline documents by initiating a grievance at Level III of the Grievance Procedure Article as included in this Agreement. From that point on, review will occur in conformance with the timelines and procedures delineated in the Grievance Procedure and the provisions of this Agreement. Review of written warnings terminates at the close of Level III of the Grievance Procedure.

AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S
TESTS APPLICABLE FOR LEARNING WHETHER EMPLOYER
HAD JUST AND PROPER CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINING AN EMPLOYEE
Few, if any, union-management agreements contain a definition of "just cause”. Nevertheless, over the years the opinions of arbitrators in innumerable discipline cases have established a sort of "common law* definition thereof. This definition consists of a set of guidelines or criteria that are to be applied to the facts of any on© case. These criteria are set forth below in the form of questions.
A "no" answer to one or more of the following questions normally signifies that just and proper cause did not exist. In other words, a "no” means that the employer's disciplinary decisions contained one or more elements of arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and/or discriminatory action to such an extent that said decision constituted an abuse of managerial discretion warranting the arbitrator to substitute his or her judgment for that of the employer.
The answers to the questions in any particular case are to be found in the evidence presented to the arbitrator at the hearing thereon. Frequently, of course, the facts are such that the guidelines cannot be applied with slide rule precision.
THE QUESTIONS
1.	Did the agency give the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or
probably disciplinary consequences of the employee’s conduct?
NOTE A - Forewarning or foreknowledge may properly have been given orally by management or in writing through the medium of typed or printed sheets or books of shop rules and penalties for violation thereof.
NOTE B - There must have been actual orai or written communication of the rules and penalties to the employee.
NOTE C - A finding of lack of such communication does not in all cases require a “no" answer to Question Number One. Certain offenses, such as insubordination, coming to work intoxicated, drinking intoxicating beverages on th© job, or theft of the property of the company or of fellow employees, are so serious that any employee in the industrial society may properly be expected to know already that such conduct is offensive and heavily punishable.
NQTE- D - Absent any contractual prohibition or restriction, the agency has the right unilaterally to promulgate reasonable rules and issue reasonable orders; and same need not have been negotiated with the union.
2.	Was the agency's rule or managerial order reasonably related to the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the business?
FTA ’ 50
NOTE - If an employee believes that the rule or order is unreasonable, s/he must nevertheless obey it (in which case s/he may file a grievance there over) unless s/he sincerely feels that to obey the rule or order would seriously and immediately jeopardize his or her personal safety and/or integrity. Given a firm finding to the latter effect, the employee may properly ba said to have bad justification for bis or her disobedience.
3.	Did the agency, before administering discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did, in fact, violate or disobey a rule or order of management?
NOTE A - The agency's investigation must normally be made before its disciplinary decision. If the company fails to do so, its failure may not normally be excused on the grounds that the employee will get his or her day in court through the grievance procedure after the exaction of discipline. By that time, it is generally conceded that there has been too much hardening of positions.
NOTE B - There may, of course, be circumstances under which management must react immediately to the employee s behavior, tn such cases, the normally proper action is to suspend the employee pending investigation, with the understanding that: (a) The final disciplinary decision will be made after the investigation and (b) If the employee is found innocent after the investigation., s/he will be restored to his or her job with full pay for time lost.
4.	Was the agency's investigation conducted fairly and objectively?
NOTE - At said investigation, the management official may be both ''prosecutor" and 'judge", but s/he may not also be a witness against the employee.
5.	At the investigation, did the 'judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?
NOTE - ft is not required that the evidence be preponderant, conclusive or ’’beyond reasonable doubt". But the evidence must be truly substantial and not flimsy or slight.
6.	Has the agency applied its rules, orders and penalties even-handedly and without discrimination to all employees?
NOTE A - A r1no” answer to this question requires a finding of discrimination and warrants negation or modification of the discipline imposed.
NOTE B - If the agency has been lax in enforcing its rules and orders and decides henceforth to apply them rigorously, the agency may avoid a finding of discrimination by telling all employees in advance of its intent to enforce hereafter a(i rules as written.
7.	Was the degree of discipline administered by the agency in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee's proven offense and (b) the record of the employee in his or her service with the agency?
FTA-51
NOTE A-Ain vial proven offense does not merit harsh discipline unless the employee has properly been found guilty of the same offenses a number of times in the past. (There is no rule as to what number of previous offenses constitutes a "good”, a "fair”, or a "bad” record. Reasonable judgment thereon must be used.)
NOTE.B - An employee's record of previous offenses may never be used to discover whether s/he was guilty of the immediate or most recent offense. The only proper use of his or her record is to help determine the severity of discpline once s/he has properly been found guilty of the immediate offense.
NOTE C - Given the same proven offense for two or more employees, their respective records provide the only proper basis for '’discriminating” among them in the administration of discipline for said offense. Thus, if employee A’s record is significantly better than those of employees B, C and Dr the agency may properly give a lighter punishment than it gives the others for the same offense, and this does not constitute true discrimination.###

APPENDIX A - MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
COMPACT
1.	Ths purpose of this compact is to reflect the commitment of the Fresno Unified School District and the Fresno Teachers Association to meaningfully and in good faith address issues raised in 1999-2000 negotiations subsequent to the conclusion of such negotiations.
2.	Preparation Time for 4th-6th Grades
A.	The parties agree that adequate preparation time is essential to the delivery of successful teaching and, therefore, successful learning. Historically, secondary teachers have been provided with preparation time (usually daily) within the context of a departmentalized scheduled. Recently, class size reduction in kindergarten through third grades has ameliorated much of the pressure regarding preparation time for teachers in these grades.
B.	The parties acknowledge that teachers of grades 4 through 6 usually teach
a longer school day relative to other teachers and sill maintain class sizes hovering in the 30's. Sill teachers in these grades generally have little or no formal preparation time, especially compared to their colleagues in other grades as set forth above.
C.	The District will provide three hour instructional assistant(s) to elementary sites to increase 4-6 preparation time. The instructional assistants) shall be usedfor the express purpose of elementary schools’ plan for 4-6 preparation time, which the schools shall develop and follow consistent with Article 20, Hours, Section 3. B., Preparation Time.
D.	The parties hereby agree to form a joint FTA/FUSD Task Force to develop guidelines for the use of the instructional assistants), review the efficacy of using them to increase preparation time and to monitor their use during the school year.
