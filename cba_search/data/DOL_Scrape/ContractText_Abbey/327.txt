A. When at the time a benefit is to be paid hereunder, the Company's maximum liability calculated in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 20.01 hereof exceeds an amount equal io $75 per employee (excluding employees on layoff or leave of absence without pay) a benefit of $75 , ■ for each full year of qualifying service (employees' qualifying,service shall be the same as their credited service, since their most recent date of hire, under the Rohr Employee's Pension Plan, except that no credit shall be allowed for a fractional part of a year of service) to a maximum of $2,250 for thirty (30) or more years of qualifying service, shall be paid as a lump sum to eligible employees providing the Company's maximum liability at that time is sufficient to pay the employee benefits. If the payment of benefits to all eligible employees in any one month ($75.00 per employee for each full year of qualifying service! would exceed the amount of the Company's maximum liability at that time, (hen eligible employees who retire, and deceased employees' beneficiaries shall receive maximum accrued benefits, fund permitting, prior to other . benefits being paid. Benefit amounts for remaining eligible employees will be equally reduced in accordance with the following example: There are sixteen (16) employees
. involved within the following circumstances:
1.	Two (2) retirees with combined accredited seniority equaling twenty-six (26) years.
2.	One (I) deceased person with ten (10) years, but less ■than eleven (11) years.
3.	Six (6) eligible employees on layoff with five (5) years eligibility.
4.	Four (4) eligible employees on layoff with six (6) years eligibility.
■ 5. One (1) eligible employee on layoff with nine (9! years eligibility.
6. Two (2) eligible employees on layoff with ten (10) years eligibility. :
The Company liability for purposes of this example is $5.20 x I (XX) B/U employees on the active payroll equaling $5,200 a month. Using the base liability of $5,200, the following payments would be made:
Two (2) retirees - 26 years x $75 =	$1,950
One (1) deceased person - lO.years x $75 =	750
Total $2,700

The thirteen (13) remaining employees on layoff have a combined total of eighty-three (83) years of eligibility. The point value is determined by dividing the total combined years into the remaining fund dollars: $2,500divided by 83 years = $30.1. The point value is computed to the nearest dollar. Each point is valued at $30 in the above example. Each employee would receive $30 .x their individual eligibility years/of service.
However, in the event of a subsequent eligibility termination of employees who received such reduced benefit, such employees after such subsequent termination and another minimum period of four (4) full weeks may, if otherwise eligible and if the Company's maximum liability at that time permits, apply for a benefit in an amount equal to the difference between the reduced benefit received and the amount they would have received had the benefit not been reduced under the provisions of this Paragraph 2O.O2A. In the event employees shall be recalled pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. they shall be eligible for all full years of qualifying service since their most recent date of hire, except for years of qualifying service based upon which benefits under this Section shall have been paid as above provided.
B.	Benefits shall be payable to eligible employees whose termination has been extended without re-employment by the Company for a minimum period of four (4) full weeks and who make written application therefore to the Company on the appropriate forms. Benefit checks shall be mailed to such eligible employees at the address contained in such application, as soon during the calendar month after the month in which the written application is fifed as is practical. but in no event prior to the expiration of such four (4) full week period.
C.	The Company shall deduct from any benefit payable hereunder any amount required to be withheld by reason of any law. regulation or legal process. The Company shall, once a month, forward to the Union, a dollar-value report of the' Bargaining Unit ELB Fund,
D.	No employee shall be eligible for any benefit if. during the four (4) week period referred to in Paragraph 2O.O2B above, they received, are eligible for. or claim any benefit under

26-	if current surnames are identical, in alphabetical order of ini-
27-	lials. Effective February 13,1984, changes in surname will have 28- no effect on the established seniority ranking. Employees with 29-	different hire dates who enter classifications on the same dale
30-	will be given seniority ranking by hire date, but only as this
31-	relates to other employees with the same Classi ft cational se-32- niority date. This will apply only before employees acquire plant 33- hire date seniority.
34-
35-	The classificational seniority of employees transferring into a
36-	classification in which (bey have not been previously classified 37- will be determined by the physical date of their assignment to 38-	the work of the new classification rather than by the effective
39-	date of the change in status form. However, employees who
40-	have an approved transfer request (Form 1034) oh file who are 41- retained after an opening occurs in the requested classification 42-	will upon transfer be credited with seniority retroactive to the

11-	date of hire to date of establishing seniority shall be known as
12-	the probationary period for all new employees, employees en-13-	tering the Bargaining Unit for the first time, and former
14-	employees rehired after having lost seniority. Once an employee

12-	during the probationary period will be voided for seniority
13-	purposes. Employees'who transfer from one classification
14-	to another classification will, after working in the new clas-

The following is a sample of the information needed in order to be given consideration for available and future openings:

Occasionally, employee absences or temporary increase in workload in certain classifications required the Company to send temporary recall letters to employees to return to work for extremely short periods of time. (Example: In some cases employees were sent recall notices for one (I) day of work.) In order to alleviate this problem, the Company is not obligated to temporarily recall employees io fill temporary vacancies or temporary increases in the ' workload up to a maximum of ten (10) working days provided mutual agreement is reached with the Chief Shop Steward or the Business Representative.

: employee may be assigned to perform the work of lateral or lower classifications, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) calendardays. when such assignment does not violate the overtime provisions of this Agreement and employees are not on layoff of regress ion from the affected classifications. Should requirements be necessary beyond sixty (60) calendar days, the Company will meet such needs through transfer requests in accordance with Section 22.07. This time period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. This provision is exclusive of the temporary recall provision.

2.	The "Class ificationai Summary” is a brief description of the classification as a whole and distinguishes the classification from other classifications.
3.	The “Typical Work Performed" Section'describes typical and normal requirements of the classifications. These requirements shall be characteristic of and illustrative of the level of difficulty of the classification.
4.	The “Knowledge and Ability Required” Section shall describe in general terms the basic qualifications an employee must possess in order to perform the requirements of the classification.
The Job Description is written Io define and illustrate the level of difficulty of the job and as such shall be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a composite picture of the job requirements.
When a work operation or function is described in the same manner in more than one classification or in different classifications. such work operations or functions ate not distinguishing elements or determinant of ievel of difficulty between those classifications, but are only stated for descriptive purposes or because they are such an integral part of the job that their omission would be undesirable from the standpoint of completeness.
Job relations between employees may include giving guidance and instruction to each other, as long as such guidance and instruction is not extended to conflict with the duties and responsibilities of a Group Leader or a Supervisor.
The work operations, duties and other distinguishing characteristics described in a Job Description are those which are performed under guidance or instruction which is considered usual and normal for the work described.
An employee shall not necessarily be required to perform all of the work operations described in a Job Description in order to be eligible for classification thereunder. However, inability to perform operations described which are required by the assigned job may constitute cause for reclassification.
An employee shall not be eligible for classification under a Job Description by reason of performing isolated or singular duties that are incidental to his/her job but which are described in the other Job Description.
65
1	- H. A Job Description shall not be construed so as to grant or con-2-, cede an employee or group of employees any right to refuse to 3-. perform assigned work for the reason that such work is not 4,-' described specifically in the Job Description for his/her job clas-5- . siflcation or is described in another Job Description.
6-
7-	1.	Although reference is frequently made in the Job Descriptions
S-	to aircraft work and to airplane parts, assemblies, etc., it is not
9-	the intent to limit the work defined to aircraft manufacture.
10-	When other products are manufactured, it is understood that
11-	these descriptions shall still-Ire used, when applicable, in as
12-	much as their primary purpose is to establish a level of difficulty.
13-
14-	J. A"Giossary of Terms" stating agreed upon definitions of terms 15-	■ and meanings of words shall be established and recorded in
16-	writing to clearly indicate usage, intent, and meaning, and these
17-	terms and word meanings shall be consistently used and
>X-	applied in ail Job Descriptions.
19-	■
20-	K. .This Statement of Policy is, not intended to approve any 21- . r , .misclassification, nor is it intended to bar correct classification 22-	of any work or any employee, nor to bar grievances alleging

J- TOLERANCES, CLOSE
2- Means those tolerances which are held by the machine, operator and/ 3- or fixture with great or special care, effort or skill on the part of the 4- worker. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than precise-5- ness of linear, angular or other measurement.
6-
7-	TOLERANCES. COORDINATED
X- This expression is used only when exacting tolerances are implied, 9- i.e.. exacting tolerances are to he associated always with "coordinated 10* dimensions." "coordinated tolerances" unless modified expressly. It 11* should be understood that the mere location of a point by two or more 12- reference dimensions does not. in iiseif. mean that dimensions themselves 13- are coordinated. An example of truly coordinated dimensions is shown 14- in the following: The precision dimensions between two holes must be 15- held while at the same time the precision dimensions locating each of the J 6- holes must also be held with respect to another reference'point or line. 17-
IX- TOLERANCES, EXACTING
19- Those tolerances, which, to obtain or hold, require extra careful atten-20- tion and the application of much job knowledge on the part of a skilled 21- worker, whether on machine or hand operations. These tolerances 22- would be difficult, if not impossible, for a semi-skilled or unskilled 23- worker to hold consistently with good output. This term expresses a 24- level of difficulty required to obtain or hold the tolerance rather than a 25- preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement. * ' ■ 26-
27 TOOLING, STANDARD
2X- Those tools or tooling used on the same or different types of machines 29- or operations, principally in making a set-up for either layout or ma-30- chining and occasionally for bench assembly work and which further 3J- are found commonly in nearly all shops and industries performing 32- similar operations. In the machine shop it would include vee blocks. 33- parallel bars, angle plates, chucks, collets, machine vises, a wide vari-34- ety of clamps, bolts, locks and wedges. In bench or assembly work it 35- would include surface plates, table vises, and various common attach-36- ments used on portable and stationary tools to permit holding the 37- work or increasing the scope of the tool.
3S-
39-	TOOLING, TEMPORARY
40-	Tooling which is made or adapted from equipment, material or tooling 41- on hand and which is for temporary use pending completion of a per-42- manent tool or for limited runs (normally not more than five ship sets) 43- where a permanent tool is not feasible.
44-
45-
73
I - WITHOUT THE AID OF TOOLING
2- This phrase means that in some cases where tooling does not exist or is • 3- ,.faulty, the worker may be required to work around such a condition. At 4- times when this condition does not exist the worker may still hold the 5-- classification, provided other qualifying factors of the classification 6- are present in the job.

21-	classification.
23- * Employees whose base rate after a promotional increase is within 24- .	the new rate range of the labor grade of ihe higher classification will
25-	receive Automatic Wage Increases in accordance with the provisions
2b- of Section 35.01. Employees whose base rate after a promotional 27- increase is less than the new rale range minimum of the labor grade 28- of the higher classification will be increased to the minimum.
