ARTICLE 6	- DISCIPLINE
6.01. Cause For Discharge.
(a)	' No employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 17.01, shall be discharged except for just cause. An employee may be discharged without prior warning for dishonesty, willful misconduct, drunkenness, drinking alcohol during working hours on the job, being under the influence of an unlawful controlled substance during working hours on duty, unlawful possession of a controlled substance during working hours, or using a controlled substance at any time while on the Employer's premises, unlawful sale of a controlled substance, refusing to submit to testing for drug or alcohol usage as provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01(b) of this Agreement, serious improper behavior or discourtesy toward a customer or guest, insubordination, failure to report for work without just cause, walking off the job during a shift, fighting, sleeping on the job or willful and malicious destruction of Employer’s property. The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the substance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription. Prior to any discharge for any other reason, an employee must be given a written warning and reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiency. Upon the discharge of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific
5
Wendy’s
conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willful misconduct. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in making the discharge or suspension, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within five (5) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for discharge of the Employee. An employee may not be discharged solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. The Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of its inquiry to guests and of the guests' responses to any Union inquiry within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. Copies of videotapes relied upon by the Employer for any suspensions or discharges shall also be provided upon request, provided the Employer has the copying capability and if the Union pays the reasonable costs for furnishing the copy.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level at or in excess of the current level allowed by law provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol. A positive reading for the presence of any illegal controlled substance resulting from a nationally recognized test such as (and as reliable as) a gc/ms test, shall constitute just cause for discharge.
(c)	Employees with less than three (3) years' service may be offered before, after, or at any time during the grievance process two (2) months' pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating, the discharge. In the event the employee declines this offer when made by the Employer, the Union vyill not arbitrate the discharge unless it objectively determines that, in its judgment, the discharge constituted a flagrant miscarriage of justice. In the event a positive determination is made, and the Union processes the discharge to arbitration, the arbitration procedure to be used, i.e., either type of expedited procedure or the regular, arbitration procedure, shall be determined by the Employer notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18.03.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter, but in any event, , warning notices shall be issued, to employees only at the beginning or end of a shift. Due to the Airport Authority’s Mandate on security and security breaches resulting in the closure of security check point, employees having reported on time but delayed by the security breach will not lead to disciplinary action for the purpose of tardiness. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer’s own employees, and copies, of any relevant cash register tapes shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make
6
Wendy’s
written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice. An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer’s own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action. Employees shall be required to sign all notices for the purpose of acknowledging receipt.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
No employee shall be discharged or laid off on-his/her day off or while on vacation or leave of absence.
6.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
No employee shall be suspended or laid off or have his/her shift, station or days off changed for discriminatory reasons, or for disciplinary purposes unless a prior written warning has been given the employee except where the suspension is for one of the enumerated causes for discharge. All suspensions shall be for reasonable periods under the circumstances of each case. An employee may not be given a disciplinary suspension solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.05. Mitigation of Damages.
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is discharged by the Employer and who disputes his/her discharge was for just cause shall have an affirmative duty to mitigate any potential damages which might result to the Employer in the event the discharge involved is subject to Article 18 - Grievance and Arbitration and an arbitrator overrules the discharge. An arbitrator acting under the terms of this Agreement who sustains the grievance of a discharged employee shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee unless that employee or the Union has affirmatively proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee has fulfilled his/her duty to mitigate damages at all times since his/her discharge.
ARTICLE 7	- REPORTING PAY
7.01. Reasons for Payment.
When the Employer or his/her representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report for work as previously scheduled, for any reasons, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee’s regular rate of pay for his/her scheduled shift, provided, however, that where an employee is sent home because of airline operations beyond the Employer’s control, the employee shall be paid for the hours actually worked or four (4) hours, whichever is greater.
7.02. Discharged Employees.
Employees who are discharged must be notified not later than the end of their shift, except in cases of discharge for dishonesty discovered by the Employer after the end of the shift. If this is
7
Wendy’s
not done and the employee reports for work on his/her next regularly scheduled shift and is not allowed to work, he/she shall be paid for the scheduled shift.
7.03. Early Shift Release.
Employees shall not be required by the Employer to leave work before the end of a scheduled shift on which the employees have commenced work; provided that this section shall not be construed to prohibit an employee, with the Employer’s approval, from voluntarily leaving work early if he/she so desires and being paid only for the time actually worked on that shift.
7.04. Required Training & Communication Meetings.
The Employer may require training and communication meetings. The Employer must provide a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours notice in order to require such attendance. All meeting time referenced above will be considered time worked. An employee who is off on a meeting day will be paid for actual hours of meeting attendance or a minimum of four (4) hours, whichever is greater.
ARTICLE 8	- DISCRIMINATION AND LIE DETECTOR TESTS
8.01. Prohibited Discrimination.
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer or the Union against any employee because of membership or nonmembership in, or activity on behalf of the Union, provided that an employee’s Union activities shall not interfere with the performance of his/her work for the Employer. In accordance with applicable laws, there shall be no discrimination against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, privileges or opportunities for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin, sexual orientation or disability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Employer is permitted to take all actions necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, any actions taken by the Employer to comply with the Americans with Disabilities act to affect reasonable accommodations will be discussed and reviewed with the Union prior to implementation.
8.02. Lie Detector Tests.
No employee shall be required directly or indirectly by the Employer to take a lie detector test.
8.03. Confessions or Statements.
If an employee requests the presence of a Union Representative or Shop Steward and none is available, he/she shall not be required or requested by the Employer to sign a confession or statement concerning the employee’s alleged irregularities in the handling of money, merchandise or supplies.
ARTICLE 9	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
9.01. Shift and Weekly Overtime.
(a)	Overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half the straight-time hourly rate for the following. See section (c) below for exceptions regarding scheduled ten-hour shifts.

The above probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union. An employee in probation with the Employer shall not be eligible for promotions nor preference for bidding.
17.02. Definition of Seniority.
(a)	House seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months an days from the employees most recent date of hire into the bargaining unit as a regular or steady extra employee by the Employer.
(b)	Classification seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into or transfer into his/her present classification on a full-time basis.
(c)	In the administration of this Agreement, each of the classifications listed in Exhibit 1 is a separate and distinct classification.
17.03. Layoffs and Recalls.
(a)	In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary employees within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with their house seniority', provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph {c}), all extra work in their classifications before extra employees are hired, before steady extra employees are offered such work, and to the extent practical, before regular employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day; provided, however, that such employees who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as extra employees for such work in accordance with Section 10.05, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03.

25
Wendy’s
17.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee’s seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in the other classification and prior performance. However, for the purpose of looking at prior performance, effective June 1, 2005, documented verbal coaching/counseling will not prohibit an employee from being considered in a promotional bid. Where qualifications to perform the work in the other classification are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. For purpose of this Article, any employee who has passed the craft examination for Bartenders conducted by the Union shall be deemed to be qualified for a Bartender’s position for this Agreement. For purposes of this paragraph a “promotion” shall be deemed to be a transfer to another classification in which the transferred employee has an opportunity for increased compensation or for subsequent job progression as a result of the transfer. Any permanent vacancy that is not filled pursuant to 17.04(b), and which would constitute a “promotion” compared to another bargaining unit classification, shall be filled in accordance with this Section, provided there is a qualified bidder. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for ninety-six (96) hours at a central location in Human Resources, with copies of each shift being posted in a predesignated location in each terminal for notification purposes only. In order for any employee to be considered for a posted shift, they will be required to sign the original bid sheet posted in Human Resources. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted shall be transferred back to his or her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a.temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring to transfer. An employee transferred under this1 section shall not be eligible for another such transfer for six (6) months. An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) working days from the date of transfer. Only the first three vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists.
(c)	The Employer and the Union hereby explicitly adopt the "60% rule" in application of Article 17. Under this rule, an employee's shift or station is deemed so changed as to be a new, vacant position when the shift or station is less than sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change. Conversely, if the shift or station remains at least sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change, the incumbent employee keeps the shift or station despite the change, and there is no bidding.
26
Wendy’s
The Employer and the Union further explicitly agree that the 60% rule applies to changes from eight (8) hour to ten (10) hour shifts. Where, after the change, the shift is still at least sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change, the incumbent employee who had the 8 hour shift is entitled to the new, ten (10) hour shift. If the new, ten (10) hour shift if less than sixty percent (60%) of the previous eight (8) hour shift, then it is considered to be new, vacant and subject to bid.
17.05. Break in Continuous Service and Seniority.

(a)	The employee quits.
(b)	The employee is discharged for just cause.

(d)	The employee is absent, due to injury or illness sustained during the course of employment, exceeding the period for which statutory, temporary, total disability payments are payable under the State Industrial Insurance System, provided; that the employee shall have one (1) week after his/her written release from the State Industrial Insurance System in which to return to work.
(e)	The employee is absent because of layoff exceeding six (6) months if he/she had less than six (6) months of active employment when the layoff began, or absent because of layoff exceeding twelve (12) months if he/she had six (6) or more months of active employment.
(f)	The employee is absent exceeding six (6) months because of illness or injury not compensable under the State Industrial Insurance System if he/she had less than six (6) months of active employment when the absence began, or is absent exceeding twelve (12) months because of such illness or injury if he/she had six (6) months or more months of active employment when the absence began.
17.06. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 17.03 shall be notified to return to work by the. Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail return receipt requested or other available means of communication of the date and time the employee is to report, and by confirming such communication by certified mail, return receipt requested to the employee’s current address of record on file with the Employer. A copy of the confirmation letter shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given an employee being recalled.
