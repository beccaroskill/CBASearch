The purpose of those benefits is to provide a portion or all of an employee’s pay during the time the employee would otherwise be on medical leave of absence without pay pursuant to the Kern County Civil Service Rules. Catastrophic leave benefits are contingent on the receipt of donated vacation time in the manner described below.
B.	Catastrophic leave shall conform to the rules for leave of absence without pay set forth in the Kern County Civil Service Rules except that, during that portion of the leave of absence, which is also a catastrophic leave, the employee will be paid. Although employees on catastrophic leave will receive catastrophic pay, for all other purposes, except as indicated below, such employees will be considered on leave of absence without pay pursuant to the Kern County Civil Service Rules and they shall not accrue any leave rights while on catastrophic leave.
C.	In no event may an employee take more than six (6) months of catastrophic leave during any twelve (12) month period. Catastrophic leave and leaves of absence without pay shall run concurrently.
D.	An employee is eligible for catastrophic leave when the employee faces financial hardship due to injury or prolonged illness of the employee or employee’s spouse, parent or child (based on medical evidence) and the employee is absent from work caring for himself or herself or family members.
E.	Employees governed by this MOU may donate vacation time to another employee who meets the conditions described
above. Employees may not, however, donate sick leave or CTO.
F.	Employees (or their designees) requesting establishment of a catastrophic leave bank must submit a written request to
the Personnel Department. The request must provide sufficient information to enable the Director of Personnel to determine whether the reason for the leave qualifies as catastrophic. This information will be maintained confidentially to the extent required by law. Catastrophic leave requests for injury/illness must include supporting medical verification from a licensed physician. If the request is for a family member, it should also specify that the employee’s attendance of the ill or injured family member is required. Leave requests must include the estimated date of return to work
G.	It is the responsibility of the employee or co-workers to canvass other employees for the donation of leave credits, however; donations are voluntary; coercion of fellow employees is strictly prohibited. Donations must be made on the County approved authorization form. All donations are irrevocable.

Section 3.	Golden Handshake
A.	Preamble
WHEREAS, the County of Kern recognizes a revenue shortfall could occur in some budget units during the term of this MOU, and said shortfall may only be met by a downsizing of operating departments which will require the deletion of filled positions causing the layoff of permanent County employees represented by CCAPE, the COUNTY and CCAPE have agreed to exercise the provisions of Government Code 31641.04 of the County Employees' Retirement Act of 1937 ('37 Act) (commonly called the Golden Handshake) adopted by Kern County Ordinance G 5621 on September 21, 1991, to mitigate, where possible, the numbers of employees that must be laid off pursuant to the provisions of Kern County Civil Service Rule 1300.
B.	Adopted Provisions
The Kern County Board of Supervisors, will, by board resolution, grant two (2) years of additional service credit to specified eligible employees who retire during times to be specified by Board Resolution.
C.	Criteria
The County and CCAPE further agree to the implementation of 31641.04, the Golden Handshake, subject to the following criteria:
1.	The offering will be made only to eligible members holding positions within the departments specified by Board Resolution, and whose retirement would logically prevent the layoff of a less senior employee. In no instance will the County be required to make the offering, if the said offering would forseeably result in an operational detriment.
2.	The number of employees offered a Golden Handshake within a department and classification, or classification series or logical progression of classifications will be limited to the number of position deletions necessary to achieve the financial objectives of the specified departments. In no event will the resultant retirements exceed the number of positions deleted.
18 of 26
Version 4
3.	In the event the operation of criterion 2 above, results in an excess number of employees desiring to participate in the Golden Handshake program, the eligible employees will be offered the retirements in descending order of county seniority as seniority is defined in Civil Service Rule 1310.80.
4.	The department head or appointing authority of a specified department will be allowed the discretion to determine the classifications and number of eligible employees (within the criteria stated above) to which this offering will be made. This discretion, however, must be applied reasonably within the stated goal, of, whenever possible, avoiding the layoff of a permanent employee.
D.	Paid Leave Balances
The County and CCAPE further agree, notwithstanding the provisions of any other existing MOU, statute, rule or ordinance, to the following:
1.	Earned sick leave payoffs, as provided in Article IV, Section 2 of this MOU will be deferred and paid as follows:
a.	One half of the qualified payoff amount will become payable upon retirement; and
b.	One half of the qualified payoff amount will become payable twelve (12) months following retirement.
2.	Earned vacation payoffs, as provided by law and ordinance, will be deferred and paid as follows:
a.	One half of the qualified payoff amount will become payable upon retirement; and
b.	One half of the qualified payoff amount will become payable twelve (12) months following retirement.
3.	No interest shall be earned or paid on the deferred eligible payoff amounts.
4.	Any retiring employee may elect to request a salary advance against his/her accumulated sick leave or vacation payoff balance for the purpose of buying back any eligible prior service time, as permitted by ordinance. An advance may be made up to the total amount needed, after the deduction of payroll taxes, as determined by KCERA, to buy back eligible service time in order to receive credit in the KCERA retirement system. Any remaining balance of accumulated sick leave or vacation credit will be paid in equal installments as provided above.
E.	Disputes
Because of the time lines involved in this program, the parties agree to the following procedure for the resolution of any disputes that may arise from application of Article VI, Section 3 of this MOU.
1.	A five (5) person panel comprised of the Assistant Administrative Officer, the Employee Relations Officer, the Director of Personnel (or, in his absence, the Assistant Director), the director of the specific department, and the Executive Director of the CCAPE, will be formed to adjudicate disputes.
2.	An employee who believes himself/ herself aggrieved by operation of this Section of this MOU may submit
his or her complaint in writing to the Assistant County Administrative Officer, who will call a meeting of the above-defined panel.
3.	The complainant and his/ her representative may appear before the panel and present relevant evidence and/or
argument to support his/her claim.
4.	A complaint must be submitted within 5 calendar days of the employee's belief he/she has been aggrieved.
5.	The panel will reach a decision on the complaint and said decision of the panel will be final and binding upon
the parties.

The arbitration procedure will be informal and private. The arbitration procedure shall not be bound by any of the rules of evidence governing trial procedure in state courts.
The arbitrator will not have the power to add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the provisions of any MOU, Rules, Regulations, or Ordinances of the County of Kern.
