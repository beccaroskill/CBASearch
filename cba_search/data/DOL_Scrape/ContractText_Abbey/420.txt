AGREEMENT
RECOGNITION AND DURATION
This Agreement is made and entered into this 14th day of March, 2010, by and between Verizon California Inc., hereinafter referred to as "Company," and the Communications Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as "Union." It is agreed that:
1.	The Company recognizes the Union as the collective bargaining agent for all hourly-paid employees, excluding all other employees (professional employees, managerial employees, guards, supervisors as defined in the Act, and confidential employees as agreed to by the parties), during the life of this Agreement for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment pursuant to National Labor Relations Board Certification, dated September 13, 1967.
1.1	The Company agrees to provide in the contract of sale or assignment of its business or any portion thereof, should this occur, that the purchaser or assignee shall be bound by all of the contract rights under this collective bargaining Agreement.
2.	Should any valid Federal or State law or final determination of any board or court of competent jurisdiction affect any provision of this Agreement, the provision or provisions so affected shall be made to conform to the law or determination and otherwise this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
3.	This Agreement (hereafter referred to as "Primary Agreement"), wage schedules, and job classifications listed in Appendix A shall take effect on March 14, 2010, and shall remain in full force and effect until midnight, March 9, 2013, and shall automatically continue in full force and effect thereafter until terminated or amended, in accordance with the following procedures:
R
R
1
3.1	If this Agreement is to be terminated, a written notice must be sent by either party to the other not less than sixty (60) days prior to the termination date set forth above, or not less than sixty (60) days prior to any date thereafter on which such termination is to become effective.
3.2	This Agreement may be amended or modified by either party giving written notice to the other of such desire to so amend or modify sixty (60) days prior to the termination date set forth above, or sixty (60) days prior to the 1st or 16th day of any month thereafter.
3.3	Addendum One, Group Life Insurance, shall be made a part of this Agreement and shall have the same effective date and termination date as this Primary Agreement.
3.4	Addendum Two, Medical Plan, shall be made a part of this Agreement and shall have the same effective dates and termination dates as this Primary Agreement.
ARTICLE 1 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
1.	Management, at its own discretion, shall have the right to select persons for employment, to retire employees in accordance with the provisions of the "Plan for Employees' Pensions," or to transfer employees from one occupation to another or from one location to another if their services are required in another location for a period of six (6) months or more, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein. Any employee who believes he is being prejudiced in the exercise of these rights by Management shall have the right to proceed in accordance with Article 12 herein which deals with grievances.
2
2.	It is agreed from time to time the Company will employ people who do not fully meet the Company's normal employment standards, and place such employees in jobs which they can perform, within their limitations. Nothing in the foregoing, however, will preclude Management assigning these employees to higher rated jobs at a later time if they are qualified to perform the higher rated jobs, provided that such assignment does not supersede a senior qualified employee with a bid on file for the job at that location.
ARTICLE 2 NONDISCRIMINATION CLAUSE
1.	Management will not discriminate directly or indirectly against any employee because of his membership or nonmembership in the Union or because of any Union activity in which he properly engages. Neither the Management nor the Union nor any employee in the bargaining unit will discriminate against or exert either mental or physical duress upon any employee of the Company because of his membership or non-membership in the Union or any other union; provided, however, that the Union will not be liable for the act of any employee who violates this Article and who is not a representative of the Union.
2.	Neither the Company or the Union will discriminate against any employee designated as part of a special class protected by Federal and/or State law.
3.	The use of the masculine or feminine gender in the language or in job titles within this Agreement shall be construed as including both genders.
3
ARTICLE 3
NO LOCKOUT - NO STRIKE CLAUSE
1.	During the life of this Agreement, the Company will not conduct any lockout which will affect the Union or any employees subject to this Agreement.
2.	During the life of this Agreement, the Union and its members will not engage in any strike, walkout or other work stoppage of any nature whatsoever in sympathy with any labor dispute not directly involving the Company or because of any dispute which is subject to arbitration hereunder, and in the event any such strike, walkout, or work stoppage or threat thereof should occur, the Union and its officers will do everything within their power to end or avert the same. Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall be so construed so as to require any member of the bargaining unit to go through any legal picket line but it is agreed that the failure of members of the bargaining unit to go through a picket line established by any labor organization contesting the right or jurisdiction of the Union or the members of the bargaining unit to perform the Company's normal work is a work stoppage within the meaning of this Section 2.
ARTICLE 4
DISTRIBUTION OF AGREEMENT
1.	The Company and the Union will jointly have copies of this Agreement and the attached wage schedules printed and bound into pocket size pamphlets. The Company will deliver a copy of this pamphlet to each employee and sufficient additional copies will be printed to provide both the Union and the Company with sufficient copies to meet their administrative needs. The costs of printing the contract will be divided equally between the Union and the Company.
4
ARTICLE 5
BENEFIT COMMITTEE

At the discretion of the Company, it may retain volunteers based upon their job knowledge and skills. Volunteers shall indicate at the time of separation whether or not they wish to be considered for rehire.

3.	Any vacation payment for which the employee is eligible will be made in addition to the layoff allowance.
4.	If an employee who has received a layoff allowance is reengaged, and the number of weeks since the effective date of leaving is less than the number of weeks pay upon which the layoff allowance was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be considered as an advance to the employee by the Company and repayment of this amount shall be made at the time of reemployment, or through payroll deductions each payroll period at the rate of at least ten (10) percent of the employee's basic wage rate until the amount is fully repaid.

14
period of layoff of such former employee does not exceed three (3) years, his/her net credited service is in excess of one (1) year and he/she is rehired to a classification where he/she is performing service essentially the same as was required in the classification he/she held at the time of layoff.

6.3	If such former employee, upon reemployment, is assigned to essentially the same type of work as at the time he was laid off, he shall be paid at the rate currently in effect for that assignment, and for the period of service which would have been credited to him for wage purposes had he not been laid off.
6.4	Seniority for such former employees shall be bridged upon reemployment and will not be adjusted for the period of his layoff.

Pay shall be allowed for not more than three (3) employees including the grievant.
F.	All issues resolved informally or at Step 1 will neither establish a precedent, nor be referred to in any future grievances, arbitrations, or litigation except on matters pertaining to the grievant in question.

10.	Representatives of the Union or of any local thereof may confer with representatives of Management during working hours without loss of pay, provided the conference has previously been agreed to by Management.
11.	In the event any grievance involves a question of wage status, any wage adjustment which arises out of the final solution of the grievance shall be made retroactive to the date on which the grievance was first presented to the immediate supervisor of the employee or employees affected; provided, however, that if the proposed wage
20
adjustment involves a question of judgment as to the application of appropriate wage in the case of a transfer from one occupation to another or where other circumstances make the determination of an appropriate wage a matter of judgment, retroactive adjustment shall not be for more than three (3) months prior to the initial presentation of the grievance under Section 5, Step 1, of this Article and provided further, that if the wage adjustment involved has resulted from the correction of a mechanical or clerical error, the adjustment shall be made retroactive to the time the error commenced.

2.	Appropriate change in wages will be made with respect to employees who are transferred from one occupation to another in accordance with the following:
2.1	Employees who are transferred to higher wagepaying classifications will be placed on the step of the new schedule which has the next higher rate to the employee's rate of pay at time of transfer. In no event will employees so transferred have their progression steps extended by more than twenty-four (24) months. The employee's progression date, if applicable, will not be affected by such transfer. Employees so transferred who have credit allowed for experience which is not directly applicable to the new job classification may have such credit taken away at the date of transfer. Management may at its discretion place a transferring employee at a higher step on the schedule when it determines it to be appropriate to do so.
2.1.1	Employees who transfer back to their previous job classification within two (2) years will receive wage credit for time worked in the higher classification if the vacancy requires the same duties and skills as determined by management.

An employee who is unable to return to his normal job by the end of three (3) calendar months will be placed on the step of the new schedule which corresponds to his length of wage service and will remain on that new schedule until he is able to, and does, return to his normal job. Employees who are being transferred to lower wage-paying classifications for reasons other than health, permanent physical disability or superannuation will be placed on the step of the new schedule which corresponds to their length of wage service. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, an employee temporarily disabled due to occupational injury will be compensated at his normal basic rate if placed in another job classification during the period of such disability.
2.3	If an employee by reason of superannuation or permanent physical disability, is transferred to an occupation for which there is provided a schedule of wages lower than the schedule under which his current occupation is carried, the initial decrease in his wage will be limited to a maximum of six (6) cents per hour and succeeding decreases will be limited to the same amount and will be made only at six (6) month intervals until the appropriate wage has been attained under the new schedule.
52

2.5	Nothing in this Section 2 is to be construed as restricting Management's right to place temporarily disabled employees in jobs which they can handle during their temporary disability.
3.	The progressive wage increases provided under the wage schedules will be awarded automatically to all employees except occasional employees upon completion of the periods of active employment specified in the wage schedules.

Employees whose services with the Company are terminated for any reason whatsoever shall have no claim against the Company for any benefits provided in the following paragraphs and the accumulated sick leave described hereinafter shall not be considered to constitute any liability on the part of the Company, to such employees, provided, however, that this rule will not be used to discriminate against employees to the extent that they might be dismissed at a time when they might be eligible to apply for such benefits.
1.1	The term "benefits" shall mean seventy-five (75) percent of the employee's stated wage in all cases where the employee does not receive compensation as defined in Subsection 1.2 below and shall mean one-hundred (100) percent of the employee's net pay after application of taxes in all cases where he does receive compensation, as defined in said Subsection 1.2.

1.1.2	In no event during an absence due to
57
occupational injury will an employee's combined benefits be greater than the net amount which would have been payable had the employee worked. Additionally, if the employee is otherwise eligible, the net amount payable will not be less than the net amount payable had such employee worked.
1.2	"Compensation" shall mean the payments made to an employee from any source under the provisions of the Worker's Compensation Insurance and Safety Act, or any other Federal or State law or regulation now in effect or hereinafter enacted, provided, however, that if any such law or regulation shall require the collection of taxes or contributions from the employee and the Company, only that portion of such payments as is represented by the Company's tax or contribution will be considered as compensation.

2.	Employees will accumulate sick leave at the rate of one (1) and one-half (1/2) workdays for each month of credited service up to a maximum of two hundred seventy (270) workdays, provided, however, that after fifteen (15) years of
58
credited service such portions of this sick leave as may have been expended by absences for which benefits have been paid, will be restored at the rate of one (1) and one-half (1/2) workdays for each additional month of credited service until the maximum of two hundred seventy (270) workdays is accumulated again.
2.1	After they have completed twelve (12) months of credited service, regular employees will be eligible for sick leave with benefits as provided hereinafter if they are forced to be absent from work because of illness or injury, or death in their immediate families. Employees will be eligible for sick leave with benefits as provided in Subsection 3.1 of this Article 32 when they are forced to be absent from work because of occupational injury.
2.2	Each workday for which benefits are paid because of absences due to illness or injury will be deducted from the accumulated sick leave; however, absences because of occupational injury or death in the immediate family (in accordance with Subsection 3.2 of this Article) will not be deducted from their sick leave accumulation.
3.	Regular employees who are eligible and apply for benefits due to illness or injury will be subject to a two (2) day waiting period. The two (2) day waiting period will be waived for:
A.	Those regular employees with an accumulated balance of ninety (90) or less days of sick leave at the start of their absence who have received no benefits due to illness or injury during their last twelve (12) months of credited service.
B.	Those regular employees with an accumulated balance of ninety-one (91) to one hundred seventy-nine (179) days of sick leave at the start of their absence who have received no benefits due to illness or injury during their last six (6) months of credited service.

3.	1 All regular employees will be eligible to receive the excess of benefits over compensation for each workday absent because of occupational injury, beginning with the first workday of absence, to the extent of their accumulated sick leave, or for the first five (5) workdays of absence, whichever is the greater. Temporary employees will be eligible to receive the excess of benefits over compensation for only the first five (5) workdays of absence due to occupational injury.
3.	2 Regular employees who are eligible for benefits and are required to be absent from work because of death in their immediate families will be eligible to receive benefits (without a waiting period) for three (3) days.

Benefits will not be granted to employees after they have commenced a vacation or a leave of absence and for this purpose a vacation or a leave of absence will be considered to have commenced immediately after the close of business on the last day actually worked, or immediately after the end of the last shift actually worked. An employee who has returned to active employment after a leave of absence or who has returned to work after a vacation will not be permitted to apply for benefits for an illness or injury occurring during such leave of absence or during such vacation, except that an employee who is unable to return to work because of an illness or an injury suffered during his vacation will be eligible to apply for benefits beginning after his vacation, subject to the two (2) day waiting period described above.
4.1	If an employee, who is eligible to receive benefits and has worked all of the first session, is required to leave work because of illness or injury prior to completion of the greater portion of the employee's second session, he will be eligible to receive benefits after observance of the two (2) day waiting period described above. If an employee has worked the greater portion of his second session and is required to leave work because of illness or injury, he will receive the regular wage which he would have received had he worked his entire shift, and will be eligible to receive benefits after observance of the two (2) day waiting period described above. If an employee is required to leave work because of occupational injury, he will be paid the excess of benefits over compensation in accordance with the
61
foregoing except that the two (2) day waiting period will be waived.
4.2	Employees will not be permitted to exchange days for which they would be eligible to receive benefits for days when they are scheduled to be absent from work.
4.3	Management will reserve the right to investigate any case of disability due to illness, injury or other cause, for which benefits are requested, and in its sole discretion may require an opinion from a physician other than the one in regular attendance, or a statement from the physician in regular attendance and the payment of benefits will be governed by such investigation and opinion. Benefits will not be paid in cases of absence caused by nervous disorders unless a physician, selected and paid by the Company, shall deliver to the Company a statement in writing to the effect that such nervous disorder is sufficiently serious to make it essential that the employee be relieved from work for a definite period of time.
In any event the determination of the payment of benefits shall rest solely with Management which fairly shall consider, but shall not necessarily be bound by, doctor's reports and all other pertinent information.
5.	Employees who are found to be guilty of abusing the foregoing provisions for sickness and accident benefits may be subject to dismissal or to forfeiture of any privileges relating thereto.
62
ARTICLE 33 EMPLOYEE TRAINING
1.	Assignments to positions covered by this contract for premanagement training purposes shall be filled at the discretion of Management. The number of employees to be assigned at any one time will not exceed an aggregate of one (1) percent of the total bargaining unit.

content, and administration of such tests shall be at the sole discretion of the Company and shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions hereof.

64
be certified by written medical evidence in accordance with this article.
3.	Job vacancies will be posted in the manner designated by the Company. Employees may apply for an unlimited number of posted vacancies at any given time.

As outlined in Article 8, Section 1.5, the employee must submit the transfer application within three (3) months after the date of realignment and move at his own expense.
3.2	The Company will notify the appropriate Union representative of any employee or employees of more seniority than the employee chosen and the reasons why such employee or employees were bypassed. Management will also notify the appropriate Union representative of all vacancies filled by request for transfer, showing when such a vacancy is filled, by whom, the seniority date of the selected employee, and wage schedule from which he has transferred.
4.	Selection of employees for transfer to vacancies shall be determined as follows:

65
4.2	An Equipment Maintainer’s right of transfer which is on a lateral basis must be at a work location which is over ten (10) miles distant from the work location from which the employee is bidding. The provisions of this section may be selectively waived at Management discretion.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
FLEXTIME
GTE California Incorporated and the Communications Workers of America agree to the concept of flextime. At the request of either party, the feasibility of flextime will be explored. Design and implementation of a flextime plan for a work group must be mutually agreed to by the Company’s departmental supervisor and the local union. The flextime plan will consist of:
Bandwidth - That time during which the office is open.
Core Time - That part of the day when all employees must be on the job.
Standard Work Day - Scheduled shifts.
Flextime - Flextime available before scheduled shift or after scheduled shift.
Flexible Lunch Break -
Attachment “A” (Flextime Guidelines) will be used by the parties as a guideline to design a flextime plan.
Once a flextime plan has been established, modifications to the plan must be mutually agreed to by department supervision and the local union. If an agreement to modify cannot be reached by the parties or either party wishes to discontinue the plan, the Company’s department supervision or union may cancel the plan with ten (10) work days notice to the other party.
104
FLEXTIME GUIDELINES
Flextime is a concept which allows redistribution of work hours. It does not change the number of hours worked, but merely allows for flextime within a work week.
The goal is to allow flexibility in scheduling with the four basic constraints of:
1.	Accumulating the necessary hours during the accounting period.
2.	Being on the job during core time.
3.	Being on the job when necessary to get the job done.
4.	Working within the established bandwidth.
The bandwidth of the day, that time during which the office is open to employees, is enlarged, giving more latitude in the time span over which working hours can be chosen.
The criteria for operation under flextime rules is as follows:
Accumulated Hours: 40 hours per normal week must still be worked.
Normal Work Day: 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or normal service hours to the public or other GTE offices.
Minimum Scheduling of functions during the day outside of core Service time will be determined on a department and/or unit level Coverage: to reflect actual operating needs. Normally critical functions need to be covered only during the “normal work day” of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. This is one of the important elements of flextime and must be maintained for maximum flexibility.
1)	Normal work week will consist of a 40 hour work week, unless authorized to work overtime.
A)	Relief breaks are to remain the same as at present - 15 minutes duration.
B)	Lunch breaks will be a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of one hour, providing the employee meets total hours requirements. A lunch period of longer than one hour may be arranged with supervisor approval.
2)	While the basic goal is to provide flexible work hours, occasionally it may be necessary for the supervisor to adjust
105
flextime schedules in order to meet the requirements of the job or due to misuse of the program.
3)	Time off during the core period must be approved by your immediate supervisor.
4)	If you are off sick, you must notify your supervisor as soon as possible.
5)	Bandwidth:	That time during which the office is open.
Core Time:	That part of the day when all employees
must be on the job.
Standard Work Scheduled shifts.
Day:
Flextime:	Flextime available before scheduled shift or
after scheduled shift.
Flexible Lunch
Break:
Example of flextime guidelines:
7:30	8:30	11:00	12:00	3:30	5:30
BANDWIDTH				
FLEX TIME	CORE TIME	FLEXIBLE LUNCH BREAK MINIMUM 30 MINUTES	CORE TIME	FLEX TIME
STANDARD WORK DAY
8:00 A.M.	4:30 P.M.
6)	The above is intended to be a guideline. Flextime will vary in departments and workgroups based on what is feasible and agreed upon between the department and the Union.
Each employee should strive to arrive at their work location at their scheduled time. When this is not possible, flextime may be used, provided that it is within the departments’ guidelines. Should an employee require time that deviates from the department guidelines, it must be with supervisor approval.
106

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT HOME DISPATCH
The parties agree that the Company may establish "Home Dispatch" in those locations and among those classifications where it is determined by the Company to be economically and operationally feasible. The Company will develop specific guidelines consistent with the following provisions:
I.	While the Company will determine eligible groups, in general it will be those employees whose normal work assignment makes it possible to start and/or end the tour at a location other than the official reporting location. Home Dispatch will be offered by
114
classification within a work group, as defined in Article 6, Section 16 of the Labor Agreement.
II.	Participating employees will obtain their job assignment and report directly to the location of the assignment by the normal start of the tour in a Company vehicle instead of to a reporting center in their personal vehicle. At the end of the tour, employees will take the Company vehicle home. Travel time to the first assignment and from the last assignment is not paid time.
A. An employee whose first assignment of the day is to a job site outside of the area serviced by his normal work location shall be paid for all driving time in excess of thirty (30) minutes.
An employee whose last assignment of the day is outside of the area serviced by his normal work location shall be paid for all driving time in excess of thirty (30) minutes.
Such time shall be paid at the employee's normal rate of pay and shall be considered as time worked for all purposes.
III.	The Company will implement the Home Dispatch program on a voluntary basis.
IV.	Employees will not be required to use personal time to maintain Company vehicles; however, they will be expected to oversee the condition of the vehicle in accordance with the Company's preventative maintenance program and exercise care in the parking and storing of the vehicle.
V.	Should the Company decide to discontinue the program, a 30-day notice will be given to the local union and employees who are participating. Employees desiring to discontinue participation may be required to provide a 30-day notice. Employees who deviate from the provisions of the program may be removed from participation at management's
115
discretion.
VI.	The participating employee is expected to do the following:
A.	To insure the vehicle is properly stored, operated, and maintained. It is management's discretion, if required, to designate an alternate Company owned or leased parking site to keep vehicles free from vandalism.
B.	To use the vehicle only in performing work and traveling between work locations and the employee's residence or other designated parking location. While the vehicle is at the employee's residence, the vehicle is to be locked and parked in a safe and legal location. The safety cone behind the vehicle is not required; however, a safety check is to be performed before the vehicle is moved. Back-in parking is recommended, where applicable, to avoid backing accidents when leaving for work.
C.	Vehicles are to be used only for official Company business. No personal use shall be authorized. A brief (5-10 minute) stop, while in direct route to first assignment or after last assignment while in direct route home, is not considered personal use.
D.	Passengers, other than those authorized for business purposes, will not be allowed in Home Dispatch vehicles.
VII.	Maintenance and Operational Responsibilities.
Operation and maintenance of vehicles involved with the program are an expense of the business. Therefore, tolls, fees, and other motor vehicle usage costs (except for those tolls normally incurred by the employee between their residence and work location) will be paid by the Company under established voucher provisions.
116
The employee assumes certain responsibilities associated with an assigned vehicle. These responsibilities include:
A.	Adhere to vehicle maintenance schedules as required by Fleet Operations.
B.	Perform vehicle inspections during fuel stops such as: checking tire pressure, water levels, oil levels, etc. It is the employee's responsibility to notify their supervisor of other repair needs such as engine running rough, need for new tires, etc. It is the employee's responsibility to report safety related defects. Any vehicle in need of repair should be brought to the nearest authorized repair facility if safe to do so. The employee should contact their supervisor so the supervisor can coordinate these repairs with Fleet Operations.
C.	The Primary fueling location is the fuel facility on Company property. Alternate fueling locations may be designated service stations within the community.
D.	The Company accepts the responsibility to provide vehicle washing based on the availability in the area.
E.	The employee will account for out-of-pocket expenses for tolls, ice, parking fees, etc. The supervisor will be responsible for advising the employee of the procedures to be followed for both incurring these costs and being reimbursed.
F.	The supervisor will coordinate both scheduled and unscheduled vehicle maintenance. The employee will deliver the vehicle to a designated location during work time and be provided a traveling vehicle by their supervisor, or the vehicle maintenance will be performed while the employee is on vacation. Should it become necessary to perform unscheduled maintenance during working hours, the employee will be
117
provided an alternate vehicle.
G.	If the vehicle should break down while the employee is traveling to his first assignment, the employee's pay commences at the start of their tour. If the vehicle breaks down after the tour ends, the employee will be paid until the vehicle is repaired or provided with appropriate transportation.
H.	While the employee is on vacation, the Company vehicle will be returned, if necessary, to the employee's current reporting location, so routine or schedule maintenance can be performed on the vehicle. Unless the employee's supervisor makes other arrangements, it will be the employee's responsibility to return the Company vehicle prior to vacation and retrieve the vehicle within a time frame to perform their first dispatch assignment after returning from vacation.
VIII.	Meetings.
The Company recognizes the necessity to assemble employees participating in the Home Dispatch Program for meetings at Company designated locations. Meetings may be called by supervisors whenever necessary for: safety meetings, tour schedule bidding, procedural changes, general announcements, paycheck distribution, training, etc. The local union will be notified of the time and location of safety meetings and will have the opportunity to be present. Notification will normally be at least 48 hours prior to such meetings.
IX.	Tours.
It will be the employee's responsibility to be at their first dispatch location at the start of their tour. The employee will work until the end of the tour. Travel time to the first assignment and from the last assignment will not be paid.
118
X.	In the event an employee is required to manually call the Company to receive his first assignment, the employee will have such time for this call considered as work time and part of his scheduled work day. Employees who live outside the calling area will be issued and use a Company calling card or will call an established 800 number if necessary to obtain his first assignment. If an employee's assignment is not available when the Company is contacted, the employee will contact his supervisor or report to a designated work location.
XI.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective March 14, 2010 and shall expire March 9, 2013 unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT INCOME SECURITY PLAN (ISP)
1.	Verizon California Inc. and Communications Workers of America recognize the need for technological change in the business and hereby enter into this Memorandum of Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement). In order to lessen the economic impact upon regular employees who become surplus due to technological change, the Company and the Union agree to establish the INCOME SECURITY PLAN (the Plan). "Technological change" shall be defined as a change in plant or equipment, or a change in a method of operation, diminishing the total number of regular employees required to supply the same services to the Company or its subscribers. "Technological change" shall not include layoffs or force realignments caused by business conditions, variations in subscribers' requirements, or temporary or seasonal interruptions of work.
When technological change brings about any of the following conditions, the Plan shall apply:
A A need to layoff and/or force realign employees in any job title.
B Reassignment of regular employees to permanent
119
headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the employee’s permanent headquarters.
2.	During the term of this Agreement, if the Company notifies the Union in writing that a technological change has created, or will create a surplus in any job title in any work group and/or work location, regular employees meeting the following qualifications shall be eligible for Plan participation:
A Accredited service of one year or more.
B No comparable assignment available within fifty (50) miles of the former permanent headquarters and/or refusal of reassignment to a new permanent headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the former permanent headquarters.
However, the Company reserves the right to apply this Plan to any surplus in force, whether or not it is brought about by technological change that the Company deems appropriate. All elections shall be voluntary and acceptance by the Company will be in order of seniority.
3.	The Company reserves the right to determine the job titles and work group(s) and/or work location(s) in which a surplus exists, the number of work groups and/or work locations in which a surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and locations which are considered to be surplus, and the period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the Company pursuant to this Plan. In no event shall the number of employee elections accepted under the terms of the Plan exceed the number of employees determined by the Company to be surplus.
4.	For those employees who are eligible in accordance with Sections 1 and 2, the Company will provide the following ISP Termination pay benefits:
A.	ISP Termination Allowance of $1,100, less withholding taxes, for each completed year of accredited service up to and including thirty (30) years for a maximum of $33,000 prior to withholding taxes. The ISP Termination Allowance is not
120
prorated for any partial year of service.
B.	In addition to the ISP Termination Allowance, the Company shall pay an employee who has left the service of the Company with ISP benefits an ISP Expense Allowance not to exceed $750, less withholding taxes, for each completed year of accredited service for a maximum of $3,750 prior to withholding taxes. The ISP Expense Allowance is not prorated for any partial year of service.
The combined maximum ISP Termination pay benefit payable as set forth in Paragraphs A and B of this Section 4 shall in no event exceed a total of $36,750.
The dollar amounts set forth in this Agreement shall be prorated for regular part-time employees based on the average hours worked during the last twenty-six (26) pay periods; i.e., average of thirty (30) hours worked per week would result in termination benefits paid at 75% of those set forth in Paragraphs A and B of this Section 4.
5.	Employees eligible for ISP Termination Allowance in accordance with Section 2 will receive a lump sum payment for the entire amount of the ISP Termination Allowance paid in the month following the month in which the employee leaves the service of the Company.
6.	Reemployed employees must complete one (1) full year of accredited service with the Company before becoming eligible again for termination benefits. Those employees who have previously received termination benefits of any kind shall be eligible for ISP Termination Pay benefits based on their most recent date of hire in lieu of their accredited service date as outlined in paragraphs 4 A and B above.
7.	All benefits payable under the Plan are subject to legally required deductions.
8.	Termination benefits shall not be made if the termination is the result of any sale or disposition by the Company, of the exchange or office at which the employee is working, or
121
from which the employee is assigned to work, when the employee is continued in the employment of the new management of the exchange or office.
9.	An employee’s election to leave the service of the Company and receive termination pay benefits must be in writing and transmitted to the Company within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the Company’s offer in order to be effective, and it may not be revoked after such fourteen (14) calendar day period.
10.	This Agreement will be implemented prior to invoking the provisions of Article 8 (Force Realignments) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, when conditions set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement exist as determined by the Company.
11.	Neither the right to effect a technological change, the determination of a surplus condition, eligibility for participation in the Plan, nor any part of this Plan or Agreement shall be subject to the arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
12.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 14, 2010 and shall expire on March 9, 2013. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on March 9, 2013 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.
122
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES
Verizon California Inc. and the Communications Workers of America agree to the following relative to permitting CWA members to cross jurisdictional lines:
1.	This agreement is not intended to supplant workers in either bargaining unit. It is intended to maximize the use of regular employees and lessen the use of contractors.
2.	When a work group is facing a force reduction of employees due to lack of work, the Company may temporarily assign such employees across jurisdictional boundaries to avoid a layoff. The Company will notify the Union in advance of the temporary assignment. The normal duration of these assignments will not exceed 90 days unless agreed upon by all parties.
3.	Employees may cross jurisdictional boundaries when necessitated by natural disasters, severe weather conditions, civil unrest or excessive workload. The Company will notify the Union in advance of these instances. Listed below are a few examples of “excessive workload”:
A.	When sufficient manpower is not available locally to complete a work order(s) in Infrastructure Provisioning, the Company may utilize employees across jurisdictional lines to complete the required work (COEI and/or Outside Plant).
B.	When service order installation and/or repair work is too excessive within one Union’s jurisdiction to meet customer demand given current manpower levels, the Company may utilize employees represented by the other Union to complete the work in a timely manner.
4.	If represented employees of one union possess a skill or have training required to complete a job assignment which is not possessed by represented
123
employees of the other union, such trained/skilled employees may cross jurisdictional boundaries to complete the assignment. Management will take the necessary steps to train a member of the affected location as soon as possible to minimize future similar occurrences.
5.	When bargaining unit employees are assigned work within the jurisdiction of the other collective bargaining agreement in which there exists a higher rate of pay for the same work, a wage differential will be paid. The wage differential shall apply for the entire time of the assignment. This differential will be paid step to step.
If other circumstances dictate the assignment of Union represented employees across jurisdictional boundaries, the Company agrees not to make such assignments without notifying the Unions and seeking approval. Should consent by all parties not be possible, the Company shall determine the alternatives available, based on legitimate business needs, and make a decision to proceed or not proceed with the assignment. The Company recognizes both Unions’ right to file a grievance in such cases.
This agreement is effective on March 14, 2010 and shall expire on March 9, 2013, unless agreed to by both the parties in writing.
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
LEAVE OF ABSENCE - VACATION ELIGIBILITY
An employee who returns from a leave of absence, for which credited service is not granted, will be eligible to take an accrued vacation when he has completed twelve months of credited service, computed from the date he was last eligible for vacation, prior to going on leave.
The required completion of 12 months of service is computed by adding the two periods (1) amount of service accrued between date of last vacation eligibility and the start date of the leave, plus (2) date returned from leave up to the accumulation of 12 months of credited service.
124
Under the provisions stipulated herein, such employee's vacation eligibility date will return to January 1 of the year following the accrual of twelve months of credited service.
For example:
An employee begins a six-month leave of absence, for which credited service is not granted, on 10/1/77. This employee has five years of service and was eligible for two weeks' vacation on 1/1/77. (Note: He would have either taken his 1977 vacation prior to 10/1/77 or have been paid for it at the time he went on leave.) The employee returns to work on 4/1/78.
To be eligible for a vacation in 1978 the employee will have to work three months. When combining the three months worked in 1978 with the nine months worked in 1977, the employee would meet the requirement of accruing twelve months of credited service.
To summarize the example: Employee		
Action	Date	Computation
Leave begins	10/1/77	Employee accrued nine months’ vacation eligibility in 1977 (1/1/77 to 9/30/77)
Returns from Leave	4/1/78	
Accrues 12 months’ service	7/1/78	4/1/78 to 6/30/78
Eligible for 1978	7/1/78	Nine months in 1977
Vacation		and three months in 1978
Eligible for 1979 Vacation	1/1/79	
125

Accredited Service will be applied toward eligible employees' pension calculations until the disability benefits end or the eligible employee retires, quits or dies.
6.	The amount and availability of benefits under the LTD Plan are governed by the provisions of the Plan and the insurance contract.

7.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 14, 2010 and shall expire on March 9, 2013.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
NETWORK SERVICES - OVERTIME (CUSTOMER OPERATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION)
Verizon California Incorporated and Communications Workers of America (hereinafter “CWA” or “Union”) agree that due to occasional weather-related challenges and the fluctuating nature of our customers’ service needs, there are times when all necessary work can not be completed during the normal work day and overtime becomes necessary.
The Company and the Union agree that whenever possible qualified volunteers should be used to perform such overtime work as long as there is no negative impact on customer service, there is no increased cost to manage the business and an unsafe working condition will not be created.
Local Union and management representatives will jointly develop local processes designed to identify and utilize volunteers. These processes can vary by work location to fit local needs. They will be utilized whenever the use of volunteers will meet the needs of our service.
When the workload is so significant that the use of volunteers alone will not meet service needs, it is understood that employees and their supervisors will work together to ensure that the employee’s need for time off and the Company’s need to have all employees work a share of overtime will both be accommodated. During such times, employees who need to be excused from working overtime for either all or part of a given day for important personal reasons should inform their supervisor of the need as soon as possible. Examples include doctor or dental visits for themselves or a family member, weddings or other similar significant family events or occasional child or elder care responsibilities.
The Company or the Union may rescind this Memorandum of Agreement by written notice effective thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice by the party of their intent to terminate.
144
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
NETWORK SERVICES - STAFFING
(CUSTOMER OPERATIONS & CONSTRUCTION)
When the Company identifies the need to fill twenty (20) vacancies or more within the Network Services (Customer Operations and Construction) department simultaneously, the following staffing provisions will be utilized:
1.	The Company will identify all such vacancies by classification and work location.
2.	The Company will post these vacancies and will not restrict any of them to “priority one only” unless the vacancy is in a remote area where the Company must have a trained person because of small team size.
3.	All such vacancies will be posted on the same day and will be filled in the usual order, i.e. priority one, followed by priority two, etc., and in accordance with the usual staffing/contractual guidelines.
4.	If any of these vacancies do not have any qualified bidders they will be staffed externally as is the usual right and custom.
5.	If a Network Services (Customer Operations and Construction) employee is bypassed for one of these vacancies due to the employee being on discipline, Labor Relations and a District 9 representative will discuss the situation prior to an external offer being extended.
6.	Vacancies which are filled from within the Network Services (Customer Operations and Construction) group will be handled in the following manner:
a.	Management will have the right to determine the appropriate effective date for the transfer for each individual. This may be immediate or it may be as long as three (3) months after being awarded the job. At the time the position is committed to the employee, the Company will give them their best estimate as to the effective date.
145
b.	Management may backfill the resulting vacancies in any manner deemed appropriate, internal or external or a combination of the two. In essence, the vacancy will be treated as if it had gone “no bid” without posting it. The Union may not grieve the manner in which management has chosen to fill the vacancies.
c.	At the end of this three (3) month time frame all employees must be transferred to the new job.
7. Any vacancy posted after this initial posting (section 2 or 3 above) will be filled under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and the above modifications will not apply.
This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on March 14, 2010, and shall expire on March 9, 2013.

The existing pre-retirement survivor pension benefit provisions of the Pension Plan shall be amended to provide a pre-retirement survivor pension benefit for an employee who dies, either during active service or prior to commencing a pension benefit, at a time when he or she is unmarried and has accrued at least five years of vesting service.
3.	An unmarried employee may, at any time prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying, designate any living person as the designated beneficiary for the preretirement survivor pension benefit.

2.	ELIGIBILITY
All full-time and part-time regular hourly employees are eligible to receive an award if they are on a TPA Team for 30 calendar days or more. Employees on other Incentive plans are not eligible, i.e., National Sales, Retail, LiveSource.
3.	AWARDS
Awards are based on performance toward objectives over the period of a calendar year. An award amount is determined for the applicable calendar year, a percentage of which may be earned by eligible employees, depending on team performance during that calendar year. The payout ranges from 0% to 120% of an established target.
The range of the Team Performance Award payout is as follows:
Each annual target award is 4% payable in April of the following year. The range is 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
Employees transferring between or changing teams for any reason during the year will receive an award based upon the team in which they reside at the end of the calendar year (December 31). Awards will not be prorated based on time spent with each team.
An employee who resigns, is laid off, terminated, dies or retires during the calendar year is eligible for a prorated Team Performance Award if all other eligibility requirements have been met. *
*In case of Termination for Cause the individual situation will be reviewed to determine if the individual is eligible for an award.
158
Employees on approved military leave of absence who have one year or more service will be given full wage credit up to three months toward the Team Performance Award.
Employees on any other unpaid leave will have cumulative leave time excluded from award computation.
4.	TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITIES
Excused time off for union activity will be counted as time worked when computing Team Performance Awards.
5.	BENEFITS TREATMENT
Team Performance Award payments are recognized in the calculation of Pension Plan benefits, Group Life Insurance, and the Hourly Savings Plan. Such payments will be applicable in the year payment is received. This is in accordance with Verizon benefit plan definitions.
All other benefits are in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and are based on rates shown in the hourly wage schedules.
6.	TAXES, PERSONAL ALLOTMENT
Deductions for federal, state, and local tax liabilities will be made in accordance with lump sum distribution tax laws.
Personal allotments such as savings bonds, and United Way contributions will not be made.
7.	UNION DUES
Applicable Union dues will be deducted from Team Performance Award.
8.	OVERTIME
Overtime payments will be based on an hourly rate which includes both base and Team Performance Award payments.
An employee’s hourly wage Team Performance Award rate for overtime payments will be calculated as follows:
The hourly rate will be equal to actual Team Performance Award divided by 2080 hours.
159
Example of Team Performance Award Overtime payment using Team Performance Award hourly rate:
An employee’s Team Performance Award Payment equals $2080. The employee worked 100 hours of overtime in the award year at a time and one-half rate (100 X 1.5 = 150 hours
paid).
EXAMPLE:
TPA HOURLY RATE
$2080 = 1.00 x 2080
OVERTIME
HOURS
PAID
150 Hours Paid
TPA OVERTIME PAYMENT = $150.00

9.	OBJECTIVES/MEASURES
All hourly employees will normally be assigned to teams based on their functional area of responsibility. Teams may consist of a few employees or many.

NATIONAL MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT HOURLY SAVINGS PLAN (HSP)
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter “CWA” or “the Union”) and Verizon Communications companies, which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or “the Companies” or “the Company”), have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
1.	The Company and the Union will make the Hourly Savings Plan (HSP) available to regular full or part-time hourly employees of the Company who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, by action of the Board of Directors, to modify or amend in whole or part, any or all of the provisions of the HSP, but no such amendment or modification shall have the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of members, retired members, former members or their beneficiaries or of diverting any part of the Trust Fund to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of members, former members, or their beneficiaries and the payment of reasonable HSP administration expenses.
3.	The Company reserves the right, by action of the Board of Directors, to terminate or partially terminate the HSP at any time. Upon termination or partial termination of the HSP or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions under the HSP, the member accounts of the members affected by the termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions as the case may be shall be nonforfeitable.
4.	The HSP may be merged into or consolidated with another plan, and its assets or liabilities may be transferred to another plan; provided, however, that no such merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be consummated unless
189
each member and beneficiary under the HSP would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, if the transferee plan then terminated, that is equal to or greater than the benefit he/she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer, if the HSP had then terminated.
5.	The Company and the Union agree that every provision heretofore contained in this Agreement is contingent upon the Company’s receipt of a favorable determination that the HSP, as amended, continues to be qualified under Section 401(a) et. seq., of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event any recession in the HSP is necessary to obtain or maintain a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company will make the revisions, adhering as closely as possible to the level of benefits contained in the HSP.
6.	In the event any portion of this Agreement is determined by a court or government agency to be in violation of existing law or is voided by a change in existing laws, the Company retains the unilateral right to make whatever modifications it deems necessary and appropriate to comply with the law, including the right to rescind the Agreement, if it deems no such modification is feasible. The Company shall have no obligation to bargain or negotiate with the Union in the event that this Agreement is modified or eliminated or in the event the Company does not implement any or all of the provisions of this Agreement because it does not receive Internal Revenue Service approval, any or all of these plans are deemed not qualified, or because of a change in existing laws.
7.	The HSP will be administered solely in accordance with its provisions and no matter concerning the HSP or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement but rather shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the HSP and the interpretation of the HSP Committee.

NATIONAL MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT HOURLY SAVINGS PLAN MATCH
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter "CWA" or "the Union"), and Verizon Communications companies, which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or "the Companies" or “the Company”), have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;

NATIONAL MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter “CWA” or “the Union”) and Verizon Communications companies, which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or “the Companies” or “the Company”), have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
This agreement between Company and the Union covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing, access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high
191
performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon’s business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) and Verizon Enterprise Delivery, formerly Verizon Select Services. This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) and Verizon Enterprise Delivery, formerly Verizon Select Services as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow
192
that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti-Management.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a “third party” or “outsider”.
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit.
193
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations
194
and responsibilities; and
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election.” This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election.”
(2)	The Union shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The “show of interest” cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this Agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may
195
have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
7.	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the CWA for access, Verizon Labor Relations Staff, in conjunction with local management and CWA representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the CWA representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the CWA that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the CWA are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the CWA commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
196
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of nonrepresented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate CWA representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the CWA that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this Agreement. Either Verizon or the CWA can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days’ written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to
197
abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and CWA believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the CWA agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issue subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN
198
process, shall be split equally by Verizon and CWA.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the CWA, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
