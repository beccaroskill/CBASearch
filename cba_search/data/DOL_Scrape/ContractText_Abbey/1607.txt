Section 2.	All payments shall be remitted to the depository designated herein on Report Forms designated, as appropriate, by the Funds or Council. The Board of Trustees of the respective Funds shall have the option, in their sole discretion, to establish a procedure for the electronic payment of contributions and electronic submission of data identifying employees who worked in Covered Employment, the hours for which contributions and deductions are due and may require that all employers follow such procedures. The Board of Trustees of the respective Funds may, in their sole discretion, assess employers who fail to follow such procedures with a reasonable assessment as determined by the Trustees on each month the employer fails to follow the procedure. In the event that the report accompanying any payment made to the Depository pursuant to Article 5 (Joint Apprentice Committee), Article 16 (Health and Welfare Fund), Article 17 (Pension and Annuity
28___________________________________________________
Funds), Article 18 (Work Dues and Jobs Recovery Dues Check-offs), Article 22 (Political Action Committee), Article 25 (National Apprenticeship and Health and Safety Fund), (Education and Development Fund) and Article 26 (Carpenters Savings Fund) of this Agreement shows that the full sum as therein required is not paid, or is not intended to be paid, then the Depository shall dispose of said payment by distributing to each party such portion of the remittance in proportion to the fraction that each such recipient’s hourly remittance bears to the total hourly remittance required by this Agreement.
Section 3.	To the extent that an employee has not performed Covered Employment during the reporting period, the Employer shall so advise the Funds of that fact in the time and by the method otherwise provided for the remittance of contributions herein.
Section 4	(A). Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, payments not received by the 10th day following the payroll week which the Report covers shall be considered “delinquent” for purposes of this Agreement.
(B).	If the Trustees of the respective Funds, in their sole discretion, determine that an Employer has a satisfactory record of timely payments, the Trustees may notify such Employer in writing that his payments into the respective Funds will be required by the 15th day following the end of each calendar month, which shall be the “Due Date.”
29
Section 5.	Payments received by the Fund or Council later than five (5) days after the due date shall incur and shall include a liquidated damages charge equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross amount due each Fund or Council if submitted after the due date.
Section 6.	In addition to the liquidated damages charge provided for above, the alleged failure of the Employer to make payments when due or payments received later than five (5) days after the due date shall subject the Employer to one or more of the following actions:
(A)	. As otherwise described in Article 14, the Council shall have the right to withhold employees covered by this Agreement until all sums due (including liquidated damages) are paid. If such action shall, in the discretion of the Council, prove necessary or desirable, the employees whose labor is thus withheld, shall be paid their wages and fringe benefits for all time lost pending payments by the Employer as provided in Article 14.
(B)	. The appropriate Funds and/or Council may institute formal collection proceedings that may include, but are not limited to the institution of legal action against the Employer, to secure, and if necessary, to compel payment of the monies described herein. In the event that an Employer is delinquent in the payment of contributions, the Employer shall pay (in addition to the principal sums due and the ten percent (10%) liquidated damages) interest calculated at 6%, all costs of suit (including reimbursement for
30________________________________________________
Fund administrative time) and attorneys’ fees and costs, regardless of whether suit or other formal proceedings are instituted.
Section 7.	The Employer shall, simultaneous with the remittance of monies described herein, transmit to said Depository, a report containing (1) the names and Social Security numbers of the persons to whom this Agreement is applicable, who have been in the employ of the Employer during such payroll week; (2) the number of hours during said payroll week for which wages or any type compensation are payable under this Agreement; and (3) such other payroll information as the Boards of Administration of the Funds herein provided for may reasonably require for the proper administration of said Funds.
Section 8.	Each Employer shall furnish a Bond in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) to ensure the payments required under this Agreement. Prior to entering into any subcontract for work covered by this Agreement, the Employer will verify with the Fund that the proposed subcontractor has a signed Agreement and has posted the fringe benefit bond required under this Agreement. After the Employer has contacted the Fund, the Fund will inform the Employer in writing within 72 hours if the proposed subcontractor does not have a fringe benefit bond, and/or an Agreement. The Employer will not enter into a subcontract until the subcontractor has posted a bond and signed an Agreement.
The Employer agrees that, upon written notice from
31
the Fund that its subcontractor is delinquent in the payment of fringe benefits on his particular project, the Union, the subcontractor, and the Employer shall meet to resolve said delinquency. In the event that satisfactory arrangements to collect the delinquency are not made, a jointly payable check in the amount of said delinquency shall be issued to the Funds by the Employer. This will not preclude the Union from exercising its rights provided in Article 14.
Section 9.	Estimated payments in advance for all payments (except wages) required under this Agreement will be made by Contractors who have not established a current record of timely payments with the Funds.
Section 10.	The Employer shall also, upon request of any agent or designee of the Board of Administration, permit such agent during regular business hours to inspect and make copies of any and all records of the Employer, pertaining to compensation paid to employees, hours worked by employees, monies withheld from employees for taxes paid on account of employees, and all other records relevant to, and of assistance in determining whether the Employer’s obligations hereunder to make payments to the Depository have been faithfully performed. If such inspection and/or audit reveals the Employer failed to make such payments in full, the Employer shall be required to pay for the cost of such inspection and/or audit at the rate of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day as well as any additional monies provided for herein.

Drug Testing Policy
Employees or applicants for employment (hereinafter “employees”) who possess “illegal drugs” on the job site, except for medication prescribed by the employee’s physician or over-the-counter medication, and employees functionally impaired from performing their duties due to “illegal drugs” may be barred from the job site subject to the terms below. As used herein, the term “illegal drugs” means any chemical substance whose (1) manufacture, use, possession or sale is prohibited by law; and (2) any legally-dispensable controlled substance (medications available only as prescribed by a licensed physician) obtained fraudulently or used by any individual other than the person for whom prescribed.
An employee on the job site may be required to submit to a chemical test which demonstrates onsite impairment if a reasonable, objective basis exists to believe that the employee is impaired on the job site. A reasonable, objective basis will exist under the following circumstances:
A first hand observation is made of the employee’s job performance, and documented in writing prior to any tests; and
The employee’s conduct or actions indicating alleged impairment shall be observed and documented in writing by two supervisors on the job site; and
A determination is made that the employee’s
________________________________________________39 conduct is symptomatic of drug impairment by a physician or health care professional qualified to make such a determination following a consultation with the employee.
Persons refusing to submit, underthe aforementioned circumstances, to a test which complies with the minimum procedural guidelines set forth below may be barred from the job site subject to the terms below.
An employee determined to be impaired from drugs on the job site, as a result of properly implemented medical tests described in this Agreement, will, on first occurrence, be offered the opportunity to enter a rehabilitation or counseling program from a list of local programs provided by the Council from which the employee may choose. If the employee enters such a program, his status as an employee will not be affected and he will be allowed continued access to the site under the conditions established by the program.
For purposes of this Agreement, being “impaired from illegal drugs” means the chemical tests results demonstrate on-site functional impairment in accordance with the consensus of the scientific community and at metabolic levels accepted by the scientific community which show or infer functional impairment.
The affected employee shall be advised of positive results by the Employer’s medical personnel and have
1
40______________________________________________
the opportunity for explanation and discussion prior to the reporting of results to the Employer, if feasible. The affected employee shall have the right to have his/ her sample independently retested by a laboratory of his/her choice at his/her expense. If the independent retest indicates that the specimen does not contain levels of substance in violation of the standards set forth herein, the employee shall be put back to work immediately with reimbursement of the tests, costs and full back pay and benefits.
Employees taking prescription medication which according to their physician has physical or medical side effects which could cause impairment on the job site should report the medication to the Employer’s authorized medical personnel for the site. This information shall remain strictly confidential between the employee and the medical personnel. The medical personnel shall in turn disclose any possible limitations on the employee’s abilities to the Employer, who after conferring with the Council shall make reasonable accommodations for those limitations. The medical personnel shall adhere to the American Occupational Medical Association’s Code of ethical conduct for Physicians Providing Occupational Medical Services (adopted by the Board of Directors of AOMA on July 23, 1976) and to the AOMA Drug Screening in the Work Place Ethical Guidelines (adopted by the Board of Directors of AOMA on July 25, 1986).
Any information regarding the test results will be held in strictest confidence by the Employer. Neither the Employer nor any of its medical personnel,
___________________________________________________41 supervisors or other personnel shall disclose any information regarding the fact of testing or the results of testing of any employee to the Owner or to any other employer or employee.
The rules and requirements contained in this Agreement shall apply to management and supervisory personnel to the same extent as other employees.
No employee shall be required to sign any waiver limiting liability of employer, owner/client, testing lab or any person involved in the chain of custody of the specimen nor any consent abrogating any provision of this Agreement.
The Council is not responsible for ascertaining or monitoring the drug-free status of any employee or applicant for employment.
The Employer shall provide training to all management, security and supervisory personnel who have responsibility for the oversight of employee activities or work performance, in the recognition of impairment from drugs and work place materials or substances that may cause physical harm or illness. Such training will include the observation, documentation and reporting skills necessary for compliance with this Policy, and procedures and methods for work place substance evaluations and analysis.
All employees, upon hire, shall receive instruction in, and a copy of the policies and rules applicable
42____________________________________________________
to their employment and work assignments prior to access to the project.
The Employer shall establish and implement a program that assures that all managers, supervisors and employees are instructed in any changes in the existing procedures and methods.
Subject to the restrictions on medical tests contained in the Agreement, bodily fluids such as blood and urine samples shall be handled in the following manner:
Collection shall be by a physician or health care professional. Specimen containers shall be labeled with a number and the donor’s signature and shall be closed with a tamper-proof seal initialed by the donor and collecting agent. The labeling shall be done in the employee’s presence and in the presence of a Council representative if the employee chooses.
The specimen number and identifying information on the donor shall be entered on a log and signed by the collecting technician in the presence of the employee — and that of a Council representative if the employee chooses — and the employee shall initial the proper line on the log entry.
The volume of such sample shall be such that sufficient amounts will remain for both confirmation tests and independent testing.
Samples shall be stored in a scientifically acceptable manner.
F
____________________________________________________43
All handlers and couriers of the sample must complete entries and identify themselves on a proper chain of custody form.
Confirmation tests by an alternative scientific method must be performed. After testing and confirmation testing, the facility must retain a sufficient portion of the sample for independent retesting and store that portion in a scientifically acceptable, preserved manner for thirty (30) days — unless the employee or the Council requests an extension of time.
Results shall be communicated in writing to the Employer’s medical personnel within seventy-two (72) hours. The laboratory may only report drug concentrations if the appropriate test indicates that the specimen contains levels of substance(s) in violation of the standards established by this Agreement. Information on test results and the fact of testing shall be communicated only to those who must know the information in order to ensure safety and enforce the Agreement’s rules. Copies of all documents — including but not limited to test results, computer printouts, graphs, interpretations, and chain of custody forms — shall be delivered to the donor.
On the day that the sample is taken, the Employer may send the employee home for the remainder of the day, but shall arrange transportation at its expense and not allow the employee to drive home.
