N.	Pupil-Teacher Ratio
Pupil-teacher ratios in the Springfield Public Schools computed on a building by building basis are:
Kindergarten
Grade 1-6
Grade 7-12
Putnam Vocational Technical High School
Academic Classes
Shop Classes
23-1*
28-1*
21-1
25-1
17-1
*See Memorandum of Agreement relative to smaller instructional units in basic skills.
Method of Computation:
The pupil-teacher ratio of a school is derived by dividing the pupil membership on October 1 or March lf by the number of teachers, not including the principal, assistant principals, librarians, guidance counselors, and including all part-time teachers for the fraction of their time which they spend in the school.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee and the Association agree that class size reduction is desirable and that this is the beginning of a process that will lead to a reduction in class size throughout the system. Class size reductions will be made using the agreed upon class size maximums subject to the following conditions:
1.	Maximum class size:
a.	2000 - 2001 Kindergarten 25
b.	2001 - 2002 Kindergarten 25 & 1st grade 25
c.	2002 - 2003 Kindergarten 25 & 1st grade 25 & 2nd grade 25
2.	After all classes have reached the maximum, the Superintendent, for reasons of health and safety, transportation costs or a sibling already in a school, may assign up to two (2) additional students above the class size limitations. There will not be any appeal to the Superintendent’s decision.
3.	Gymnasiums and libraries will not be closed to meet class size maximums nor will new portables be leased or purchased for the purpose of class size reduction.
10
4.	The two-way bilingual model requires two (2) teachers in a classroom, and these classes will have up to fifteen (15) students per teacher.
5.	Federal and state regulations for special education shall supersede class size maximums and in some instances will be lower (see Article 8 D.) Where special education students are integrated into the homeroom for that portion of the day, they will not be counted in the class size maximum.
6.	Each school's program will dictate the class size for chorus (not music) and physical education; they will not be subject to the class size maximum; however, the goal in these two areas is to keep the class size as close to the class size maximum as is practicable.
7,	The Committee and the Association agree that a Facilities Expansion Program is required to implement the agreed upon class size maximum. Ths Committee and the Mayor are committed to the Program, and the Association is committed to supporting the Program, The class size maximums must coincide with the Program, and where there is no room, the class size maximum cannot be imposed The Parties' bargaining sub-committee will continue its work on class size and the student assignment process
8,	The Parties will re-examine and negotiate this clause in the next Agreement.
O.	Teacher Certification
No teacher covered by this Agreement shall be employed unless certified by the Massachusetts Department of Education or granted a waiver by the State Department of Education.
Teachers shall be assigned to teach in their area of certification as determined by the regulation of the State Department of Education. Teachers will be allowed to teach outside his/her area of certification only to the extent allowed by the State Department of Education. In the instance where 1,R.eduction-In-ForceN takes place, this language will not be used to arbitrarily or capriciously reduce a full time teacher to part-time,
P,	Parent-Teacher Conferences
Parent-teacher conferences at all school levels will be scheduled at the request of the teacher and/or parent. (This applies to the number and frequency of conferences),
Q.	Conditions of Instruction and Responsibilities of Teachers
1.	Unannounced visits by the principal and/or assistant principal(s) are to be anticipated.
2.	The parties agree that a teacher’s primary function is to teach, therefore:

c.	Except in emergency situations, teachers shall not be required to assume any office duties in the event of absence of office personnel.
d.	Parents/guardians of our students, as parents/guardians everywhere, are desirous of a report card that is, to the extent possible, personalized for their child. Therefore, while report cards for elementary students may be objective and standardized, it is recommended, but not required, that teachers include their own comments relative to a student's achievement. Teachers will exercise their professional discretion in doing so in order to ensure their comments reflect observed student behavior. An elementary school teacher shall not be required to prepare each evaluation of a pupil more than once.
e.	Instances when teachers are expected to toilet-diaper or toilet train students will be Limited to unusual circumstances.
3,	The School Committee and the Springfield Education Association agree that it is the responsibility of all teachers in the system to teach the curriculum as outlined in the Learning Outcomes which are locally prepared and the Frameworks in each of the curriculum areas as prepared by the State. The School Committee agrees to furnish every teacher in the system with a copy of the Learning Outcomes and the State Frameworks for their curriculum area. It is also agreed that every teacher in the system is responsible for implementing the educational polices and system goals set by the School Committee. The Schoo! Committee further agrees that it will set system goals for the following school year no later than May 30 of each year
4	Each teacher or team with instructional responsibilities, at the beginning of the school year or course, is expected to communicate, in writing, the goals and expectations for the school year/course for students and parents. The communication will include information in the following areas;

Teacher/Parent Communication: The Association agrees that teacher-parent communication is a crucial element of a successful educational program.

In accomplishing layoffs within a discipline, certification(s) will be reviewed and the teacher with the least length of service within the discipline will be laid-off, unless the teacher chooses to displace another less senior teacher under Section E of this Article.
E.	A teacher scheduled to be laid off will be allowed to displace a less senior teacher in another discipline under the following limited circumstances:
1.	If the teacher scheduled to be laid off is in a discipline that does not have a separate State Department Certification, the teacher will be reviewed if he so chooses, as outlined in Section 4 in the discipline(s) in which the teacher has certification.
OR
2.	If a teacher scheduled to be laid off has taught for ar. entire semester in another discipline during his continuous employment in the Springfield Public Schools, the teacher will be reviewed if he so chooses as outlined in Section D, in that disciplines).

F.	For the purposes of this Article total time in the Springfield School System in months and days in the bargaining unit shall be used to compute an employee's length of service within any disciplines set forth above. Part-time employees will have their length of service computed as if they were full-time employees. However, effective July 1, 1982, part-time employment will be treated on a pro-rata basis for purposes of determining length of service, (e.g. A teacher working on a half-time basis after July 1, 1982 will earn one-half a year seniority for each full year spent teaching half-time.)
1.	Teachers will hold seniority, as above defined, only in the single discipline in which they are teaching on February I, of a school year. If teaching two or more subjects, the subject in which they devote the majority of their teaching time that year will determine the single discipline as outlined above. Time spent on any authorized leave of absence will not count as a break in service, and seniority will accumulate during such periods
2.	Any employee of the Springfield Public Schools who is a member of Bargaining Unit B and returns to this Bargaining Unit A shall have his length of service computed in the following manner: Time spent as a non-tenured Unit B employee up to a maximum of three (3) years shall be forgiven The remainder of their Unit B service shall be subtracted from their prior Unit A length of service and the difference shall constitute their Unit A length of service upon returning to this Bargaining Unit A. (e g. An employee taught in Unit A for thirteen (13) years and then went to Unit B. He attained tenure in Unit B after three years and continued in Unit B for four (4) more years, for a total of seven (7) years in Unit B. The three (3) years spent earning tenure In Unit B are not counted. The four (4) years in Unit B after tenure are subtracted from the thirteen (13) years of original Unit A service. Thus, upon returning to Unit A he has nine (9) years of length of service.)
Teachers who are to be laid off will be notified of this fact as soon as possible, but not later than May 15th of rhe school year preceding the school year in which the reduction in force is to take place.
3.	In cases of identical length of service a lottery system shall be used to determine seniority.
The School Committee agrees to provide the Association with a seniority list by March 1, of each year.
68
G.	If a position outlined in Article 1 (Recognition) is created or becomes vacant while there are
teachers on lay off the following procedure will be followed:
1.	If the position is in a discipline where teachers have been laid off, then teachers laid off in that discipline will be given an opportunity to fill that position prior to other applicants, as long as they are certified and qualified If more than one teacher is laid off in that discipline the opening shall be offered in order of length of service.
2.	If the position is other than a classroom teaching position and is in a discipline in which there has been no lay off, then teachers will first be given the opportunity to fill the position as long as they are certified and qualified. If more than one teacher is laid off, the opening shall be offered in order of length of service if they are certified and qualified
3.	If there is an open position, and a laid-off teacher is certified and qualified for the position, then that teacher will be given the opportunity to fill that opening prior to consideration by other applicants. If more than one teacher on lay off is certified and qualified, the opening shall be offered in order of length of service.
4,	In administering this and subsequent paragraphs, a teacher who has been laid off shall have recall or preference rights only for twenty-four (24) months from the date of the teacher’s most recent lay off. After that date, a teacher will have no recall or preference rights, but will be considered if the teacher so indicates, for any openings in the same manner as new applicants. Notwithstanding any other language in this Article to the contrary, a teacher on lay off who refuses two positions in any period prior to the twenty-four (24) months after lay off will be removed from any consideration for an opening. Such a teacher will be considered as a new applicant for any vacant or created position

All other workshops shall be compensated in accordance with established past practice.
MENTOR PROGRAM
The purpose of mentoring is to provide guidance, resources, and support for the participating teacher (mentoree). For the beginning teacher, this relationship will help make Iheir induction to teaching smooth and successful.
Mentoring is most successful when both parties have a working relationship based on mutual respect, trust, a clear understanding of the goals and purpose of the program, and a commitment to developing confident and effective teachers.
The result of our mentoring program will be the increased effectiveness of participating teachers in implementing strategies and techniques of teaching. As a result, they will become reflective teachers and, therefore, lifelong learners in the art of teaching.
Based on our mission statement, confidentiality becomes a crucial issue with which to deal when building a relationship based on mutual respect and trust. All communications and knowledge gained (except illegal acts) must be considered confidential between the mentor and participating teacher.
Mentors are coaches. This approach involves a confidential process through which teachers share expertise and provide collegiality, technical assistance, feedback, and support during experimentation with new practices. (Adapted from Joyce and Showers, 1982) Mentors will not discuss the participating teacher’s teaching performance with anyone other than the participating teacher, including school and district administrators.
Mentor teachers are not evaluators. The mentor's assessment of a participating teacher’s performance will not be used in the teacher’s evaluation.
ENFORCEABILITY
The Springfield School Committee and the Springfield Education Associatiori/MTA/NEA acknowledge and agree that all extant Letters of Agreement by and between them are enforceable through the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in Article 32 of their Collective Bargaining Agreement.
