b.	A Union grievance may be introduced by the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee to the Director of Labor Relations and the grievance will be discussed at the next regular third-step meeting. The Company's disposition will be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) working days (unless extended by mutual consent) following the meeting in which the grievance was discussed. Special meetings between representatives of the Company and the Plant Grievance Committee will be by mutual consent.
Section 2.	Employee Grievance
a.	An employee grievance is a difference between the Company and any employee concerning the interpretation or application of any provision of the Agreement.
b.	When any such grievance arises, an earnest effort must be made to settle it according to the following sequence and procedure.
Section 3.	First Step
a.	Any employee having such a grievance will present it orally to his supervisor either personally or through his steward, where an earnest attempt will be made to resolve the grievance. Should the grievance not be settled orally, the Union may, within two (2) workdays, reduce the grievance to writing on the forms provided by the Company and signed by the employee, setting forth, on the grievance form, all of the available facts of the alleged violation. The grievance form must indicate:
(1)	A statement of the grievance and the facts upon which it is based.
(2)	The section or sections of the Agreement claimed to have been violated and
(3)	The remedy or correction requested. The disposition at the first and second steps of this procedure, together
with the dates thereof, must be noted thereon and signed by the respective representatives of the Company and the Union.
b.	The Union will have the right to investigate and present a grievance of violation of an employee's recall rights by following the procedure as outlined in Article V, Section 3.a.
c.	When the grievance is presented in writing, the answer of the supervisor will be given in writing on the form provided, as soon as possible, but not later than two (2) regularly scheduled working days after its presentation. After a grievance has been reduced to writing and presented to the supervisor, no representative of the Company will discuss that particular grievance with the grievant without the presence of a Union representative until it is settled in the grievance procedure.
d.	If an appeal for the disposition of a grievance at the first step of the grievance procedure is not taken within five (5) working days from the date of such decision, the grievance will be considered withdrawn without prejudice to either Party.
e.	If the Union accepts a grievance disposition given at the first step of the grievance procedure, it will not be considered precedent setting for or by either Party to this Agreement.
Section 4.	Second Step
a.	If the grievance is not settled by the unit supervisor and the steward, then the shop committeeman and the steward within whose area the grievance arose will take up the grievance with the manager or his designee at a regularly scheduled weekly meeting. Upon request of the shop committeeman and/or the manager, a Labor Relations representative will attend such meeting. If the grievance is appealed to this step of the grievance procedure, and the shop committeeman assigned to the area of the plant in which the grievance arose is unable to handle it because he is absent from the plant, then upon request by the steward to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative, the grievance may be investigated and presented by the acting shop committeeman for that zone. For the purpose of adjusting grievances at this stage of the procedure, a shop committeeman or the acting shop committeeman will represent only employees assigned to the zone in which he is employed, except as provided in Article V, Section 3.b.
b.	The meeting of the manager (or designated representative) and/or a Labor Relations representative with the shop committeeman and the steward in his zone will be held once a week. If the grievances presented at this meeting cannot be disposed of in the time set for the meeting, the meeting may be continued the following day. The manager or designee, and/or a Labor Relations representative will render a decision on a grievance so presented no later than three (3) working days after such meeting.
5
Section 4. Second Step (continued)
c.	If no appeal from the disposition of a grievance given at the second step of the grievance procedure is taken within three (3) working days from the date of the decision, then the decision will be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union. Any disposition of a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure accepted by the Union will also be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union.
Section 5.	Third Step
a.	If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled by the manager (or designated representative) and/or a Labor Relations representative, an appeal may be taken by the Plant Grievance Committee to the Grievance Review Committee. The Grievance Review Committee will render a decision on a grievance so presented as soon as possible, but no later than five (5) working days after the regular third-step meeting at which the grievance was discussed.
b.	If no appeal from the disposition of a grievance given at the third step of the grievance procedure is taken within five (5) working days from the date of the decision, then the decision will be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union. Any disposition of a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure accepted by the Union will also be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union.
c.	If the grievances presented at the regular third-step meetings provided for in this article cannot be disposed of within the time allowed, the meeting may be continued at a time mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union, but no later than five (5) working days. If the Union does not receive a disposition to a grievance within these time limits, the grievance may be appealed to the next step.
Section 6.	General Provisions of the Grievance Procedure
a.	In cases of disciplinary suspensions or discharge of employees for infraction of shop rules or other misconduct, the Union reserves the right to seek modification or elimination of such penalties regarding seniority and compensation, in whole or in part, on the ground that the employee was unjustly disciplined. Such protests will be handled according to the grievance procedure, including the right to appeal to arbitration.
b.	If the Union withdraws a grievance at the first, second or third step of the grievance procedure, it will be considered as having been withdrawn without prejudice to either Party. A grievance withdrawn subsequent to the third step must be withdrawn by mutual agreement and will be considered as having been withdrawn without prejudice to either Party.
c.	Any employee grievance not presented for disposition through the grievance procedure described herein within five (5) working days of the occurrence of the condition giving rise to the grievance, or within five (5) working days of the date it is reasonable to assume that the employee became aware of the condition giving rise to the grievance, will not thereafter be considered a grievance under this Agreement. Any Union grievance not presented within five (5) working days from the date on which it is reasonable to assume that the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee became aware of the condition giving rise to the grievance will be deemed untimely.
d.	No disposition or award upon any grievance under this Agreement will be made retroactive for any period prior to the date the grievance was	first filed in writing, except:
(1)	There may be	seven (7) working days of retroactivity on overtime grievances.
(2)	There may be	sixty (60) working days retroactivity on classification grievances.
(3)	There may be	up to thirty (30) working days retroactivity on layoff and recall grievances. However, in no event
will the Company's liability exceed thirty (30) days.
e.	If the Union does not receive a disposition to a grievance within the time limits set forth herein, the grievance may be appealed to the next step.
f.	The time during which a grievance must be dispositioned or appealed may be extended by mutual agreement.
Section 7.	Prearbitration Review Step
a.	If a grievance within the scope of Article V, Section 8.a. is not settled satisfactorily at the third step of the grievance procedure and the Plant Grievance Committee believes it has grounds for appeal, the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee or designated representative will give the Director of Labor Relations or his designee a written "notice of appeal" to arbitration.

a.
(1)	The Company, consistent with its several normal and standard overtime practices relating to areas within the collective bargaining unit, will make an equal distribution of overtime among the available qualified employees in any unit who are regularly employed on such work. Such distribution will be made on the respective shifts on which the overtime work occurs. An employee will be offered, on a voluntary basis, overtime as necessary to maintain production schedules. If the required personnel are not available following the initial request for volunteers, the employee(s) with the least amount of recorded overtime will be required to work the overtime in question.
(2)	In units within a designated overtime area, when the number of employees needed to perform the overtime work within a unit is not available following the initial request for volunteers, the Company will complete the overtime requirement by offering the overtime to the low. available, qualified employee(s) within the designated overtime area. If the required personnel are not available following the request for volunteers, the employee(s) within the unit with the least amount of recorded overtime will be required to work the overtime in question.
(3)	Whenever it is necessary for employees to work weekend overtime, the Company will endeavor to offer the overtime per Article VI, section 7, a. (1) or (2) by the close of their regular shift hours on Thursday before the upcoming weekend. An employee absent on Thursday will be considered unavailable and charged for the weekend overtime. However, an employee required to work weekend overtime due to a lack of a sufficient number of employees being available upon request, may exercise an option of working or being replaced by a low overtime employee who was absent on Thursday.
(4)	Should it be determined through the grievance procedure that an employee is unequal in overtime as required in Article VI, Section 7.a(1). such employee will be offered the next overtime assignment to which he is entitled under this section (new job, not continuing assignment) until the employee has worked overtime hours equal to the hours that he was out of line at the time the grievance was filed. If, from the date of the grievance, there has been overtime worked to which the grievant should have been offered and he was not asked to work, starting with the sixth workday following the date of the grievance, a displacement will have occurred and the employee will be paid for the hours that he should have been offered for the purpose of equalization.

This will also apply in the case of a holiday(s) prior to the scheduled vacation. It is further agreed that this will be applicable to a one (1), two (2), three (3), and four (4) day vacation, provided such vacation begins on a Monday and is scheduled two (2) weeks in advance.

(5)	When an employee on loan returns to his home unit and is ahead on overtime because of overtime worked

j.	Overtime records will show the overtime hours worked converted to the number of straight-time hours for the current month and year to date.
k.

ARTICLE VII SENIORITY
Section 1. Layoff
a.	In case of an indefinite layoff for lack of work, an employee will be laid off and recalled by non-interchangeable job families in accordance with his seniority as provided herein.
b.	The non-interchangeable job families as listed in the Job Family Appendices have been mutually agreed upon and incorporated and made a part of this Agreement as attached. New or revised classifications and/or job families will be effected in accordance with Article IX.
c.	In case of an indefinite layoff, a senior employee in a classification in which there is a lack of work will be permitted, in order of his seniority, to bump an employee within his own job family who has less seniority in the same or lower labor grade, or to bump a less senior employee in another job family as follows:
(1)	If qualified under Article VII, Section 1.c(1)(a), an employee may bump to a higher labor grade (classification) than he can get by exercising his bump rights in his own job family: if faced with an out-of-plant layoff, he may bump into any classification of equal or lower grade, (a) If an employee has been in a classification listed in the Job Family Appendices and was so classified for a period not less than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days subsequent to his seniority date, he may bump to the highest classification held. If an employee's work record reflects that he held a classification subsequent to his seniority date that is not listed in the Job Family Appendices, it will be considered as the classification listed in the Job Family Appendices to which employees performing the same work were transferred.
(b)	An employee electing to bump across job families into another classification will personally examine the job and be given an explanation by the supervisor of the work to be performed. If the employee so desires, the shop committeeman in the zone where the work is to be performed will be present at the interview. An employee may elect to bump into a classification that is less than the highest to which he is entitled to bump under Article VII, Section 1 .c( 1), if it meets the requirements of this paragraph. The employee will be advised that he must be able to perform the job within a reasonable period of time without impacting production. Failure to do so will result in a thirty (30) day suspension and forfeiture of all rights to the job family to which he exercised his rights. Following the thirty (30) day disciplinary suspension, the employee will be permitted to exercise his rights to the classification to which his seniority entitles him in his original job family. An employee given recall under the provisions of Article VII, Section 1.c (1)(d) will be subject to the conditions of this paragraph immediately upon recall.
(c)	An employee may not bump into a classification that he left either voluntarily because of his inability to perform the work or involuntarily where such inability was otherwise established or acknowledged.
(d)	If an employee qualifies to bump under the provisions of this section but does not have enough seniority to do so, he will be given recall rights to the job family from which he was laid off as well as to the job families into which he could have bumped had he held sufficient seniority. Such recall rights will be based upon the classifications he would have received under the provisions of this section.
(e)	The Company will have up to five (5) working days following the effective date of the layoff in which to implement the bumping between job families.
(f)	Any inequities brought about as a result of such bumping will be corrected within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, after they are brought to the Company’s attention. Any liability on the part of the Company will commence at the end of the forty-eight (48) hour period.
(g)	An employee who is placed in an out-of-plant layoff status as a result of being bumped by an employee under Article VII. Section 1.c(1)(a), will be laid off immediately and the Company will not be required, as set forth under Article VII, Section 1 ,d, to give notice to the Union prior to such layoff.
(h)	No more than fifteen percent (15%) of any one job family may be affected by the bumping provided in Article VII, Section 1.c(1 )(a) in any one (1) month.
(2)	A senior employee bumping under the provisions here defined may be required to replace the employee he bumps on the shift on which the replaced employee was working.
(3)	A senior employee will automatically be given the bump in his own job family. Those who do not have rights under Article VII, Section 1 .c( 1) will be laid off. A senior employee who is absent due to a bona fide illness, in Section 900, on vacation, on an approved leave of absence, or other bona fide reasons while the layoff is being processed, and who, if present would have an option to bump an employee under Article VII, Section 1 ,c(1), will be furnished by certified mail with a list of the titles of those classifications for which he qualifies. Upon receipt by the Company of the classification designated by the employee (not later than ten (10) days following receipt by the employee of the aforementioned list), the Company will process the paperwork necessary to effect the change or to extend layoff rights as provided under Article VII, Section 1 ,c(1 )(d).

VII
Section 1.	Layoff (continued)
d.	When there are layoffs for an indefinite period or for more than fifteen (15) workdays, notice in writing indicating the classification and number of employees to be surplused in each classification will be given to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee five (5) work days, if possible, and in no event later than three (3) days before such layoff. As soon as possible, but in no event later than the effective date of the layoff, a list will be made available indicating the names of the employees to be laid off and their positions on the seniority list. After the completion of the layoff, a list will be given to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee indicating the status of the employees affected by the layoff. When there are layoffs caused by sudden cancellation of major contracts, major subcontracts or acts of God that cause interruptions of production or plant shutdowns, the Company may use the procedure provided by Article VII, Section 1 .e. Within the ten (10) day period provided by Article VII, Section 1 .e, the Company will process the indefinite layoff, providing such layoff is necessary, and give the requisite indefinite-layoff notice to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. An employee who is at work and is processed through the termination procedure for indefinite layoff will be paid through the end of the normal shift unless the employee requests and is granted permission to process earlier. An employee who is on short-term military leave, on vacation, temporary layoff or on bereavement, who comes into the plant and processes through the termination procedure for indefinite layoff will receive four (4) hours' straight-time pay. When employees are recalled to work, a similar list will be available to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee simultaneously with the notice to return to work.
e.	Temporary layoffs due to breakdowns, shortages of materials, manufacturing irregularities or causes of a like nature not to exceed fifteen (15) workdays within a rolling twelve (12) month period may be made by the Company irrespective of any provisions of this Agreement. Temporary layoffs will be processed through Wage Administration by seniority and classification of those employees within the respective unit and shift affected, provided those retained can perform the work without a break-in or familiarization period. However, a more senior employee within the respective unit and shift affected may volunteer prior to processing less senior employees for layoff. This restriction on fifteen (15) days will not apply in case of any stoppage of work, strike or slowdown, or any other case or condition beyond the control of the Company. The Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee will be provided a copy of the layoff notice in advance of the temporary layoff. Temporary layoffs will be recorded on the employee's unit attendance card as a temporary layoff.
f.	The Company and the Union agree that the employment of certain employees as defined herein will not be governed by seniority rules. Employees retained out of line of seniority will be those needed in starting the development of tooling or manufacturing work on a new project, or whose services are required when the workforce is reduced. Such employees will be retained up to one hundred twenty (120) calendar days only because no other employee possesses the required skill, license, or experience to perform the necessary work. A list of such persons will be made, and a copy will be furnished to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. Any employee who is removed from the list will be subject to the rules governing seniority. Any complaint by the Union regarding an employee on this list will be handled in accordance with the grievance procedure.
Section 2.	Recall and Return Rights
a.	Whenever there is an increase in the work force after an indefinite layoff, and before a new employee is hired in a given job family, an employee who has recall rights to that classification within the job family will first be offered employment in that classification in accordance with his seniority at the current rate of pay for the job to which he is recalled. An employee will not be hired in labor grade 5 and below in a given job family without first considering those employees who are still on layoff in labor grade 6 and below in that job family. If employees in labor grade 6 and below are qualified to perform the work in question, they will be offered employment before a new employee is hired.
b.	An employee who subsequent to October 15, 1962, was, or who following the effective date of the Agreement, is transferred or recalled to a lower-rated job other than that to which he is entitled under the provisions of this section and Section 1 of this article, will be offered a transfer or recall in line of seniority to the specific higher-rated job that he was working at the time of his transfer or layoff. This provision does not apply to an employee who was transferred from a job for reason of "inability to perform the job that he was assigned."
c.	If an employee refuses to accept such offer of transfer, he will forfeit any further claim to any job equal or lower in the job family from which he was transferred or laid off. except in the event of an out-of-plant layoff, at which time the employee will be eligible to exercise bump rights as provided for in Article VII, Section 1.c.(1).
d.	An employee will be reassigned under this section no later than the date his replacement reports for work,
e.	No employee will be eligible by reason of his seniority to be recalled or transferred to a higher-rated job, except as
provided under Article VII. Section 1 .c(1)(a), or as provided under Article VII, Section 2.a.

c.	Effective with the October 8, 2007 adjustment and thereafter, to receive the COLA adjustment each employee must have been an active employee, or in Section 900 for the full period in which the adjustment is made.

g.	No adjustments, retroactive or otherwise, will be made due to any revision which may later be made in the published figures for the BLS Consumers' Index for any base month.
h.	The Parties agree that this provision for a cost-of-living allowance is dependent upon the availability of the official monthly BLS Consumers' Price Index in its same form and calculated on the same basis as the indices for June, July, and August 2000.

(2)	Notwithstanding other provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company will advise the Union of its intent to place a new or revised job into effect thirty (30) calendar days prior to actually working the job. Following such notification, the Parties will meet and discuss the proposed new or revised job in an effort to reach agreement on the job classification and job family placement. Upon the Parties reaching an agreement, the new or revised job will be placed into effect. Should the Parties not reach agreement within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Company may place the new or revised job into effect in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
c.	The Company will send by certified mail ten (10) copies of such job descriptions, specifications and classifications, rates of pay and job family placements addressed to the President and Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee within fifteen (15) days after placing them into effect. The job specification sheetswill include the factors, point scoring and other information.
d.	The Union will have the right, within thirty (30) days of receipt from the Company of a new or revised job, to file a Union grievance alleging:
(1)	Improper evaluation and labor grade
(2)	Improper job family placement; and/or
(3)	That such new or revised operations should be placed or retained in an existing job description, specification and classification.
Such grievance will state the Union's position, the facts upon which it is based and the remedy or correction requested. In the event of a job rating grievance, the specific factors with which the Union disagrees, together with the reasons why it believes the	factors are not evaluated properly,	must be	listed	by	the	Union	on the grievance form.	In	the event	that
the Company	and the Union are unable to resolve the grievance, it	may	be appealed to	arbitration	in	accordance	with
Article V, Section 8.a. The arbitration will be limited to a determination (based on the work as described by the Company) of:
(a)	The proper evaluation
(b)	The proper labor grade
(c)	The proper job family: and
(d)	Whether the new or revised job may properly be placed or retained in an existing classification, e. Thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification, if the Union has not filed a Union grievance, the job classification will be added to the Job Family Appendices. The job description and specification, rate of pay, and job family placement will become a part of and be subject to all of the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
f.	The Company's right to make work assignments and to determine methods of operations is in no way restricted by this article and will not be subject to arbitration.
g.	When arbitrating the rate of pay for a job, the authority of the arbitrator will be limited to determining which of the existing labor grades the new or revised job will be placed in. The arbitrator will base his award on evidence either Party presents under the Company's Hourly Job Rating Plan, including intraplant job comparison material.
h.	The effective date of the rate of pay of any new or revised job will be the date the new or revised job was placed into effect by the Company. In the event this rate is revised through the grievance procedure, such revision will be retroactive to the date the job was placed into effect.
i.	In the event that the job is placed in a different job family or classification than the group or classification in which the Company originally placed it, either by agreement between the Parties or by decision of the arbitrator, the effective date of displacement pay. if any, will be three (3) working days from the date of settlement by the Parties, or three (3) working days from the date of receipt of the arbitrator's decision by the Company. When the Union gives notice to the Company of intent to arbitrate such a matter, it will list in writing to the Company the reasons for disagreement and the relief sought.

IX
Section 1.	Changes in Job Family Appendices (continued)
j. The Company agrees to include in the "Description of Duties":
(1)	Any duty presently appearing as part of the job specifications
(2)	Experience; and
(3)	Education
The Company agrees with the principle that lower classified employees should not perform higher classified work on a regular and consistent basis without being paid the higher rate. The Company will continue to use "C" classifications when the need for such classifications exists. While the Company agrees that all job descriptions should be written to show a clear line of demarcation between classifications, it cannot agree that all unrelated duties appearing in present job descriptions will be removed.
Section 2.	Work Outside Job Family
a.	The Company will make every effort possible to keep employees working in their respective classifications and job families. In the event an employee is required to work outside of his job family in excess of one (1) workday, the Union will be notified via electronic message sent to the designated Local 848 e-mail address. In the event an employee is required to work outside of his job family in excess of ten (10) days, such period of time in excess of ten (10) days will be mutually agreed to in writing by the Company and the respective committeeman(s). Job descriptions and specifications will be used for the purpose of distinguishing one job classification from another as clearly and definitively as possible. In multilevel or series-type jobs, job descriptions and specifications must distinguish the level of pay of each job.
b.	It is understood that employees may be required to perform work within other job families, de minimis in length, and only in conjunction with the completion of their normal job.
Section 3.	Involuntary Transfer to Lower Classification
Under the terms of prior Agreements, an employee could not be involuntarily transferred to a lower classification within his job family, resulting in a condition where an employee could be assigned to the "A" classification with the commensurate rate while performing the duties of the "B" classification. The Parties again agreed during the 1965 negotiations that where the above condition exists, an employee will not be transferred to a lower labor grade within his job family for the duration of this Agreement, except under the following conditions:
a.	When there has been a significant change in the job content of the classification to which an employee was assigned or a significant change in his work assignment.
b.	When there is a bona fide reduction in force that affects the employee in his job family.
It was further agreed between the Parties that an employee cannot use misclassifications as cited above as grounds for requesting an upgrade.
Section 4.	Proper Classification
For the purpose of determining if an employee is properly classified, it is understood and agreed that an employee will not be required to perform all of the incidental duties included in a job description, but he must perform the major functions of the job on a regular basis. Major functions are those duties called out in a job that are not covered in a lower-rated job and require the performance of a skill or other factor that is not required in the lower-rated job. An employee will not be considered to be improperly classified by reason of occasionally performing major functions or isolated or minor duties in a higher job. In case of dispute, the normal function of the job will govern based on the normal past practice of the shop. When it is determined that an employee is improperly classified, these findings will not be used as grounds for requesting an upgrade of the employee. Promotion reassignment and/or replacement of the employee will be effected under the terms provided herein.

Furthermore, once selections are made, they may not be changed if the selection affects another employee's prior selection. An employee transferring to a unit where vacation schedules conflict with the transferring employee's prior vacation selection(s) will not be allowed to bump an employee because of seniority from a vacation schedule previously selected.

(2)	An employee who for any reason leaves the payroll of the Company without having taken the vacation for which he is eligible will be paid in lieu of such vacation for any portion for which he has not already been paid.
(3)	Effective February 15, 1996, the Company will permit employees who have not used all of their current year’s vacation to carry over the unused portion, up to a maximum of two (2) years' total accrual.

An employee will be deemed to have worked a major fraction of the month in which he is terminated if he has worked a minimum of eighty-five (85) straight-time hours.
(2)	An employee in Section 900 due to a work related injury, who retires under the Retirement Plan directly from Section 900, will be paid prorated vacation pay.
(3)	An employee recalled from layoff or returning from military service under the Selective Service Act, as amended, or returning from Section 900 due to illness will, if not eligible for full vacation, be eligible for prorata vacation pay on his seniority date falling after such recall or return, computed as in Article X, Section 7.f(1), if he worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the regularly scheduled working hours of the plant for the period from such recall or return to such seniority date.
(4)	An employee with at least six (6) months seniority but less than one (1) year seniority, who is laid off will be paid pro rata vacation provided the employee has worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the regularly scheduled working hours prior to layoff.
g.	The Parties recognize the right of the Company to shut down the plant, or portions thereof, for purposes of vacation. However, no employee will be forced to take his vacation during this shutdown, with the understanding that the employee will be on vacation without pay if he elects not to take vacation during this shutdown and is not otherwise scheduled. In the event the Company requires a certain classification'of work to be performed during a scheduled shutdown, employees performing work in the particular classification will be offered the opportunity to perform the work in seniority order.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Section 1.	Personal
a.	A leave of absence not exceeding ninety (90) days may be granted by the Company to any employee for good and sufficient cause upon the written request of the employee. Also, the Company may grant a leave of absence to an em-employee who has been appointed or elected to a state or federal office. If a leave of absence is granted, the seniority of the employee will accumulate during the period of the leave of absence.

Section 3. Health Care Benefits for Future Retirees or Survivors Effective for Retirements on or after January 1, 1993.
a.	General Information
(1)	Retirees with less than ten (10) years of credited service will not be eligible for retiree health care for themselves, dependents or survivors.
(2)	Should the retiree or dependent/survivor elect not to pay any cost in excess of the applicable Company contributions, the retiree and dependent/survivor of such retiree will no longer qualify for Company health care or HMO coverage. In such instances, the health care may be reinstated one (1) time with satisfactory evidence of insurability.
(3)	The health care coverage for a retiree or survivor and the eligible spouse will be based on the age of the eligible individual. The benefits will be different if both are not eligible for Medicare. Those individuals that are not eligible for Medicare will have benefits as described in Article XII, Section 3.b. Those individuals that are eligible for Medicare will have benefits as described in Article XII, Section 3.c.
(4)	Dental benefits as well as the new vision and hearing programs provided to active employees do not apply to retirees.
b.	Health Care Benefits Before Age Sixty-five (65) (non-Medicare eligible)

For disability retirements, service will be projected from the retirement date to age sixty-five (65) to determine the percent of contribution under this schedule.
(2)	The annual Company contribution maximum is seventy-eight hundred dollars ($7800).
(3)	The Company will offer two plans. The plan design is as given in the document entitled “Retiree
for Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans Plan Year 2007.’’ The $7800 cap as described in Article XII (2) applies; however, for plan years 2008 and 2009 (January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009), the stipulated claims cost per plan participant will be $7800 annually for the Essential Plan to allow time to develop claims history (i.e. for those two years, a 30-year employee will have a monthly contribution of $0 and the dependent will have a contribution of $163). Beginning with the 2010 plan year (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010) the contribution will be calculated based on actual claims per Letter of Agreement 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For plan years 2008 and 2009, the cost of the Premium Plan will be $100.00 more per participant than the Essentials Plan. Thereafter, the pre-65 Premium Plan will have a contribution rate equal to the pre-65 Essential Plan contribution rate PLUS 100% of the excess in plan cost per participant, if any, over the pre-65 Essentials plan.
(4)	The Company contribution percent in Article XII, Section 3.b(1) will be applied to the lesser of the actual cost or the Company contribution maximum in Article XII, Section 3.b(2) when calculating the actual Company contribution for the retiree or dependent/survivor.	43

remain under the care of the Company approved occupational disability physician network and the claim is found compensable under workers' compensation.	*
(a)	The employee will receive, up to a maximum of sixty six (66) work days within a rolling 12 month
period, payment of an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of base pay less taxes	.
starting from the reported date of injury. When the employee's claim has been given a	* -
maximum medical improvement (MMI) rating the employee will be ineligible to receive any additional funds under the OHC program. However, an employee reaching MMI may be eligible	7 i
for benefits under the Company provided disability plan.
(b)	The OHC payment will come from two (2) sources: Company supplemental pay and the workers' compensation benefit paid by the carrier.	*
(C) The payment will be calculated so the employee will not experience a decrease in net	.
take-home pay by taking into consideration that the workers' compensation payment is not taxable.	.
(2)	If the employee does not choose to remain under the care of the Company approved occupational disability physician network, the employee will be ineligible for the sixty six (66) work days of supplementary payments and any of these payments advanced to the employee will result in an overpayment that is immediately due to the company,	■■
(3)	Should the employee remain disabled and absent from work for a total of sixty six (66) work days within a rolling 12 month period, the supplemental payments shall cease and the weekly disability benefit shall be limited to the workers’ compensation payment applicable under state workers' compensation law.
(4)	If an employee returns to work and has not exhausted the sixty six (66) work day limit in a rolling twelve (12) month period, a subsequent absence (even if related to the prior absence) is treated as a new absence	*■ '
and the employee again has the option of whether to be under the care of the Company approved occupational disability physician network, provided the change of treating physician is approved by the Texas Workers'	* .
Compensation Commission in accordance with current TWCC rules and regulations or provisions under	t ..
section 4.b.(2) as outlined above.
(5)	As long as the employee is complying with the treatment plan established by the Company-approved occupational disability physician network, the employee is eligible for supplemental pay for the relevant injury,	w
in accordance with Section 4.b (1). If the employee does not follow the treatment plan, the	►-•
employee is considered non-compliant and owes the company any supplemental pay the employee has	•- -
received.
(6)	(Insert from Letter of agreement dated 7/8/93)	*
In those cases where a second or third shift employee qualifies for one hundred percent (100%) pay and physical therapy is recommended by the approved occupational disability physician network, an attempt	r	■
will be made to schedule the physical therapy at the beginning of the shift for second shift employees and	'	•
at the end of the shift for third shift employees. If such scheduling is not practical, the physical therapy will be	.
scheduled outside the shift and a corresponding amount of time off with pay will be granted from the	„	.
employee's shift. In no case will payments caused by physical therapy be at a premium rate.

ARTICLE XV
CHECKOFF AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Authorization for Union Dues
a.	The Company agrees to deduct Union dues in the amount of two (2) hours of the employee’s hourly base rate, plus two (2) hours of COLA, plus any other amount that may be established by the Union each month from the earnings of an employee who authorizes such deductions by signing the authorization form provided for this purpose. Such deductions will be made in accordance with the provisions of the authorization form.
b.	The Company's obligation to make such deductions will terminate automatically upon the termination of the employee or upon his transfer to a plant, union or job not covered by this Agreement. Employees who are transferred out of the collective bargaining unit into supervisory positions will have, in addition to their normal withdrawal period, thirty (30) days following their transfer to revoke or withdraw their checkoff authorization by so notifying the Company and the Union by letter. However, in compliance with the 1985 NLRB ruling, the Company will not resume deduction of Union dues on an employee rehired without seniority until such time a new authorization card is signed by the employee. Deductions will be resumed, however, under the following conditions:
(1)	If an employee is recalled or rehired with seniority, provided such employee's authorization has not been revoked by him during a revocation or withdrawal period; provided also, that the resumed deductions will begin with the employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the next calendar month following such recall or rehire.
(2)	If a former collective bargaining unit employee is transferred back to a job covered by this Agreement, provided that such employee's authorization has not been revoked by him during a revocation or withdrawal period that occurred while he was not in the collective bargaining unit; provided also, that the resumed deductions will begin with the employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the next calendar month following such transfer.
(3)	In the event of a month beginning with a split week, the date of the check compensating for said work will constitute the eligibility for a Union dues deduction in current month.
c.	On dues week, represented employees who have authorized a dues checkoff will have dues deducted, based on deduction priority, if their earnings during the week are sufficient to permit the deduction. It is not required that the check be for forty (40) or more hours if the earnings are sufficient to permit the deduction.
d.	The Union agrees that it will indemnify and save the Company harm from any and all liability, claim, responsibility, damage or suit that may arise out of any action taken by the Company in accordance with the terms of this section or the terms of this article in reliance upon the authorization mentioned herein.
Section 2.	Application of Checkoff
a.	The authorization form for checkoff of dues to be used by employees for the purpose of authorizing the Company to deduct monthly Union dues from their earnings and to assign such sums to the Union is attached and made a part of this Agreement.
b.	The Union will assume full responsibility for the distribution and collection of such authorization cards and guarantees that such distribution and collection will not take place during working hours on Company premises.
c.	Each authorization card will be signed by the employee who authorized the deduction together with a witness to his signing and the date of signing.
d.	All authorization for cards will be submitted by the Union to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative on or before the Friday before the week in which they are to become effective. Such cards will be transmitted to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative by a letter of transmittal, signed by an authorized officer of the Union and listing thereon the name, unit, and employee number.
e.	If an employee's earnings for the first payroll week of a calendar month are insufficient to permit the full deduction, then the deduction will be taken from the employee's earnings in the first, second, third, or fourth payroll weeks in which his earnings are sufficient. The Union will be provided with weekly catch-up reports and a check representing said deductions.
f.	Monthly union dues will be deducted from vacation checks.
g.	A check in the total amount of the sum deducted on account of dues will be drawn each month to the order of Local 848, International Union, United Automobile. Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and will be hand-delivered to the financial secretary thereof.
h.	A statement of the total Union dues deducted will be included on the employee's annual W-2.
i.	The Company will forward to the Union each month in employee number order the following information:
(1)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized deduction of Union dues and from whose wages such deductions have been made during the current month.
(2)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized the deduction of Union dues and from whose wages no such deduction was made because of insufficient earnings during the pay period for which the deduction was authorized.
(3)	A list of all employees, including base rate and COLA, if any, identifying those employees who have not submitted to the Company an authorization for checkoff of dues.
(4)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized such deductions but whose authorization became ineffective pursuant to Article XV, Section 1.b, by reason of the termination of their employment or their transfer or layoff.
XV
Section 2. Application of Checkoff (continued)
j.	The Company will furnish the Union monthly an alphabetical list of all employees and their employee numbers identifying Union members.
k.	The monthly Union dues provided for herein will be deducted from the authorizing employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the calendar month. However, if an employee's earnings for the first payroll week of a calendar month are insufficient to permit the full deduction, then the deduction will be taken from the employee's earnings in the first of the second, third or fourth payroll weeks in which his earnings are sufficient. Monthly Union dues deductions will not exceed the dues amount as set by the Union. Further, the Company will not be required to make a double deduction from an employee's subsequent monthly earnings if his weekly earnings in each of his preceding month's first four (4) payroll weeks were insufficient to permit a deduction.
I.	The maximum monthly deduction provided for herein is the amount of the Union dues for one (1) calendar month, except in the case of the resumption of deductions from the earnings of an employee recalled, rehired with seniority or transferred from a non-collective bargaining unit job into the bargaining unit, as provided for in Article XIII, Section 8.b of the Agreement dated October 1, 1962. The maximum monthly deductions from such an employee's earnings for the first calendar month subsequent to recall, rehire or transfer are:
(1)	The monthly Union dues for the first calendar month: and
(2)	The monthly Union dues for the month preceding the first calendar month. If the earnings of such recalled, rehired or transferred employees are subjected to monthly deductions as described, the deductions will be made in the first four (4) payroll weeks of the calendar month in the following manner: one (1) deduction will be taken from the employee's earnings for the first payroll week in which his earnings are sufficient, and the other deductions will be taken from the next payroll week in which his earnings are sufficient.
m.	The interpretation and application of "date of delivery" as it appears in the authorization form referenced in Article XV. Section 1, and which is shown in Article XV, Section 3. will be:
"Date of Delivery" - the date of delivery will be the date the Company actually receives the authorization for checkoff of Union dues, as evidenced by the date and time stamped on each card by a date and time-recording machine.
n. The Company will furnish the Union, during regular business hours Monday through Friday, access to union dues history data via on-line computer terminal located in the Local 848 business office.
o.	The Company will furnish the Union, during regular business hours Monday through Friday, access to Union members' employment history data via on-line computer terminal located in the Local 848 business office.
p.	The Company will provide the Union with a weekly computer file of any regular union dues or catchup dues it may have taken in that week's payroll processing.
q.	The Company will provide the Union monthly with a clock number listing of any employees that had regular union dues taken on dues night and did not subsequently work forty (40) hours during the dues period.
r.	The Company's agreement to furnish to the Union certain dues information contained above will not automatically cease on any termination of this Agreement, but will terminate ninety (90) days after notice to the Union by certified mail from the date as set forth under Article XX, Section 1 .b.

ARTICLE XVI OFF-SITE OPERATIONS
Section 1.	Definition of Off-Site
“Off-site" will mean the performance of work by covered employees at places geographically located at such distances from the Company's Grand Prairie, Texas, facilities that the distance requires an employee to obtain lodging other than at his established residence. It will also contemplate the eventual return of such employees back to the Company's Grand Prairie, Texas, operations. "Off-site" will not include a new establishment set up by the Company or the relocated operations of a major segment of the Company’s present organization (such as one of its divisions) regardless of where the new establishment or the relocated division may be geographically situated.
Section 2.	Application of the Agreement
a.	The Company and the Union recognize that these and other conditions on the Company's off-site operations do not make it possible to apply all parts and sections of this Agreement to employees assigned to off-site locations. Therefore, it is agreed that the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. UAW, and its Local 848, will represent collective bargaining unit employees assigned to off-site operations on:
(1)	Wages (basic rate structure)
(2)	Discipline and discharge
(3)	Working conditions
b.	However, the Company agrees to apply to covered employees assigned to its offsite operations all articles, sections, and other parts of the Agreement between the Parties except the following: Article III -	Recognition
Article IV	-	Representation, Duties and Responsibilities
Article V	-	Grievance, Arbitration and Discharge Procedures
Article VI	-	Work Hours, Overtime and Premium Payments
Sections 1.c, 1.f, and 7
Article VII	- Seniority
Sections 1, 2. 3, and 14
Article IX	- Job Classifications, Families and Labor Grades
Article X	- Hours Not Worked, Incomplete Days Worked
Sections 4 and 6
Article XVII- Subcontracting and Major Maintenance or Facilities Construction Work Sections 1, 3. 5 and 7
Article XIX - General Provisions
c.	When covered employees are promoted at an off-site location, Section 5 of Article VII will be applied in light of off-site conditions and requirements, but only to employees assigned to the specific off-site location where the promotion is made and at the time it is made.
d.	No labor grade inequities will exist among covered employees who are performing equal work at an off-site location. All such employees will be assigned to the labor grade commensurate with the work being performed.
Section 3.	Rules of Cognizant Agency
Off-site locations are normally under the cognizance of a military or a government civilian agency charged with an interest in the development or modification of a Company product at its locations. Because of this, employees assigned to such off-site locations are subject to rules and regulations of the agency having cognizance over the location and frequently must work at times and places and under conditions the cognizant agency dictates or controls.	r
Section 4.	Lists Required
Lists of those employees going off-site and those returning from off-site locations will be given to the Chairperson of the plant grievance committee.
pt* •
Section 5.	Grievance Procedure
a.	An employee at an off-site operation who feels that he has a complaint involving one (1) of the three (3) categories given in Article XVI, Section 2.a, with respect to an application or interpretation of the Agreement, excluding the articles and sections listed in Article XVI, Section 2.b, or with respect to the provisions of this article, will write a letter of complaint to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. The Chairman of the plant r Grievance Committee will investigate the complaint, and if he believes the complaint has merit, he will introduce the complaint as a written grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure.
b.	Disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions of the articles and sections of the Agreement made applicable to off-site locations by Article XVI, Section 2, and of the provisions of this article will be subject to impartial arbitration. Recognizing that the normal procedures cannot practically be applied to off-site facilities, investigation time on such cases will be limited to normal in-plant investigation. The Company agrees to release witnesses called by the arbitrator or the Union only if they are not assigned to off-site operations, and investigations by the arbitrator will be limited so as to exclude off-site facilities.	t
56
XVI
Section 5. Grievance Procedure (continued)
c.	Notwithstanding any of Article XVI, Section 5, the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee may discuss any complaint received in writing from an off-site employee with the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative.
Section 6.	Application of Checkoff
Employees in the collective bargaining unit who are on the checkoff list when transferred to an off-site operation, or who subsequently authorize deductions, will have their deductions continued while at an off-site operation of the Company, subject to the conditions of the checkoff authorization signed by the employee.
Section 7.	Policies and Practices
The Company agrees to continue, if allowed by the cognizant contractor, its past policies and practices with respect to wage rates and other expense reimbursements allowed employees assigned to an off-site operation.
Section 8.	Assignment to Off-Site Locations
Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW and its Local Union 848 hereby agree that employees in the collective bargaining unit may be assigned to offsite operations as required and in accordance with past practice followed by the Company and UAW Local 848, subject, however, to the following:
a.	If a covered employee is assigned to an off-site operation and a layoff is called within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the off-site assignment, and the employee would have been affected if he had not been off-site, the employee is subject to the layoff procedure. After exhausting all rights as set forth under Article VII, the employee will be laid off and placed on the recall list as of that date.
b.	if a covered employee is assigned to an off-site operation, and a layoff is called after thirty (30) days of the effective date of the off-site assignment, and the employee would have been affected if he had not been off-site, the Company will return the employee within sixty (60) days for the purpose of layoff. After exhausting all rights as set forth under Article VII, the employee will be laid off and placed on the recall list as of the date the assignment is completed.
c.	If a covered employee assigned to an off-site operation is subsequently assigned to another operation and a layoff is called within thirty (30) days of the reassignment and the employee would have been affected if he had not been offsite, the employee is subject to the terms of Article XVI, Section 8.a.
d.	If a covered employee assigned to an off-site operation has the seniority to hold, he may be assigned to other off-site operations or returned to the plant as necessary.
e.	This section will apply to all covered employees currently assigned to off-site operations and those who will be assigned in the future.
f.	Offsite assignments will be determined by the type of work to be performed. CBU personnel assigned off-site per this article will be reclassified to job family 1030.

XVII-XVIII
ARTICLE XVII SUBCONTRACTING AND MAJOR MAINTENANCE OR FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION WORK
Section 1.	Notice
a.	The Company agrees, whenever reasonable and practicable, to use its maintenance employees to perform major maintenance work and facilities construction work. Due consideration will be given to employees on the layoff list in performing these tasks. The company may sub contract janitorial services only if there are no Job Code 5173-09 (Custodians) or 5174-010 (Janitors) of Job Family 5140 employees on layoff status.
b.	Each month, the Director of Facilities/Maintenance or his designated representative will advise the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee and the shop committeeman representing maintenance employees of the reasons and desirability for subcontracting facilities construction and major maintenance work. The Union representatives will be advised by the Company of the time and place of such meeting. Both Parties agree that this arrangement does not give the Union or any arbitrator the power to veto or modify the Company's right to subcontract major maintenance and facilities construction work, nor will it prohibit the Union's right to file and process a grievance, in accordance with Article V of this Agreement.
c.	The Company agrees, after it has subcontracted out major maintenance and facilities construction work, to advise the Union of such action on a weekly basis.
Section 2.	Use of Maintenance Employees
a. It was agreed during the 1962 contract negotiations that under the provisions of Article XVII, Section 1, it will be deemed reasonable and practicable to use maintenance employees in lieu of subcontracting maintenance and facilities construction work when the following conditions exist:
(1)	The particular skills involved for the complete operation are immediately available either on the active payroll or on the layoff list
(2)	The Company has the specialized equipment required or readily available to perform the operation
(3)	No economies can be realized.
(4)	The volume, excluding a reasonable amount of overtime or type of work does not preclude the completion within the time limits required. Reasonable will be generally defined as sixteen (16) hours overtime within a workweek. The overtime will be applicable in those instances where a contract could be completed by bargaining unit employees without impacting the daily workload by utilizing a fifty six (56) hour workweek and also in those instances where contractors are working on a short run contract during hours which are defined as weekend overtime hours for a Maintenance employee. The application of Item 4 will involve only those classifications of Maintenance employees identified in sub-section (7) below which could by application cover those jobs being performed by employees of contractors.
(5)	The work being subcontracted is not in accordance with past practices of the Company
(6)	The use of maintenance employees is not contrary to the control requirements of the cognizant military or government civilian agency
(7)	If there are employees on layoff classified as utility operators, facilities construction craftsman, millwrights, laborers, sheet metal mechanics, and/or machine repair mechanics, and the Company lets a contract calling for more than forty-five (45) days of continuous work of the above crafts, the Company agrees to recall the same number of employees in each craft as used by the contractor and retain them until the job is completed. Employee(s) refusing short term recalls per this article will be bypassed for said recall, however their contractual recall period as specified in Article VU Section 11. d. will remain in tact. The more than forty-five (45) days of work is applied only to the single contract.
Section 3.	Attachment to Article XVII
a. The parties agree that our mission is to operate as a maintenance Self Directed Work Team, dedicated to high efficiency, cost effectiveness, and quality, focusing on servicing and communicating with customers and suppliers with the goal of capturing all “desired" construction projects.
ARTICLE XVIII QUALIFICATIONS ENFORCEMENT AND WAIVER
Section 1.	Specific Performance
a.	Either Party will be entitled to require specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement.
b.	Each of the Parties warrants that it is under no disability of any kind that will prevent it from completely carrying out and
performing each and all of the provisions of this Agreement, and further that it will not take any action of any kind that will prevent or impede it in the complete performance of each and every provision hereof.
Section 2.	Waiver
The waiver of any breach of any of the provisions or terms of this Agreement by either Party does not constitute a precedent for any future waiver or enforcement of such breach.

f.	Employee Negligence and Unsafe Acts

Section 5.	Physical Restrictions
a.
(1)	An employee in Section 900 or returning from layoff who reports to the plant Medical Department with the intent of returning to work and is unable to meet the physical requirements of the job assigned, will be offered an opportunity to speak with Union representation prior to being sent home. Should the employee choose not to have Union representation, he will sign a letter to that effect and the Chairman will receive a copy of said refusal of representation,
(2)	An employee returning from Section 900, who cannot perform his job because of physical restrictions, will displace a less senior employee on another job of equal or lower labor grade within his job family that he can perform with his physical restrictions. If the physically restricted employee goes to a lower labor grade as a result of a permanent physical restriction, he will not retain rights to the higher labor grade. The Company will have seven (7) workdays to place the restricted employee. Those employees who are placed in an out-of-plant layoff status as a result of being displaced, as stated above, will be laid off immediately and the Company will not be required to give notice to the Union as set forth in Article VII.
b.	If an employee who is physically disabled as a result of sustaining injury either at work or outside of work cannot be placed under Article XIX, Section 5.a, he will be given such other suitable employment as may then be available.
c.	When a dispute arises between the Company and the Union as to whether suitable work is available that such employee can perform consistent with the employee’s physical restrictions, the Union shall have the right, upon the request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievience Committee, to request a meeting with Labor Relations, applicable management, and a medical services representative to address the dispute. Upon such request, a meeting shall be promptly scheduled. When a dispute arises as a result of the Company's authorized physician's diagnosis that an employee is not capable of returning to work, the Company and the Union agree to refer the employee to a specialist in the field for which the medical dispute exists for a functional capacity evaluation. The Company and the Union will examine the particular job to be performed to determine the physical requirements. These findings will be jointly furnished to the medical specialist to determine if the employee can perform the physical requirements of the job. The medical specialist will make whatever physical examination necessary, and the decision will be final and binding upon the employee, the Union and the Company. The medical specialist will have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify in any way any of the terms of this agreement. The medical specialist shall be chosen from a Texas Workers Compensation Commission (TWCC) list of certified doctors, exclusive of any Company authorized physicians.
d.	The Parties recognize that modifications to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or existing practices may be required to fulfill the obligations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If such modifications or changes in practices are needed, the Parties will jointly implement such modifications or changes necessary to comply with the ADA.
Section 6.	Absence for Union Business
Union members will be given permission to be absent from or to leave the plant on bona fide Union business upon request of the President of the local Union, providing that:
a.	Twenty-four (24) hours' advance notice has been given to the Director of Labor Relations or his designee
b.	The total number for which permission is requested to be absent from the plant on any one (1) day will not exceed
twenty-five (25) and not more than two (2) of these are from any one (1) steward's district, except in those instances where an employee is elected as an official delegate to an International UAW convention, or to a function sponsored by or under the auspices of the UAW. Such time spent by employees out of the plant will not be paid for by the Company.
Section 7.	Security Provisions
Nothing contained in this Agreement will in any way limit the right of the Company to discharge any employee in order to comply with its obligations to the government under any security agreement, under any security provisions of its government contracts, or under any law, regulation or direction of the government. The Company will notify the Union prior to or immediately following such a discharge and, if permitted, will disclose to the Union the reason or basis for its action.

Section 8.	Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. Education Reimbursement Plan
The parties agree to adopt the Vought Education Reimbursement Work Instruction V.W.I. 1.8.011 for the purpose of encouraging the development of all employees. The following table outlines key elements of the plan (not inclusive).
Tuition and Required Foes	100% accredited state schools 30% accredited private schools
Program Approval	includes all courses in approved program Form submitted prior to start of class.
Executive Development Programs	These programs are not part of the Education Reimbursement Plan
Job Related/Reasonable Opportunity	Companv-related business. Must meet test of reasonable opportunity
Certificate Programs	Yes - job or company related
Courses Not a Part of an Approved Program	Must be job specific
General Education Courses (Toward a Degree)	Yes
Grades	Undergraduate - "C" in each course Graduate - "B" average Graduate - "D" or "Fail" are not reimbursed
Enrollment Limitations	2 courses per term recommended
Textbooks	Up to $60 per course
Course Required Software	50% to $200 maximum per course
Section 9.	Security and Access
a.	Since the Company has mandated security obligations in its contracts with certain other companies and/or government agencies pertaining to security access, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to place the Company in violation of said security agreements. Therefore, the Company is not required to employ, continue in its employment, assign to or give access to any employee not approved for access by the aforementioned other Company or government agency.
b.	Where it is practical and reasonable, the Company will follow the principle of seniority in determining employees to be submitted for access clearances by the appropriate other Company and/or government agency. It is recognized that other non-secured, non-accessed programs must operate efficiently, and where possible avoid disruption. Therefore, it may not be practical and reasonable to submit candidates by seniority. The Company's intent will be to follow the principle of seniority. However, should this not be practical and reasonable, the Company will discuss the matter with the appropriate committeeman(s) and the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. The Company will have no liability should it be determined that a more senior employee(s) has to be laid off while retaining a less senior employee(s) because of security requirements imposed by other companies and/or government agencies.
c.	Promotional opportunities within an access area will be filled in accordance with the contract provisions of Article VII, Section 5, Promotions. Access clearance will not be a considered factor in identification of an individual for promotion. An employee's promotion and assignment to work a job requiring security access depends upon such employee chosen for the promotion submitting access paperwork and obtaining the necessary security access from the cognizant agency in a timely manner.
d.	In a job classification requiring the assignment of a small number of employees to work full time in a security access program, the Company will request bidding employees to submit themselves for the necessary clearance in seniority order, beginning with the most senior first and so on. An employee's promotion and assignment to work a job requiring security access depends upon such employee submitting access paperwork and obtaining the necessary security access from the cognizant agency in a timely manner.
Section 10.	Masculine - Feminine References
In construing and interpreting the language of this Agreement, reference to the masculine, such as ‘'he", “him”, and “his", shall include reference to the feminine.
Section 11.	Tobacco Free Facilities
Effective July 1, 2008, the use of tobacco products will be prohibited on Company property. This “Tobacco-Free" environment will prohibit smoking or tobacco use on the premises, including parking lots, walkways and Company and employee vehicles.
From November 1, 2007 though June 30, 2008, the Company will offer a Company-paid smoking cessation program(s) for all bargaining unit employees covered by this Agreement. The program will be available for spouses at a discounted rate,

Letter of Agreement 5
Disability Benefits - Impartial Physician
In those cases in which the insurance company exercises its option to have its physician examine an employee, the insurance company has the right for the examination to be conducted in Dallas, Texas. If the insurance company exercises the right subsequent to 52 weeks following the individual's last day at work, the Parties agree that the Company will pay mileage at the rate of $.400 per mile (both ways) as determined by Rand McNally from the individual's place of domicile to Dallas, Texas. No mileage will be paid if the domicile is less than 100 miles (one way) from Dallas, Texas. If the place of domicile is 200 miles or more (one way), the individual will be paid an additional $100 lodging allowance. The Company will increase the travel allowance, if necessary, in accordance with the current applicable Company travel rate.
If, as a result of such examination, the employee is not receiving short term disability benefits or Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) and a dispute exists as to the employee's entitlement to short-term disability benefits or EDB, it is agreed as follows:
1.	That a physician will be selected in accordance with the procedure for selection of Medical Arbitrators in Article V, Section 8.p. of the Agreement between the Parties.
2.	That the affected employee who is under the regular care and attendance of a physician will be referred to the physician selected under paragraph 1. who will determine whether, if the case involves short-term disability benefits, the employee is wholly and continuously disabled and prevented from engaging in his occupation or, if the case involves EDB, whether the employee has a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment.
3.	That in the case of short-term disability benefits, if the employee is to be wholly and continuously disabled and prevented from engaging in his occupation and is and has been otherwise under the regular care and attendance of a physician, short-term disability benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the disability insurance plan under which the claim arose, including short-term disability benefits not paid because of the adverse determination of the insurance company's physician; that in the case of EDB, if the employee is found to have a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment. EDB will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the disability insurance plan under which the claim arose, including EDB not paid because of the adverse determination of the insurance company's physician.
4.	That the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement may request from an affected employee's physician or the insurance company's physician such of the employee's medical records as he deems useful to his determination.
5.	That the decision of the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement will be final and binding on the Parties.
6.	That the charges of the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement will be borne equally by the Parties.
70
7.	Provided, however, that this procedure will not be applicable and EDB will not be denied as a result of the insurance company's physician's examination where the Social Security Administration considers the employee eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and the Company considers the employee to have a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment.

Letter of Agreement 6
Carveout Procedure for Disability Benefits	7
This letter amends the original letter dated 10 August 1970 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988 to incorporate the offset procedure for Impairment Income Benefits if the employee has returned to work.	*“
The Parties have agreed to a procedure for offsetting short-term disability benefits and Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) payable under the disability income plan now in effect between the Parties.
This procedure will be referred to hereinafter as the "offset procedure", r- ■
The disability income plan provides for certain levels of benefits under the short term disability plan and EDB. This plan also pro- - > vides for the inclusion of benefits payable from such sources as Social Security, Workers' Compensation, or similar government benefits, and retirement benefits to maintain the appropriate level of benefits.	7
OFFSET PROCEDURES
k.
Short Term Disability	.
The following sources of benefits will be "offset" from short term disability benefits:	u .
1.	Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SS-DIB)
The weekly equivalent of the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments, to which an employee may be entitled for the same period for which he is receiving short-term disability benefits will be deducted from short-term disability benefits. For this reduction, the weekly equivalent of a monthly SS-DIB benefit will be considered equal to * the monthly SS-DIB amount divided by 4.333.	.
The offset procedure will be applicable only to the primary SS-DIB to which the employee is or may be entitled. No reduction in short-term disability benefits will be made because of SS-DIB which may be paid or payable to entitled	*"• •
dependents of the employee. However, if an employee's age is too great to allow him to apply for SS-DIB, any amount	* '
payable from Old Age Social Security will be deducted. The reduction will cease when the Company has r., received one SS-DIB denial.	t ,
2.	Workers' Compensation
Short-term disability benefits will also be reduced by periodic Worker's Compensation benefits paid or payable to the	'
employee for any injury for the same period for which the employee is receiving short-term disability benefits. For	►-
lump sum settlements, the reduction will be calculated using the method agreed to by the Parties in the retirement	■ •
plan. However, if the employee has returned to work and receives Impairment Income Benefits, either weekly or lump sum, there will be no offset from short-term disability benefits.	,
Extended Disability Benefits (EDB)
The following sources of benefits will be "offset" from EDB:	k
1.	Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SS-DIB)	> ,
The weekly equivalent of the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments, to which an employee may be entitled for the same period for which he is receiving EDB will be deducted from EDB. For this reduction, the weekly	'
equivalent of a monthly SS-DIB benefit will be considered equal to the monthly SS-DIB amount divided by 4.333.
The offset procedure will be applicable only to the primary SS-DIB to which the employee is or may be entitled. No >•- ■ reduction in EDB will be made because of SS-DIB which may be paid or payable to entitled dependents of the employee. However, if an employee's age is too great to allow him to apply for SS-DIB, any amount payable from Old	t
Age Social Security will be deducted. No SS-DIB offset will be taken if two denialshave been received by the Company.
72
6
2.	Workers' Compensation
EDB will also be reduced by periodic Worker's Compensation benefits paid or payable to the employee for any injury for the same period for which the employee is receiving EDB. For lump sum settlements, the reduction will be calculated using the method agreed to by the Parties in the retirement plan. However, if the employee has returned to work and receives Impairment Income Benefits, either weekly or lump sum, there will be no offset from EDB.
3.	Disability Retirement Benefits
EDB will also be offset by any benefits paid or payable under the Company's disability retirement plan, unless such benefits have been denied.
The offset procedure will be applicable to disabilities which commence on or after January 1, 1970.
There will be no integration of sick pay and short term disability benefits under the offset procedure.
The provisions, conditions and application of the disability income plan will be unaltered by this Letter of Agreement except to the extent, if any, they must be modified to implement the offset procedure.
The Company will inform affected employees of the provisions of this Letter of Agreement in a timely manner as set forth in this letter.
It is agreed that the Company may make changes in the offset procedure (including the changes in the presumed SS-DIB amount) made applicable by changes in the law governing Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits.
Step 1. Letter SS-1
Letter SS-1 is sent to the employee during the eighth week of disability. Included with the letter is an "Authorization to Secure Award or Denial Information".
Letter SS-1 advises the employee to:
1.	File a claim for SS-DIB, and
2.	Sign and submit the authorization form to the local Social Security District Office.
A copy of the award or denial should be received by the Company (per Authorization Form) by the seventh month of disability. If notice of a denial is received, no short-term disability reduction is made. If notice of an award is received, reduction of short-term disability is made.* If no notice has been received, short-term disability benefits will be reduced by the estimated SS-DIB amount.**
Where an SS-DIB award is received, the reduction in short-term disability payments is made in the employee's short-term disability check for the first full week of the seventh full calendar month of disability.
For example: If the employee became disabled on January 15, the first reduction would be from the short-term disability check for the first week of August.
However, since short-term disability reductions are effective with the sixth full calendar month of disability, an additional amount is deducted until the SS-DIB amount for the sixth month, or retroactive to the effective date of the award, has been held out.
** If the employee's SS-DIB claim has not yet been determined, or it appears an entitled employee has not filed a claim or has not provided the required medical evidence, or if the employee has been totally or partially disqualified for SS-DIB because of delayed filing, lack of treatment, or refusal without good cause to accept vocational rehabilitation training, weekly short-term disability benefits are nonetheless reduced, as in the example above (including the additional amount for the sixth month of disability), except the base weekly reduction is on a presumed SS-DIB amount, subject to changes in the law governing Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits.
The current amount of reduction for disabilities commencing on or after January 1, 2004. is $229 per week. The additional amount deducted to recover the sixth month overpayment is $50.
73
6	r
Step 2. Letter SS-2	■
Letter SS-2 is sent to the employee during the first full week of the seventh calendar month of disability.
It is written one of two ways. It tells the employee either:
1.	The notice of an SS-DIB award was received and short-term disability will be reduced, or	*-
2.	That no notice was received and the presumed SS-DIB amount will be deducted.
k .
Step 3. (Where Step 2 is not applicable) Letter SS-3
If it appears to the Company that the employee is not entitled to SS-DIB benefits (but no determination has been received) letter SS-3 is sent to the employee during the first week of the seventh month of disability.
Letter SS-3 informs the employee that no reduction in short-term disability benefits will be made presently. However, the employee is advised to immediately file a claim for SS-DIB if not already done, because if no determination of claim is received, short-term disability benefits will be reduced in accordance with the following paragraph. k .
Where neither award nor denial (per Authorization form) nor "Certificate of Social Insurance Award or Denial" (Social	,
Security document) is received by the time unreduced short-term disability payments have been made for 39	t .
weeks, the presumed reduction begins with the short-term disability check for the 40th week of disability.
However, since only 13 weeks of short-term disability benefits are now available to recoup presumed SS-DIB for 26 weeks (six months), the total presumed SS-DIB is deducted during the last 13 weeks of short-term disability.
Step 4. Letter EDB-1	L -
Letter EDB-1 is sent to the employee during the 39th week of disability. The letter advises the employee to make application for EDB, and, if applicable, for disability retirement benefits and continuation of life insurance.	£
Step 5.
Situations may arise where adjustments must be made from an employee's disability benefits. Letters SS-4 and SS-5 L are samples of letters to cover such situations.	r...
Letter SS-4; To be sent after receipt of notification of SS-DIB award (overpayment or underpayment).
Letter SS-5: To be sent after receipt of notification of denial of SS-DIB or after the maximum benefit period.
This Letter of Agreement will remain in effect for the duration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties unless otherwise mutually agreed.

Insurance Dependents After Retirement
This Letter of Agreement replaces the original letter dated 15 December 1972 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988.
The Company and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and its Local Union 848, agree as follows:
1.	At the time an employee receives the retirement exit interview, a description of the current health care rules and provisions regarding coverage for themselves, as well as their dependents, will be explained in detail. Employees will be required to provide the Company with satisfactory evidence that the dependents listed to be covered with health care after retirement meet the eligibility requirements on the date of retirement.
2.	In the event that the retiring employee's spouse is an employee of the Company on the date of the retiring employee's retirement, and is eligible for health care in his or her own right, the retiring employee may list that spouse as a future eligible dependent. However, the spouse will retain active employee health care coverage so long as a covered employee. In the event that spouse loses coverage in their own right at any time subsequent to the retiring employee's retirement date, retiree health care coverage will be extended to that spouse.
3.	Under no other circumstances will any dependents acquired subsequent to the retirement effective date be eligible for health care coverage, regardless of the relationship to the retiree.

Letter of Agreement 14 Alternative Work Schedules (AWS)
Pursuant to Article VI, Section 4, the Company may establish alternative work schedules of 4 ten-hour shifts and 3 twelve-hour shifts. Such shifts will not exceed 25% of the total UAW represented employee population. This letter of agreement outlines the provisions for the alternative work schedules referenced in Article VI, Section 4.
Schedules
• Monday - Thursday Schedule -10 hour work days
1	st Shift - 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
2nd Shift - 5:30 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
•	Friday - Sunday Schedule - 12 hour work days 1st Shift - 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
2nd Shift - 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
Alternative work schedules may be utilized in areas in which capital investment in new equipment dictates the use of such schedules for maximum efficiency. Examples of these areas include High Speed Gantries. Stringer Mills, Makino MAG 3, Makino A99, the Brotje, and such other opportunities as may be identified in the future. Prior to establishing an alternative work schedule in any such areas, the Union will be given advance notice. Upon request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, the Company will meet and confer with the Union in good faith to demonstrate the basis of the Company's belief that the establishment of an alternative work schedule will support the capital investment in such new equipment.
Staffing
•	Where management designates an area for an alternative work schedule, volunteers will be solicited from the required job family through a '‘pre-bid" self-nomination process. If there are more volunteers than openings, final selection will be based on seniority within the designated job family.
•	In the unlikely event that such requests results in an insufficient number of volunteers, employees will be assigned on an involuntary basis, in reverse seniority order, to an alternative work schedule. Prior to assigning employees on an involuntary basis, the Company will notify the Union and, upon request, meet with the Union to confer in good faith the best means of meeting the staffing requirements.
•	Once designated, agreed-to shift preference areas will include alternative schedules. For example, a more senior employee assigned to 1st shift on Monday - Thursday schedule may bump a less senior employee on 1st shift of the Friday - Sunday schedule provided they are in the same shift preference area.
Premium Hours
Employees assigned to the Monday - Thursday schedule (40 scheduled hours) will be paid a premium of 5 additional hours of straight time pay.
Employees assigned to the Friday - Sunday schedule (36 scheduled hours) will be paid a premium of 9 additional hours of straight time pay.
The provisions of Article VII, Section 5 (Shift Differential) will apply to the second shifts of each special schedule.

For Holidays that fall on a regular scheduled workday of a Monday - Thursday schedule, an employee assigned to a Monday - Thursday schedule will receive 10 hours of holiday pay.
For Holidays that fall on a regular scheduled workday of a Friday - Sunday schedule, an employee assigned to a Friday - Sunday schedule will receive 12 hours holiday pay.
In the event a Company observed holiday falls on an employee's regularly scheduled day off, the employee will receive 8 hours holiday pay.
Work performed on a holiday will be compensated at double time.

Care 90s Retiree Cost
This letter reaffirms the letter dated 28 March 1996
Retiree medical costs under Care 90s cannot be calculated based on actual experience since Care 90s is not currently offered to retirees. The Parties recognize this fact and understand as well that it is not a sound insurance practice to set the health care insurance premium rate using exclusively the experience of a group with substantially less than 1,000 covered individuals. This Letter of Agreement is written to establish the beginning point for retiree insurance costs and outline the procedure to be used for future cost calculations. In the year following the year in which the average lives covered by Care 90s reaches 1,000 retirees, insurance costs will be based on actual costs for the group and reasonable trend projections based on actual experience.
For calendar year 1993, the cost for a retiree will be assumed to be $300 per month and the cost for a family will be an additional $300 per month.
The monthly cost for calendar year 1994 will be $300 increased by the percentage increase in the health care component of the CPI-W plus two percentage points.
The monthly cost for calendar year 1995 or later will be the lesser of:
(1)	The prior year's monthly cost increased by the percentage increase in the health care component of the CPl-W plus two percentage points or
(2)	Actual experience for the latest available 12-month period, increased by the trend factor compounded from the midpoint of the experience period to the midpoint of the following calendar year.
The percentage increase in the health care component of the CPI-W plus 2 percentage points will be used in place of the trend factor until the covered group reaches 1,000 lives.
Effective January 1,2008, the retiree medical plan for retirees not eligible for Medicare is as described for the plan years beginning January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009, the monthly cost for a retiree enrolled in the Essentials plan is assumed to be $650. Beginning with the plan year commencing on January 1,2010, the monthly cost for the Essentials plan will be determined per (1) and (2) above.
For plan years 2008 and 2009, the cost of the Premium Plan will be $100.00 more per participant than the Essentials Plan. Thereafter, the pre-65 Premium Plan has a contribution rate equal to the pre-65 Essentials plan contribution rate PLUS 100% of the excess in plan cost per participant, if any, over the pre-65 Essentials plan.
The calculations will be provided to the UAW for review during the month of November each year and will utilize the latest 12 months' claim experience available when the calculation is made. The health care component of the CPI-W change will utilize the same period of time, however, should the CPI-W data not be available, the latest 12 months' available data will be used.
It is understood that claims data for all retirees and dependents covered under the Care 90s program will be used whether or not such retirees are represented by the UAW.
87
17
The numerator to be used when calculating the monthly cost will be the claims for all Care 90s retirees and dependents enrolled in the Essentials plan. The denominator to be used when calculating the monthly cost will include enrolled in the Essentials plan each retiree as one unit and all dependents of a retiree as one unit.
The experience for retirees and families will be added together for cost calculation purposes and the amount of cost charged for the retirees will be the same as the additional amount charged for the family.
The above method outlined to calculate Care 90s retiree cost will also be used to determine the cost for company contribution maximum purposes. It is further agreed that the $7,800 company contribution maximum will be subject to collective bargaining at the expiration of this 3-year Agreement for ail affected retirees who retired from the bargaining unit. The company contribution maximum was increased from $5,400 to $7,800 effective January 1, 2002.

Dear Russell:
The purpose of the letter is to clarify the terms of Letter of Agreement No. 17 regarding the cost of retiree medical coverage for bargaining unit employees.
The parties agree that, for the purposes of Article XII, section 3.b., the cost of retiree medical coverage shall be calculated based upon the per capita claims cost for the most recent twelve-month period projected to the mid-point of the contribution period based on the lesser of:
(i)	the percentage increase in the CPI-W plus two percentage points; or
(ii)	the best estimate of actual trend
The remaining provisions of Letter of Agreement No. 17. not inconsistent with the above, shall continue to apply.
If the forgoing is consistent with your understanding of our agreement, please indicate by your signature below.

Letter of Agreement 19 Return to Work
An employee returning from Section 900 must report back to work through the Company's Medical Department. The Medical Department will review the release from the employee's attending physician and will determine what restrictions, if any, the employee has. If there are restrictions placed on the employee. Medical will contact the employee's immediate supervisor or designated operations management to determine if the employee can be accepted with the restrictions.
When an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his job classification due to temporary medical restrictions, the employee may be assigned to other tasks outside his job family within the restrictions of the employee’s functional capacity record for up to ninety (90) calendar days in a calendar year. In job families affected by layoff, a limit of sixty (60) calendar days per calendar year will apply and the employees placed will not exceed the number of employees on layoff in the job family. In determining other available jobs the parties shall first examine work within the employees job family, then jobs within job families for which the employee has established bump rights under Article VII, section 1 ,c.( 1 )(a) and then any other assignments the employee is capable of performing. The Company will make every effort to place the employee on his respective shift. Should it be necessary to move an employee between shifts, the move will be reviewed every ten (10) days for alternate placement or to place a less senior employee on restrictions in that position. The functions assigned will not be limited to duties covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Temporary medical assignments will not establish Article VII, section 1 .c.( 1 )(a) rights. Employees performing such temporary medical assignments are not eligible for overtime.
The Union will be provided a weekly list (by Name, Clock Number, Unit, Shift, and duties assigned) of employees assigned to such temporary medical assignments. Any concerns of placement will be immediately addressed upon request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. If, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, a single Job Family (affected by layoff) has been disproportionately affected by placements, there will be a 30 day moratorium on additional placements in that Job Family. During such moratorium, the parties will meet to attempt to resolve issue in question.
In the event a job is located that meets the employee's medical restrictions and the returning employee refuses to accept the job, the employee will be immediately removed from Section 900 and will be deemed as having voluntarily terminated his employment.
In the event a job cannot be found to accommodate the employee's restrictions, the employee will be retained in Section 900 until he returns to work or eligible benefits are exhausted, whichever occurs first.
If while in Section 900, an employee engages in other employment, that employee will be immediately removed from Section 900, and will be deemed as having voluntarily terminated his employment.

Family and Medical Leave of Absence
-
The parties agree on the following terms and conditions under which a UAW-represented employee may request time off for family leave without pay for a limited period. This Agreement is intended to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and related regulations. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between any of the provisions of this Agreement or the collective bargaining agreement made and entered into on March 2,1992, FMLA shall govern. However, if this Agreement or the collective bargaining agreement provide greater leave rights to UAW-represented employees than those rights provided by FMLA, then this Agreement, or the collective bargaining agreement, as the case may be, shall govern.
1.0 DEFINITIONS
1.1	Eligibility - To be eligible for family leave, an employee must have been employed for a total of at least 12 months, and must have worked at least 1250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. For each regular or normal workday that an employee is in Section 900, on vacation, or on personal/sick leave, such employee will be credited with eight hours solely for purposes of determining eligibility for family leave. However, an otherwise eligible employee who is employed at a worksite where less than 50 employees of the company are employed within 75 miles of that worksite is ineligible for family leave, but such leave may be approved upon the mutual agreement of the company and a committee comprised of (i) the president of UAW Local 848, (ii) the Benefits Coordinator, and (iii) the committeeman for the applicable zone (or the committeeman designated by the union for such purpose).
1.2	Family Leave - A leave of absence which may be taken by eligible employees for up to 12 weeks during a 12-month period under the following circumstances:
•	Upon the birth of the employee's child and/or to care for such child
•	Upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care
•	When the employee is needed to care for employee's child (including stepchild), spouse, or parent (including step-parent) who has a serious health condition
•	When the employee is unable to perform the essential job functions because of a serious health condition
1.3	Intermittent Leave (Sporadic) - Medically necessary family leave which is taken in separate blocks of time due to a single illness or injury, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include leave periods from an hour or more to several weeks.
EX: Employee takes 3 hours one week and 12 hours the next week.
1.4	Reduced Leave (Scheduled) - Medically necessary family leave that reduced an employee’s usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per work day.
EX: Employee leaves every Tuesday and Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.
1.5	Overtime - Time away from work without pay during intermittent or reduced leave will be considered as “time worked" or “work performed" solely for purposes of calculating and paying overtime under the collective bargaining agreement.
1.6	12 - Month Period - The period within which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs as determined by
a "rolling" 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave. Accordingly, each time an employee takes an approved family leave, the remaining leave entitlement will be any balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding 12 months.
2.0 GENERAL
2.1	Leave taken for the birth of a child and/or to care for such child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, expires at the end of the 12- month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement of a child.
2.2	The company will require medical certification to support a request for leave due to the serious health condition of the employee or the employee s child, spouse or parent. In the case of foreseeable leave, an employee who fails to provide certification within 15 days from the date leave is requested may be denied the taking of leave until the required certification is provided. When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide certification within 20 days after the date of the company's request or as soon as reasonably possible under the particular facts and circumstances. If an employee fails to provide a medical certification, the company will deny the employee's continuation of leave.
2.3	At its discretion, the company may require a second medical opinion at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the company, at its own expense, may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the company and the union.
92
20
2.4	If medically necessary due to a serious health condition of the employee or employee's spouse, child or parent, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. However, the employee must attempt to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt company operations. If intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule is requested, the company will require medical certification. Where an employee takes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually taken is counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to which an employee is entitled.
2.5	Leave is unpaid, except that an employee's earned or accrued paid vacation or paid personal/sick leave may at the employee's option be substituted for all or part of any otherwise unpaid leave under this Agreement.
2.6	Based on information provided by the employee, the company may designate leave, whether paid or unpaid, as family leave for purposes of this Agreement. The company’s designation will be made before the leave starts, or before an extension of the leave is granted, unless the company does not have sufficient information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave until after the leave commenced. If either the company or the employee designates leave as family leave within the meaning of this Agreement after the leave has begun, the entire or some portion of the paid leave period may be retroactively counted as family leave, to the extent that the leave period counted as family leave.
2.7	When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth or adoption of a child, or planned medical treatment, the employee must provide at least 30 days prior notice before family leave is to begin. However, if 30 days notice is not practical, then notice must be given as soon as practical. If an employee fails to give 30 days' notice for foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the company may deny the taking of family leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the company.
2.8	When the need for family leave, or its approximate timing, is not foreseeable, an employee should give notice to the company of the need for family leave as soon as practical under the facts and circumstances.
2.9	The company will require an employee on approved leave to report bimonthly to Medical Services on the employee's status and intent to return to work.
2.10	Any employee who is granted an approved leave of absence under this procedure is entitled to continued coverage under the company's health care plan, life insurance plan, and the health care account of the Flexible Spending Account during the period of unpaid absence on the same basis as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the period of leave.
2.11	With respect to any life insurance coverage which was continued during any period of unpaid leave, the company may recover from the employee any premium payments made on the employee's behalf to maintain coverage during such period, whether or not the employee returns from leave. With respect to any health care coverage which was continued during any period of unpaid leave, if an employee fails to return to work for a period of at least 30 calendar days after any approved leave has been exhausted or expires, the company may recover from the employee the company's share of allowable "premiums'' as would be calculated under COBRA, excluding the 2% fee for administrative costs. However, the company will not recover such COBRA premiums if the employee's failure to return to work for such 30-day period is due to: 2.11.1 The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition of the employee or the employee's immediate family member which would entitle the employee to leave under this Agreement. The company will require medical certification of the employee's or the family member's serious health condition. The employee is required to provide medical certification within the 30-day period, then the company may recover the COBRA premiums during the period of unpaid leave.
2.11.2 Other circumstances beyond the employee’s control (as approved by the company).
2.12	Under the terms of the retirement plan, any period of approved leave will be treated as continuous service (i.e., no break in service) for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual,
2.13	At the conclusion of an approved leave, an employee’s right to return to work shall be governed by the applicable terms of the collective bargaining agreement.

Letter of Agreement 23 New Technology
The application of technological advancements is recognized by the Union and the Company as being essential to both the Company's growth and ability to compete and to the continued improvements of the standard of living of employees covered by the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The term "new technology" will be defined as the installation of automated manufacturing machines, robots and computer-aided manufacturing systems which cause the direct elimination of work which has been performed manually by an hourly-represented employee. As a result, recognizing that future technological changes will occur and that such future changes cannot be definitized at this time, the Company agrees:
1.	That with the introduction of "new technologies" it is important that advanced planning be made to anticipate substantial changes that would eliminate or consolidate jobs, require new skills or substantial retraining. Therefore, at the time such substantial technological changes which affect bargaining unit employees are defined, discussions with the Union will be held. The discussions will be with the President, Chairman, and Zone Committeeman for affected areas. Upon determination that the impact of the change is "new technology" as defined in this Agreement, the Parties may establish a joint sub-committee(s). hereinafter referred to as joint new technology committee(s). The joint new technology committee(s) will be established by mutual agreement to study specific issues, make recommendations, and complete actions as mutually directed by the Parties.
When it is mutually agreed by the Parties to establish a joint new technology committee(s), the Union will appoint up to three (3) members and the Company will appoint up to three (3) members. The Committee(s), may request a maximum of two (2) additional temporary members if deemed necessary. It is further agreed that appointees to the joint new technology committee(s) will be individuals from the affected area(s) which are knowledgeable of the operation(s) where the new technology will be implemented. The joint new technology committee(s) will be under the oversight of the Plant Grievance Committee and the Director - Labor Relations.
2.	When new hourly-rated jobs are instituted by the Company in accordance with Article IX. Section 1.b. of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as a result of such technological changes the Company will counsel affected bargaining unit employees in their efforts to obtain additional or update existing skills commensurate with the technological change so they can be considered for placement in such new jobs.
3.	While the Company does not anticipate vast reductions in the workforce due to new technology, if a reduction will result from the introduction of such new technology, the Company will make every reasonable effort to achieve such reduction through normal attrition due to quits, deaths and retirements.
The Company considers this letter as its commitment to a employees as technology advances.

Letter of Agreement 31 Substance Abuse Testing Program Effective 2 October 2000
The Parties to this Agreement, UAW Local 848 and Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. wish to cooperate in making our work place a safe environment and our workforce a productive one for the benefit of all the Parties, our customers and our community.
To that end the Company affirms that it will zealously administer and conduct its drug testing programs to ensure that:
•	The dignity and privacy of those tested will be safeguarded to the maximum extent possible.
*	The program may not be used for any purpose except the achievement of a drug-free workplace and workforce.
*	It will continue to employ the rigorous controls, safety checks and quality control measures that are employed in
testing other segments of the workforce.
For its part, the Union (UAW Local 848) agrees to support the Substance Abuse Testing Program described herein. All parties agree that their mutual interests will be best served in adopting this program to achieve the goal of a drug-free workplace and workforce.
Section 1.	Purpose
To define substance abuse testing practices to provide a drug-free workplace/workforce for all employees.
Section 2.	Policy
It is the policy of the Company to hire/employ only individuals who do not use illegal drugs or other controlled substances in any amount or frequency, unless properly prescribed for them by their physician. The term "illegal drugs" means controlled substances included in Schedules I through V as defined by Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812), the possession of which are unlawful, and include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine and propoxyphene. The Company will not arbitrarily change the current list of drugs being tested. In the event the Company deems it appropriate to change the list of drugs being tested (Substance Abuse Panel-10), the Company will consult with the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to any change. In the event the parties do not agree on the proposed change, such change will not take effect until the issue can be resolved by a mutually satisfactory third party. The term "illegal drugs" does not include controlled substances obtained and used pursuant to a valid prescription or as otherwise authorized by law. Human Resources will administer the following "Substance Abuse Testing Program." The Substance Abuse Testing Program will apply to the following individuals
a)	All UAW represented new hires, recalls, rehires, and reinstatements will be tested as part of the Company's pre-employment review requirements. If the employee has not been absent from the payroll for thirty (30) days or more, this provision will not apply.
b)	All UAW represented employees will be subject to systematic random testing without notice and after a positive test, accelerated testing under Section 4.c.
c)	All UAW represented employees will be tested for cause based upon a reasonable suspicion to believe that such persons are under the influence of illegal drugs, after involvement in accidents or potentially dangerous near-miss accidents which could be attributed to substance abuse or whose performance is impaired and who exhibit behavior consistent with substance abuse.
105
31
Section 3.	General Procedures
a)	Urinalysis drug screen tests consist of an initial Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT) screen, confirmed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Such testing will be conducted by a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (formerly NIDA) certified laboratory. The screening parameters and cut-off levels for both test categories are published by SAMHSA.
b)	Individuals to be tested will complete and sign an Authorization and Release Form (Attachment 1). listing prescribed and over-the-counter medications taken within the last thirty (30) days. Failure to sign an Authorization and Release Form or to provide a sample in accordance with the procedures set forth herein will be considered failure to successfully complete the substance abuse test and will be reason for disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
c)	The collection of individual urine samples and the testing of same will be supervised by Company-designated medical personnel and collection/testing facilities in a manner consistent with the following standards:
(1)	Urine samples will be collected from individuals in such a manner as to ensure the integrity of the testing process.
(2)	Special containers will be provided for specimen collection.
(3)	Suitable, sanitary and private facilities will be provided for the collection of urine specimens.
(4)	Sample collection will be supervised, but not witnessed. An enclosed stall will be provided to ensure
privacy of the individual.
(5)	The Vought Medical Department clinic manager or approved designee will immediately review all situations where there is reasonable suspicion that an individual has submitted a suspicious or potentially adulterated sample. When the Medical Department or its approved designee determines an original sample to be suspicious, that sample shall immediately be set aside as unsuitable for testing and the individual must submit another sample before leaving the collection site. Samples may be considered suspicious or potentially substituted or adulterated if the urine temperature registers below 90° or above 100° within four minutes, and/or the sample imparts a suspicious odor or abnormal appearance.
(6)	Container will be sealed with tamper-evident tape in the presence of the individual tested.
(7)	Specimens will be labeled and checked to ensure that the name on the label matches the name on the
Authorization & Release Form and the Chain of Custody Requisition Form.
(8)	The label will be signed by the individual.
(9)	The Chain of Custody Requisition Form and the Authorization and Release Form will be kept on file for one (1) year from the date of testing for a positive specimen and one (1) month from the date of testing for a negative specimen.
(10)	The lab will relay test results to the Medical Review Officer who will personally discuss lab tests reported positive with the individual. If the Medical Review Officer determines the positive test is the result of legal usage, the test will be reported as negative. Only results certified as positive by the Medical Review Officer will apply in Section 4. below.
d)	Test results will be handled as "Company Private" information and are not to be communicated outside the Company, except as required by contract or law. Currently, these requirements are clearance reporting requirements and court orders.
e)	Individuals who test positive may request, within thirty (30) days of being notified of their results, a re-confirmation test on the same biological specimen, to be conducted by a SAMHSA certified testing facility at the individual's expense. Such re-confirmation testing only uses the GC/MS method, and only tests for the presence of the drug(s) and/or drug metabolites in question. The presence of those drug(s) and/or drug metabolites at any detectable level by GC/MS, without regard to the previous screening and confirmation test cutoff levels, is considered a positive result. In the unlikely event the test results are negative, the Company will reimburse the employee for laboratory testing charges.
f)	If there is a reasonable suspicion of a faulty specimen or if the laboratory report shows evidence of an "abnormality" in the specimen, Vought Medical may request a retest. The Vought Medical Review Officer will provide the employee with an explanation for the retest.
g)	The following actions are considered major disciplinary offenses, and are equivalent to a positive test result for purposes of determining subsequent disciplinary actions and processing in accordance with Section 4 below: (1) repeated refusal to cooperate with the testing procedures, (2) laboratory documentation of substitution or adulteration of a test sample: (3) failure to report for testing within a reasonable amount of time after being notified of a random drug test.
106
31
Section 4.	Positive Test Results
a)	Positive test results are communicated to the employee in person by the Medical Review Officer and negative results are communicated via personal and confidential memo.
b)	If the Medical Review Officer is convinced the positive test results are the result of a one (1) time usage of a valid prescription issued to a member of the employee's immediate family, the test results will be pended and the employee will be subject to accelerated unannounced testing for the next ninety (90) day period.
c)	Employees who test positive will be placed on unpaid suspension for five (5) working days and in addition, during the five (5) day period, will be required to seek help from a company directed counseling and assistance program or a company-approved drug treatment program prior to being allowed to return to work. The employee will be required to read and sign a Return-To-Work Conditions Form (Attachment 2).
d)	The employee will be subjected to regular random drug tests as well as an accelerated schedule of unscheduled and unannounced tests, for two (2) years following his or her return to work. For the purpose of calculating two (2) calendar years, any period of time spent on layoff or on vacation will count towards the satisfaction of the two (2) year testing period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee will not be considered to be “subject to testing” during any period of time on layoff or in Section 900 in excess of thirty (30) consecutive days. Accordingly, the employee shall be subject to an additional period of accelerated unannounced testing equal to any such period(s) spent in Section 900.The two (2) year period does not constitute an employment contract or other guarantee of employment during such period.
e)	The employee who tests positive again under d, above, will be discharged.
Section 5.	Recalled Employees
a)	All laid off employees with recall rights who have been absent from the payroll for at least thirty (30) days and who are offered employment in accordance with Section 2 of Article VII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall report to the plant Medical Department for a drug test.
b)	A laid off employee who tests positive within a two (2) year period from the date of a previous positive test will be denied recall and lose all seniority.
c)	A laid off employee who tests positive beyond the two (2) year period of a previous positive test or an employee who tests positive who was not on accelerated drug screening at the time of layoff will be denied recall and bypassed for a thirty (30) day period beginning on the date the positive test results are communicated, during which time the individual should seek help from a drug counseling or treatment program. Upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the individual shall again report to the plant Medical Department for a drug test. If the individual again tests positive, he/she will be denied recall and lose all seniority. If the individual tests negative, he/she will be returned to work but subjected to regular random drug tests as well as an accelerated schedule of unscheduled and unannounced tests for two (2) years following his/her return to work.
Section 6.	Testing For Cause
a)	When there is reasonable suspicion to believe an individual's behavior has been impaired by substance abuse or after involvement in an accident which caused a bodily injury of more than minor cut(s), contusion(s), or abrasion(s) or property damage of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or more, the employee will be subject to the above testing procedures.
b)	Prior to the authorization of a "reasonable cause" drug test, the Medical Department's professional judgment must indicate a need for such test. The Site Manager of Human Resources and the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee will discuss the issue before a drug test is to be administered on a "reasonable cause" basis, and if concurrence is not obtained, the employee will give a sample, but it will not be submitted to the laboratory until the issue is resolved through the grievance procedure.
c)	Nothing in this policy will preclude the Company from taking action against the employee warranted by other policies, procedures, rules of conduct, etc.
107
31
Section 7.	Testing Responsibility
a)	Medical informs supervision in a timely manner of employees selected for substance abuse testing.
b)	The supervisor has the employee read the instruction letter and fill out an Authorization and Release Form (Attachment 3). The employee is sent to Medical.
c)	Medical has the employee sign the Authorization and Release Form and collects a sample as specified in the General Procedures section.
d)	The Company’s Medical Review Officer receives test results, confirms test results, notifies employee(s), and communicates positive test results to the Site Manager of Human Resources or designee.
e)	If a test result is a Medical Review Officer confirmed positive, Medical notifies the appropriate Labor Relations Representative for action as outlined in Section 4.
f)	Labor Relations notifies Security of positive results when the employee has a security clearance.
g)	Labor Relations notifies the EAP Coordinator of applicable positive test results so that coordination with the
EAP provider can be established.
h)	The Company Medical Director is authorized to release individual employee test results to Security when the employee is being submitted for a security clearance.

Letter of Agreement 33 Vacation for UAW Transfers
This letter reaffirms the letter dated 23 June 1988.
It was agreed during 1988 contract negotiations that transfers from the bargaining unit will not transfer vacation into the bargaining unit in excess of the lesser of:
A.	Vacation payable and/or accrued on the date of the transfer to the bargaining unit.
B.	Vacation that would have been payable or accrued had the employee not transferred from the bargaining unit. Vacation taken will be used in the calculation.
example A
Employee "A" transfers to the salaried payroll on July 1.
At the date of transfer, employee "A" had 20+ years of vacation service.
Employee "A" had 20 days of vacation to be taken before the subsequent January 1, and had accrued 10 days of pro-rata which would have been available for use after the subsequent January 1.
Employee "A" takes 10 days of vacation in the following September.
On October 1 (3 months after transfer to salary), Employee "A" transfers back into the bargaining unit.
Employee "A" transfers back into the bargaining unit 10 days of vacation to be taken before the following January 1, and 13 days of pro-rata vacation. Ten of the pro-rata days were accrued as hourly before the transfer to salaried, and 3 of the days were accrued as salaried. Employee "A" was allowed to transfer his full current and accrued vacation since it was not more than he would have had by remaining in the bargaining unit.
EXAMPLE B
Employees transferring into the bargaining unit will have no vacation until earned under Article X, Section 7.

Letter of Agreement 34 Dependent Life Insurance
This letter replaces the original letter dated 15 February 1982 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988.
It was agreed by the Parties during the 1981 negotiations that provisions would be made for offering dependent life insurance to employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. (Reference Article XX. Section 2.d).
Following is a description of the Dependent Group Life Insurance Program to be offered to eligible employees beginning March 1. 1982.
1.	Eligibility Date
An employee will become eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance on March 1. 1982, provided that the employee has at least one eligible dependent as defined io Section 3. below. If the employee does not then have such a dependent, the employee will become eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance on the first day of the calendar month following the date a dependent is acquired.
The date that the employee becomes eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance will be hereinafter referred to as the employee's eligibility date.
2.	Enrollment and Effective Dates
The employee's Dependent Group Life Insurance will become effective as set forth below:
a.	If the employee enrolls on or before the eligibility date, insurance becomes effective on the eligibility date.
b.	If the employee enrolls during the 30-day period following the eligibility date, insurance becomes effective
immediately.
c.	If the employee enrolls subsequent to the 30th day following eligibility, the employee must furnish evidence satisfactory to the insurance company of each dependent's good health. In such case, insurance will become effective on the first day of the calendar month following the date the insurance company approves the evidence, with respect to those persons whose evidence has been approved and who are still eligible dependents, as defined in Section 3., below.
In any event, for insurance to become effective, the employee must be actively at work on the date insurance would otherwise become effective. If the employee is not actively at work on such date, insurance becomes effective on the date the employee returns to active work, provided the employee is then still eligible as set forth in Section 1 above.
3.	Definitions of dependents are the same as the health care definitions, provided that employees' spouses who are also employees of the Company may be covered by this Dependent Life Insurance until such time as the insurance company elects not to provide the dependent coverage due to a conflict of state insurance laws. Coverage will remain in effect until the conflict is explained to the employee in writing by the insurance company and premiums are discontinued.
4.	Amount of Insurance
The amount of Dependent Group Life Insurance applicable to each dependent is as follows:
Amount of Insurance
Spouse $20,000
Child $10,000
113
34
5.	Contributions
The employee will contribute the full cost of Dependent Group Life Insurance and contributions will be payable monthly in advance. Coverage for this insurance is fully pooled and not eligible for dividends of any manner. The required monthly contribution, regardless of the number of dependents on whose account the employee is insured, is as set forth in the following schedule, which is subject to change. An employee who elects to participate will complete a payroll deduction card authorizing weekly payroll deductions. When a participant is not receiving weekly payments, it is the employee's responsibility to transmit the appropriate payment to Payroll. In the event the participant fails to make the required payment as outlined in Section 7. the coverage will terminate and the employee may reapply for coverage only by furnishing satisfactory evidence of good health as required in Section 2.
Schedule - Cost Per Dependent Unit Per Week (subject to change annually based on experience)
Over 50%	Below 50%
Enrollment	Enrollment
$.48	No Plan
6.	Payment of Benefits
If a dependent dies from any cause while the employee is insured for Dependent Group Life Insurance, the amount of such insurance in force on account of the dependent will be paid in a lump sum to the employee (the employee is the beneficiary for Dependent Group Life Insurance). The employee’s insurance certificate will set forth the procedure for payment of insurance in case a dependent dies subsequent to the death of the employee. This insurance is term insurance without cash, loan or paid-up values.
7.	Cessation of Insurance
Dependent Group Life Insurance will automatically cease on the earliest of the following:
a.	The	date the employee ceases to have a dependent as defined in Section	3.. above.
b.	The	date the employee ceases to be insured for Company life insurance.
c.	If the employee fails to make a required contribution for Dependent Group	Life Insurance when due.
d.	The	last day of the calendar month in which the employee attains age 70.
e.	The date of discontinuance of the Dependent Group Life Insurance.
f.	The date the dependent begins active duty in the armed forces of any state.
g.	The date the dependent becomes insured as an employee on a regular full-time basis.

Letter of Agreement 35
Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator
The Union will designate and secure Company agreement with an individual to serve as the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator. Once designated, the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will work with the Company on any identified sexual harassment related issues within the bargaining unit, will have the authority to request investigations by Human Resources, and collective bargaining unit employees will be allowed access to the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator on Company time. The Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be allowed reasonable time at Company expense to perform in this capacity, however, the Coordinator will not perform these activities in an overtime situation.
The following guidelines outline the working procedure between the UAW Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator and Human Resources.
Sexual harassment allegations will be investigated by Human Resources. When Human Resources is advised of an allegation involving a UAW-represented employee, the UAW Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be contacted prior to any investigation.
Human Resources and the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will exchange known information and will discuss the direction of the planned investigation including who will be interviewed.
The UAW Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be involved in all interviews involving bargaining unit employees and interviews of non-bargaining unit employees where allegations have been made against bargaining unit employees.
It is not necessary for the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator to be present in interviews with salaried employees where no allegations have been made against bargaining unit employees; however, if there are bargaining unit witnesses to be interviewed, the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be present during the witness interviews.
Once the investigation involving represented employees is complete, the total file will be discussed with the UAW Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator prior to its disposition. Human Resources will not provide the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator with copies of statements.
Upon request, the complete file will be discussed with the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, and copies will be provided in a timely manner.

Letter of Agreement 36 Workforce Diversity
The Parties agree that to remain competitive in today's market place, it is critical to continue to maintain a workplace that values, understands, respects and best utilizes the diversity of Vought employees. As our workforce continues to change, it is the desire of both parties to recruit, employ, train, transfer, and advance people regardless of their race, color, religion, gender, mental or physical disabilities, national origin, age, military status, or any other characteristics that makes us different from one another.
Due to the priority both parties place on workforce diversity, a joint effort will be made to establish and coordinate a Workforce Diversity Team. This team will meet six (6) times a year and will accomplish the following:
Review policies and practices, as well as recommend changes as appropriate, within the bargaining unit environment, that may hinder the advancement or development of women, minorities, the disabled or people who differ culturally; and
Develop ways that enable employees at all levels to appreciate and respect individual differences.
Provide recommendations to the company on methods of delivering education regarding “What is Diversity" and how to best value and utilize it.
The team will be co-chaired by the UAW local President and a member of Human Resources. The team will consist of 10 members; two co-chairs, one member of human resources, and seven UAW appointed representatives. The seven UAW appointed representatives would serve as members of the team for a term of approximately 18 months.

Letter of Agreement 37 Smoking in the Workplace (Effective 2 October 2000)
The Company and the Union are committed to maintaining a safe, healthful and comfortable place to work. Because of increased concerns about the effects of secondary or side-stream tobacco smoke on employees’ health, the Parties agree to the following provisions that will reduce employees' exposure to smoke while balancing the rights of smokers and nonsmokers.
Smoking will be permitted in open factory and shop areas where not specifically prohibited by this Agreement.
Smoking will be prohibited in the following areas:
•	The Company and the Union have agreed to an equitable number of factory restrooms designated as smoking/ non-smoking. Signs will be maintained in each restroom accordingly.
•	All Cafeterias
•	Designated areas where smoking presents a hazard to personnel or property in the area (fire or safety hazard)
•	Open factory, shop areas, and break rooms (areas) that have been designated no smoking by the majority of
employees in that area. The affected Committeeperson and Steward will be available to support the decision making process. Any decision arrived at will be upheld for a minimum of one year.
•	Enclosed or confined factory and shop areas including, but not limited to private offices, open office areas, workstations and cubicles, conference rooms, meeting rooms, classrooms, medical facilities, elevators and stairways.
•	Salaried areas designated no-smoking by Company directive
The success of this agreement depends upon the thoughtfulness, consideration, and cooperation of all employees. To support smokers, who may wish to stop smoking, education and cessation programs will be offered on an ongoing basis. This Letter of Agreement #37 will become null and void effective July 1, 2008, in accordance with the provisions of Article XIX, Section 11.

Letter of Agreement
Nashville 1AM Represented Employee Transferring to Dallas
Per recent Company announcements, plans are in place to facilitate the addition of capital equipment, facility upgrades and the rearrangement of buildings that will be located within the Dallas Jefferson St. and Marshall Drive Facilities. These capital additions will help accommodate the relocation of work from the Nashville. Tennessee site. This work will transition in phases over, but not limited to, a thirty six month period as the Nashville site is closed.
In a mutually beneficial effort to attract and relocate as many experienced aerospace workers currently employed at the Nashville Site to the Dallas Site, the parties have reached the following agreement:
Employees electing to transfer to Dallas to perform work will be covered by the UAW certification as designated in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Certification No. 16R1744, dated July 19, 1946, the NLRB Certification of Representatives in Case No. 16RC2696 (Bargaining Unit Voting Group 1), dated April 12, 1960, those employees designated in NLRB Certification No. 16RC3476, dated August 29, 1963, and those employees designated in the mutual Agreement between the Parties, dated December 8, 1961.
Job Placement
•	The Company will offer an hourly job in Dallas to all hourly employees represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM) in Nashville who elect to transfer. The positions offered will be jobs outlined in the UAW agreed-to job family appendices.
•	Nashville employees transferring will be offered, to the extent possible, a similar job and classification corresponding to the closest equivalent job within the UAW job family and classification structure.
•	Nashville employees electing to relocate to Dallas will transfer at their current Nashville hourly wage rate effective on their actual start to work date in Dallas and subsequently progress per the provisions of the UAW collective bargaining agreement.
•	Nashville employees will not be transferred until the current UAW recall lists of the applicable job family is exhausted. Once all laid off UAW employees with rights to the target job family have a documented, active recall letter placed in the U.S. Mail Service the recall list will be considered exhausted.
•	A list, including name and job family placement, of the Nashville employees electing to relocate will be provided to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee within a reasonable time period. Additions to the list subsequent to the date the list is provided must be by mutual agreement
Seniority
•	The date the first hourly Nashville employee begins work within the Dallas facility will be the in-date seniority date for all subsequent transferring employees
Nashville Letter of Agreement t of 3
126
2007 Collective Bargaining Agreement
•	Nashville employees will remain in relative Nashville seniority order within the indate established, within their respective job families, regardless of report to work date.
•	Nashville transfers will have their total Company service time count toward vacation accrual rates per Article X, section 7.
•	The Service Date, which will be the Original Company Seniority Date for Nashville employees, will be the calculation and award date for vacation hours earned.
•	Nashville employees relocating to Dallas with available vacation hours on the books will be allowed to transfer them one for one and be able to utilize them per Article X, section 7.
Pension and Retiree Medical
•	After a five (5) year qualifying period from the date a Nashville employee actually begins work at the Dallas facility, they will be eligible for the negotiated retiree medical provisions per Article XII, section 3., b.. Should a Nashville employee voluntarily quit prior to the 5 year period, they will be covered under the plan in place for Nashville heritage hourly employees. Should a Nashville transfer be affected by layoff during the first year in Dallas, the five year limit will be waived.
•	Transfers, provided they are currently vested, will begin accruing pension benefits per the provisions of Article XIII of the UAW collective bargaining agreement beginning the first day of work in Dallas. Employees transferring who are not vested will have Nashville and Dallas service time count toward being vested. Once vested, all Dallas service time will count toward the UAW pension benefit.
•	Transferred employees who are, or become, eligible for the early retirement supplement outlined in Article XIII, Section 2, c. and qualify for a similar benefit under a Nashville heritage plan will only be eligible for one supplement..
Miscellaneous
•	Nashville I AM employees on layoff, if interested, will be considered for open positions along with outside new hires. In the event a laid off Nashville employee is hired they will be offered a wage rate no lower than their Nashville recall rate.
•	Existing Nashville Employees classified as Leads will not be transferred into UAW Lead classifications.
•	In the event an open job is posted per Article VII, section 5 subsequent to the establishment of the Nashville In-date but prior to a Nashville employee starting to work in the posted job family, and an existing UAW employee is selected for the position, the In-date seniority date for the UAW employee selected will be the same as the established Nashville in-date. Once a Nashville Employee transfers into a UAW job family or a new hire from the street is hired into the applicable job family all postings in that job family will be per Article VII, section 5.
•	In the event there are unclear job classification matches, (Plant Maintenance for example) both parties will review the employee’s skills and experience for placement into a UAW job classification.

Memorandum of Agreement Voluntary Political Contributions (Revised November 26, 2007)
It is agreed between, Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. (Company) and the International Union, UAW and its Local 848 (Union) that the following understandings have been reached in connection with deductions for voluntary political contributions from the monthly pension checks of the Company’s hourly retirees and eligible surviving spouses. The Company will assume the actual costs of general administration.
The Company also will continue to take deductions from the paychecks of active hourly employees in the same manner as it has in the past.
1.	A designated official of the Union will furnish to the Company for each hourly employee, retiree or surviving spouse for whom a deduction is to be taken, an Authorization Card signed by the employee, retiree or surviving spouse.
Cards that cannot be processed will be returned to the designated official of the Union for correction.
2.	The Union will retain exclusive responsibility for soliciting employees’, retirees’ and surviving spouses’ participation, including compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act.
3.	With respect to retirees and surviving spouses, the Company will take such authorized deductions from regular pension checks monthly and continuing monthly while such authorization is in effect, absent any conflicting legal requirements. In any case, deductions will be taken from any pension checks transmitted to the retiree or surviving spouse through regular processing but will not be made from checks prepared through special processing. Current processes for deducting from the pay of active employees will in all respects be unchanged.
4.	A deduction not taken in one month will not be carried forward to a subsequent month; the amount that can be deducted from pension checks is limited by law. Deductions for V-CAP will be subordinate to all other deductions permitted or authorized by law if total deductions exceed legal limitations.
5.	Retirees, surviving spouses and employees who wish to cancel their authorizations for deductions will sign a form supplied by the Union for that purpose. Refunds will be the responsibility of the Union.
6.	Designated officials of the Union will collect and forward to the Company, all signed Authorization Cards and Cancellation forms for the initial processing and once each month for subsequent additions, deletions and changes.

8.	The Union will indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any and all liability or claims arising form any claims or administrative errors resulting from the deductions provided for in this Agreement.
