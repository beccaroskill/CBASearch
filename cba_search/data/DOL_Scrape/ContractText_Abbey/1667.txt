4.3	In line with this, the Union and the Association hereby commit themselves to cooperate with one another in the development of ways, means, and programs that will make for a more efficient, productive, and responsible work force.
4.4	Also, it is the desire of the Union and the Contractor to maintain a harmonious working relationship between themselves and to cooperate to the extent possible in attempting to resolve mutual problems that face Hawaii's Construction Industry.
Section 5.	UNION SECURITY
5.1	Each employee covered by this Agreement shall, as a condition of continued employment, become a member of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the date of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is later, and the employee shall thereafter maintain such membership in good standing by continuing to tender dues to the Union for the duration of this Agreement.

6.4	The Union's per hour dues, and any other deductible amounts which are based on hours worked by an employee, shall be deducted on a weekly basis and shall be transmitted by the Contractor to the Union at the same time as Trust Fund payments are, transmitted. The Contractor acknowledges that dues deductions are employee wages and that failure to transmit said dues once deducted is an unlawful retention of monies that do not belong to the Contractor.
6.5	In the event the State Joint Board determines that a Contractor has violated this Section, it shall impose the following penalties on said Contractor:
-4-
(a)	liquidated damages in the amount of twenty percent (20%) of such delinquent and unpaid dues or twenty dollars ($20), whichever is greater, for each and every delinquent monthly amount,

Where one or more checks are not received by the Union in a proper and timely manner, the Contractor may be placed on a "transmittal verification" listing after being verified by the State Joint Board. The State Joint Board shall have a subcommittee composed of the co-chairman to expeditiously make decisions in such cases.

7.1	The parties hereto agree that during the term of this Agreement there shall be no lockout by the Contractor nor any strike, stoppage of work, or slowdown on the part of the Union or its representatives or on the part of any employee covered by the terms of this Agreement, except as provided under paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 below.
7.2	Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving a Contractor the right to require said Contractor's employees to cross a legitimate picket line. A legitimate picket line is one that is not in violation of the law. Employees who exercise their option of refusing to cross a legitimate picket line shall not be disciplined, discriminated against, or suffer any other adverse treatment by the Employer.
7.3	If a Contractor fails to make timely payment to any of the trust funds provided for in this Agreement, OR if such Contractor fails to make timely transmittal of amounts deducted for Union dues, initiation fees, and assessments as provided for under Section 6. (Authorized Deductions), and so long as either cf these conditions continue, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to withdraw its members from the performance of work for said Contractor. In each case, the Union shall give written notice to the Contractor involved of its intent to withdraw such Contractor’s employees, and the Contractor shall be given five (5) working days from receipt of said notice in which to make necessary full payment. If such full payment is not made within said five-day period, the Union shall then be free to withdraw said Contractor’s employees and to continue said withdrawal until full payment is made.
7.4	It is mutually understood and agreed that neither the Association, any Contractor, nor the Union shall be liable for damages caused by the acts or conduct of any individual or group of individuals who are acting or conducting themselves in violation of the terms of this Agreement, provided that such action or conduct has not been specifically authorized, participated in, fomented, or condoned by the Association, any Contractor, or the Union, as the case may be.
-5-

Such individuals acting or conducting themselves in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.	'
'	Section 8. DISCIPLINE OR DISCHARGE
8.1	Employees shall be subject to discipline or discharge for just cause.
8.2	A probationary period of ten (10) working days shall be established for all new employees and such new employees may be summarily discharged. Anytime an employee is dispatched to a Contractor he/she shall be considered a "new" employee (regardless of whether he/she was a former employee).

Page 13
TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF TEMPORARY SUMMER HIRES
Effective And Applicable ONLY From
June 1 Through September 30 Of Each Year
PREAMBLE
For various reasons, a Construction Company, like any Employer, may be "required" or otherwise feel compelled by practical considerations and pressures to employ a student and/or other person(s) during the Summer months on a select basis.
Recognizing said situation as a definite problem area, there was a need to develop uniform terms, conditions, and guidelines that would be fair and equitable to all concerned in meeting said problem area.
This Document and the terms and conditions set forth in it were developed in response to that need.
A.	Application And Contractor Eligibility. The Terms And Conditions Applicable To The Employment Of Temporary Summer Hires as set forth herein are available to any Contractor who is signatory to a current collective bargaining Agreement with the Laborers’ International Union Of North America, Local 368 (AFL-CIO), provided:
1.	that said Contractor employs at least two Regular (Exhibit "A”) Laborers, and provided, further,
2.	that a Contractor who is listed as being delinquent in the payment of contributions to any of the Hawaii Laborers' Trust Funds will NOT be eligible to participate in this Summer Hire Program unless and until said Contractor makes full payment of all delinquent amounts due to said Funds, including liquidated damages, interest, and/or other penalty amounts.
B.	Hourly Wage Rate
1.	University/Colleqe Group Or Equivalent........................................... $10.00	per hour
This group includes bonafide students who are attending universities, colleges, or other institutions of higher learning, as well as high school graduates (or equivalent) who have been accepted for enrollment at said institutions.
2.	All Others........................................................................ $6.00	per hour
C.	No Trust Fund Contributions For Temporary Summer Hires. No Trust Fund or other contributions shall be effective to or shall be made for or on behalf of Temporary Summer Hires. However, as required by State law, a hospital, surgical, and medical care plan must be made available to such hire if he or she is not already covered under such a plan through his or her parents or other source. Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) and Workers' Compensation coverage must also be provided to those of such Hires who meet the eligibility requirements as set forth under State law.
D.	Hiring Process, Union Affiliation, And Registration Fee
1.	Prior to employing a Temporary Summer Hire, the Contractor shall prepare a Confirmation Of Hiring Slip (a sample copy of which is attached hereto) and process same through the Union’s Hiring Office.
2.	All Temporary Summer Hires shall be processed through the Union’s Hiring Office as set forth above, but affiliation with the Union will not be required. However, a non-refundable registration fee of $50.00 covering the entire period of summer employment must be paid to the Union’s Hiring Office in advance and prior to ti <e start o> employment.
Exhibit "A" - (continued)
Page 14

(a)	the Temporary Summer Hire,
(b)	the Superintendent of the project on which the Temporary Summer Hire will be working,
(c)	the Temporary Summer Hire’s immediate supervisor,
(d)	the Union Steward.
E.	Allowable Number Of Temporary Summer Hires
1.	Each Contractor who meets the eligibility requirements as set forth in paragraph A., above, will be allowed to employ one Temporary Summer Hire.
2.	The employment of any additional Temporary Summer Hires (over and above the'one as provided for above) will be subject to discussion with the Business Manager of the Union on a case-by-case, project-by-project, basis. The decision of said Business Manager with respect to said matter will be final.
3.	In no event shall the total number of Temporary Summer Hires employed by a Contractor exceed the total number of Regular (Exhibit "A1') Laborers employed by said Contractor.
F.	Work Performed By Temporary Summer Hire To Be Limited To Laborer II Work, Light Cleari-Up (Janitorial) Laborer and Watchman. The work to be performed by a Temporary Summer Hire shall be limited to:

2.	Light Clean-Up (Janitorial) Laborer, and
3.	Watchman.
G.	Overtime Work. A Temporary Summer Hire shall be afforded overtime work only after all other Regular Laborers employed on the project on which he or she is working have been given first choice to do that work.
H.	Layoffs. If a layoff becomes necessary due to lack of work, the Temporary Summer Hire shall be laid off first before any of the Contractor’s Regular Laborers (as determined on a company-wide basis) are laid off. Notice of any such layoff shall be given to the Union.
I.	Revocation. This Summer Hire Program was developed in response to the many special requests as received from signatory Contractors and is being extended by the Union as a privilege (NOT as a right). In line with this tenet:
1.	The Union has the unqualified right at its sole discretion to revoke this privilege at any time, with or without notice, if in its opinion said privilege is being abused.
2.	The Union also has the unqualified right at its sole discretion to revoke this privilege at any time, with or without notice, if the participating Contractor is found employing other Summer Hires, secured through another trade, who are doing Laborers’ work as set forth in this Exhibit "A" (Classification And Hourly Wage Schedule).
3.	This privilege shall automatically be revoked if a participating Contractor should become delinquent in the payment of contributions to any of the Hawaii Laborers’ Trust Funds on behalf of his Regular Laborers.
Exhibit ’’A" - (continued)
Page 15
4.	In the event the Union exercises its right of revocation or if the privilege is automatically revoked as set forth in paragraph 3., above, any Temporary Summer Hire(s) then-employed by the offending Contractor shall be immediately terminated.
J.	Termination
1.	The Union shall be notified whenever any Temporary Summer Hire quits, is laid off for lack of work, is discharged for cause, or is otherwise terminated.
2.	IN ANY EVENT, this Summer Hire Program shall be effective and applicable ONLY from June 1 to and including September 30 of each year, and all Temporary Summer Hires employed under the terms and conditions set forth in this Document shall be terminated on or before the end of the work day on September 30 of the applicable year.
3.	Temporary Summer Hires shall not be entitled to any re-employment rights as "Former Employees" under Section 26.6 of the Master Agreement Covering Construction Laborers In The State Of Hawaii, nor shall hours worked as a Temporary Summer Hire be counted towards the 1,000 accrued work hours requirement needed for consideration as a Former Employee or as an Experienced Applicant under Section 26.2 and 26.3 of the aforesaid Master Agreement.
K.	Duration. This Summer Hire Program shall be effective to and including August 31,2007, at which time it will be subject to joint review by the negotiating parties for possible renewal, modification, or cancellation.
NOTE
The special rates of pay and other terms and conditions applicable to Temporary Summer Hires as set forth in this Document can be used only on PRIVATE PROJECTS and on FEDERAL PROJECTS (those financed entirely with Federal funds).
Because State of Hawaii law differs from that of the Federal government, they CANNOT be used on City & County and State projects. This includes Federally-assisted projects (such as highway work) which are administered by the State.

If the employee enters such a program, his or her status as an employee will not be affected and he/she wifi be ,	allowed to return to work and to continue to work as long as he/she remains drug free,
as indicated by a negative drug or alcohol test result.
(2)	Employee Option 2 - A first-offense employee who does not choose to enroll in a substance abuse assistance or rehabilitation program shall be suspended for the length of time it takes to obtain a negative reading from a subsequent drug or alcohol test but in any case, no less than a two (2)-week suspension. The employee must make arrangements with his or her Company prior to undergoing drug or alcohol retesting.

(b)	Second Offense - A suspension from work for the time it takes to obtain a negative reading from any subsequent drug or alcohol test but in any case, no less than a four (4)-week suspension from work. The employee must make arrangements with his or her Company prior to undergoing drug or alcohol retesting. Should a subsequent test fail to produce a negative reading within two (2) months after the beginning of such suspension, then the employee will be discharged and will not be eligible for re-employment by the Company until
-5-
such time as the physician or medical laboratory that conducted the original test submits verification of a negative reading having been obtained from said person.
(c)	Third Offense - Any employee who tests positive for the third time will be discharged and will not be eligible for re-employment by the Company for a period of three years, unless the employee can establish through objective evidence that he or she is no longer a current alcohol or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from doing his or her job, or would constitute a threat to property or the safety of others.
2. For purposes of administering this paragraph G (Schedule Of Disciplinary Actions), offenses shall be cumulative on an Company-wide basis.
