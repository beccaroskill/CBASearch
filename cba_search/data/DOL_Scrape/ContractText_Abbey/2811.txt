25.	(3) The Union Steward is representing an employee assigned to the
Steward's area of jurisdiction as described herein, provided that, in the event the designated steward is absent, a substitute steward may be used within the same clinical area at San Francisco General Hospital. In other Department facilities, the nearest substitute steward may be used. The Union agrees to equally distribute substitute steward assignments so that such assignments do not fall disproportionately on the same stewards.
26.	(4) In no event shall more than one (1) steward be released from duty
at any time to represent an employee.
27.	The Union Steward shall not interfere with the work of any employee. The
steward shall not have the right to interview patients or visitors.
28.	If, in the judgment of the supervisor, because of the necessity of maintaining
adequate patient care, permission cannot be granted immediately to the Union steward in order to present a grievance during on-duty time, such permission shall be granted by the supervisor no later than the next working day from the date the Union steward has been denied permission.
29.	In emergency situations where immediate disciplinary action must be taken
because of a violation of law or a City or departmental rule (intoxication, theft, etc.) the Union steward shall, if possible, be granted immediate permission to leave his/her post of duty to assist in the grievance procedure.
30.	The Department and the Union agree that the Union steward can be effectively
used to perform a beneficial service to employees,[including probationary employees (does not apply to P103 Per Diem Nurses)] by providing counseling regarding poor performance, attendance, abuse of sick leave and other leave provisions, conduct violations, abuse of alcohol or drugs in informing employees of available treatment centers for these problems, etc., and thereby assist management in correcting the situation and minimizing the necessity of disciplinary or adverse action. Employees shall be advised of this provision and, with their written consent, the supervisor concerned will fully inform the appropriate Union steward and request assistance in counseling the employees whether jointly or separately. Additionally, the Union agrees to apply its resources to assist in resolving such problems. This assistance may be provided through Union-sponsored classes during off-duty hours.

35.	In addition, the Union shall designate one member from SFGH, LHH, Forensics and CPH to be released one (1) shift every two (2) pay periods to handle matters of employer-employee relations covered by existing release time language.

36.	Reasonable space will be allowed on bulletin boards for use by the Union to
communicate with employees. Material shall be posted upon the bulletin boards space as designated, and not upon walls, doors, windows or any other place.

In addition, if staff nurses in any facility, unit or specialty area determine that there is a need for specialized training, in-service, or skills development classes, they shall submit a written request to the Senior Hospital Associate Administrator or appropriate designee, who shall respond with thirty (30) calendar days.
509.	The Orientation Program will include but not be limited to:
510.	a.	objectives, policies, goals and procedures of each facility.
511.	b.	job descriptions and responsibilities; and
512.	c.	information to provide adequate care to categories of patients who may be assigned to the nurse's unit and whose care requires either skills which are new to the nurse or skills so infrequently called for that periodic update/review is needed.
513.	The in-service education program shall be directed towards updating knowledge and skills related to job responsibilities, and development of knowledge and skills required for new or expanded departmental programs and specialty units.
514.	Each nurse must complete the orientation program before being permanently assigned to a shift and a unit. Until completion of the formal orientation, the nurse will be considered in a structured learning experience, and not part of the unit's regular nursing staff for at least two (2) weeks. A nurse shall not be assigned total responsibility for a particular patient until the standards of competency specific to care of that patient have been validated by successful completion of a unit specific skills check list.
515.	The Department shall schedule in-service training so as to insure that all nurses, including float nurses, may attend. 5.	Developmental Plans
516.	A nurse may be placed on a developmental plan when there is a demonstrated, documented departure from standards of competence, which include the skills, knowledge and behaviors specific to the performance criteria. The developmental plan shall be proposed not more than eight (8) weeks after either the Performance Appraisal or the documented incident(s) indicating such departure. The developmental plan shall include specific, measurable goals with specific time lines to completion. For implementing a developmental plan, shift assignments for a given nurse may be changed without regard to seniority for up to three months. The decision requiring a developmental plan may be appealed to the SEIU LOCAL 790 (STAFF NURSE & PER DIEM) Memorandum of Understanding July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2003 Extended through June 30, 2005 76

518.	The Department shall make reasonable effort to secure approval from the Board of Registered Nursing for courses that would meet the requirements for continuing education. Those courses approved will be charged against educational leave time.
519.	The Department shall make a reasonable effort to negotiate with outside agencies, such as the San Francisco Community College District, U.C. Medical Center, and other likely providers of Continuing Education for the educational needs of the Registered Nurse. 8.	Registered Nurse Crosstraining Program Purpose
520.	a.	Crosstraining programs are designed to enhance the nurse's ability to temporarily float and/or permanently reassign to another unit within a hospital or another program/division within the DPH. These programs will establish flexibility to reallocate nursing resources, enhance job opportunities for nurses and improve the Department's ability to meet the demands of rapidly changing service requirements. b.	Crosstraining:
521.	Crosstraining provides the nurse with the necessary skills and competencies to float to designated units at times when the nurse's home unit is overstaffed and additional staffing is needed in the designated unit.
522.	The purpose of crosstraining is to provide a method whereby nurses covered by this agreement may obtain appropriate preparation for work assignments in units other than the nurse's "home unit". "Home unit" shall be defined as the unit to which the nurse is regularly assigned. Crosstraining shall be defined as the method of instruction and orientation provided to a nurse. The purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that when the DPH floats a nurse to a unit other than the nurse's home unit, the skills and competencies of the nurse are appropriate for the assignment.

523.	The Department shall identify appropriate designated units in the various divisions, based on staffing needs, as potential areas for crosstraining of permanent staff for floating. The Department may develop appropriate crosstraining programs to meet the staffing needs of those units. d.	Enrollment in the Program
524.	Any permanent staff nurse covered by this MOU is eligible to apply for crosstraining. Selection of candidates for the program shall be based on their level of previous experience and basic skills and abilities specific to the receiving unit. Wherever permissible and practicable, CE units will be offered for participation in the program or portions thereof. Nurses accepted for crosstraining must agree to use his/her paid educational leave for fifty percent (50%) of the total hours spent in crosstraining and the Department will pay the nurse at his/her regular rate for the remaining fifty (50%) of the hours. Scheduling and release time for a crosstraining program shall be based on the home unit's ability to safely staff the home unit for the duration of the program, and such determination of scheduling and release time shall be at the sole discretion of the Director of Nursing or appropriate management representative. Each division shall keep a database of nurses with corresponding competencies and crosstraining for the purpose of floating. e.	Floating
525.	A nurse who has been crosstrained to another unit will be the first to float to that area in which the nurse has been crosstrained for a period of six (6) months from the completion of the program. Thereafter, the nurse will float based on inverse seniority on a rotational basis of nurses crosstrained to the receiving unit. f.	Program Monitoring
526.	The Divisional Committee shall review and make recommendations on the crosstraining programs, including but not limited to: identification of appropriate designated units, criteria for selection and release time for crosstraining.

Further, the Department supports criterion-based selection of program applicants. The Professional Performance Committee will recommend to Nursing Administration the selection criteria. Selection criteria will measure prerequisite skills and abilities necessary for successful completion of the specialty training program.
529.	A nurse desiring placement in a specialty training program will submit a written request or application to the facilitator of the respective specialty training program, as designated by nursing administration. The nurse will be granted an interview.
530.	When evaluating applicants for specialty training programs at SFGH, the Department agrees to give first priority to RN's currently working for the City and County of San Francisco, provided applicant meets qualifications and passes the test. Priority will be based first on seniority at SFGH and then on seniority elsewhere within DPH.
531.	In the event that the nurse does not meet acceptance criteria, she or he will be referred to available educational courses or resource materials which would assist the nurse to upgrade skills. Recommended time frames for application to future specialty training programs will be discussed.
532.	During the course of any training program at SFGH, a nurse shall have return rights to the first available vacancy on his/her former unit, shift, and position.

V.A. STAFFING
(SECTION V.A. Staffing does not apply to P103 Per Diem Nurses)
537.	1.	Commitment to Staffing Levels Annual "salary savings" for nursing positions directly involved in patient care shall not exceed five percent (5%) in each of the fiscal years covered by this MOU. Such commitment is in recognition of the mutual desire of the parties to maintain the nursing complement at the highest possible level in order to provide the best possible patient care, as well as relieve the additional burdens placed on staff by understaffing.
538.	2.	Staffing The City and the Union agree that the maintenance of adequate nursing staff is an essential element of quality patient care. The Union and the City also agree that registered nurses are better able to perform effectively with the assistance of an adequate number of other direct care providers (Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), Licensed Psychiatric Technicians (LPTs) and CNAs as well as with ancillary services provided by support and maintenance staff.
539.	Standards of Care The City commits to maintaining the community standard of care in its Hospital operations.
540.	a.	S.F. General Hospital San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center will meet or exceed standards prevailing in the community. This commitment outlines the average number of health care provider hours per patient per day (HPPD) necessary in the various clinical units to maintain needed nurse to patient care levels.
541.	Health care providers include staff nurses predominantly; also per diem nurses, LVNs, LPTs and CNAs. The HPPD provided is based on discussion among nurses, physicians, and nurse managers, taking into account the nature of the care required and average patient acuity (severity of illness). SFGH shall maintain a ratio of Registered Nurses to Licensed Vocational Nurses which shall not be less than sixty percent (60%) RN’s in Medical-Surgical units, eighty percent (80%) RN’s in both 4B/”Stepdown” unit and 6C Birth Center, and all RN’s in the ICU (4E), CCU (5E/R), PACU, and Nursery.
542.	Actual HPPDs and nurse to patient ratios will be recorded on a daily basis and reviewed each week to establish actual HPPDs and nurse to patient SEIU LOCAL 790 (STAFF NURSE & PER DIEM) Memorandum of Understanding July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2003 Extended through June 30, 2005 81

543.	Section III.L. lists the specific HPPDs by unit. The HPPDs for various nursing units of the hospital are as follows: Medical-Surgical
544.	-	Medical-Surgical: 6.0 to 7.0 HPPD (3.6 to 3.7 patients per care provider)
545.	Critical Care: 21.0 HPPD (1.14 to 1.33 patients per care provider)
546.	-	Unit 4B - Step Down: 10.0 HPPD (2.5 to 2.6 patients per care provider) Maternal/Child
547.	-	Pediatric: 7.0 HPPD (3.44 patients per care)
548.	-	PACU: PACU Standards recommend that two registered nurses who are competent in Phase I Post Anesthesia Nursing be present whenever a patient is recovering in Phase I. To the extent possible, SFGHMC will maintain no less than two such nurses in PACU. This may require the floating of cross-trained ICU staff particularly on weekends, nights and holidays. Staffing will be based on criteria which address the number of patients and the acuity/intensity of patients in the PACU. PACU staffing levels are established to accommodate the numbers/types of surgeries occurring. Basic levels are: Monday - Friday: 7A - 7P:	Two (2) twelve-hour RN’s 9A - 9P:	One (1) twelve-hour RN 11A - 7P: One (1) eight-hour RN 12N - 8P: One/two (1 or 2) eight-hour RN 7P - 7A:	Two	(2) twelve-hour RN’s. Weekend/Holidays:	7A - 7P:	Two	(2) twelve-hour RN’s 7P - 7A:	Two	(2) twelve-hour RN’s Use of the PACU for non-surgical patient placement will be a subject for unit-based CQI review, with recommendations for placement patterns.

Each patient will be assigned to a Care Level based on these needs. The patient to care provider ratio for these Care Levels will be: Level 1	1:4 (four patients per care provider) Level 2	1:3 (three patients per care provider) Level 3	1:2 (two patients per care provider) Level 4	1:1 (one patient per care provider)
550.	-	Birthing Center - The Birthing Center has a fixed (base) standard of five (5) RN’s per shift; postpartum care offers 6.2 HPPD (2.7 to 3.0 patients per care provider). Baseline shift staffing for the Birthing Center (6C) will be: 6 RN’s, 1 LVN, and 1 ORT Day and Evening Shifts	7A- 11:30P 5 RN’s, 1 LVN, and 1 ORT Night Shift	11P- 7:30A Two hours before the end of each shift, nurses will determine the acuity. If the acuity tool calls for less than the above baseline(s), one scheduled RN may be offered standby. Based on the acuity and census, as calculated through the present acuity system, staffing baselines will be increased to acuity needs when warranted. Changes in the Birth Center’s care delivery system will require reexamination of staffing standards/levels. Psychiatric
551.	-	Psychiatry, including 6B, 7A, 7B, 7C and 7L: 6.15 to 7.0 HPPD (2.75 to 3.7 patients per care provider) The City will maintain a ratio of sixty percent (60%) RN staffing to forty percent (40%) LPT/LVN staffing.

563.	The Department and the Union recognize that SFGH serves as the major Trauma Center for the City and County of San Francisco. Due to the unpredictable nature of traumatic events, sudden increased demand may be placed upon the Emergency Department. When it is necessary to receive and treat the victims of either a multicasualty incident or of simultaneous individual traumatic events, the above guidelines may be temporarily relaxed. Charge Nurses on Day Shift
564.	The City agrees that charge nurses will be assigned on the day shifts, Monday to Friday, on the following units: Medical-Surgical, Units 6-C and 6-A.
Determination of Acuity
565.	The Hospital will continue to involve nurses, on a daily basis, in the
determination of the number of staff required. Daily staffing levels are based upon the level of patient acuity prevailing on the unit. During each shift, nurses assess the severity of each patient's illness. The supervising nurse condenses this information for all patients on the nursing unit and uses it to determine the number of health care providers assigned for the next shift.

STATEMENT RE: Handling of HIV+ CLAIMS
The City Attorney and General Manager of the Retirement System state categorically that in all workers compensation cases, confidentiality will be assured as required by law.
To assure confidentiality with respect to HIV+ claims, we will employ the "Jane Doe" procedure in any "Jane Doe" case arising within the next 12 months.
Thereafter, should the "Jane Doe" procedure be unworkable, alternative procedures would be discussed in advance with affected parties.
The union understands that in stating the above, the City Attorney has the sole responsibility under the Charter for handling all administrative and court proceedings. Similarly, the General Manager of the Retirement System and City Attorney have exclusive authority over workers' compensation claims handling procedures. None of the above shall be deemed to affect any authority conferred by the Charter, nor be subject to arbitration.

Louise H. Renne, City Attorney
June 26, 1989
Paul Varacalli
240 Gold Gate Avenue
San Francisco, CA 94102
Dear Paul:
You have asked about the meaning of the term "unworkable" in paragraph (3) of my statement regarding the handling of HIV+ claim (Statement). As we have discussed, the "Jane Doe" procedure is now untried. Therefore, many issues may arise, some of which cannot be anticipated, which would make aspects of the procedure unworkable as presently written. Potential issues could include: an unexpected number of claims affecting the City's ability to process claims appropriately, or, from the standpoint of the claimants, delays and confidentiality concerns arising from discovery procedures. The term "unworkable" does not extend to mere administrative convenience.
We have every desire to make this procedure work. As you know, our concern in making our Statement has been to make clear that the matters discussed in the Statement are not subject to meet and confer, or to arbitration. However, the confidentiality concern we address here is of such great concern to nurses--who play a critical role in the fight against AIDS--that we felt it necessary to outline our procedures for handling HIV+ claims to alleviate any concern.
Very truly yours,
LOUISE H. RENNE
City Attorney

Voluntary Unpaid Time Off

The decision of the appointing officer shall be final except in cases where requests for voluntary unpaid time off in excess of ten (10) working days are denied. In such cases, an employee may appeal in accordance with the procedures provided below for appealing imposition of furlough.
3)	An employee shall be entitled to take up to ten (10) unpaid days per fiscal year at the rate of no more than five (5) days in a three (3) month period, at the employee's discretion, upon at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior written notice to the employee's appointing officer.
