Section 2.1 The City hereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purposes stated in Chapter 41.56 ROW as last amended of all employees within the bargaining unit defined by the classifications listed in Appendix A to this Agreement.
Section 2.2 Leave for Business Manager The City may approve granting of leave of absence without pay for the period covered by this Agreement without loss of Civil Service status, and/or without loss of continued accrual of seniority, and aggregate City service or tenure status for all purposes, to no more than two employees of the City who are members of the Union and whom the Union may desire to have act as its business manager to be locally engaged in the business of the Union.
Section 2,3 Union Security Clause It shall be condition of employment that all employees of the employer, covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union (or who, in lieu thereof, pay each month a service charge equivalent to regular Union dues to the Union as a contribution towards the administration of the Agreement) on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members or shall continue to pay said service charge. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its execution date shall, on the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in the Union, or in lieu thereof pay an amount equal to the regular initiation fee and each month a service charge equivalent to regular union dues to the Union as a contribution towards the administration of the Agreement.
Provided: Objections to joining the Union which are based on either bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which such employee is a member will be observed. Any such employee shall pay an amount of money equivalent to regular Union dues and initiation fees to a non-religious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the dues and initiation fees. Such payments shall be made to a charity having offices in Pierce County and the payment shall be made to said office.

by law. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly on behalf of the employees involved. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties thereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request and the Union so notified. The performance of this function is recognized as a service to the Union by the City. There shall be no retroactive deduction of Union dues beyond one pay period.
Section 2.7 The Union agrees that the City shall not terminate the employment of any employee under the security clause provisions of this Agreement, until written notification is received from the Union that an employee has failed to pay the required dues or service charge or provide proof of an alternative payment based on religious tenets as provided herein above. The parties also agree, that when an employee fails to fulfill the above obligation, the Union shall provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) days' notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action and during this period the employee may make restitution in the amount which is overdue. The Union further agrees that in the event the City undertakes to terminate an employee's tenure pursuant to the Union Security provision contained herein, then the Union undertakes to indemnify and hold the City harmless should such employee file a claim together with all costs assessed therein, including attorney fees, if any.
ARTICLE 3	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Union recognizes the prerogative of the City to operate and manage its affairs in all respects in accordance with its lawful mandate, and the powers of authority which the City has not specifically abridged, delegated or modified by this Agreement are retained by the City, including but not limited to the right to contract for services of any and all types.

ARTICLE 8	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 8.1 - Definitions
Shop Steward - Union member appointed by the Union Business Manager.
Grievance - To be valid, a grievance must be submitted in writing within thirty (30) days of the alleged violation by the grieving party.
Section 8.2 It is the goal of both the Union and the City to settle problems at the lowest possible level in a cooperative, objective method. To this end, every effort will be made by both parties to resolve problems at the lowest level. Initially, the employee shall discuss the grievance with the shop steward. Both parties will make every effort to identify the appropriate manager at each step of the grievance process. Further contacts shall follow this procedure:
Step 1 The employee and/or shop steward shall meet with the immediate supervisor (written communication not required). Such meeting shall take place as soon as possible, but in no case longer than ten (10) working days of first knowledge of incident contact outlined above. The immediate supervisor shall advise the shop steward of the proposed resolution within five (5) working days of this meeting.
Step 2 If the grievance cannot be resolved at Step 1, it shall be reduced to writing specifying the section or sections violated, relevant facts, and the proposed remedy and shall be presented to the next level of management responsible for addressing grievances, with copies to the Union and Human Resources Department within ten (10) working days of decision rendered at Step 1. This step shall not preclude contacts at lower levels if this may expedite the resolution process.
The specific manager responsible for addressing the grievance shall (within 10 working days) render a decision in writing to the employee and the Union.
Step 3 If the employee is not satisfied with the response, then within ten (10) working days of receipt of the responsible manager's answer, the grievance will be forwarded to the department or division head.
The Department/Division head may elect to submit the grievance to the Labor Management Committee who will hear it and offer a recommendation to the Department/Division head immediately following the committee meeting. The Department/Division may also respond to the grievance without Labor Management input.
The Department/Division head will, within ten (10) working days of either making a determination or of receiving the committee recommendation, render to the employee and the Union the decision, and the reason for it in writing.
CS 2016-19

Step 4 If the employee is not satisfied with the response, then within ten (10) working days of receipt of the department head's or division head's answer, the employee (or designated representative) will forward the grievance to the Utilities Director or City Manager for possible resolution. The Utilities Director or City Manager (after consultation with the department head or division head, the Human Resources Director and Union Business Manager) shall submit his/her answer in writing within ten (10) working days after personal receipt of the grievance.
Step 5 Grievances not resolved under the above steps shall be referred to arbitration by either party to this Agreement. Either party may give notice of its intention to arbitrate within fifteen (15) working days following completion of the steps listed in the aforementioned sections. A list of five (5) arbitrators shall be requested from the Public Employment Relations Commission, both parties shall meet and each shall strike a name until one (1) arbitrator is selected. Should the parties fail to arrive at the selection of an arbitrator, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall be asked to appoint one. Any decision by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties. Each party shall bear the expense of its own representation, including attorney’s fees, and all other expenses incident to the arbitration shall be divided equally. Each party is responsible for the costs of its representatives, attorneys and all costs related to the development and presentation of their respective cases in arbitration. In the event that the City unsuccessfully challenges an arbitrator’s decision in court, or the Union is forced to file an action in court to compel compliance with an arbitrator’s award, the Union may seek recovery of attorney’s fees incurred in the court action to the extent such recovery is permitted under RCW 49.48.030. The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from, or alter, change or modify this Agreement; and his/her power shall be limited to an interpretation or application of this Agreement and application of appropriate remedies.
Section 8.3 - Time Frames The time limitations in this Article may be adjusted by mutual agreement, in writing, between the Union and the Department. Failure by the non-grieving party to comply with any time limitations as provided in this Article shall constitute a right of the grieving party to proceed to the next Step without waiting. Failure of the grieving party to comply with the foregoing time limitations shall constitute resolution of the grievance.
ARTICLE 9	- SENIORITY
Section 9.1	For the purposes of this Agreement including temporary upgrades, seniority is defined as the length of continuous service by classification in which the employee is employed.
Section 9.2	An upgrade is defined as the filling of a temporary vacancy within the bargaining unit which is in the higher classification in the class series which receives a higher rate of pay.

Section 9.4	Vacancies of five (5) working days or less, and in instances of emergency and illness, may be filled to meet the City's immediate needs.
Section 9.5 In the event the City, at its discretion, fills a vacancy that exceeds five (5) working days, such vacancy shall be filled from a layoff register or the existing Civil Service eligible list, providing the temporarily upgraded employee is in the same section, division or department. If no eligible list exists, such vacancy shall be filled on a seniority basis in accordance with the provisions in Section 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.
TPU Process for Set Ups
1.	If there is a need for a bargaining unit employee to be set up to a higher classification within the bargaining unit and there is no eligibility list for the desired classification, then the set up will be offered to a permanent employee in the next lower classification on the basis of seniority.
2.	In the event no Building Maintenance Worker (BMW) accepts a set up assignment to Assistant Building Maintenance Supervisor (ABMS), then it will be offered to an employee on the current BMW eligibility list.
3.	In the event that no one on the BMW eligibility list accepts a set up assignment to ABMS, it will then be offered to the Custodians on a seniority basis.
4.	An employee in a higher classification may not accept a temporary vacancy assignment to a lower classification.
Section 9.6 Whenever a regular permanent position vacancy occurs, prior to interviewing from the Civil Service list established for the particular classification, employees may bid for the vacancy on a seniority basis, providing they have permanent status in the department in the affected classification. Regular permanent vacancies will be posted for a minimum of seven (7) days on employee bulletin boards, using employer's job vacancy bid sheets, as soon as possible after the employer has knowledge of the regular permanent position vacancy. The senior bidder shall be assigned to the vacant position, provided that the City need not consider employees who do not meet the qualifications required for the position. The Union will be sent a copy of the completed bid sheet.
Subsequent position vacancies, created as a result of implementing this procedure, shall be open to bidding on a seniority basis within the terms of this section.
This section shall not in any way interfere with the right of the City to assign, adjust assignments or temporarily rotate personnel for training or for purposes of increased efficiencies.
Where practicable, the City shall make every attempt to give advance notice to the Union whenever a regular permanent position vacancy occurs, or of its intent to so rotate and/or assign personnel.
