117
All regular employees within this bargaining unit hired after June 1,1978 including Compositors, shall be subject to the normal bumping provisions contained in this Agreement.
APPENDIX C INTER-PLANT TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES

The rights granted pursuant to this Appendix are derived from an agreement entered into between PACE Local 2-86, the constituent Unions of the IUC and the Company.
An involuntarily laid off employee will be offered employment In vacant non-temporary jobs at any other locations covered by this provision, which management decides to fill and for which he is qualified, on the basis of Company seniority, before an offer for such job has been made to applicants); provided that the covered employee indicates interest in such sites at the time of layoff, on a form provided by the Company and completed at the time of involuntary layoff by the employee, and further provided that the right of transfer under this appendix will exist only as long as the covered employee retains seniority rights in the local bargaining unit from which he is laid off.
An employee so transferred will retain his COLA and will continue on his COLA progression using his original anniversary date: however, if the COLA of the employee so transferred is less than the COLA of similarly situated employees at the hiring bargaining unit, the COLA of such employee will be
118
increased to ensure parity with similarly situated employees at the hiring bargaining unit; provided that the COLA paid to an employee so transferred will in no event be used as the basis or evidence for a grievance seeking a COLA upgrade or increase for any other employee.
An employee who rejects an offer of employment to a specific site under the terms of this provision shall thereafter be ineligible for an inter-plant transfer for the period of that layoff.
The employee will be notified by registered letter, addressed to the employee’s last address appearing on the Company records. Within two (2) working days of the date written notice is received, as indicated on the registered mail receipt, but In no case longer than seven (7) calendar days from the postmark date of the registered letter, the employee shall report to the Employment Office at the location where the vacancy exists. Failure on the part of the employee to report to the Employment Office, or to report to work on the day designated by the Company, will result in the forfeiture of all rights under this provision. No employes shall be required to report to work less than seven (7) calendar days from the date the employee is required to report to the Company’s Employment Office.
Transferred employees who accept recall to any other location of the Company covered by this provision, under the terms of such location's recall procedure, shall lose seniority at the plant to which he was transferred, and shall work a minimum notice period of five (5) working days before returning to the previous location.
A transferred employee who rejects recall to his home plant shall lose his seniority at Such plant. If a transferred employee is laid off from any plant covered by this provision, he shall accrue seniority benefits as provided in the Local Agreement from the plant or plants in which he is in a laid-off status.
