Article 3
Non-Discrimination
The Zoo and the Council shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, political ideology, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of Woodland Park Zoo.
Article 4 Job Classifications
4.1	Temporary Employees. Temporary employees are not covered by this Agreement. Temporary employees are typically hired to fill-in for regularly-benefited employees who are absent but who are expected to return to work or hired to work a limited duration such as work during a busy season. This includes, for example, employees absent due to illness, injury or pregnancy. There may be other limited business justifications for employment of temporaries.
Hours for temporaries can be “intermittent” or “full-time” or “part-time” or “seasonal” depending upon organizational business needs during terms of employment. Temporary employees will generally work no more than fifteen hundred (1500) cumulative hours during a twelve (12) month period, with a cap of forty five hundred (4500) hours or four (4) years total.
4.2	New or Merged Job Classifications. The Zoo shall promptly notify the Council of its decision to establish any new job classification which will perform work currently performed by members of the bargaining unit or to merge job classifications where one or more of the affected classifications is within the unit.
If the new or merged job classifications fall within the Council’s jurisdiction, upon request, the Zoo will meet with the Council to negotiate hours, wages, and working conditions for the new classification.
4.3	Promotions. An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher base rate of pay shall be paid at that rate; and provided further, that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular positions and shall not apply to appointments from positions designated as temporary or seasonal.

At this level, the employee’s performance needs improvement and a Performance Improvement Plan must be identified, monitored, documented and submitted with the employee’s Performance Evaluation.
5.1.4	The base wages of eligible employees will be increased from a fund computed by multiplying the increase percentage(s) by the total salaries of eligible employees.

Eligible employees are those who were hired on or before October 1st of the preceding year, and were in the bargaining unit and on the active payroll as of the increase effective date.
5.2	Base Rates of Pay
5.2.1	Employees hired into regularly benefited bargaining unit positions between September 1, 2004 and January 14, 2008 shall be placed at the top step for their position as contained in the 2004-2007 Agreement.

5.5.1	Report-to-Work Guarantee.

Further, in the event of an emergency beyond the Zoo’s control which results in the Zoo sending home some or all of its employees, the four (4) hour guarantee is not in effect and the employee(s) shall be paid for actual time worked.
Regularly-benefited employees may use vacation or leave without pay to offset the loss of hours if they are sent home due to an emergency situation, as described in the previous paragraph.
5.5.2	Emergency Call-Back Premium. Regular employees who are called back to work after completing their regular shift shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours straight time pay.

Regularly benefited employees directed by their supervisor or manager to temporarily work in another position with a higher minimum hourly rate, shall receive a wage payment at the base rate of pay or four percent (4%) above their current rate, whichever is higher, if their temporary position lasts four (4) or more hours within a forty (40) hour workweek.
5.7	Rest Breaks.

Article 6	Professional Development

Woodland Park Zoo - Joint Crafts Council 2014-2016 Collective Bargaining Agreement

6.1.3	Payback Provision. Employees who receive reimbursement for college courses must agree as a condition of receiving such reimbursement that they will pay back to the Zoo all such monies received if they leave the employment of the Zoo within two (2) years after receiving such reimbursement.
6.2	Certifications and Licenses. Employees required by State and Federal law to maintain a license or certificate shall be fully compensated for the time and expenses needed to attend classes or conferences to accomplish that requirement. Classes or conferences shall be relevant to the range of the employee’s assignment at Woodland Park Zoo and must be approved in advance.
6.3	ZooBright Program. Employees may also apply for ZooBright Program Awards under guidelines established for the program.
Article 7	Hours and Overtime
7.1	Schedules. The normal workweek shall consist of five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour days and two (2) consecutive days off in a seven (7) calendar day period except when the Zoo’s operations require a different schedule. The Zoo will notify the individually affected union of exceptions to the normal schedule.
The shifts, workdays and hours to which employees are assigned shall be stated on a monthly work schedule. Should it be necessary in the interest of efficient operations to establish schedules departing from the normal workday or workweek, the Zoo shall give notice to the affected employee as far in advance as is reasonably practicable, but not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the effective date of the change except in unusual or emergency situations. The Zoo will not seek to change employee schedules for purposes of avoiding overtime.
7.2	Overtime. All time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half. Hours worked on a holiday are compensated at time and one-half regardless of the number of hours worked in a workweek. Vacation, sick leave, jury duty, and bereavement leave used during a workweek shall count as time “worked” for the purposes of calculating the forty (40) hours of work towards overtime. Paid Time Off Holidays and personal holidays shall not count in the calculation of the forty (40) hours of work towards overtime.
Because the zoo is open three hundred sixty-five (365) days a year and hosts many special events, all zoo employees may be required to work overtime. Working overtime is a job expectation.
Overtime work is allowed only with prior supervisory approval or except in emergencies. Regular employees will have the right of first refusal of all scheduled overtime in their classification.
Woodland Park Zoo - Joint Crafts Council 2014-2016 Collective Bargaining Agreement

All part-time employees may participate in the Zoo’s 403(b) retirement plan. Regularly benefited part-time employees earn vacation and sick leave on a pro-rata basis. Regularly benefited part-time employees earn continuous service credit on a pro-rata basis after completion of their probationary period. Part-time employees regularly working under twenty (20) hours a week are otherwise non-benefited.
Article 8	Paid Time Off
8.1	Holidays. The following holidays will be observed each calendar year. Employees shall be paid time and a half for working the official holiday:
Holidays
New Year's Day
MLK Day

8.1.1	Holiday Pay while on Vacation. Eligible employees who are on paid vacation leave shall be paid for any designated holiday if they normally are scheduled to work on the holiday. Hours of pay are pro-rated if they normally would be scheduled to work part-time on that day.
8.1.2	Holiday Pay while on Sick Leave. Eligible employees who are on paid sick leave shall be paid for any designated holiday if they normally are scheduled to work on the holiday. Hours of pay are pro-rated if they normally would be scheduled to work part-time on that day.
8.1.3	Holiday Pay while on Family Medical Leave (FMLA). Eligible employees on FMLA leave shall receive holiday pay if they are using accrued sick leave or vacation while on FMLA leave. If they are on unpaid leave they are not eligible for holiday pay. Hours of pay are pro-rated if they normally would be scheduled to work part-time on that day.
8.2	Personal Holidays. In addition to the recognized holidays listed above, employees will receive two (2) personal holidays during each calendar year. Employees must complete ninety (90) calendar days of service in an eligible employment classification to be able to use the personal holidays. Personal holidays must be scheduled with the prior approval of the employee’s supervisor. Personal holidays must be used in full-day increments (pro-rated hours for part-time employees) in the calendar year.

8.3	Vacation. Vacation time off is available to employees to provide opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits.
8.3.1	Accumulation of Vacation. All employees shall be entitled to annual vacation with pay in accordance with the following schedule. Vacation is accrued proportionately to hours worked. The examples below are based on a 40-hour week.
Length of Service
Paid Time Off Benefit
0 through 1 years	—	12	days	(96 hours)/year
2 through 4 years	--	15	days	(120 hours)/year
5 through 9 years	—	18	days	(144 hours)/year
10 through 14 years	--	20	days	(160 hours)/year
Over 14 years —	25 days (200 hours)/year
8.3.2	Employees who transitioned to Zoo employment on December 3, 2002. with equal to or greater than twenty-five (25) years of credited service as of that date shall be grandfathered into the City vacation accrual rate schedule in effect at the time of this Collective Bargaining Agreement. Employees grandfathered under this provision shall continue to accrue an additional day of vacation upon their anniversary up to a maximum of thirty (30) days.
8.3.3	Use of Vacation. Employees must complete ninety (90) calendar days of service in an eligible employment classification to be able to use vacation. Generally, vacation must be taken during the year in which it is accrued. In the event that available vacation is not used by the end of the calendar year, employees may carry up to two hundred (200) hours of unused vacation forward to the next calendar year. Previous City of Seattle employees over the two hundred (200) hours cap will be grandfathered at two hundred and forty (240) hours.
8.3.4	Vacation Schedules. Vacation schedules are determined by area supervisors. Employees should request vacation time as far in advance as possible since vacations will be granted on a first-come first-served basis, so long as the scheduling is consistent with department needs. Supervisors will normally respond to vacation requests within seven (7) days.
8.4	Sick Leave
8.4.1	Accrual of Sick Leave. Regularly benefited employees will accrue sick leave benefits at the rate of twelve (12) days per year. Sick leave is accrued proportionately to hours worked. Sick leave benefits are calculated on the basis of a "benefit year," the twelve (12) month period that begins when the employee starts to earn sick leave benefits. Employees can request use of paid sick leave immediately. Paid sick leave can be used in minimum increments of one (1) hour. Employees may use sick leave benefits for an absence due to their own illness or injury or that of an immediate family member as defined elsewhere in this Agreement.
Woodland Park Zoo - Joint Crafts Council 2014-2016 Collective Bargaining Agreement
12
8.4.2	Sick Leave Notification. Employees who are unable to report to work due to illness or injury should notify their direct supervisor before the scheduled start of their workday if possible. The direct supervisor may also require contact on each additional day of absence if deemed necessary. If an employee is absent for three (3) or more consecutive days due to illness or injury, a physician's statement may be requested to verify the disability and its beginning and expected ending dates. Such verification may be requested for other sick leave absences as well and may be required as a condition to receiving sick leave benefits. Before returning to work from a sick leave absence of four (4) consecutive work days or more, an employee may be requested to provide a physician's verification that he or she may safely return to work.
8.4.3	Sick Leave Benefits. Sick leave benefits will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. As an additional condition of eligibility for sick leave benefits, an employee on an extended absence must apply for any other available compensation and benefits, such as workers' compensation. Sick leave benefits will be used to supplement any payments that an employee is eligible to receive from state disability insurance, workers' compensation or Zoo-provided disability insurance programs. The combination of any such disability payments and sick leave benefits cannot exceed the employee's normal weekly earnings.
8.4.4	Unused Sick Leave. Unused sick leave benefits will be allowed to accumulate indefinitely.
8.4.5	Purpose. Sick leave benefits are intended solely to provide income protection in the event of illness or injury and may not be used for any other absence.

Internal applicants who are not chosen will be given an explanation of why they were not selected and suggestions on how to improve their future candidacy.
9.3	Eligibility. For purposes of filling vacancies with internal candidates only, probationary employees shall be considered external candidates.
Article 10	Continuous Service
10.1	“Continuous service” means continuous regularly benefited employment from the employee’s last date of hire with the Zoo. For those employees who were hired by the City of Seattle in the positions covered by this Agreement at Woodland Park Zoo and who have been continuously employed in those positions “date of hire” means the date they were hired full or part-time, but not intermittent, by the City of Seattle. Continuous service credit continues to accrue when an employee is on an approved leave of absence for up to six (6) months. Regularly benefited part-time employees earn continuous service credit on a pro-rata basis. Employees hired by the Zoo on a temporary or seasonal basis do not accrue continuous service credit.
10.2	Continuous service is broken when the employee quits, retires or is discharged. Employees will be deemed to have quit when they fail to return on their scheduled date from a leave of absence or fail to notify the Zoo of an absence unless a reason satisfactory to the Zoo is given for not reporting.
10.3	Probation. New regularly benefited full and part-time employees are on probation for the first full-year of their employment with the Zoo. A full-time employee is one who is regularly scheduled to work a forty (40) hour week. Regularly benefited part-time employees are on probation until they have worked an equivalent number of hours equal to one (1) year (2080 hours) of full-time employment. Employees accrue no continuous service credit during their probationary periods; however, if they remain employed after the probationary period, they are given continuous service credit back to the date of their original regularly benefited hire by the Zoo. The Zoo retains full discretion as to whether to discharge or discipline probationary employees and its actions with respect to such employees are not subject to challenge through the grievance and arbitration process. Probationary employees having ninety (90) days or more employment shall be allowed use of vacation and personal holidays consistent with Zoo policies.

12.2	Military Leave. Employees who serve in the Armed Forces (including service in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces), National Guard, commissioned corps of the Public Health Service or State Militia, will be granted leave and reemployment rights in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes.

The employee must provide appropriate documentation of his/her military pay.
12.3	Jury Duty. The Zoo will grant employees a paid leave of absence to serve on jury duty. Employees may retain the compensation they receive from the court for jury duty. Employees must supply verification that they have served on jury duty in order to receive pay from the Zoo for the time served.

12.5.1	Personal Leave. Personal leave may be granted for a period of up to thirty (30) calendar days per year. Employees who have completed one (1) year of employment may apply. Such leave must be pre-approved by the supervisor. The Chief Operating Officer or his/her designee must give final approval in writing. Requests for personal leave will be evaluated based on a number of factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence. Denials of leave requests will not be subject to further appeal or grievance.
12.5.2	Educational Leave. Educational leaves of absence may be granted without pay to employees who wish to take time off from work duties to pursue course work that is applicable to their job duties with the Zoo.
Employees who have completed one (1) year of employment may request educational leave for a period of up to twelve (12) months every five (5) years. Such leave must be pre-approved by the supervisor. The Chief Operating Officer or his/her designee must give final approval in writing.

12.5.3	Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and Washington Family Leave Act (FML) Leave. The Zoo administers provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), the Washington Family Care Act (“WFCA”) and the Washington Family Leave Act (“WFML”). The Council acknowledges the Zoo’s right to develop policies and procedures for implementation of the FMLA, WFCA and WFML and any amendments to the Acts. The FMLA permits eligible employees to take unpaid time off for: the birth or placement of a child; to recuperate from a serious health condition; or to care for a child, parent or spouse with a serious health condition. Currently, to be eligible for a leave under the FMLA, an employee must be a regularly benefited employee, must have at least one (1) year of service with the Zoo and have worked at least twelve hundred fifty (1250) hours in the prior year.
FMLA leaves are generally unpaid. Paid vacation and sick leave must be used at the start of FMLA, WFCA and/or WFML leave. Once available paid vacation and sick leave have been exhausted, FMLA leave will be unpaid.
The Zoo will continue to pay its share of the premiums for medical coverage during the FMLA portion of leaves. Employee shares of premiums will be deducted from any paychecks issued. It is the employee’s responsibility to pay the Zoo their share of any premium payments in order to continue medical or dental coverage for themselves or their dependents, or coverage may be discontinued.
Article 13	Grievance Procedure
13.1	Definition. A grievance is a claim by an employee or the Council or a member Union of an alleged violation of any express provision of this Agreement by the Zoo.
13.2	Informal Attempt at Resolution. Prior to filing a formal grievance, an employee should discuss any complaint or concern with his/her supervisor in an effort to resolve the matter.
13.3	Time Limits for Filing. All references to “days” in this Article are to calendar days except that when the final day of any time period in this Article falls on a day when the offices of the Zoo or the Council/Union are closed, the time period shall be extended to the next day when the offices are open. No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is submitted, in writing, within ten (10) days after the employee concerned becomes aware, or should have become aware through the use of reasonable diligence, of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the alleged grievance. If a grievance is not presented within ten (10) days as set forth above, it shall be waived.
With respect to the other time limits set by this Article, if the grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limits or any mutually agreed upon extension, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the Zoo’s last answer. If the Zoo does not answer a grievance or an appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the Council/Union may elect to treat the grievance as denied at that step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. The time limits in each step may be extended by mutual written agreement of the Zoo and the Council/Union.

In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the terms of the Agreement, he/she shall fashion an appropriate remedy so long as the remedy is not beyond the scope of the parties’ contractual agreement. The arbitrator shall submit, in writing, his/her decision within sixty (60) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension.

15.4	Failure by an employee to abide by the afore-referenced provisions of this Article shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, it shall be the responsibility of the Union to notify the Zoo in writing when it is seeking discharge of an employee for non-compliance with Sections 15.1, 15.2 or 15.3 of this Article. When an employee fails to fulfill the union security obligations set forth within this Article, the Union shall forward a "Request For Discharge Letter" to the Vice President of Human Resources, with a copy to the affected employee. Accompanying the “Request For Discharge Letter” shall be a copy of the letter to the employee from the Union explaining the employee's obligation under Article 15, Sections 15.1, 15.2 or 15.3.

Unless sufficient legal explanation or reason is presented by the employee why discharge is not appropriate or unless the Union rescinds its request of the discharge, the Zoo shall, as soon as possible thereafter, effectuate the discharge of such employee. If the employee has fulfilled the union security obligation within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Union shall so notify the Vice President of Human Resources in writing, with a copy to the employee. If the Union has reaffirmed its request for discharge, the Vice President of Human Resources shall notify the Union in writing, with a copy to the employee, that the Zoo effectuated the discharge and the specific date such discharge was effectuated, or that the Zoo has not discharged the employee, setting forth the reasons why it has not done so.
