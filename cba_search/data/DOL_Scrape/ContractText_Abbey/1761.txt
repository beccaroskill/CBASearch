ARTICLE V
EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATIONS
An Employee who regularly works sixty-four (64) hours or more in a pay period shall be classified as a full-time employee. An Employee who regularly works less than sixty-four (64) hours per pay period shall be classified as a part-time employee. "Regularly works" is defined as working sixty-four (64) or more hours in at least seven (7) of the bi-weekly pay periods in a six (6) month period. The term "hours" as used herein includes hours paid for vacation, holidays, sick leave, bereavement leave and jury duty.
In any event, an Employee who works less than an average of sixteen (16) hours per week in any thirty (30) day period shall receive written notice from the Employer, with a copy of such notice sent to the Union, and shall have ten (10) days from the mailing of that notice to contact the Employer to attempt to increase hours worked to sixteen (16) or more hours per week. The failure of the Employee to contact the Employer in such a matter may, at the Employer's sole discretion, result in the Employee's termination. All Employees will be notified of this requirement at the time of hiring. This provision shall not require the Employer to modify any work schedules.
ARTICLE VI
WORK WEEK AND HOURS OF WORK
SECTION 6.1	WORKWEEK
The workweek shall be from 0001 hours Sunday until 2400 hours Saturday. Wages shall be paid bi-weekly on the second Friday following the end of the pay-period.
SECTION 6.2	SCHEDULING OF WORK
The Employer shall schedule the hours of work of Employees at least two (2) weeks in advance, except in circumstances beyond the Employer's control. Nothing shall preclude the Employer from scheduling employees to work ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shifts.
SECTION 6.3	BREAKS
Employees who work shifts of more than four (4) hours and less than eight (8) hours shall receive a fifteen-minute paid break during their shift.

In addition, Employees shall be provided with breaks for emergency purposes as reasonably required.
CBA - Coastal and USPOA 2009
6 of 23
SECTION 6.4	OVERTIME
Overtime pay is to be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times the basic hourly straight time rate for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek. A workday shall be defined as from 0001 hours until 2400 hours. There will not be any pyramiding of hours worked. Paid vacation time, personal/sick or holiday time or training time shall not be counted as hours worked in the calculation of overtime. The opportunity to work overtime shall be provided consistent with the Employer's business needs and circumstances and must be authorized in advance by the Employer.
When the Employer has less than twenty-four (24) hours notice of its need to provide coverage, the Employer shall have the right to require an Employee, who normally performs the work, to remain on duty until relieved and/or to require an available Employee to provide such coverage, as conditions warrant.
When the Employer has advance knowledge that overtime will be required, it will offer such work to available, qualified Employees, by rotation, in order of seniority. Should the most senior Employee (s) reject the overtime opportunity, the Employer shall offer the work to the next available, qualified Employee(s) on the seniority list. Rejected overtime shall be considered as “over-time worked” for purposes of seniority distribution. Should an insufficient number of qualified Employees agree to work overtime through this procedure, the Employer may assign overtime to available, qualified Employees by reverse seniority. It is the intent of this procedure that overtime work is distributed among available, qualified Employees within their respective Agencies as equally as possible. For purposes of this Section, an Employee who rejects two consecutive overtime opportunities is no longer "available."
Overtime work may be offered to part-time Employees if they provide the Employer with a list of days and times during which they are available and willing to work should extra work become available. However, if a part-time Employee refuses on two separate occasions to work hours offered consistent with such list, other than due to an emergency acceptable to the Employer, the Employer will not have further obligation to offer overtime work to that Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employee shall not be required to remain on duty for more than twelve (12) consecutive hours, except in an emergency situation or when no other Employee is available for relief. The existence of an emergency situation and availability of relief shall be determined at the Employer's reasonable discretion. It is the responsibility of the Employee to advise Supervisors and Management at what point they will exceed twelve (12) consecutive hours on duty. Employees who fail to ensure Management is advised of the point they will exceed twelve (12) hours of duty are subject to disciplinary measures under Article VII of this agreement. Should a dispute arise among the Employer, Employee and/or Union regarding the existence of an emergency situation, or the availability of relief, the Employee shall continue working as directed by the Employer.

SECTION 7.3	CALL-OFF

However, the Employee shall not be disciplined if it is determined in the Employer's reasonable discretion that the occurrence was due to circumstances beyond the Employee's control.
Any Employee who fails to provide notice of an absence and fails to appear for work, may, at the Employer's sole discretion, be suspended without pay for a period of three days. A second occurrence of this infraction may, at the Employer's sole discretion, result in the Employee's termination. However, the Employee shall not be terminated if it is determined in the Employer's reasonable discretion that the second occurrence was due to circumstances beyond the Employee's control. (Example: public transit breakdown, weather related delay, sudden serious illness)
Officers who are calling off must have available vacation or sick leave, and their time off from work will be charged to either vacation or sick leave. Excessive absences will be handled according to the most current Company policy.

Failure to perform TAS duties as scheduled may be addressed in Section VII, Discipline, of this document.
SECTION 16.3	PROMOTIONS
In the event that a higher level job becomes available, first preference shall be given to the most senior Employee who is available and qualified to perform the duties thereof. If, within ninety (90) days of such promotion, an Employee fails to satisfy the Employer's requirements for the position or the Employee does not wish to continue in the position to which promoted, such Employee may elect to be returned to his or her prior position in the bargaining unit.
SECTION 16.4	REDUCTION IN FORCE
In the event of any layoff within the bargaining unit, the Employees with the least seniority shall be laid off first, provided that there remain enough qualified Employees to fill all remaining positions and provided further that any Employee who is qualified only for the position(s) being eliminated will be laid off regardless of seniority. Any full- time Employee who is laid off may elect to work a part-time shift, and any Employee laid off from a higher job classification may elect to bump an Employee from a lower job classification for which the electing Employee is otherwise qualified.
SECTION 16.5	RECALL
All laid off Employees will be recalled in order of seniority to positions for which they are qualified. Upon recall, no seniority will be credited for the layoff period, but the Employee shall retain seniority possessed at the time of layoff. No new Employee will be hired at the facility until all qualified laid off Employees have been recalled and all qualified laid off Employees have been offered the position(s) involved.
It is the Employee's responsibility to keep the Employer advised of his or her current address.
If a recalled Employee does not respond within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of such notice or if such is returned to the Employer because the Employee failed to keep the Employer informed of his or her current address, said Employee shall be considered to have voluntarily quit, with no right to future recall.
SECTION 16.6	LOSS OF SENIORITY
CBA - Coastal and USPOA 2009
16 of 23
An Employee who is laid off for reasons other than the Employer's loss of the procurement contract to provide services at the facility will retain seniority for one year. The Employer will have no obligation to recall any Employee who is on layoff at such time as the Employer (or any subcontractor thereof) ceases to employ security personnel at the facility. Any Employee who voluntarily quits or who has been terminated for cause shall lose all prior seniority.
SECTION 16.7	SHIFT AND POST REASSIGNMENT
In the event that the Employer determines it is necessary to rotate Employees among posts, every reasonable effort shall be made to assign Employees during the same shift in which they working. All reasonable effort will be made, consistent with the necessity to provide services required by the Government at the facility, to assign Employees in such a manner as will not disrupt established child care arrangements, as well as family or other work obligations. Assignments are to be made in an unbiased manner, and consistent with the Employees' seniority. To the extent any conflict should arise between or among Employees concerning the shift to which they are reassigned, said conflict will be resolved by seniority, with the most senior Employee(s) having first choice of shift.
SECTION 16.8	TRANSFERS
The Employer has no obligation to transfer Employees from one work site to another, regardless of the termination of any Government procurement contract. However, should the Employer transfer an Employee from one facility to another, that Employee shall retain the same seniority date as at the facility from which transferred.
ARTICLE XVII

c.

Firearms used for qualification shall be of the same type, model and caliber as will be used while the Employee is armed and on duty. The firearms qualification testing shall be limited to two (2) attempts. Depending on range availability, this must be accomplished within a thirty (30) day period.
If an Employee fails to pass the firearms testing after two (2) attempts, the Employee shall be placed on administrative leave without pay for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.
If the Employee fails to obtain a retest date for firearms qualification prior to the expiration of their SPO License or their administrative leave, whichever occurs first, the Employee will be considered as having voluntarily quit. However, the failure to re-qualify shall not be considered a voluntary quit if the failure is attributable to a lack of firing range availability, which is beyond the Employee's control. Under such circumstances, the Employee shall remain on administrative leave without pay until such time as the firing range becomes available.
To the extent possible, firearms qualification testing shall be scheduled at least thirty (30) to sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Employee's certification.
The Employer agrees to provide Employees with instruction on firearms safety, handling and malfunctions prior to firearms qualifications. The Employer agrees to pay Employees for up to two (2) hours at their normal rate of pay for their attendance during this training.

If the Employee does not satisfactorily pass their physical within this thirty (30) day period, they shall be considered as having voluntarily quit. However, the failure to obtain a physical examination will not be considered a voluntary quit if such failure is attributable to circumstances, which are beyond the Employee's control.
SECTION 18.4	TRAINING
Employees may be required to take regular training courses to stay qualified to work at the facility. While attending these courses, the Employees will be paid straight time wages.
