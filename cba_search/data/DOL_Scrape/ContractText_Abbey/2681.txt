MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO AND THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SAFETY EMPLOYEES’ BENEFIT ASSOCIATION CONCERNING THE EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFETY UNIT
PREAMBLE
This Memorandum of Understanding by and between all members of the Employee Relations Committee for the Safety Unit contains the complete results of negotiations concerning wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for employees in the Safety Unit. The parties hereto have met and conferred in good faith exchanging various proposals in an attempt to reach agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, the members of the Employee Relations Committee for the Safety Unit including authorized representatives of the County, and the San Bernardino County Safety Employees’ Benefit Association (hereinafter referred to as SEBA) hereby agree as follows.
ACCESS TO WORK LOCATIONS
The parties recognize and agree that in order to maintain good employee relations, it is necessary for Field Representatives of SEBA to confer with County employees during working hours.
Therefore, SEBA Field Representatives will be granted access to work locations during regular working hours to investigate and process grievances or appeals or examine working conditions. SEBA Field Representatives shall be granted access with reasonable advance notice to the appointing authority or designated management representative prior to entering a work location and after advising of the general nature of the business. However, the appointing authority or designated management representative may deny access or terminate access to work locations if, in their judgment, it is deemed that the visit would interfere with the efficiency, safety, or security of County operations. The appointing authority shall not unreasonably withhold timely access to work locations. The appointing authority shall ensure that there is at all times someone designated who shall have full authority to approve access. If a request is denied, the appointing authority or designated management representative shall establish a mutually agreeable time and location for access to the employee, and/or facilities.
SEBA Field Representatives granted access to work locations shall limit such visits to a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the grievance or appeal or visit.
The appointing authority or designated management representative may mutually establish with the SEBA Field Representatives reasonable limits as to the number of visits authorized with the same employee on the same issue, and reasonable limits as to the number of employees who may participate in a visit when several employees are affected by a specific issue. The County shall not unduly interfere with SEBA’s access right to work locations.
AGENCY SHOP
(a)	Modified Agency Shop
Current employees in the Unit who are now or hereafter become SEBA members shall remain SEBA members for the period of this Memorandum of Understanding. Employees who are hired after September 14, 1992, and who are in a job classification within the Safety Unit, shall within the first pay period from the date of commencement of duties as an employee,
Safety - Page 1
become a member of SEBA or pay via payroll deduction to SEBA a fee in an amount equal to SEBA's bi-weekly dues or a lesser amount designated by SEBA. Excepted from the above are extra-help and recurrent employees. Dues withheld by the County shall be transmitted to the SEBA officer designated in writing by SEBA as the person authorized to receive such funds, at the address specified. The parties agree that the obligations herein are a condition of continued employment for unit members. The parties further agree that the failure of any unit member covered by the Article to remain a member in good standing of SEBA or to authorize payroll deduction of the prescribed fee during the term of this Agreement shall constitute, generally, just and reasonable cause for termination.
The County shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed or discontinued deduction until a payroll deduction card is submitted to the Auditor/Controller-Recorder in sufficient time to permit normal processing of change or deduction.
No unit member shall be required to join SEBA or to authorize an agency fee payroll deduction if the unit member is an actual, verified member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations; this exemption shall not be granted unless and until such unit member has verified the specific circumstances. Such employee must, instead, arrange with SEBA to satisfy his/her obligation by donating the equivalent amount to a non-labor, non-religion charitable fund, tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), chosen by the employee, from the following: County Employees Combined Giving Campaign; Teddy Bear Tymes; or the Salvation Army. SEBA shall be responsible for determinations under this paragraph. Proof of such payments shall be submitted to the County on a monthly basis as a condition of continued exemption from the agency fee requirement.
SEBA shall be fully responsible for expending funds received under this Article consistent with all legal requirements for expenditures of employee dues which are applicable to public sector labor organizations.
Whenever a unit member shall be delinquent in the satisfaction of his or her obligation described above, SEBA shall give the unit member written notice thereof and fifteen (15) days to cure the delinquency; a copy of said notice shall be forwarded to the County Employee Relations Division Chief. In the event the unit member fails to cure said delinquency, SEBA shall request, in writing, that the County initiate termination proceedings. The termination proceedings shall be governed by applicable laws and are specifically excluded from the Grievance Procedure.
The County shall not involuntarily deduct from non-members monies specifically earmarked for a Political Action Committee or other political activities.
SEBA shall keep an adequate itemized record of its financial transactions and shall make available annually to the County and, upon request to the employees who are members of SEBA within sixty (60) days after the end of its fiscal year, a detailed written financial report thereof in the form of a balance sheet and an operating statement, certified as to its accuracy by its President and Treasurer or corresponding Principal Officer or by a Certified Public Accountant. A copy of financial reports required under or referred to in the Labor-Management Disclosure Act of 1959 or Government Code Section 3546.5 shall satisfy this requirement.
This organizational security arrangement shall be null and void if rescinded by a vote of employees in the unit pursuant to Government Code Section 3502.5(d).
SEBA hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County of San Bernardino and its officers and employees from any claim, loss, liability or cause of action of any
Safety - Page 2
nature whatsoever arising out of the operation of this Article. SEBA's indemnity and liability obligation is more fully set forth as follows:
SEBA shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County of San Bernardino and its officers and employees from any claim, loss, liability, cause of action or administrative proceeding arising out of the operation of this Article. Upon commencement of such legal action, administrative proceeding, or claim, SEBA shall have the right to decide and determine whether any claim, administrative proceeding, liability, suit or judgment made or brought against the County or its officers and employees because of any application of this Article shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed. Any such decision on the part of SEBA shall not diminish SEBA's defense and indemnification obligations under this Agreement.
The County, immediately upon receipt of notice of such claim, proceeding or legal action shall inform SEBA of such action, provide SEBA with all information, documents, and assistance necessary for SEBA defense or settlement of such action and fully cooperate with SEBA in providing all necessary employee witnesses and assistance necessary for said defense. The cost of any such assistance shall be paid by SEBA.
SEBA upon its compromise or settlement of such action or matter shall timely pay the parties to such action all sums due under such settlement or compromise. SEBA, upon final order and judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction awarding damages or costs to any employee, shall pay all sums owing under such order and judgment.
(b)	Full Agency Shop
Within thirty (30) days of April 13, 2004, an election shall be conducted within the Safety Unit to determine whether a full agency shop provision shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of employment for the Safety Unit. If by such an election the majority of the members of the Safety Unit casting ballots approve inclusion of a full agency shop provision, the provisions under (A) Modified Agency Shop, above, shall cease and the following provisions shall be implemented:
Effective the pay period beginning May 29, 2004, all current employees who are in a job classification within the Safety Unit, shall become a member of SEBA or pay via payroll deduction to SEBA an agency fee in an amount equal to SEBA's bi-weekly dues or a lesser amount designated by SEBA. Employees who are hired after May 29, 2004, and who are in a job classification within this Unit, shall within the first pay period from the date of commencement of duties as an employee, become a member of SEBA or pay via payroll deduction to SEBA an agency fee in an amount equal to SEBA’s biweekly dues. Excepted from the above are extra-help and recurrent employees. Dues and agency fees withheld by the County shall be transmitted to the SEBA officer designated in writing by SEBA as the person authorized to receive such funds, at the address specified. The parties agree that the obligations herein are a condition of continued employment for unit members. The parties further agree that the failure of any unit member covered by the Article to remain a member in good standing of SEBA or to pay the prescribed fee during the term of this Agreement shall constitute, generally, just and reasonable cause for termination.
The County shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed or discontinued dues deduction until a payroll deduction card is submitted to the Auditor/Controller-Recorder in sufficient time to permit normal processing of change or deduction. Agency fees shall automatically be deducted from employees who elect not to become members of SEBA
No unit member shall be required to join SEBA or to authorize an agency fee payroll deduction if the unit member is an actual, verified member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect
Safety - Page 3
which has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations; this exemption shall not be granted unless and until such unit member has verified the specific circumstances. Such employee must, instead, arrange with SEBA to satisfy his/her obligation by donating the equivalent amount to a non-labor, non-religion charitable fund, tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), chosen by the employee, from the following: County Employees Combined Giving Campaign; Teddy Bear Tymes; or the Salvation Army. SEBA shall be responsible for determinations under this paragraph. Proof of such payments shall be submitted to the County on a monthly basis as a condition of continued exemption from the agency fee requirement.
SEBA shall be fully responsible for expending funds received under this Article consistent with all legal requirements for expenditures of employee dues which are applicable to public sector labor organizations.
Whenever a unit member shall be delinquent in the satisfaction of his or her obligation described above, SEBA shall give the unit member written notice thereof and fifteen (15) days to cure the delinquency; a copy of said notice shall be forwarded to the County Employee Relations Division Chief. In the event the unit member fails to cure said delinquency, SEBA shall request, in writing, that the County initiate termination proceedings. The termination proceedings shall be governed by applicable laws and are specifically excluded from the Grievance Procedure.
The County shall not involuntarily deduct from non-members monies specifically earmarked for a Political Action Committee or other political activities.
SEBA shall keep an adequate itemized record of its financial transactions and shall make available annually to the County and, upon request to the employees who are members of SEBA within sixty (60) days after the end of its fiscal year, a detailed written financial report thereof in the form of a balance sheet and an operating statement, certified as to its accuracy by its President and Treasurer or corresponding Principal Officer or by a Certified Public Accountant. A copy of financial reports required under or referred to in the Labor-Management Disclosure Act of 1959 or Government Code Section 3546.5 shall satisfy this requirement.
This organizational security arrangement shall be null and void if rescinded by a vote of employees in the unit pursuant to Government Code Section 3502.5(d).
SEBA hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County of San Bernardino and its officers and employees from any claim, loss, liability or cause of action of any nature whatsoever arising out of the operation of this Article. SEBA's indemnity and liability obligation is more fully set forth as follows:
SEBA shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County of San Bernardino and its officers and employees from any claim, loss, liability, cause of action or administrative proceeding arising out of the operation of this Article. Upon commencement of such legal action, administrative proceeding, or claim, SEBA shall have the right to decide and determine whether any claim, administrative proceeding, liability, suit or judgment made or brought against the County or its officers and employees because of any application of this Article shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed. Any such decision on the part of SEBA shall not diminish SEBA's defense and indemnification obligations under this Agreement.
The County, immediately upon receipt of notice of such claim, proceeding or legal action shall inform SEBA of such action, provide SEBA with all information, documents, and assistance necessary for SEBA defense or settlement of such action and fully cooperate with SEBA in providing all necessary employee witnesses and assistance necessary for said defense. The cost of any such assistance shall be paid by SEBA.

SEBA upon its compromise or settlement of such action or matter shall timely pay the parties to such action all sums due under such settlement or compromise. SEBA, upon final order and judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction awarding damages or costs to any employee, shall pay all sums owing under such order and judgment.
ASSIGNMENT TO HIGHER POSITION
Employees directed to continuously perform duties in a vacant higher level position for which funds have been appropriated shall be entitled to compensation on the higher level for the time actually worked in excess of sixty (60) work days in a one hundred twenty (120) work day corridor, unless specifically waived by the employee; provided, however:
(a)	The appointing authority certifies to the County Administrative Officer in writing at the time of appointment that the employee is assigned and held responsible to fully perform all of the duties normally associated with the higher-level classification without limitation as to difficulty or complexity of assignments or consequence of action and that the employee shall be required to meet standards for satisfactory performance normally required at the higher-level classification.
(b)	A written request of compensation at the higher-level classification is directed to the County Administrative Officer through the Human Resources Department for approval. It shall be the responsibility of the appointing authority to initiate such requests and whenever possible to anticipate need for reassignment to a higher-level classification. Written requests may also be made by the employee or the exclusive recognized employee organization in the same manner. A copy of the written request for compensation at the higher-level classification and the certification of the assignment of duties shall be provided to the employee. The employee shall be advised of the date compensation at the higher level is to be effective.
No employee shall be required to accept assignments to continuously perform the duties of a vacant higher-level position for which funds have been appropriated unless directed in writing by the appointing authority or supervisor with the delegated authority.
Employees may be temporarily assigned higher or lower duties without a change in pay and such action not be deemed as a basis for transfer, demotion, promotion, or reclassification. In all cases where periodic or regular variations in assignments occur because of seasonal needs or because of the nature of the duties or the work schedule, such variations shall be considered as incidental to the position.
Appointments to regular positions from an appropriate eligible list of a lower classification as a Trainee are exempt from provisions of this Article and are governed by the provisions of the Personnel Rule on Appointments.
Approval of compensation at the higher-level classification shall not circumvent the principle of the competitive process for appointments to positions in the classified service. Approval of the higher salary may not be retroactive unless approved by the Director of Human Resources and unless a request for compensation at the higher-level classification is made within twenty (20) work days following the sixty (60) working day period. In no event shall additional compensation be paid for the first sixty (60) days worked. Requests approved for compensation at the higher-level classification shall be governed by the Personnel Rule on Provisional Appointments as to the duration of approval and eligibility requirements for compensation at the higher-level classification and as to continuation of the appointment.
Safety - Page 5
This Article does not apply to a situation in which there is no vacant higher-level position for which funds have been appropriated. Addition of duties of a higher-level classification to an employee's budgeted position shall be governed by Personnel Rule on Classifications.
It is the responsibility of all parties including department heads and other supervisory personnel to follow the procedures set forth in this Article and promptly report unauthorized situations covered by this Article to the County Administrative Officer.
For purposes of this Article, a vacant position is defined as an authorized position for which funds have been appropriated and allocated to an existing job classification based upon the duties and responsibilities currently assigned to the position and which may be:
(1)	An unoccupied position due to attrition and for which the Civil Service appointment process has been initiated.
(2)	A new position authorization by Board of Supervisors budgetary action for which the Civil Service appointment process has been initiated.
(3)	A position from which the incumbent is on extended authorized leave of absence.
BENEFIT PLAN
Section 1	- Benefit Plan Contributions
(a)	Employees in a regular position scheduled and paid for a minimum of forty-one (41) hours per pay period are eligible to receive the benefits of this Section.
(b)	The bi-weekly amount of the County provided Benefit Plan for eligible employees in this Unit shall be one hundred thirty-eight dollars and forty-six cents ($138.46) per pay period. The benefit plan contributions provided in this Section shall only be afforded to employees who have completed more than eighteen (18) years of service with the County as of December 25, 2005, including those who previously elected to opt-out or waive to a spouse.
(c)	Under no circumstances will the monetary value of the Benefit Plan be prorated.
(d)	Employees who are on an approved medical leave of absence and whose paid
hours in a pay period are less than forty-one (41) hours will continue to receive the benefits of this Section for up to six (6) pay periods per episode of illness or injury. Employees who are on an approved leave of absence without pay under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 will continue to receive the Benefit Plan dollars for up to six (6) pay periods. Employees who are on a leave of absence without pay shall not be eligible to receive the monetary benefits of this Section unless on a medical leave or a Family Medical Leave Act eligible leave.
Section 2	- Section 125 Premium Conversion Plan
(a)	Eligible employees shall be provided with a Section 125 Premium Conversion Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees a choice between paying premiums with either pre-tax salary reductions or after-tax payroll deductions for health insurance, dental insurance, voluntary life (to the IRS specified limit) and accidental death and dismemberment insurance premiums currently maintained for Unit employees or any other program(s) mutually agreed upon by the parties. The amount of the pre-tax salary reduction or after-tax payroll deduction must be equal to the required insurance premium.
Safety - Page 6
(b)	Benefit Plan elections shall not reduce earnable compensation for purposes of calculating benefits or contributions for the San Bernardino County Employees’ Retirement Association.
(c)	To be eligible for this benefit, an employee must be in a regular position and be regularly scheduled to work at least forty-one (41) hours in a pay period or be on an approved leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act.
(d)	Election of pre-tax and after-tax payroll deductions shall be made within thirty (30) days of the initial eligibility period in a manner and on such forms designated by the Human Resources Employee Benefits and Services Division Chief. Failure to timely submit appropriate paperwork will result in after-tax deductions for all eligible premiums for the remainder of the Plan year.
(e)	Once a salary reduction has begun, in no event will changes in elections be permitted during the Plan year except to the extent permitted under Internal Revenue Service rulings and regulations and with the County’s Plan Document. Examples of mid-year qualifying events include: marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, death, over age dependent, loss of student status, the employee’s or the employee’s spouse’s or domestic partner’s reduction in work hours, loss of spouse’s or domestic partner’s employment, gain or loss of spouse’s or domestic partner’s insurance, relocation outside an HMO network service area, entitlement to Medicare for the employee’s or the employee’s dependent, significant increase in County insurance cost during the Plan year, loss or gain of Medicare or Medicaid coverage and spouse’s, domestic partner’s or dependent’s open enrollment. The employee must submit request for a change due to a mid-year qualifying event within thirty (30) days of the qualifying event. The Human Resources Employee Benefits and Services Division Chief, or designee, will authorize changes as long as the change is made on account of and consistent with an employee’s change in status.
Section 3	- Health and Dental Plan Coverage
(a)	All eligible employees scheduled to work forty one (41) hours or more per pay period in a regular position must enroll in a health and dental plan offered by the County. Employees who fail to elect health plan coverage will be automatically enrolled in the health and dental plan with the lowest bi-weekly premium rates available in the geographical location of the employee’s primary residence.
(b)	To be eligible for County health and dental plan coverage, an employee must be in a regular position and have received pay for at least forty one (41) hours in a pay period or be on an approved leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act.
(c)	Enrollment elections must remain in effect for the remainder of the Plan year unless an employee becomes ineligible for an HMO network service area.
(d)	Eligible employees may elect to enroll their dependents upon initial eligibility for health and dental insurance. Thereafter, newly eligible dependents may be enrolled within thirty (30) days of obtaining dependent status, such as birth, adoption or marriage.
(e)	Notification of a mid-year qualifying event must be submitted to the Human Resources Employee Benefits and Services Division in accordance with procedures adopted by the County. Employees are responsible for notifying the County within thirty (30) days of dependent’s change in eligibility for the County plans.
(f)	Dependent(s) must be removed mid-Plan year when a dependent(s) becomes ineligible for coverage under the insurance plan eligibility rules, for example divorce, over age
Safety - Page 7
dependent, gain of coverage on spouse’s or domestic partner’s employer provided insurance, or termination of domestic partnership.
(g)	Premiums for coverage will be automatically deducted from the employee’s pay warrant. Failure to pay premiums will result in loss of coverage for the employee and/or the dependents.
(h)	Employees eligible for health plan coverage who are also enrolled in comparable group health plan sponsored by another employer or are covered by a spouse who is also employed with the County may elect to discontinue enrollment in their County-sponsored health plan (opt-out or waive). Employees who have not completed more than eighteen (18) years of service with the County as of December 24, 2005, and who elect to opt-out of County-sponsored health plan coverage or waive to a spouse during the term of this MOU will receive twenty dollars ($20.00) per pay period in lieu of the Medical Premium Subsidy described below. Employees who have completed more than eighteen (18) years of service with the County as of December 24, 2005, and elect to opt-out or waive to a spouse will continue to receive one-hundred and thirty-eight dollars and forty-six cents ($138.46) per pay period.
(i)	Employees eligible for dental plan coverage who are also enrolled in a comparable group dental plan sponsored by another employer may elect to discontinue enrollment in their County-sponsored dental plan.
(j)	The rules and procedures for electing to opt-out of County-sponsored health and dental plan coverage are established and administered by the Human Resources Employee Benefits and Services Division.
(1)	Employees may elect to opt-out of County health and/or dental plan(s) within thirty (30) calendar days of becoming eligible for another employer-sponsored group plan. Proof of initial gain of other group coverage is required at the time that opt-out is elected.
(2)	Employees may elect to opt-out of County health and/or dental plan(s) during an annual open enrollment period. All employees who are newly opting-out during an open enrollment period must provide verification of other group coverage.
(3)	To continue to opt-out, employees must re-elect the opt-out benefit and certify that they have other group coverage during each annual open enrollment period. Except as required at the initial opt-out election, employees are not required to provide verification of continued coverage unless requested by the Plan administrator.
(4)	An employee who elects to opt-out for dental plan coverage may not reenroll in a County-sponsored dental plan for a minimum of two (2) years unless the employee involuntarily loses coverage from the other employer-sponsored group dental plan. Employees who elect to enroll in County dental coverage, for reasons other than involuntary loss of another group sponsored dental plan coverage, may enroll during the open enrollment following completion of the two (2) year dental opt-out restriction. NOTE: a voluntary loss of other group dental insurance may result in a break in dental coverage until the two (2) year mandatory opt-out period is complete.
(5)	Employees who voluntarily or involuntarily lose their other group health
plan coverage must enroll in a County-sponsored health plan within thirty (30) calendar days. Enrollment in the County-sponsored plan will be provided in accordance with the requirements of the applicable plan. If the employee elects not to enroll their eligible dependents, the dependents may only be added at a subsequent annual open enrollment period.
Safety - Page 8
(6)	There must be no break in the employee’s health plan coverage between the termination date of the other employer group coverage and enrollment in a County health plan. Terms and conditions of the applicable plan will determine the required retroactive enrollment period and premiums required to implement coverage. Failure to notify the County of loss of group coverage within thirty (30) calendar days will require the employee to pay their insurance premiums retroactively on an after-tax basis.
(k)	An eligible employee whose spouse or domestic partner is also an eligible County employee may elect coverage as a dependent on their spouse’s or, if the employee is age eighteen (18) or younger, on their parent’s County health and/or dental insurance plan in lieu of individual employee coverage. This is called a “waiver” to their County spouse’s or parent’s County insurance coverage. Such election must be made within 30 calendar days of the employee’s, County parent’s or the County spouse’s eligibility for County health and dental insurance. During the Plan year, an employee is responsible for notifying the County within thirty (30) days of ineligibility for the waiver, for example the dependent child turns nineteen (19) or the spouse leaves County employment. Changes will become effective on the first day of the pay period following the receipt and approval of all appropriate documentation. Loss of the spouse or parent’s County plan coverage will require the employee to immediately enroll in the County’s health and dental plans. Waivers may be changed during any subsequent annual health and dental open enrollment period.

This Subsidy will be established each year when premiums change for the County-sponsored health plans. The Subsidy will be discontinued when the lowest cost health plan becomes available to the employees.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE
Section 1	- Purpose
The County and SEBA fully realize the importance of viable procedures to aid in the resolution of disputes among employees, supervisors, and management. It is recognized that conditions may arise which can create employee dissatisfaction, and that to maintain high employee morale and harmonious relations, an orderly method of processing disputes is necessary. The Board of Supervisors and SEBA have pledged that their representatives at all levels will extend active, aggressive, and continuing efforts to secure prompt disposition of issues. The initiation of a complaint in good faith by an employee shall not cause any adverse reflection on the employee's standing with immediate supervisors or loyalty as a County employee.
Section 2	- Definitions and Exclusions
There are three (3) types of dispute procedures in this Article: grievances, disciplinary appeals, and unfair labor practices.
(a)	A grievance is a disagreement between County management and an employee, or group of employees concerning the interpretation, application, or violation of this Memorandum of Understanding. Formal grievances must be filed by SEBA on behalf of any employee or group of employees. Group grievances are defined as, and limited to, those grievances that allege more than one (1) employee suffered harm under similar facts and circumstances within the grievance filing period. A group grievance does not need to identify, by name, the specific individuals alleged to have suffered harm provided the affected employees (i.e., grievants) are readily ascertainable (e.g., all deputies assigned to the Rancho Cucamonga Station on the night shift). However, where only some employees in a larger group of employees are alleged to have suffered harm or where back pay or monetary relief is sought, SEBA shall be required to name the grievants so as to enable the County to determine and evaluate the scope and potential liability and also attempt settlement.
(b)	A disciplinary appeal is an appeal of discipline as defined by the Personnel Rules.
(c)	Unfair labor practice charges are defined by County Ordinance 3707 (the Employee Relations Ordinance). This section also applies to unit modification and unit determination issues.
Safety - Page 13
Any dispute which may arise between parties involving application, meaning, or interpretation of the Personnel Rules is excluded from this Article and shall be settled in accordance with the appropriate appeal procedure established by the Personnel Rules except as provided in Section 4 of this Article.
All matters are excluded from this procedure which deal with the Non-Discrimination Article, County Management Rights Article, federal or state statutes, rules or regulations; or are preempted by County Charter. However, SEBA retains the right to process a grievance based upon a claim of discrimination because of labor organization affiliation as an alleged violation of the Article entitled Employee Rights.
Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or state or federal statute, this grievance procedure shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for seeking recourse for any grievance, as defined herein.
Section 3	- Grievance Procedure
(a)	Jurisdiction
The Director of Human Resources or designee shall have the sole authority within the County structure to provide the official management interpretation or application to any and all provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator has the final authority within the County structure to adjudicate all grievances, as defined or otherwise provided herein.
(b)	Representation
Aggrieved employee(s) shall be represented by an authorized SEBA representative. This representation may commence at any step in the Grievance Procedure. A representative of the Human Resources Department may be in attendance at any step in the Grievance Procedure. The County agrees within reasonable limits to compensate the aggrieved employee(s) for time spent during regularly scheduled hours in the handling of real and prospective grievances.
(c)	Consolidation of Grievances
In order to avoid the necessity of processing numerous similar grievances at one time, similar grievances must be consolidated.
(d)	Time Limitations and Notification
Time limitations are established to settle a grievance quickly. Time limits may be modified only by agreement of the parties. If at any step of this Grievance Procedure SEBA is dissatisfied with the decision rendered, it shall be SEBA’s responsibility to initiate the action which submits the grievance to the next level of review within the time limits specified. Failure to submit the grievance within the time limits imposed shall terminate the grievance process and the matter shall be considered resolved. If a reviewing official does not respond within the time limits specified, the grievance shall be deemed to have been denied on the last day upon which the response could have been made.
SEBA shall then proceed to the next step of the Grievance Procedure within the specified time limits. A formal grievance may be entertained in or advanced to any step if the parties jointly so agree, except as limited by Section 2 of this Grievance Procedure. A copy of such agreements bearing the signatures of the parties shall be filed with the Employee Relations Division of the Human Resources Department.
Safety - Page 14
For purposes of this Grievance Procedure, notification to a party may be given either personally or by mail. When notice is mailed to an employee, it shall be sent to the employee's current address of record. For the purpose of this procedure, notice by mail shall be deemed to have been completed on the third calendar day following deposit of notice with the United States Postal Service, unless the party can establish that notice was not actually received as a result of circumstances beyond the party's control.
(e)	Steps in the Grievance Procedure
The procedures outlined herein constitute the informal and formal steps necessary to resolve an employee's grievance. The attempt of settlement of grievances filed on behalf of an individual employee(s) in the informal step at the employee-supervisor level is required. The presentation of the informal grievance is an absolute prerequisite to the institution of a formal grievance. The grievance must be submitted within fifteen (15) work days after the employee is aware of the conditions precipitating the grievance.
Step 1 - Informal. Initially, the employee having a grievance shall on a personal face-to-face basis discuss the complaint with the immediate supervisor informally.
Within three (3) work days the immediate supervisor shall give the decision to the employee orally.
If a mutually acceptable solution has not been reached in the informal step, SEBA shall submit the grievance in writing on appropriate forms prepared and supplied by the Employee Relations Division which shall provide a detailed statement of the grievance, including dates, names, and places, applicable MOU articles, and the specific remedy or action requested. The written grievance shall be filed in duplicate with the Employee Relations Division within five (5) work days of oral notification of the immediate supervisor’s decision.
Step 2 - Formal. The Employee Relations Division shall make a determination of whether the grievance is a matter for which the formal Grievance Procedure is appropriate. In making such determination, the Employee Relations Division shall determine if: (1) the grievance has been filed in a timely manner; (2) the initial step has been followed; (3) if the grievance alleges that a specific Memorandum of Understanding Article(s) has been misinterpreted, misapplied, or violated; and (4) the matter complained of in the grievance is covered by a specific provision of the MOU. The determination and notification to SEBA will be made within five (5) work days of receipt of the grievance.
If a mutually acceptable solution has not been reached, SEBA, on behalf of the grievant shall submit the written grievance to the Division/Section Head within three (3) work days of the receipt of written response of the immediate supervisor.
If objection is made to the procedural and/or substantive grievability of a grievance at any step of the grievance procedure, it is expressly agreed that such defenses are preserved in any arbitration hearing and that no waiver will result from the subsequent processing and discussion of the grievance on the merits.
Step 3. The Division/Section Head shall meet with SEBA and thoroughly discuss the grievance within five (5) work days of receipt of the written grievance of the employee.
In the Sheriff's Department, it may be necessary to involve intermediate supervisors in the discussions with SEBA. The time limits established normally allow for this, but if an extension of time is needed, it should be mutually agreed upon in writing by both the appointing authority and the grievant or designated representative. A copy of the written
Safety - Page 15
agreement will be furnished to the Employee Relations Division of the Human Resources Department.
The Division/Section Head shall give a written decision to SEBA and the Employee Relations Division within five (5) work days after discussion with SEBA. If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at this level, it may be appealed by SEBA to the appointing authority within five (5) work days following notification to SEBA.
Step 4. The appointing authority shall review the matter and shall render a decision within five (5) work days after receiving the grievance. If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved by the appointing authority, appeal may be made by SEBA within five (5) work days to the next step.
Step 5 - Arbitration. If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved, a written appeal for arbitration must be filed by SEBA with the Employee Relations Division within five (5) work days of notification of the decision by the appointing authority. The appeal must be presented on the aforementioned grievance form supplied by the Employee Relations Division of the Human Resources Department along with a copy of any pertinent documents.
In reaching a decision and award the arbitrator shall limit himself to the allegations contained in the grievance presented in relation to the express provisions of the MOU alleged to have been violated. Further, the arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, change, add to, subtract from, or ignore any provisions of this MOU. Lastly, the arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for that of the County on matters pertaining to the exercise of managerial discretion except where it can be shown by the grievant/SEBA that the County abused its discretion.
The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and transmitted to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of the hearing. The arbitrator’s decision may require an appointing authority or a subordinate to cease and desist from the action which is the subject of the grievance. The arbitrator may also require the appointing authority to take whatever action is necessary, within the control of the appointing authority, to remedy the grievance, or take other action to relieve the loss, if any, to the employee. Under no conditions can the arbitrator order relief that exceeds the relief requested by the grievant, and shall be limited to making the grievant whole. The decision by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties unless there is a financial impact of greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), in which case it shall be subject to approval of the Board of Supervisors. For grievance decisions with financial impact greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), the Employee Relations Division will submit the grievance decision at the next practicable meeting of the Board of Supervisors. If the Board of Supervisors fails to act within thirty (30) days following receipt of formal notice of the decision of the arbitrator, the decision shall become final and binding. A copy of the arbitration decision shall be filed with the Employee Relations Division of the Human Resources Department and SEBA.
All grievances shall be treated as confidential, and no publicity will be given until the final resolution of the grievance.
Section 4	- Disciplinary Appeals
Disciplinary appeals are governed by the Personnel Rules, except where the provisions in the MOU differ from those in the Personnel Rules the provisions of the MOU take precedent.
Disciplinary appeals shall be heard by a hearing officer. In instances where an employee is not represented by SEBA, the County may elect to have the appeal heard by the
Safety - Page 16
Civil Service Commission. If the employee elects to have the appeal heard by a hearing officer, the employee must assume one-half (1/2) of the costs of the appeal process, including any arbitrator’s costs. If the employee does not elect to have the appeal heard by the Civil Service Commission the County shall pay the entire cost of the appeal process, including any arbitrator costs, but not expenses, incurred by the employee. Except as provided herein, the hearing officer's findings and recommendations shall be final and binding on both parties but shall be subject to review by the Civil Service Commission on its own initiative only as described below. The Civil Service Commission shall either accept or reject the hearing officer's findings and recommendations within sixty (60) days of receipt by the Commission. In the event the Civil Service Commission does not accept the hearing officer's decision in its entirety, the Commission shall conduct and complete a full and fair evidentiary hearing on the disciplinary appeal. Such hearing shall commence within thirty (30) days of rejecting the hearing officer's findings and recommendations unless the hearing cannot for good cause be commenced within thirty (30) days. Both the County of San Bernardino and SEBA reserve the right to seek judicial review of the final administrative decision pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Failure by either party to formally request a rehearing by the Commission will not be deemed a waiver or bar of the right to seek judicial review as set forth above.
Within five (5) business days of acceptance of the appeal by the Civil Service Commission, the parties shall either mutually agree to have the appeal heard by the Civil Service Commission or the appellant’s representative shall request a list of hearing officers from the American Arbitration Association or the State or Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
If applicable, the names provided by the American Arbitration Association or the State or Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be added to the list established annually by the parties and the Civil Service Commission. Within ten (10) business days, the parties shall select from the list by mutual agreement. Where mutual agreement cannot be made, the hearing officer in each case shall be determined following a striking process. The determination as to which party strikes first shall be based on a coin flip. If the last remaining person on the list is not available, the previously stricken person(s) shall be contacted in reverse order until one is available.
The parties shall advise the Civil Service Commission of the selection of hearing officer and request that the hearing officer be appointed.
The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and issue its decision in accordance with provisions of this MOU and the rules and procedures of the Civil Service Commission.
The cost of the hearing officer’s services, and court reporter if applicable, shall be borne equally by the parties. Any cancellation fee will be paid by the party responsible for canceling the hearing, or divided between the parties if both parties are responsible.
Section 5	- Unfair Labor Practices
Unfair labor practice charges as well as unit modification and unit determinations shall be heard by a Hearing Officer in accordance with Section 7 of this Article.
Section 6	- Mediation
The parties (Director of Human Resources or designee and SEBA) may by mutual agreement utilize mediation for grievances filed under the provisions of this Agreement. The mediator has no authority to compel resolution of the matter mediated.
Safety - Page 17
No reference to a matter mediated may be utilized in a subsequent arbitration or hearing unless stated in writing at a step prior to the mediation. The penalty for disclosure shall be forfeiture of the hearing or appeal by the party violating the same. When possible the parties shall utilize the mediation services provided by the State or Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. In the event that the mediation process would result in fees for service rendered by the State or by use of a private mediator officer, such costs shall be equally divided between the employee’s department and SEBA.
No person serving in the capacity as a mediator may serve as the hearing officer/arbitrator for the same case should the same be forwarded to arbitration or a Personnel Rules disciplinary hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
Section 7	- Procedures Governing Appeals Before the Arbitrator/Hearing Officer
(a)	Arbitrators/Hearing officers may be selected by mutual agreement of the Human Resources Department and SEBA as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) working days after receipt of a written notice by SEBA of its appeal to arbitration or receipt of a list from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service as applicable. Otherwise, they shall be selected from a list established by the Human Resources Department and SEBA from names provided by the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. The arbitrator/hearing officer in each case shall be determined following a striking process. The determination as to which party strikes first shall be based on a coin flip. If the last remaining person is not available, the previously stricken person(s) shall be contacted in reverse order until one is available. The list shall be in effect for one (1) year; names are subject to renewal only if both the Human Resources Department and SEBA are in agreement; where there is not mutual agreement, new name(s) shall be added to the list in the aforementioned manner.
(b)	The cost of the hearing officer’s/arbitrator’s services, and court reporter if applicable, shall be split equally between the County Department of the complainant(s) and SEBA, or the complainant if not represented by SEBA. Any cancellation fee will be paid by the party responsible for canceling the hearing, or divided between the parties if both parties are responsible.
(c)	Prehearing conferences are to be mandatory. Within twenty (20) work days, both parties are required to meet in such conference to jointly or individually declare stipulations, identify witnesses and exchange exhibits that will be carried forward to the hearing, the intent being full disclosure by both sides prior to the arbitration process.
(d)	The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing and transmitted to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing.
DOWNGRADINGS
When a position is downgraded because of decreased responsibility or difficulty, the Director of Human Resources may authorize continuation of the same salary rate payment to the incumbent employee that the employee received prior to the downgrading of the position by placing the employee on an "X" step, provided that the employee shall receive no future salary rate increases until the salary rate of the position held exceeds the "X" step.

(a)	Requests for expense reimbursement should be submitted once each month, except if the amount claimable for any month does not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00), the submission may be deferred until the amount exceeds twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or until June 30 during the current fiscal year, whichever occurs first. At the end of the fiscal year, expense reimbursement claims for July 1 and beyond must be on a separate claim from those expenses claimed for June 30 or earlier.

Reimbursements at this rate shall be considered as full and complete payment for actual necessary expenses for the use of the private automobile, insurance, maintenance, and all other transportation related costs. The County does not provide any insurance for private automobiles used on County business. The owner of an automobile is responsible for the personal liability and property damage insurance when the vehicle is used on County business.
(2)	When employees, traveling on official County business, leave directly from their principal place of residence rather than from their assigned work location, mileage allowed to the first work contact point shall be equal to the actual mileage from the residence or the mileage computed from the assigned work location, whichever is less.

(c)	Travel Via Rental Vehicles
Reimbursement will be provided for the cost of a rental vehicle for business purposes if such use is approved by the appointing authority. Rental vehicles are covered for liability and vehicle physical damage under the County’s self-insurance program.

(b)	The allowance for lodging is sixty-five dollars ($65.00) plus tax, per night, single.
(c)	The allowance for meals is forty-one dollars ($41.00) plus tax, per full day, or when it is less than a full day or separate meals are claimed, nine dollars ($9.00) for breakfast; twelve dollars ($12.00) for lunch; and twenty dollars ($20.00) for dinner, all plus tax.
Section 8	- Meal Reimbursement
(a)	The parties agree that it is the basic responsibility of employees to anticipate and make provision for their own meals eaten during the employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty; however, reimbursement for meals may be approved by the appointing authority when an employee is twenty (20) miles or more distant from assigned work location for more than one-half (1/2) of the scheduled tour of duty or when an employee is required to work for two (2) hours or more in excess of the regularly scheduled tour of duty during an unplanned activity.

Any sums for such burial expenses entitled to the beneficiary under the Worker's Compensation laws not to exceed $4,000 shall be assigned to and paid directly to the County.
Section 11	- Meal Reimbursement for Trimester Use of Force Training
All employees attending trimester use of force training may be eligible for meal reimbursement under this Section even though they may have traveled less than twenty (20) miles from their normal work location. Meal reimbursements under this Section shall be subject to the POST-established amounts and requirements. Employees attending trimester use of force training are not eligible for expense reimbursement under Section 8 of this Article. If POST suspends or eliminates reimbursement for such expenses, operation of this Section shall be suspended. In the event this Section is suspended, reimbursement for meals shall be made pursuant to Section 8 of this Article.
EXTRA HELP AND PUBLIC GATHERINGS
Extra help employees shall be compensated on an hourly basis only for hours actually worked. Compensation shall be paid at an hourly rate as provided in the Salary Adjustment Article, Section 1. Under unusual circumstances and with the approval of the appropriate appointing authority(s) and the Director of Human Resources, an employee in a regular position may choose to work in an extra help capacity for the same or another appointing authority and be compensated as such pursuant to this Article. Employees who work public gatherings shall be compensated pursuant to the appropriate ordinance for public gatherings and such compensation shall not be governed by the provisions of this Agreement.
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT
The purpose of this Section 125 Medical Expense Reimbursement Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is to permit eligible employees to make an election to pay for qualifying medical
Safety - Page 23
care expenses, as determined by Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), on a pre-tax basis by salary reduction in accordance with Sections 125 and 105(b) of the IRC and regulations issued pursuant thereto. FSA shall be construed to comply with said Code Sections and to meet the requirements of any other applicable provisions of law. FSA exclusions from gross income do not affect compensation for retirement purposes.
FSA will be administered by the County Human Resources Department, Human Resources Chief, Employee Benefits and Services Division, consistent with said IRC Sections.
(a)	To be eligible for this benefit, an employee must be in a regular position and regularly scheduled to work forty (40) or more hours per pay period and paid for a minimum of one half plus one of the scheduled hours, be on an approved leave designated as Family Medical Leave Act or on an approved military leave.
(b)	Enrollment in the Plan is limited to the annual open enrollment period or no later than the last day of the pay period following the pay period of becoming eligible. Failure to submit an election agreement within the specified time frame shall result in an election to not participate in the Plan. The FSA Plan year will coincide with the County’s Benefit Plan year.
(c)	Enrollment is required every Plan year. An employee must elect to contribute to FSA through salary reduction on forms approved by the County Human Resources Department, Human Resources Chief, Employee Benefits and Services Division.
(d)	Eligible employees may contribute, on a pre-tax basis, a minimum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per biweekly pay period to a flexible spending account. An employee election to participate in the Plan shall be irrevocable for the remainder of the Plan year. Once a salary reduction has begun, in no event will changes to elections or discontinuation of contributions be permitted during the Plan year except to the extent permitted under Internal Revenue Service rulings and regulations and with the County’s Plan Document. Examples of eligible mid-year Change in Status events include: marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, death, over age dependent, loss of student status, the employee’s or employee’s spouse’s reduction in work hours, and loss of spouse’s employment. The employee must submit a request for a mid-year Change in Status event within thirty (30) days of the qualifying event. The Human Resources Chief, Employee Benefits and Services Division, or designee, will authorize changes provided that the change is made on account of and consistent with an employee’s qualifying Change in Status event.
(e)	IRC Section 125 requires that any amounts remaining in an employee’s account at the end of the Plan year must be forfeited. The County will use any forfeited amounts to help defray the Plan’s administrative expenses.
FULL UNDERSTANDING, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter within the scope of representation, and that the understandings arrived at after the exercise of that right are set forth in this Agreement. The express provisions of this Agreement for its duration, therefore constitute the complete and total contract between the County of San Bernardino and SEBA with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. Any other prior or existing understanding or agreements by the parties, whether formal or informal, regarding any such matters are hereby superseded or terminated in their entirety. The County and SEBA for the life of this Agreement each voluntarily waives the right to meet and confer in good faith and waives the right to compel the other party to
Safety - Page 24
meet and confer in good faith with respect to any subject or matter whether or not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement. This section shall not act as a waiver of any reserved County management rights or act as a waiver of SEBA’s right to bargain the impact of the County’s exercise of its management’s rights.
IMPLEMENTATION
This Memorandum of Understanding constitutes a mutual agreement by all members of the Employee Relations Committee to be jointly submitted to the Board of Supervisors for approval. It is agreed that this Memorandum of Understanding shall not be binding upon the parties either in whole or in part unless and until approved by the Board of Supervisors.
Any changes to this Agreement, which do not have specific effective dates, become effective on the date of Board of Supervisors approval.
LAYOFF
Section 1	- Layoff Policy
Whenever possible, loss of employment for regular County employees shall be avoided by transfer, demotion, or temporary work. During the first year following a layoff, laid off employees shall have first consideration for any vacancies in a classification for which qualifications are deemed suitable by the Director of Human Resources.
After one (1) year on the layoff list, the names of employees shall be transferred to the appropriate open or promotional list. The duration of such placement shall not exceed two (2) years.
Section 2	- Definition of Layoff
Layoff is the involuntary separation or demotion of a regular employee without fault of the employee.
Section 3	- Notification
Whenever the appointing authority anticipates a surplus of employees in regular positions, immediate notification to the Director of Human Resources and SEBA shall be made. The notification shall include the anticipated number and classifications of employees to be laid off and a plan for conducting an orderly layoff to reduce adverse effect on employees to be laid off.
Section 4	- Order of Layoff
Layoffs shall be by classifications unless the appointing authority, with the approval of the Director of Human Resources, deems it for the best interests of the service to make reductions in classification first and thereby cause separation from the service only in the lower ranks. The services of all provisional, temporary, and probationary employees in the classification affected within the interested department shall be terminated in that order before any reduction in the regular force. Layoffs among regular employees shall be made on the basis of seniority determined by the employee's current beginning date of continuous service in a regular position with the County of San Bernardino. A regular employee who accepts demotion in lieu of layoff retains layoff rights to his former classification.
Safety - Page 25
Section 5	- Short-Term Layoffs
Layoffs for periods not to exceed fifteen (15) consecutive work days may be made in any order for reasons approved by the Director of Human Resources.
Section 6	- Exception to Order of Layoff
Whenever the appointing authority believes that the best interests of the service require the retention of employees with special qualifications, characteristics, and fitness for the work, the appointing authority may request an exception to the order of layoff. Such requests must be in writing to the Director of Human Resources and must be supported by the appointing authority's reason. A copy of such request shall be submitted to SEBA at that time.
LEAVE PROVISIONS
Section 1	- Sick Leave
(a)	Definition - Sick leave with pay is an insurance or protection provided by the County to be granted in circumstances of adversity to promote the health of the individual employee. It is not an earned right to time off from work. Sick leave is defined to mean the authorized absence from duty of an employee because of illness, injury, pregnancy, exposure to contagious disease, attendance upon ill member of the employee’s immediate family or for a medical, optical, or dental appointment. Such authorized absences may include attendance upon the parent(s) of an employee, not to exceed a total of eighty (80) hours per calendar year. In addition, a maximum of forty (40) hours earned sick leave may be used for bereavement due to the death of persons in the immediate family, or any relative living with the employee. Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, mother, father, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and domestic partner or child of domestic partner, as defined by California Family Code Section 297.
(b)	Accumulation - Employees in regular positions shall accrue sick leave for each payroll period completed, prorated on the basis of ninety-six (96) hours per year, or 3.69 hours per pay period. Earned sick leave shall be available for use the first day following the payroll period in which it is earned. There shall be no limit on sick leave accumulation. This provision deleting the accrual limit of sick leave is for the length and purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding. At the conclusion of this Memorandum of Understanding, the County may elect to remove this provision, at which time the limit on accumulation shall be established at one thousand three hundred forty (1,340) hours. Any leave accumulation in excess of one thousand three hundred forty (1,340) hours prior to election by the County shall remain available to the employee. The minimum charge against accumulated sick leave shall be fifteen (15) minutes. Employees in regular positions budgeted less than eighty (80) hours per pay period shall receive sick leave accumulation on a pro-rata basis.
(c)	Compensation - Approved sick leave with pay shall be compensated at the employee's base rate of pay (including POST incentive pay).
(d)	Administration

Safety - Page 26
(2)	Notice of Sickness - The appointing authority or designated representative must be notified at least one (1) hour prior to the start of the employee's scheduled tour of duty of a sickness on the first day of absence. For employees assigned to 24-hour institutions (e.g., correctional facilities) the appointing authority or designee should be notified at least two (2) hours prior to the start of the employee’s scheduled tour of duty of a sickness on the first day of absence and must be notified at least one (1) hour prior to the start of the employee’s scheduled tour of duty. It is the responsibility of the employee to keep the appointing authority informed as to continued absence beyond the first day for reasons due to sickness. Failure to make such notification may result in denial of sick leave with pay.
(3)	Review - The Director of Human Resources may review and determine the justification of any request for sick leave with pay and may, in the interest of the County, require a medical report by a doctor to support a claim for sick leave pay.
(4)	Proof - A doctor's certificate or other adequate proof of illness shall be provided by the employee in all cases of absence due to illness when requested by the appointing authority.
(5)	Improper Use - Evidence substantiating the use of sick leave for trivial indispositions, instances of misrepresentation, or violation of the rules defined herein shall be construed as grounds for dismissal or such other action as may be deemed proper and necessary by the appointing authority and/or the Board of Supervisors.
(6)	Misconduct - Sick leave with pay may be denied if the absence is found to be due to willful injury, gross negligence, intemperance, improper conduct or willful absence without leave on the part of the employee.
(e)	Workers' Compensation - As provided in Section 4850 of the Labor Code, a Safety Unit employee who is injured in the line of duty is entitled to full salary in lieu of Workers' Compensation benefits and sick leave for a period not to exceed one (1) year. After the employee has used one (1) full year of such 4850 time, said employee may use accumulated sick leave with pay with the approval of the appointing authority to augment temporary disability payments if said employee is still temporarily disabled by order of an accepted physician under the Workers' Compensation sections or until said employee is retired.
(f)	Separation - Unused sick leave shall not be payable upon separation of the employee, except as provided in the Retirement Medical Trust Article.
Section 2	- Annual Leave
(a)	Definition - Annual leave is granted in lieu of any other vacation or holiday leave provisions. Annual leave is a right, earned as a condition of employment, to a leave of absence with pay for the recreation and well-being of the employee. Under unusual circumstances, annual leave may be used for sick leave purposes upon a special request of the employee and with the approval of the appointing authority.
(b)	Accumulation
All employees in regular positions shall accrue, on a pro-rata basis, annual leave time for completed service hours, up to eighty (80) hours per pay period. Such annual leave time shall be available for use on the first day following the pay period in which it is earned, provided an employee has completed 1,040 hours of continuous service from the employee's service date. Employees in regular positions budgeted less than eighty (80) hours per pay period shall receive annual leave accumulation on a pro-rata basis.
Safety - Page 27
Length of Service from Benefit Date	Annual Leave Allowance	Maximum Allowed Unused Balance
After 1,040 and through 8,320 service hours	176 hours	336 hours
Over 8,320 service hours and Through 18,720 service hours	216 hours	416 hours
Over 18,720 service hours	256 hours	550 hours
(c)	Court Holidays
(1)	Employees assigned to the Court Service Bureau of the Sheriff’s Department shall use annual leave for the following court holidays:
New Year’s Day	Thanksgiving
Memorial Day	Day after Thanksgiving
Independence Day	Christmas Day
Labor Day
When a court holiday falls on a Sunday, the next day, Monday, shall be observed as the holiday.
(2)	Whenever an employee is required to work on a fixed holiday, the time will be coded as work time and not charged against the employee’s annual leave bank.
(3)	If an employee does not have sufficient annual leave for the holiday, the employee will use compensatory time off. If the employee has no compensatory time off, the employee will use approved absence without pay. An employee who has been employed less than 1,040 hours and/or did not have the opportunity to accrue sufficient annual leave time will be given the option of working another assignment designated by the appointing authority, using compensatory time off, or taking approved leave without pay. An employee can work the holiday upon request of the employee only if work is available and upon approval by the appointing authority.
(4)	Other court holidays shall be considered regular work days.
(d)	Administration
(1)	Annual leave shall be taken annually at the discretion of the appointing authority, and at such times as will not impair the work schedule or efficiency of the department. The parties recognize that it is the responsibility of the employee to keep track of their own leave balances and to endeavor to keep the leave balance within the maximum allowable unused balance. Every effort will be made to enable employees to take time off to remain below the maximum balance; however, to facilitate scheduling the employee should provide at least six (6) pay periods advance notice of reaching the maximum balance to the appointing authority or designee. No employee, however, shall lose earned annual leave time because of work urgency or during leave of absence under Section 4850 of the Labor Code. If an employee has reached the maximum allowed unused balance due to work urgency or leave of absence under Section 4850 of the Labor Code and is unable to take an annual leave, the appointing authority will notify the Auditor/Controller of the situation and approve one (1) waiver per calendar year of the maximum allowed unused balance for a period not to exceed thirteen (13) pay periods, or in the case of a 4850 leave, not to exceed thirteen (13) pay periods from date the employee returns to duty.
Safety - Page 28
(2)	The minimum charge against accumulated annual leave shall be fifteen (15) minutes or multiples thereof. Annual leave shall be compensated at the employee's base rate of pay, including POST incentive pay.
(3)	Employees not planning to return to County employment at the expiration of an annual leave, except those retiring, shall be compensated at their base rate of pay (including POST incentive pay) in a lump sum payment for accrued annual leave and shall not be carried on the payroll. Retiring employees may elect to use annual leave to enhance retirement benefits or be compensated in a lump sum payment for accrued time, provided that each pay period the employee charges the number of hours in their regular scheduled tour of duty. Terminating employees not covered by the above provisions shall be compensated at their base rate of pay (including POST incentive pay) for accrued annual leave that they were entitled to use as of the date of termination.
(4)	On one (1) occasion during each calendar year, an employee who has utilized eighty (80) or more hours of annual leave during the previous calendar year may elect to convert into a cash payment, at the rate of pay (including Incentive Pay) then in effect, up to forty (40) hours of accrued annual leave.
In order to sell back annual leave prior to termination or retirement, an employee must make an irrevocable election during the month of December, specifying the number of hours to be sold back from the next calendar year's annual leave time accrual. Such election must be made in a single block of not more than forty (40) hours. Once an election is made, the employee must request that the designated number of hours actually be sold back by pay period 25 of the calendar year in which the election is effective, or the hours will be automatically converted into cash in pay period 26.
(e)	Grandfather Bank - Employees who have accrued annual leave (previously
vacation and holiday leave) in excess of that allowed under this Article as of July 14, 1979, shall be allowed to maintain their total balance as of June 2, 1979, provided, however, that any payment of such total balance at the time of retirement or separation shall be based on the base rate of pay in effect immediately preceding June 2, 1979. The employee shall have the option to select whether any use of annual leave shall be charged against time accrued prior to June 2, 1979, or time accrued subsequent to June 2, 1979.
Section 3	- Compulsory Leave
If in the opinion of the appointing authority an employee could be incapacitated for work for physical or psychological reasons, an examination may be required by a physician or other competent authority designated or approved by the Director of Human Resources. If the examination report shows the employee to be in an unfit condition to perform the duties required of the position, the appointing authority shall have the right to compel such employee to take sufficient leave of absence with or without pay, or to transfer to another position without reduction in compensation and to follow a prescribed treatment regimen until medically qualified to return to unrestricted duty.
If an employee temporarily does not possess a job prerequisite, until such time as the deficiency disappears, the appointing authority shall compel the employee either (1) to take a leave of absence with or without pay or (2) to transfer to another position without a reduction in pay; provided that nothing herein shall inhibit the ability of the appointing authority to impose appropriate discipline.
Safety - Page 29
Section 4	- Military Leave
As provided in the California Military and Veterans Code Section 395 et seq., and any amendment thereto, and the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, a County employee, regular, extra-help, or recurrent may be entitled to the following rights concerning military leave:
(a)	Definition - Military leave is defined as the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training (weekend drills), full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which an employee is absent for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty.
(b)	Notice and Orders - All employees shall provide advance notice of military service unless military necessity prevents the giving of notice or the giving of notice is impossible or unreasonable. Where available, copy of military orders must accompany the request for leave.
(c)	Temporary Active Duty - Any employee who is a member of the reserve corps of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Naval Militia shall be entitled to temporary military leave of absence for the purpose of active military training provided that the period of ordered duty does not exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, including time involved in going to and returning from such duty. While on paid status, an employee on temporary military leave shall receive the same vacation, holiday, and sick leave, step advances and benefits that would have been enjoyed had the employee not been absent, providing such employee has been employed by the County for at least one (1) year immediately prior to the date such leave begins. In determining the one (1) year employment requirement, all time spent in recognized military service, active or temporary, shall be counted. An exception to the above is that an uncompleted probationary period must be completed upon return to the job. Any employee meeting the above one (1) year employment requirement shall be entitled to receive their regular salary or compensation, pursuant to Section (e) of this Article.
(d)	Full-Time Active Duty - Employees who resign from their positions to serve in the Armed Forces for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, shall have a right to return to their former classification upon serving written notice to the appointing authority, no later than ninety (90) days after completion of such service. Returning employees are subject to a physical/psychological examination.
Should such employee’s former classification have been abolished, then the employee shall be entitled to a classification of comparable functions, duties, and compensation if such classification exists, or to a comparable vacant position for which the employee is qualified.
The right to return to former classification shall include the right to be restored to such civil service status as the employee would have if the employee had not so resigned; and no other person shall acquire civil service status in the same position so as to deprive such employee of this right to restoration.
Eligible employees are also entitled to the reemployment and benefit rights as further described in the Uniformed Services and Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. Sections 4301-4333. Specifically, a returning employee will receive restoration of original hire and benefit date, salary step, vacation accrual rate, sick leave balance (unless the employee has received payment for unused sick leave in accordance with provisions contained herein), the retirement plan contribution rate and retirement system contributions (provided the employee
Safety - Page 30
complies with any requirements established by the Retirement Board). However, such employee will not have accrued vacation, sick leave, or other benefit while absent from County employment, except as provided in the temporary duty provision.
(e)	Compensation - This provision does not include an employee’s attendance for inactive duty, commonly referred to as weekend reserve meetings or drills. Employees must use their own time to attend such meetings. Should the meetings unavoidably conflict with an employee’s regular working hours, the employee is required to use vacation or holiday leave, leave without pay, or make up the time. Employees who are called in for a medical examination to determine physical fitness for military duty must also use vacation leave, leave without pay, or make up the time. Employees cannot be required to use their accrued leave. Any employee meeting the requirements in (c) and (d) shall be entitled to receive their regular salary or compensation for the first thirty (30) calendar days of any such leave. Pay for such purposes shall not exceed thirty (30) days in any one fiscal year and shall be paid only for the employee’s regularly scheduled workdays that fall within the thirty (30) calendar days.
(f)	Extension of Benefits - The County recognizes the increased requirements of the military due to the current threats facing the United States of America. Employees who are called to active duty as a result of the activation of military reservists beginning in September 2001, and are eligible to receive the thirty (30) calendar day military leave compensation shall receive the difference between their base County salary and their military salary starting on the 31st calendar day of military leave. The difference in salary shall continue until June 23, 2006. During this period, the County will continue to provide the employee the benefits and all leave accruals as was provided prior to such active duty. Retirement contributions and credit will be granted if the employee had enough pay to cover the entire contribution. If the employee does not get enough pay to cover the retirement contribution, no contribution or credit will be given. If upon return from leave the employee complies with all requirements of the Board of Retirement, then the employee shall also receive the retirement pick-up allowed by the MOU. Employees should note that the Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) plan contains a war exclusion.
If the employee becomes eligible for full County payment for the first thirty (30) days of military leave provided in (c) of this Article, the extended payments provided under this Section shall be suspended and shall be continued after the thirty (30) days compensation has been completed.
After June 23, 2006, no compensation shall be paid beyond the thirty (30) day leave period, unless such compensation is expressly approved by the Board of Supervisors.
(g)	Vacation and Military Leave - Employees shall not be permitted to take vacation or other accrued leave in lieu of the military leave provisions provided in Section (c) of the Article. Employees may elect to use accrued leave time, except sick leave, in lieu of the integrated pay in Section (f) of this Article under the following conditions:
(1)	The employee must decline in writing the benefits of Section (f) of this Article prior to the due date of the Time and Labor Report (TLR). The employee must include the dates for which he/she is declining the benefit.
(2)	The employee must use accrued leave time for the entire pay period (i.e., County pay will not be integrated with military pay for partial pay periods).
(3)	Such written declination cannot be revoked or amended at a later date for a pay period for which the TLR has already been submitted.
Safety - Page 31
(4)	Benefits, leave accruals, and pay will be administered per normal procedures for vacation pay; no additional benefits otherwise granted under this Article will be available.
Employees may elect to use accrued leave time, except sick leave, once all paid benefits have been exhausted.
Section 5	- Political Leave
Any employee who is a candidate for public office shall have the right to a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period to campaign for the election. Such leave is subject to the conditions governing special leaves of absence without pay contained herein.
Section 6	- Special Leaves of Absence Without Pay
A special leave without pay for a period not exceeding one (1) year may be granted to an employee who is:
(a)	Medically incapacitated to perform the duties of the position.
(b)	Desires to engage in a relevant course of study which will enhance the employee's
value to the County.
(c)	An employee who has been employed by the County for at least twelve (12) months and who has been employed for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours of service during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave shall be entitled to a leave or leaves of absence, without pay with right to return to the position, for the purpose of birth or adoption of a child and/or care of a child, spouse or parent, as required by the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (California Government Code 12945.2).
(d)	For any reason considered appropriate by the appointing authority and the Director of Human Resources.
Such request must be in writing and requires the approval of the appointing authority and the Director of Human Resources. Upon request, the appointing authority and the Director of Human Resources may grant successive leaves of absence. Leaves of absence without pay may be given to an employee with or without right to return to classification. At the expiration of leaves without right to return, the employees must contact the Director of Human Resources to have their names referred for a sixty (60) calendar day period to all job openings in their classification for reemployment without examination, such time to run concurrently with the one hundred and eighty (180) calendar day period provided in the Reemployment Article herein. The employee must be appointed to a position within this sixty (60) day period or be terminated.
An employee who is pregnant has the right to continue performing the regular duties of her position until a medical authority determines that she is unable to perform those duties. At that time, if requested by the employee, the appointing authority will make every effort to find other duties the employee can perform until she is disabled due to her pregnancy or childbirth.
A pregnant employee who is medically able to perform the duties of her position but who prefers to be reassigned to available duties that are less strenuous and/or less dangerous, may request a reassignment under the conditions listed above. If the appointing authority is unable to find other suitable duties, and the employee prefers a leave of absence to continuing to perform her regular duties, a leave of absence with right to return will be granted.

Section 10	- Witness Leave
Employees in regular positions shall be entitled to a leave of absence from work when subpoenaed to testify as a witness, such subpoena being properly issued by a court, agency, or commission legally empowered to subpoena witnesses. This benefit shall not apply in any case in which the subpoenaed employee is a party to the action, or the subpoena has arisen out of the employee's scope of employment. Witness leave shall not be charged against any accumulated leave balances and shall be compensated at the employee's base hourly rate. This benefit will be paid only if the employee has demanded witness fees at the time of service of the subpoena, and such fees are turned over to the County.
Section 11	- Blood Donations
Employees in regular positions who donate blood without receiving compensation for such donation may have up to four (4) hours off with pay with prior approval of the immediate supervisor for each such donation. This benefit shall not be charged to any accumulated leave; provided, however, that any time in excess of four (4) hours must be charged to accumulated sick leave or be taken as leave without pay. Evidence of each donation must be presented to the appointing authority to receive this benefit.
Section 12	- Failure to Return After Leave
Failure of an employee to report to work at the expiration of a leave of absence shall separate the employee from the service of the County and be considered, in effect, a resignation unless extenuating circumstances can be justified to the appointing authority who may approve additional leave.

Safety - Page 37
OVERTIME
The overtime provisions of this Unit shall be as follows:
(a)	Policy - It is the policy of the County to discourage overtime except when necessitated by abnormal or unanticipated workload situations. It is the responsibility of the appointing authorities to arrange for the accomplishment of workloads under their jurisdiction within the normal tours of duty of employees. The County has the right to require overtime to be worked as necessary.
(b)	7(k) Exemption - The parties agree that employees in this Unit are covered by the
partial overtime exemption set forth at 29 U.S.C. § 207(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Although the County pays overtime compensation to employees in this Unit in excess of what is required by Section 207(k) or any other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the parties agree that the Section 207(k) partial overtime exemption has been adopted and is applicable to FLSA overtime.
(c)	Definition - Overtime shall be defined as all hours actually worked in excess of a regularly scheduled daily work shift, forty (40) hours per week, or eighty (80) hours during a pay period. In designated work locations where the regular work schedule does not call for the employees to work forty (40) hours per week, although it causes the employees to work an average of forty (40) hours per week during a pay period, overtime shall be defined as all hours actually worked in excess of a regularly scheduled daily work shift or eighty (80) hours per pay period. In designated work locations where the regular work schedule does not call for the employees to work at least eighty (80) hours in each pay period, although it causes them to work an average of at least eighty (80) hours per pay period during two (2) consecutive pay periods, overtime shall be defined as actual hours worked in excess of the regularly scheduled daily work shift, or one hundred sixty (160) hours during two (2) consecutive pay periods.
For employees assigned to a twelve (12) hour shift schedule, employees will normally be scheduled to work seven (7) twelve (12) hour shifts in a fourteen (14) day pay period. Overtime for employees assigned to this schedule shall be defined as all hours actually worked in excess of a regularly scheduled daily work shift, or in excess of eighty-four (84) hours per pay period.
All work periods which define overtime based as other than time worked in excess of forty (40) hours are established pursuant to Section 207(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 USC 201 et seq.
All forms of paid leave time as set forth in the Leave Provisions and Employees and Authorized Employee Representatives Articles, plus leaves of absence pursuant to Section 4850 of the California Labor Code, and time spent in meeting and conferring sessions shall be considered as time actually worked for purposes of computing premium overtime compensation. Time spent while attending employee-initiated training shall not be considered as time worked for purposes of computing overtime compensation.
Unless specifically provided herein, “hours worked” for purposes of computing premium overtime shall be consistent with requirements established by the Fair Labor Standards Act and other applicable law.
Any time spent by an employee in a regular position who is required to appear in a court of law arising out of the employee's scope of employment during said employee's regularly scheduled off-duty hours shall be treated as time actually worked. Compensation for required time spent in court as described above shall be granted to an employee only when said employee has actually reported to court. Such employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours time worked or the actual amount of time, whichever is greater. To qualify for such compensation, the
Safety - Page 38
employee must contact the District Attorney's Office no later than 8:30 a.m. on the scheduled day for court appearance to insure that the case is still on the court's calendar. Any time spent traveling to and from court in excess of one (1) hour per occurrence shall be compensated at straight time rates, but shall not be credited as time worked for any other purposes.
When an employee in a regular position returns to active duty at the request of the appointing authority after said employee has been released from active duty and has left the work station, the employee shall be regarded as having worked for two (2) hours or for the amount of time actually worked, whichever is greater. Overtime scheduled in advance shall not be included. Further, employees called back to duty while assigned to on-call duty shall only be compensated for actual hours worked.
When an employee in a regular position reports for active duty at the request of the appointing authority while on Annual Leave or other discretionary leave time off, the employee shall be paid for hours worked in lieu of scheduled leave time.
All overtime shall be reported in increments of full fifteen (15) minutes and is non-accumulative and non-payable when incurred in units of less than fifteen (15) minutes.
(d)	Premium Overtime Compensation - Any employee in a regular position authorized by the appointing authority or authorized representative to work overtime shall be compensated at premium rates, i.e., one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay. Payment for premium overtime compensation shall be made on the first regular payday following the pay period in which such overtime is worked, unless premium overtime compensation cannot be computed until some later date, in which case, premium overtime compensation will be paid on the next regular payday after such computation can be made. In lieu of cash payment, an employee may elect to accrue compensating time off at premium hours. Cash payment at the employee's base rate of pay (including POST incentive pay) shall automatically be paid for any compensating time in excess of one hundred twenty (120) hours, or any hours on record immediately prior to promotion, demotion or termination of employment. Compensatory time off may be taken with approval of the appointing authority at such time as will not impair the work schedule or efficiency of the department but with consideration given to the well-being of the employee.
On one occasion each calendar year, during the pay period which includes April 15, an employee may elect to convert up to forty (40) hours of compensatory time into cash payment at the rate of pay then in effect.
PAY PERIOD
A pay period shall be comprised of a fourteen (14) calendar day corridor. The first pay period under this Agreement shall commence at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, December 14, 2002, and shall end at 12:00 p.m. (midnight) on the second Friday thereafter. Each subsequent fourteen (14) day period shall commence on the succeeding Saturday at 12:01 a.m. and shall end at midnight on the second Friday thereafter. The pay period and work week may be adjusted in accordance with FLSA requirements. The intent of the County and SEBA is to allow for alternative shift scheduling without violating requirements of the FLSA. Under no circumstances shall the right to adjust in accordance with FLSA requirements entitle the County to make such adjustments for the primary purpose of avoiding overtime.
The County may reasonably establish, change, or modify standard days, tours of duty, or shifts for individual positions according to the needs of the service within the established period. Except in instances of law enforcement or staffing emergencies, employees shall be notified personally or by mail by a ranking officer of a shift change no later than forty-eight (48) hours
Safety - Page 39
prior to the time the shift change is to become effective. Projected work shift schedules will be posted two (2) months in advance, subject to change as a result of personnel shortages or emergencies.
Under those conditions where overtime is computed based upon actual hours worked in two (2) consecutive pay periods, as provided in subsection (b) of the Overtime Article, the pay period for such employees shall be comprised of a twenty-eight (28) calendar day corridor, commencing coincidentally with any fourteen (14) day pay period as described above and ending at midnight on the fourth Friday thereafter; provided, however, that the employees working such twenty-eight (28) day pay periods shall be paid on a bi-weekly basis in the same manner as those employees working a fourteen (14) day pay period.
It is recognized that during the term of this Agreement it may be necessary for Management to make changes in the number of hours in a standard day, tour of duty, or shift to meet the needs of the service. Where Management finds it necessary to make such changes, it shall notify SEBA indicating the proposed change prior to its implementation. Where such change would significantly affect the working conditions of a significantly large number of employees in the Unit as defined below; and where SEBA requests to meet with Management, the parties shall expeditiously undertake to meet as provided by Section 3500 et seq. of the California Government Code regarding the impact the change would have on the employees in the Unit.
The phrase "significantly large number" shall mean: (a) a majority of the employees in the Unit, (b) all employees within a division or substation in the Unit, or (c) all employees within a readily identifiable category such as Sergeants or Captains.
PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
It is agreed that, in the absence of an unfair labor practice ruling, SEBA membership dues and insurance premiums for plans sponsored by SEBA shall be deducted by the County from the pay warrant of each employee covered hereby who files with the County a written authorization requesting that such deduction be made. Remittance of the aggregate amount of all membership dues and insurance premiums deducted from the pay warrants of employees covered hereby shall be made to SEBA within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the month in which said membership dues and insurance premiums were deducted.
The County shall not be liable to SEBA, employees, or any other persons by reason of the requirements of this Article for the remittance of any sum other than that constituting actual deductions made from employee wages earned. SEBA shall hold the County harmless for any and all claims, demands, suits, orders, judgments or other forms of liability that may arise out of or by reason of action taken by the County under this Article.
PAYROLL ERRORS
In situations involving overpayment to an employee by the County, said employee shall be obliged to repay the amount of overpayment within the time frame the overpayment was received by the employee in accordance with existing law. Documentation explaining the overpayment and calculations will be provided to the employee at his/her request. Extensions to the period for repayment of the overage may be requested by the employee, subject to the approval of the County’s Auditor/Controller. Extensions will be approved only in the case of extreme hardship and the extended period for repayment will not be longer than one and one-half (1-1/2) times as long as the overpayment period (subject to statute limitations).

PHYSICAL FITNESS AND APPEARANCE
Section 1
The parties agree that the physical, medical, mental fitness and appearance of public safety officers are requirements to perform the duties of the job and instill public confidence in the law enforcement function. They agree that public safety members require special treatment and consideration for the stress, physical demands and appearance expectations of the County and the public. Recognizing these important factors, the parties agree that during the term of this Agreement, the County may require medical, physical ability, appearance and psychological assessments of safety employees, provided the County pays and provides time off without loss of pay for such assessments. Any remedial or treatment action shall be the full responsibility of the employee.
Section 2
The County shall provide at County expense prescheduled annual toxicology tests performed by a County-selected physician for all employees assigned to the Arson/Bomb Squad, the Narcotics Division, the IRNET Division, and employees in the Scientific Investigations Bureau who regularly work with and/or are exposed to dangerous substances.

As such, the County recognizes that the supervisor of said units may authorize up to one (1) hour per shift while on duty as workout time. If it is ordered in writing by the supervisor of said unit, said workout time shall be considered work time, but shall not extend beyond the employee’s scheduled shift.
Section 5
Employees in this Unit, over age 40, may obtain body scan services provided by the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center once every two (2) years, provided that the employee pays for said services. The County agrees to charge employees in this Unit the same fees for these services as is charged to employees in the Exempt Group.
PROBATIONARY PERIOD
The probationary period for positions in the Safety Unit shall be 2,080 hours. The probationary period ends at the end of the day in which the employee has completed the required number of service hours.
The probationary period will be automatically extended for each hour during which the employee is on leave without pay, including absences while receiving disability payments, or on military leave. In situations where the employee is on continuous paid sick leave or is using annual leave in lieu of paid sick leave for eighty (80) or more consecutive hours, or on modified duty for occupational or non-occupational reasons, the probationary period may be extended at
Safety - Page 41
the discretion of the appointing authority. Such extension is in addition to the fifteen (15) pay period extension allowed by the Personnel Rules.
PROMOTIONS
A promotion is the appointment of an employee from one classification to a classification having a higher base salary range. A promoted employee, including an individual promoted into this Unit, shall receive the entrance rate of the new range or approximately five percent (5%) whichever is greater; provided that no employee is thereby advanced in step nor advanced above the top step of the higher base salary range. An employee promoted out of this Unit shall be governed by the Article on Salary Rates and Step Advancements in the Memorandum of Understanding or other applicable document pertaining to the appropriate unit.
PROSPECTIVE LAWSUITS
The parties agree that prior to filing lawsuits, the parties shall formally meet to attempt resolution of the matter in question with the intent of reaching a mutually acceptable solution.
PROVISIONS OF LAW
It is understood and agreed that this Memorandum of Understanding is subject to all current and future applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and the current provisions of the Charter of the County of San Bernardino.

RETIREMENT MEDICAL TRUST FUND
A Retirement Medical Trust Fund will be established for eligible employees of the Safety Unit. Eligible employees are those employees with ten (10) or more years of participation in the San Bernardino County Employees’ Retirement Association (SBCERA); or those individuals who contributed to a public sector retirement system or systems over a ten (10) year period and did not withdraw their contributions from the retirement system(s); or those who receive a disability retirement. Those eligible employees with ten (10) or more years of combined contributions to SBCERA and other public sector retirement system(s) must complete a Prior Service Credit Request form and submit it to the Retirement Medical Trust Plan Administrator for approval. A letter from the public sector retirement system(s) confirming that contributions have not been withdrawn must accompany the form.
The Trust is administered by a Board of Trustees who manage the resources of the Trust Fund and determine appropriate investment options and administrative fees for managing the Trust Fund. The Trustees insure that payments of qualified medical expenses incurred by retirees or their eligible dependents are properly reimbursed. The Trust will establish individual accounts for each participant who will be credited with earnings/losses based upon the investment performance of the participant’s individual account. All of the contributions to the Trust Fund will be treated for tax purposes as employer, non-elective contributions resulting in tax-free contributions for the County. All of the distributions from the Trust Fund made to retirees or their eligible dependents for the reimbursement of qualified medical expenses as defined by the Internal Revenue Codes (including medical and other eligible insurance premiums) will also be non-taxable to the retiree or the retiree’s eligible dependent(s).
The Trust is a Voluntary Employees Benefit Association (VEBA) and will comply with all of the provisions of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
At retirement, all eligible employees will be required to contribute the cash value of their unused sick leave balances to the Trust, in accordance with the conditions described below.

RETIREMENT SYSTEM CONTRIBUTIONS
Section 1	- County Contributions
(a)	Amount of Contribution
The County will pick up a portion of the employee's required contribution to the San Bernardino County Employees' Retirement Association (SBCERA) in the amount of three hundred six dollars ($306.00) per month for all employees.
(b)	Designation of Contribution
The employee must choose to designate the entire employee required retirement contribution as either "employer" or "employee" contributions; then, for each dollar applied, the employee's retirement obligation shall be satisfied in the amount of the actuarial value of that dollar to the Retirement Association as determined by the Board of Retirement; and the employee may not withdraw this contribution from the Retirement Association.
If the employee designates the pickup as "employee" contributions, for each dollar applied, the employee's retirement obligation shall be satisfied in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) and, upon separation without retirement, an employee may withdraw this contribution from the Retirement Association. Upon retirement or separation, all contributions applied under this Section will be considered for tax purposes as employer-paid contributions.
If the employee does not file a designation, the contributions shall be made as "employee" contributions. Employees receiving Retirement System contributions under the Benefit Plan in effect prior to the effective date of this Article shall continue to have contributions under this Article applied (as employer or employee contributions for retirement purposes) in the same manner as previously applied for the employee until a revised designation is made by the employee.
Section 2	- Remaining Employee Contributions
Any employee Retirement System contribution obligations which are not paid by the application of Section 1 of this Article shall be "picked up" for tax purposes only pursuant to this Section. The Auditor/Controller-Recorder shall implement the pickup of such Retirement System contributions under Internal Revenue Code Section 414(H)(2) effective with the earnings paid and contributions made on and after the effective date of this Article.
The County shall make member contributions under this Section on behalf of the employee which shall be in lieu of the employee's contributions, and such contributions shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of reporting and wage withholding under the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code. The amounts picked up under this Section shall be recouped through offsets against the salary of each employee for whom the County picks up member contributions. These offsets are akin to a reduction in salary and shall
Safety - Page 45
be made solely for purposes of income tax reporting and withholding. The member contributions picked up by the County under this Section shall be treated as compensation paid to County employees for all other purposes, including calculation of retirement benefits. County paid employer contributions to the County's Retirement System under this Section shall be paid from the same source of funds as used in paying the salaries of the affected employees. No employee shall have the option to receive the Retirement System contribution amounts directly instead of having them paid to the County Retirement System.
Upon retirement or separation, all contributions picked up under this Section will be considered for tax purposes as employer-paid contributions. Contributions under this Section shall be applied (as all employer or all employee contributions with the same value and restrictions) for Retirement System purposes in the same manner as the contributions under Section 1 of this Article.
Section 3	- Special Provisions
Employees who have thirty (30) years of service credit and no longer make retirement contributions under the provisions of the County Employees' Retirement Law of 1937 shall be paid in cash three hundred six dollars ($306.00) per month effective December 29, 1990.
This Article shall only apply to employees who are members of the Retirement Association and are eligible for participation under the Benefit Plan Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applied each pay period.
Section 4	- 3% at 50 Retirement Formula
The County agrees to adopt a resolution to make Section 31664.1 of the Government Code (3% at 50 Retirement Formula) applicable to eligible members of this Unit on October 1, 2003. The County further agrees to adopt a resolution pursuant to Section 31678.2 of the Government Code to make Section 31664.1 applicable to all prior safety retirement service credit for each eligible employee in this Unit.
The parties agree that upon implementation of these resolutions, the eligible employees in this Unit shall be required to pay an additional 2.5% of compensation earnable, each pay period into the Retirement System, above and beyond the employee contribution rates established by the Board of Retirement on an annual basis.
Implementation of this Section on October 1, 2003, is contingent upon Court approval of the settlement referenced in the Article, “Settlement of Retirement-Related Claims.”
SAFETY EQUIPMENT
The County shall provide the following items of safety equipment upon request to each employee in a regular position hired subsequent to June 30, 1979, required to have safety equipment: handgun, magazine pouch with two extra magazines, ASP and ASP holder, chemical agent and holder, uniform holster, uniform belt with keeper straps, handcuffs and handcuff case, ammunition, off-duty holster, helmet and face shield, and protective vest. The type and make of each item of equipment shall be designated by the County.
Such equipment shall remain the property of the County of San Bernardino and will be returned to the County upon the employee's termination. Employees shall be responsible for loss or damage to such equipment due to their negligence, excepting normal wear.

Section 1
Effective July 8, 2006, a one and one-half percent (1.5%) pay increase shall be applied to the Safety Unit. Effective the first pay period in January of 2007, an additional one and one-half percent (1.5%) increase shall be applied. Effective the first pay period in July of 2007, an additional four and one-quarter percent (4.25%) increase shall be applied. Effective the first pay period in July of 2008, an additional four percent (4%) increase shall be applied. Effective the first pay period in October of 2008, an additional one and one-half percent (1.5%) increase shall be applied. As a result of those increases, the base salary ranges and rates shall be applicable on the dates indicated for classifications in the Safety Unit.
Section 2
For purposes of this Agreement, base salary range shall mean the salary range assigned to a specific classification as provided in Section 1 of this Article. Base salary rate shall mean the hourly rate of pay established pursuant to Section 1 herein or the hourly rate of pay established pursuant to the step placement within the base salary range as provided in this Agreement as appropriate. Salary ranges shall be those provided in Appendix A of this Agreement.
Section 3
The parties, having jointly reviewed and considered all available factors, including those referred to in Section 13.029(e) of the San Bernardino County Code, further agree that the recommended salary ranges set forth herein are consistent with the requirements of Section 13.029(e) of the San Bernardino County Code.
SALARY RATES AND STEP ADVANCEMENTS
New employees shall be hired at step 1 of the established base salary range, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Variable entrance steps may be established if justified by recruitment needs through step 5 with the approval of the appointing authority and through top step with the approval of the Director of Human Resources or designee.
Within the base salary range, all step advancements will be made at the beginning of the pay period in which the employee completes the required number of service hours. However, when an employee reaches the required number of service hours with eighty (80) hours of service in each pay period, the step advance will be made at the beginning of the next pay period. Approval for advancement shall be based upon completion of required service hours in the classification, satisfactory work performance and appointing authority recommendation. An employee whose step advancement is denied shall not be eligible for reconsideration for step advancement except as provided in the Article, “Merit Advancements.”
Completed service hours shall be defined as regularly scheduled hours in a paid status, up to eighty (80) hours per pay period. Overtime hours and time without pay shall not count toward step advancements. Step advancements within a base salary range shall be based upon two (2) step increments for steps 1 through 9 and in one (1) step increments from step 9 to 10. The employee shall be eligible for the first step advancement after completion of 1,040 hours and subsequent step advancements after completion of 2,080 hours, except that the employee must have 2,080 hours of service at step 9 before promotion to step 10.
The Director of Human Resources or designee may authorize the adjustment of the salary step or salary rate of an employee to maintain salary equity within the system, to
Safety - Page 47
prevent undue hardship or unfairness due to the application of any rule or policy, or to correct any salary inequity. The Director of Human Resources or designee may authorize the adjustment of the salary step or salary rate of an employee to correct any payroll error or omission, including any such action which may have arisen in any prior fiscal year.
SENIORITY WATCH PREFERENCE AND ROTATION
Section 1	- General
Commanders may permit employees to request watch rotation period based on seniority preference, for up to fifty percent (50%) of the assigned positions for a watch rotation period. In determining the frequency of rotation and watch assignments, commanders shall take into consideration workload demands and the needs of the station/division.
Section 2	- Administration
(a)	The criteria for seniority, as it relates to watch preference, are length of service in rank and then continuous service with the County.
(b)	Unresolved ties in seniority shall result in the employees rotating in the regular cycle or being assigned to a watch based on the needs of the station/division.
(c)	When a Deputy attains twenty (20) years of uninterrupted service with the Sheriff’s Department, he shall be given preference for days off and shift schedules, except for emergency work demands or employee performance concerns.
(d)	Request for watch preference based on seniority shall be made at least one (1) watch rotation period in advance of the requested assignment. Requests for watch preference based on seniority shall not be considered after the schedule is posted and approved.
(e)	Subject to the workload demands and the needs of the station/division, as determined by the commander, employees assigned to rotating watches six (6) pay periods in duration shall work each watch for at least one (1) rotation during an eighteen (18) month period. Employees assigned to rotating watches four (4) pay periods in duration, shall work each watch for at least one (1) rotation during a twelve (12) month period.
(f)	Seniority preference for watch assignment is not a right and may be denied based on the needs of the Department, including,	but not limited to:

(2)	Emergency circumstances
(3)	Current employee performance concerns

TRANSFER
Where a vacant position exists in the Sheriff's Department for patrol and correctional Deputy Sheriff positions, seniority will be treated as a factor of consideration by the appointing authority, but not the sole, decisive influence.
At the discretion of the appointing authority, new employees who have prior law enforcement experience in other jurisdictions (i.e., lateral entry staff) may be placed in any assignment deemed appropriate by the appointing authority.
TUITION REIMBURSEMENT
During each calendar year of this Agreement, there shall be an annual tuition fund of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00). The fund shall be used for purposes of reimbursing employees in this Unit for tuition and registration fees incurred in connection with job-related education or career development training, which shall include any courses that are either (a) job-related, (b) in the 100 series or above, or (c) necessary to satisfy a job-related or career development degree requirement. Prior to becoming eligible for reimbursement, the course must have been approved by the appointing authority or designee and the employee must have completed the course with a grade of "C" or better or "pass" when taken on a pass/fail basis. Such expenditures shall be authorized to employees in regular positions budgeted more than forty (40) hours per pay period. Specifically excluded from this provision are parking fees, book costs, travel and lodging charges.
Reimbursement will be calculated December 31 of each year of the agreement. Full reimbursement will be applied as long as the fund as described above, is not exceeded, provided that no employee shall be reimbursed more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per year. If the fund is exceeded, reimbursement will be pro-rated. The fund will be administered for all employees in the Unit by the Sheriff's Department.
In the event that claims against the Safety Unit Tuition Fund exceed the annual allowance and the Safety Management Unit Tuition Fund for that calendar year is not exhausted, excess funds from the Safety Management Tuition Fund shall be made available to pay claims for Safety Unit members, provided that no employee shall be reimbursed more than a combined total of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per year from both Unit’s funds.
UNIFORM ALLOWANCE
The County agrees to provide an annual uniform and clothing allowance in the sum of six hundred dollars ($600.00) to employees in this Unit in regular positions on payroll in a paid status as of pay period 24 to compensate for costs associated with uniform and clothing purchase, maintenance, cleaning and replacement.

Effective Date	Amount
July 8, 2006	$625.00
July 7, 2007	$650.00
July 5, 2008	$675.00
Safety - Page 49
Employees on a leave of absence without pay in pay period 24 shall receive the uniform allowance upon return to paid status. Any employee separating from County employment at the conclusion of a leave of absence shall not receive the uniform allowance.
UPGRADINGS
An upgrading is the reclassification of a position from one classification to another classification having a higher base salary range. Whenever an incumbent employee is upgraded as a result of such reclassification, pursuant to the Personnel Rules, such employee's step placement in the new salary range shall be governed by the Article on Promotions.
USE OF BULLETIN BOARDS
The County will furnish adequate bulletin board space where currently available. Only areas designated by the appointing authority may be used for posting of notices. Bulletin boards shall only be used for the following notices:

County equipment, materials, supplies, or interdepartmental mail systems shall not be used for the preparation, reproduction, or distribution of notices, nor shall such notices be prepared by County employees during their regular work time. In cases where SEBA represents more than one (1) authorized employee representation unit at a work location, the space described above will become the bulletin board space for all employees represented by SEBA at that work location.
SEBA campaign posters may be posted on bulletin boards under the following conditions:
