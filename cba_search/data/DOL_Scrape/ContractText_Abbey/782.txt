Re: Bargaining Issues
Dear Mr. McIver.
This letter is delivered to you simultaneously with the execution of the MOA for the 2001-2005 League Agreement.
During negotiations the parties discussed certain issues with respect to the former 144 institutions now represented by the League in these negotiations. We have agreed to continue these discussions with bargaining committees of 1199 Members and management representatives from these institutions and with 1199 and League representatives.
The parties shall recommend to the Trustees of the 1199 Pension Fund for Health Care Employees to waive the reciprocity provisions of the Plan with respect to the Registered Nurse unit at Beth Israel Medical Center and the clerical unit at Lutheran Medical Center and grant all affected Employees in each of these units foil past service credit upon retirement.
In all other places, the Union will support the reciprocity agreement and will not seek additional waivers. The Union and management will take steps to ensure that employees are informed correctly as to pension accruals.
Accepted and Ai

Re: Bargaining Issues
Dear Mr. Rivera:
This is to confirm our mutual understanding that the Trustees of the 1199 Health Care Employees Pension Fund, based on the recommendation of the Fund’s actuaries, will change the wage assumption utilized by the Trustees from 5.25% to 4.5% effective February 1,2002.
As of February 1,2004, the Pension Fund actuary will review the appropriateness of the wage and earnings assumptions and the 6.75% contribution rate. If he/she concludes that any change in assumptions or an increase in rate is necessary, he/she will so .advise the Trustees and make appropriate recommendations to the President of the Union and the President of the League. In the event there is dispute concerning the action to be taken, if any, the issue will be resolved pursuant to the CIPC process.

Exhibit A
1.	Mandatory Mail Order for Maintenance Prescription Drugs
This program requires active & retired members who use certain prescription drugs on a regular & long term basis to have those prescriptions filled, by mail, through the NBF pharmacy benefit manager, Advance PCS, Inc. This program will relieve some members of the need to constantly reorder the drug and to travel unnecessarily. It will help the NBF save resources by purchasing in bulk.
2.	Full Formulary Program
The mandatory full formulary program will be administered through the NBF by if s Pharmacy Benefit Manager Advance PCS, Inc. Among the programs are the following:
i)	Preferred Class. This program works like the NBF*s mandatory generic program. If a member chooses a preferred drug, they will have no out-of-pocket expense. If they choose a non-preferred drug, they must pay the difference in cost
ii)	Class Closure. The Cox 2 class of drugs includes two drugs: Vioxx and Celebrex which most doctors consider equally effective. The NBF will cover only Vioxx. Again, if a member fills a prescription with Celebrex, the pharmacy will contact the doctor to change the prescription to Vioxx. If the member chooses Celebrex, the member is responsible for the full cost of the prescription.
iii)	Class Elimination. The NBF is no longer providing drug benefits in the non-sedating anti-histamine class. This includes Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec. Members have available effective over-the-counter druges, c.g. chlortrimetron.
iv)	Drug Elimination. Migraine medications are eliminated.
In the above programs, the first concern of the NBF is the members’ health and welfare. The three programs have been carefully designed to maximize this result The intervention of a doctor may allow very limited exceptions.
3.	Mandatory Medicare Risk HMO
A mandatory Medicare risk HMO for retirees (currently those in the Health First coverage area of Greater New York). The program will provide full hospital medical, drug, eyeglasses and a limited dental benefit. The effective date is April 1,2002. The program will allow for hardship exemption. It is estimated that in the first year, twenty five percent of the retirees in the coverage area will remain with their current coverage.
The League and the Union will use their best efforts to add additional networks.

It is the intention of 1199. and the LVHH to maintain and improve the NBF’s programs. These and other adjustments are needed to preserve the resources of the NBF to provide its comprehensive health coverage in the face of rising health care costs. The estimated savings from these three and other initiatives are approximately $20 million in fiscal year 2003; $24 million in fiscal year 2004; and $28 million in fiscal year 2005.
4.	Annual Dental Allowance
For each member in the Members Choice Program the Fund will pay up to $3,000 per year for the participants and $3,000 per year for each covered family member.
For participants in non-Members Choice the comparable annual limit continues to be $1,200 per year.
The Fund will continue and expand its case management program.

EXHIBIT A (continued)
INFORMATION SHEET
Under federal law, whether the [Unit or Classification} employees shall be represented by 1199 will be determined by a secret-ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB”), an agency of the U.S. government Before the NLRB will conduct an election, 1199 must demonstrate that at least 30% Of the employees in [Unit or Classification] desire union representation.
1199 is or will be asking employees to sign authorization cards as a way to demonstrate such support, and the NLRB will not conduct an election unless the union has a sufficient number of signed cards. Prior to the election, the NLRB will determine which employees are eligible to vote; however, the majority of those who actualljy vote will determine the result of the election. In other words, 50% + 1 of the employees who actually cast ballots will determine whether or not 1199 shall represent all of the employees in [Unit or Classification].
Each employee has the right to participate or refrain from participating in union activities, including the right to sign or not to sign union authorization catds. [Employer] and 1199 support the freedom of workers to join a union, as well as their right to choose not to do so. [Employer] and 1199 agree that, when employees are making such an important decision, it is essential that they have access to accurate and factual information about the organization that is seeking to represent them, and about what it means to be represented by a union.	’
Employees have the right to distribute literature concerning support for or against union representation on non-working time, in non-patient care areas such as break rooms, cafeteria, parking lots, smoking areas and other places outside the hospital. Employees may talk about whether or not they want to be represented by ai union and workplace issues including wage rates, disciplinary system, employer policies and rules and working conditions in any area under the same terms applicable to any ither private conversation between employees.
In addition to the above, [Employer] and 1199 have agreed to the following rules of conduct governing the union’s organizing:
