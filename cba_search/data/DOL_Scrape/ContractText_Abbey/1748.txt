The current underlying Agreement, which was set to expire on May 31, 2019, is hereby, amended effective June 1, 2019. The terms and conditions of the Amended Agreement are contained herein, and include an extension of the underlying Agreement, which shall now expire on May 31,2022.
ARTICLE I
Union Recognition - Security
(A)	The Associations recognize the Union as the exclusive representative for all employees who come under the jurisdiction of the Union for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment. The words “employee”, “worker”, “millwright”, “members”, and “apprentice” as used herein mean persons in the bargaining unit represented by the Union. The use of any masculine pronoun herein shall refer to either gender.
(B)	The Employer agrees that in the employment of workers to perform the various classifications of labor required under this Agreement, he will not discriminate against applicants because of membership or non-membership in the Union. Each employee shall as a condition of employment become and remain a member of the Union for the duration of his employment after seven (7) calendar days following the beginning of his employment by an Employer covered by this Agreement, or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. No employee shall be penalized by the Employer for defending and upholding the contract provisions. In order to effectuate the operation of this provision, the Employer agree to notify the Union before starting a job.
(C)	The Employer shall not discharge or discriminate against any employee for non-membership in the Union if he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
(D)	In the event the National Labor Relations Act is amended while this Agreement is in force, so that an employee may lawfully be required to become a member of the Union in less than seven (7) days, then such shorter period of time shall immediately become operative notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this Article.
(E)	The Union agrees to furnish competent workers upon the request of the Employer in accordance with this Agreement, provided no violation of the Agreement exists on the part of the Employer. A violation will be determined by the following settlement of dispute procedures.
Settlement of Disputes
(F)	There shall be a Joint Grievance Board, hereinafter called Board, composed of six (6) members; three (3) appointed by the Union
and three (3) appointed by the Michigan Conveyor Manufacturers Association (MCMA) and the Associated General Contractors of Michigan (AGC). MCMA and AGC jointly shall be referred to as the Association. The Association and the Union shall each appoint at least two (2) alternate members who may serve in the absence of a regular member or members appointed by that party.
(1)	The Board shall select a Chairman and a Secretary. When the Chairman is selected from among the Union appointees the Secretary shall be selected from the Association appointees and vice-versa. The Board shall meet upon notice from the Secretary or Chairman. The Board shall consider and decide all grievances relating to conditions of employment or concerning the application and interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between Employer members of the Association, the Employer and the Union. Each grievance submitted to the Board shall be in writing. The Board shall by majority vote, decide grievances within fortyeight (48) hours after the hearing.
(2)	Any grievance that has not been satisfactorily settled in accordance with the provisions of section (1) above shall be submitted to arbitration before an impartial arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the members of the Board. In the event the Board is unable, within five (5) days after such request, to agree upon an arbitrator, the American Arbitration Association shall select an impartial arbitrator from its Labor Panel, and his selection shall be treated as if the selection had been made by the Board. The procedure to be followed in submitting the dispute to the arbitrator shall be determined by the Board. In the event the Board is unable to agree on the procedure, the arbitrator shall follow the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment thereon may be entered in any Court of competent jurisdiction. The compensation and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Association (if the dispute involves a member thereof) or by the Employee and the Union. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.
(3)	The grievance procedures are not intended and shall not be construed as qualifying, or making subject to change, any term or condition of employment specifically covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and shall not apply to any dispute over the terms or provisions to be incorporated in any proposed new agreement between the parties. Furthermore, the grievance procedure shall not be applicable to disputes involving vacation pay or contributions by the Employee to Millwrights Local Union 1102 Fringe Benefit Funds. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Union shall retain the right to take such action, as it deems necessary, including the right to strike, in order to remedy an alleged delinquency in vacation pay or fringe benefit

Failure of the Union, its Local Union or employee to cross any picket line at the Employer’s project site is a violation of this Article.
(B)	In the event that this Agreement expires and a subsequent work stoppage ensues, the Employer and its employees will continue to work since the intent of this provision is to allow maintenance work to continue as a benefit to the client. The wages and fringe benefits in
this Agreement or as approved by the NMAPC will remain in effect for all work covered under the terms of this Agreement until wages and fringe benefits are agreed upon and become effective for the Employer and the Union.

(F)	Any signatory International Union or the Local Union which initiates, participates in, or supports a work stoppage, strike, picketing or other disruptive activity in violation of this Article, agrees to pay liquidated damages as a remedy for said violation, in accordance with Section (G)8 of this Article.
