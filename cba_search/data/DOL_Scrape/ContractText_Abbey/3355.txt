The San Francisco Board of Education and the United Educators of San Francisco recognize their mutual responsibility to work toward the achievement of quality education for all students in the San Francisco Unified School District.
The United Educators of San Francisco and the San Francisco Board of Education have jointly entered into this contract under the Educational Employment Relations Act.

Under this contract, the parties shall continue to pursue their individual interests in a spirit of mutual respect while working cooperatively toward their common goal of quality education for all San Francisco public school students.
UESF/SFUSD Vision Statement
Quality of teaching is the most influential factor in student learning. Nothing matters more to raising student achievement than the knowledge and effectiveness of teachers and those who support them. The District and UESF are committed to building a lasting labor-management relationship at the central administration and all work sites. This relationship must be based on respect, collaboration and open communication. We must focus on attracting and retaining the highest quality certificated staff and paraprofessionals to achieve sustainable improvement in student learning while constructing a District culture that supports the needs of the classroom, honors our rich diversity, and adapts to leadership transitions.

Each school year a teacher may use up to five (5) days each school year of sick leave allowance for immediate family illness. In no event shall said utilization, when combined with immediate family illness provisions of Section 10.2.1.2, above, result in the utilization of more than seven (7) days per year of paid leave for immediate family illness.
A teacher who has accumulated sick leave in the District may make use of such leave while employed as an administrator or teacher of summer school session classes or schools in the same manner as in the regular school year.

Paid sick leave days shall be considered days worked for purposes of movement on the salary schedule.
Absence due to injury incurred in the course of the teacher’s employment shall not be charged against the teacher’s sick leave days. The District shall pay to the teacher the difference between his/her salary and benefits received under the California Worker’s Compensation Act for one (1) year duration, pursuant to the prior bargaining agent’s side letter of agreement, dated September 5, 1983.

A teacher on extended sick leave shall receive his or her own pro rata salary minus the per diem rate of a substitute teacher. See Appendix B for appropriate Sub Dock rate.
A teacher who has exhausted his/her extended sick leave and is unable to return to duty shall be granted unpaid leave of absence for up to one year. Extensions may be granted by the Board of Education. Such a teacher may qualify for Long-Term Disability benefits under the provisions of this contract.
A teacher returning from an extended sick leave of one (1) year or less has the right to return to his/her previous assignment if it has not been filled by a probationary or tenured teacher.
Maternity disability
The District shall provide for leave of absence from duty for any teacher who is required to be absent from duties because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from. The length of the leave of absence, including the date on which the teacher shall resume duties, shall be determined by the teacher and the teacher’s physician. Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment by the District.

10.2.11.1.	Sabbatical leave requirements
10.2.11.1.1.	Service — Sabbatical leaves must be preceded by at least seven
consecutive years of teaching service, all of which shall have been fulltime service as tenured, probationary or long-term substitute status in the San Francisco Unified School District. For contractual employees initially hired by the District on or after July 1, 1998, “full-time service” is defined as tenure track service. Qualifying service shall be construed as being in paid District status for seventy-five (75%) of the teaching days in each school year. Failure to be in paid District status for seventy-five (75%) of the teaching days in any given year due to being on an unpaid leave shall not constitute an interruption in the seven (7) consecutive year period.
10.2.11.1.1.1. Pursuant to Education Code 44969, applicants granted a sabbatical leave
are required by law to render a period of service in the employ of the Governing Board of the district following his/her return from the leave of absence which is equal to twice the period of the leave. The employee will furnish a suitable bond indemnifying the Governing Board of the District against loss in the event that the employee fails to render the agreed upon service. The bond shall be exonerated in event the failure of the employee to return and render the agreed upon period of service is caused by the death or physical or mental disability of the employee.
10.2.11.1.2. Sabbatical leaves for study — A teacher shall complete at least eighteen
(18) semester units of work during a sabbatical year. Not less than seven (7) semester units shall be completed during each semester while on such leave, and no more than two (2) semester units of summer school credit shall be counted. These courses shall be exclusive of correspondence courses. Transcripts or other evidence of completion shall be submitted to the Human Resources Department, Leaves and Separation Unit, within sixty (60) days of the teacher’s return to duty.

Effort should be made to demonstrate that the project is of comparable value to eighteen (18) units of college study. The proposal shall include a description of the final report or work envisioned and the name of the project supervisor. The latter shall be either an administrator in the District or a faculty member at an accredited college or university who has agreed to supervise the teacher’s project.

10.2.11.1.5.	Sabbatical leaves for retraining — A teacher shall comply with the rules governing a sabbatical leave for study. (See Section10.2.11.1.2 above.) In addition, a credential or appropriate certificate in the retraining subject area shall be filed with the Human Resources Department, Leaves and Separations Unit. Since this sabbatical requires attainment of a new credential or certificate and since most credential programs require more academic work than can normally be completed in a single year of study, it is anticipated that applicants for this sabbatical will have already completed a substantial portion of the course work prior to commencement of the sabbatical. Exceptions to the requirement to acquire a credential may be made in areas of need, including but not limited to, computer science, mathematics or science.
10.2.11.1.6.	Abridgment — Sabbatical leaves may be abridged for illness, injury or other good cause.
10.2.11.2. Sabbatical leave applications

10.2.11.2.2.	The percentage of sabbatical leaves granted for a school year shall be the same as the net COLA percentage increase that the District received from the State in the prior year.

Two (2) one-half year sabbaticals shall be counted as a single sabbatical leave for the purposes of this section.
10.2.11.2.3.	Qualifying applicants shall be placed in rank order on a single list according to the length of time since the termination of any previous sabbatical leave, or, if no previous sabbatical leave has been granted, in order of the length of time since the beginning of service as defined in
2001-2004 Teacher Contract Article 10—7	August 6, 2002
Section 10.2.11.1.1, immediately preceding appointment as determined by the District for salary purposes. In the event the cutoff point falls among two (2) or more applicants, each of whom has equal precedence, all of such group shall be approved.

10.2.11.2.	5. In a case of demonstrated need (e.g. a specific college program), a teacher shall have the option to “split” a sabbatical by taking one semester in one school year and another semester a subsequent school year within an overall span of three school years.
10.2.11.2.	6. A partnership sabbatical shall be defined as two (2) teachers who have been partnership teaching and apply to share a one year sabbatical. During the sabbatical year one teacher shall be on sabbatical the first semester and teach the second semester and the other partnership teacher shall teach the first semester and be on sabbatical the second semester.
10.2.11.2.	7. The Chief Administrative Officer shall consult with a committee of teachers appointed by the Union to establish educational standards for sabbaticals.

10.2.11.	4. Return from sabbatical — A teacher returning from sabbatical leave shall return to the school to which the teacher was assigned, or would have been assigned had the teacher not been on sabbatical leave.

10.2.12.	Part-time/partnership teaching
10.2.12.1.	Teachers may apply for part-time or partnership teaching. Part-time teaching shall be defined as less than full-time. Partnership teaching shall mean two (2) teachers sharing one (1) full-time teaching assignment. Parttime and partnership teaching approvals shall not exceed a total of two hundred (200) teachers in a given school year.
10.2.12.2.	Full-time teachers who are subsequently approved for part-time or partnership teaching shall have fringe benefits consistent with full-time teachers and shall accumulate service time as though they were teaching full-time for the purpose of advancing on the salary schedule or becoming eligible for sabbatical leave. Part-time and partnership teaching assignments may be renewed annually upon mutual agreement between the teacher, the Human Resources Department and the site administrator.
10.2.12.3.	Half-time teaching — Half-time teaching schedules shall be arranged by agreement with the teacher and the site administrator, and the Human Resources Department. Daily half-time service for secondary teachers shall mean teaching three (3) periods one semester and being assigned two (2) periods and a preparation period the other semester.

The Board of Education shall fix the effective date of resignation no later than June 30th of the school year in which the resignation was offered. The District shall make a good faith effort to notify the Union within twenty four (24) hours of a teacher’s written offer of resignation unless a teacher affirmatively requests confidentiality.
10.3. Leaves — temporary, categorical and emergency teachers
10.3.1.	Temporary, categorical or emergency teachers shall be awarded sick leave on the basis of five (5) days sick leave per semester of appointment. This allowance may be carried over to future temporary, categorical, emergency, or probationary appointments in the District.

11.1.1.2.	The 184 day work calendar is dependent upon the funding provisions of Education Code Section 44579.1.

11.2.3.1.	The District and Union agree to negotiate on wages and benefits for the 2003-2004 school year.
11.2.3.2.	Child Development Program
As of the 2001-2002 school year the State Department of Education has put the District on notice that it cannot operate this program at a deficit any longer.
If the District is unsuccessful in making the Child Development Program self-sustaining, the consequences imposed by the State Department of Education could be severe. The Union and District (“the parties”) agree that this program is too valuable to lose. The parties also agree that the responsibility for preserving it is a shared responsibility. Therefore, the parties agree to pursue a joint program to increase revenues and stabilize expenses with the goal of making the program self-sustaining by the 20032004 school year. If this goal for the Child Development Program is not achieved, the parties understand that the consequences of that failure will impact bargaining for salaries for the 2003-2004 year and beyond.
The Union agrees to take its fair share of the responsibility for reducing expenses. However, the parties recognize that other stakeholders involved with the Child Development Program must likewise take responsibility for increasing revenues and reducing expenses.
11.2.3.3.	Child Development Program Task Force
The District will form a task force charged to develop recommendations intended to create a Child Development Program that both meets the educational needs of students and the goal of being financially selfsustaining. The Child Development Program Task Force will include a minimum of five (5) UESF members appointed by the Union President.
11.2.3.4.	The Child Development Program Task Force will focus on recommendations designed to increase revenues and reduce expenses in the program.
11.2.3.5.	The District will work to implement Task Force recommendations that are feasible and which meet the economic and program goals of the District during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years.

11.2.3.7.	Effective immediately, for non-credentialed teachers placed on the Pre-1986 Salary Schedule, the District will assist these teachers in applying to an appropriate credentialing program. The Union and District, working through the Living Contract Committee, will monitor this process.
11.2.3.8.	Salary schedules for Child Development Program teachers hired before August 1, 1986.
11.2.3.8.1.	Effective July 1, 2003, salary schedules for teachers hired on or after August 1, 1986, shall become the sole salary schedule for teachers in the Child Development Program. The salary schedules for teachers hired before August 1, 1986, shall be eliminated. Teachers formerly on the PreAugust 1, 1986 salary schedule will be placed on the Post August 1, 1986 Child Development Program salary schedule according to their years of experience and education.
11.2.3.8.2.	Teachers currently paid on the Pre-August 1, 1986 Salary schedules shall continue step and column advancement on the Child Development Program salary schedule for teachers hired on or after August 1, 1986, according to years of experience and education.

15.	Staffing And Assignment
In the interest of effective operation of the schools and equity to members of the bargaining unit, the District agrees that the administration of the transfer process shall be accomplished in the following manner:
15.1.	Definitions
15.1.1.	A transfer, as used in this article, refers to a District action which results in the movement of a tenure-track teacher from one facility to another within the District.
15.1.2.	A vacancy is any vacated or newly created position for which a probationary teacher may be hired.
15.1.3.	Reassignment is a subsequent change from grade level in elementary school; and department to department, or at least 50% change in class subjects assigned at the middle school or high school levels. In the case of an itinerant teacher, it is a change in school assignment or additional school assignments. (See Section 31.9.3 for RSP teachers.)
15.1.4.	A consolidation is an involuntary transfer for the reason that there are more permanent teachers assigned to a site or program than the teacher allocation can support.
15.1.5.	The procedures and timelines listed below shall apply to all consolidated staff (involuntary transferees), teachers returning from long term leave (RFL) and voluntary transfer applicants.
15.1.5.1.	By February 15th, or within fifteen (15) workdays following the release of the official Staffing Allocation sheets by the District, a posting of known positions shall be circulated to all teachers facing consolidation. The provisions of Section 15.5 shall apply.

Any consolidated teacher and any Group A RFL may participate in the voluntary transfer rounds and are guaranteed placement.
15.1.5.3.	By April 1st, or within thirty (30) calendar days following the updated posting pursuant to 15.1.5.2, the posting pursuant to Section 15.3.4.1 shall occur. In years when the spring recess falls in the month of March, five (5) additional days will be added. This posting shall be sent to any consolidated teacher who has not been placed, all Group A and Group B RFL’s and all voluntary transfer applicants. No Group B RFL may be placed in a position for which an unplaced consolidated teacher or an unplaced Group A RFL is credentialed and qualified. Consolidated teachers have priority over a Group A RFL.

15.5.3.	Teachers designated to be consolidated shall have the right to indicate preferences from the list of all anticipated openings as indicated in Section 15.3.3. or subsequent openings. The time limits of Section 15.3.4 shall be waived when appropriate to permit such teachers to interview for open
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Article 15—3
August 6, 2002
positions in lieu of involuntary transfer, e.g., when the District does not notify the teacher until after the deadlines in this section. In filling openings, such teachers shall be given priority over teachers seeking voluntary transfer and over new hires.
15.5.4.	No teacher shall be involuntarily transferred two (2) consecutive years without the existence of special circumstances equivalent to school closure or elimination of program.
15.5.5.	A teacher shall not be consolidated if there is a qualified volunteer available.

15.5.9.	The District shall make good faith efforts to transfer teachers resulting from school closure to the school or schools where the students are assigned as a result of school closure except where the guidelines for racial and ethnic balance in Section 15.5.2 above and qualifications require a different result.

16.0.	Successful implementation of San Francisco’s Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program, described in Article 41, Peer Assistance and Review, and good teaching practice, along with standards previously developed by the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment program, require adoption of a standards-based evaluation system. The District and Union will continue to develop such a system begun during the 1999-2000 school year. Said system shall be based upon the California Standards of the Teaching Profession and may require development of appropriate evaluation forms and modification of the rating scale. Once completed, this effort will require modification of Article 16, Evaluation.
16.0.	1. As part of the Career In Teaching Committee (see Section 18.10) the District and Union shall form a committee of equal representation to develop and recommend modifications to Article 16, Evaluation, that include a standards-based evaluation plan based upon the California Standards of the Teaching Profession. This plan shall include appropriate modifications to evaluation forms and timelines. The plan shall also include implementation timelines. Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the committee’s recommendation either the District or the Union shall have the right to request to bargain on said recommendations. Failure to exercise this right shall result in the adoption of the committee’s recommendation.
16.0.	2. The committee shall be reflective of the District’s grade levels and work assignments as well as have participation by those who have responsibility for standards and evaluation.
16.1.	Both parties agree that the principal objective of evaluation is to assess teacher performance in order to maintain and improve the quality of education in the District. This objective is best met in an atmosphere of mutual respect, shared knowledge of the evaluation process, and trust between the parties to the evaluation.
16.2.	The teacher has the right to union representation at any conference that the teacher deems necessary and shall give the evaluator reasonable prior notice of said representation. Good faith efforts shall be made by all the parties to schedule conferences in a manner that will allow deadlines to be met.

16.6.	The long form evaluation of regularly assigned classroom teachers
16.6.1.	A complete assessment sequence for classroom teachers shall include a preobservation conference between the evaluator and the teacher, a classroom observation, a Written Classroom Performance Report (WCPR), and a postobservation supervisory conference in which the teacher has an opportunity to obtain clarification and feedback from the evaluator.
16.6.2.	These WCPRs shall be submitted to the teacher no later than January 15th if an assessment sequence is to be completed during the fall semester, and May 1st for the spring semester. If either of the WCPRs reflect an unsatisfactory performance or improvement needed, the teacher shall have a third WCPR and associated conferences. The following represents the required minimum number of assessment sequences that should occur for each teacher personnel category scheduled for evaluation and working for a full school year:
Assessment Sequences	
Tenured teachers	1 or 2 per year

The proposed accountability system is predicated upon the following structures: 1) set of district-wide standards that define school quality; 2) a mechanism for measuring the performance of a school according to the districtwide standards; 3) identification of schools that have deficiencies in meeting the standards; 4) support to build school-wide structures to develop plans to address the identified deficiencies; and 5) monitoring of the progress of the school community. This effort will require modification of Article 21, Restructuring, consistent with the guidelines and requirement of the District and State and Federal Governments.
21.0.1. The District and Union shall continue work to develop said accountability system using current structures, including the Labor Management Community Committee.
21.0.2. The District and Union intend to create an accountability system that includes requirements of the accountability systems imposed or required by the Consent Decree, State of California, and the Federal Government.

25.	Union Building Committee
25.1	At the site the duly elected Union Building Committee (UBC), designed to represent both UESF bargaining units, is responsible for implementing and enforcing provisions of this Agreement. The duly elected Union Building Representative shall serve as the chair of this committee.
25.2.	The Union Building Representative at each site represents UESF at that site, represents the site district-wide and serves as liaison between the faculty and the site administration.
25.3.	Roles and responsibilities of the Union Building Committee (UBC)
25.3.1.	The site administrator shall meet at least once a month with up to seven (7) members of the Union Building Committee on matters of contract administration. This committee shall also coordinate site elections to identify representatives for various other functions within the contract. The UBC shall have a place on the agenda at each faculty meeting, and shall have the opportunity to make a brief statement/report on matters of Union concern or business.
25.3.2.	The UBC functions to maintain clear lines of communication between administration and faculty.
25.3.3.	Teacher representatives of the School Site Council (SSC) shall be elected by teachers at the school site in an election designed and conducted by the Union Building Committee (UBC).
25.3.4.	UBC members shall be permitted use for Union business of school reproduction and audio-visual equipment (excluding materials and supplies) at times which do not interfere with or disrupt normal school functions.
25.3.5.	The UBC may schedule meetings before or after the instructional day or at such times that are not in conflict with normal school functions.
25.3.6.	The UBC at each site shall have timely access to all pertinent, non-confidential information available to site administration regarding staffing, assignment, programming, facilities management and planning, staff development, and budgeting, and including timelines and deadlines as set by district administration.
25.3.7.	The UBC shall meet with site administration to share information and ideas with the goal of achieving consensus agreement on matters of mutual concern regarding the operation of the site including staffing, assignment, programming, facilities management and planning, staff development, and budgeting, and including timelines and deadlines as set by district administration, and all other matters pertaining to school policy and operations.
25.3.8.	The UBC serves as a liaison to the Restructuring Council or successor (Article 21, Restructuring).
25.3.8.1.	The UBC shall conduct the election for teacher and paraprofessional positions on the School Site Council or other similar governing bodies.
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Article 25—1
August 6, 2002
25.3.8.2.	The Union Building Representative shall be a member, either elected or exofficio, of any shared decision-making body. The Union Building Committee at a school site is encouraged to work in conjunction with the shared decision-making body as a unified representative body.
25.3.8.3.	In the case of any school identified as a low-performing school by the process described in Article 21, Restructuring, or as part of a District Union collaboration such as the Ford Foundation supported Labor Management Community Committee (LMCC), the UBC shall work with the LMCC to schedule meetings regarding disseminating information and planning, coordinate site activities with the School Site Council, and to conduct any elections by the instructional staff that may be required to approve the proposed site plan.
25.3.9.	In order to promote cooperation and a collegial relationship at the school site, the UBC and the administration are encouraged to work collaboratively.
25.4.	Options for shared decision-making structures
25.4.1.	At each school site there shall be the opportunity to establish a shared decision-making body as described in Article 21, Restructuring. Shared decision-making bodies are crucial for successful implementation of the Weighted Student Formula and accountability programs mandated by state and federal authorities. The decision whether to establish a shared decisionmaking body shall be made by the UBC and administration, together with the faculty at each site.
25.4.2.	The Union Building Representative shall be a member of the shared decisionmaking body, either elected or ex-officio. The Building Representative would fill one of the classroom teacher positions, or other staff positions as applicable. The Union Building Committee at a school site is encouraged to work in conjunction with the shared decision-making body as a unified representative body.
25.4.3.	School Site Councils (SSC) in Stage 2 and Stage 3 restructuring schools
25.4.3.1.	Restructuring Schools Initiative (RSI) and State and Federally Funded Projects have had three options approved by the State Department of Education for operating shared decision-making structures in restructuring schools in the SFUSD. These three options are:
25.4.3.1.1.	Form a school governance/restructuring team that meets the statutory requirements for a school-based coordinated School Site Council (SSC): 50% parents and community members (or 25% parents and community members and 25% students in secondary schools) and 50% school employees, including the principal, a majority of teachers, and classified staff. Each SSC would establish written bylaws for the SSC that would require all stakeholders (teachers, parents, students, administration, classified employees) to come to consensus on major issues before action is taken. A fallback provision if consensus cannot be reached and a decision has to be made also needs to be written into the bylaws. The SSC will recognize the importance of having all existing advisory groups
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Article 25—2
August 6, 2002
and new committees develop and implement restructuring and improvement projects connected to the SSC. These relationships will also be reflected in the site’s SSC bylaws.
25.4.3.1.2	The School Site Council (SSC) and the site Restructuring Council (or other term used by the site) organize separately and maintain good communications with each other. Bylaws of each group reflect the relationship between the two groups and reflect the clear delineation of roles, duties and responsibilities of each group. (As each group operates as a distinct entity but may have overlapping membership, meetings will be scheduled separately but may occur on the same day or evening.)
25.4.3.1.3.	The School Site Council (SSC) and the site Restructuring Council (or other term used by the site) work cooperatively together. Some persons may be members of both. The roles, duties and responsibilities of each body would be clearly delineated. Meetings will be conducted concurrently, but agenda items and meeting minutes would delineate which items were within the scope of the entire group and which were within the scope of the SSC only. As meetings progressed, each agenda item would be discussed with the entire group, but for those items limited to the SSC, only those SSC members would participate in the actual decision-making. All of the SSC’s legally-mandated responsibilities will be preserved under this model.
25.4.3.2.	The intent of providing these options for restructuring schools is to enable schools to have some flexibility in developing shared decision-making structures at their sites, recognizing that the SSC has legal authority for School Based Coordinated Programs. An SSC in a Stage Two and Stage Three restructuring school expands its responsibility over the district-based program through its involvement in RSI, thereby eliminating the need for two governance councils (Section 25.4.3.1.1). If it is preferable at the site to have two governance councils, the models described in Sections 25.4.3.1.2 and 25.4.3.1.3 are available. See Appendix C.
25.4.4.	Items in Section 25.4.3 are not mandatory subjects of negotiations and therefore are not subject to the grievance process.

26.1.5.4.	Consider and recommend to the Superintendent and Union President transfers of individual teachers between schools if reason is shown without regard to Article 15, Transfer. This process is not meant to substitute for the rights and responsibilities of the parties set forth in Article 16, Evaluation,
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Article 26—1
August 6, 2002
and/or Article 30, Discipline. The decision to approve each recommendation for transfer shall be made by consensus of the Superintendent and Union President. Transfers under this subdivision may be voluntary or involuntary, and shall not be grievable. Such transfers shall not impair the transfer rights of other teachers, or any transfer rights of the District.
26.2.	All existing joint subcommittees and task forces and other work groups under this Agreement shall continue under the aegis of the Living Contract Committee. The Living Contract Committee shall have the power to consolidate, reconfigure the membership, modify the charge, tasks, and term of joint subcommittees.
26.3.	Budget and Fiscal Consultation: Effective July 1, 2002, the District shall meet with the Union to provide the Union with updates and information of the status of the District’s budget throughout the fiscal year. The checkpoints for these information exchanges shall be tied to the First Interim Report, the Audit Report, and the Second Interim Report.

26.4.1.	Within a reasonable time of written request from the Union, the District shall consult with the Union on the definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, the standards and criteria for academic freedom, revisions to Board policies regarding student discipline, the improvement of counseling and library services, and the selection of textbooks to the extent such matters are within the discretion of the public school employer under the law.
26.4.2.	Subsequent meetings, if necessary, shall be scheduled by mutual agreement at reasonable times and places.
26.4.3.	Consensus reached upon these topics may be incorporated into District policies, regulations, rules or guidelines.
26.5.	Subject matter and grade level consultation: Subject matter and grade level joint committees of the Union and the District (to include, but not be limited to: Child Development Program, Substitutes, Elementary, Middle School, High School, Multilingual, Counselors and Special Education) shall meet on a regular basis to discuss educational issues and concerns. These joint committees shall be comprised of UESF Executive Board members and District central office administrators appropriate to the subject matter or grade level and other appointees of the UESF President and the Superintendent. These meetings shall be scheduled at mutually acceptable times.

27.	Child Development Program
27.0.	The District and Union share the goal of building a program that offers a full range of educational experiences to the children in the Child Development Program. The current structure of the program makes it difficult to provide the best services for children and the best professional responsibilities for teachers and paraprofessionals. The District and Union shall work to develop possible modifications to the structure of the Child Development within the historic fiscal limitations of the Child Development Program’s funding mechanisms.
27.0.	1. The parties shall also work together to change the funding mechanisms to provide additional revenue.
27.1.	The District and the Union agree that the Child Development Program makes a valuable contribution to the District’s educational program and to the needs of the San Francisco community and recognize these programs as integral parts of the District. However, the parties recognize that in bargaining Article 27, Child Development Program, the Union and the District were severely limited by the elimination of the permissive tax levy for this program and that the subsequent under funding of this program by the State has necessitated change and may continue to do so.

Article 27—1
August 6, 2002
teachers to exercise their transfer rights under Article 15, Staffing And Assignment.
27.5.4.	Teachers holding two part-time positions
27.5.4.1.	The District shall establish a goal to identify a total of sixteen (16) part-time positions that can be combined into eight (8) full-time positions of 1.14 each. The rights and benefits of the teachers filling these positions shall not exceed those of a teacher working a FTE of 1.0. Tenure-track part-time teachers may apply for these positions.
27.5.4.2.	Selection for the second part-time position shall be based on current personnel practice as established in Article 15 Staffing and Assignment.
27.5.4.3.	Teachers serving in a second part-time position shall be paid according to salary schedules listed in Appendix B for said position and at his/her regular step placement.

27.10.4.1.	On September 1st, February 1st, and June 1st, of each year, site managers shall conduct a poll among all part-time and full-time teachers as to each teacher’s interest in working substitute hours (those hours for which no substitute teacher has been centrally assigned for an absent teacher). Teachers who are interested in working additional hours shall submit a written statement to their site manager.
27.10.4.2.	The site manager shall post a list showing the names and job status (parttime or full-time) of teachers interested in working additional temporary hours.
27.10.4.3.	As such hours become available, the site manager shall normally offer the work to part-time teachers on the list on a rotating basis prior to offering the work to full-time teachers. Part-time teachers declining an offer to work shall be placed at the bottom of the rotation list.
27.10.5.	Augmented hours — Part-time teachers

The Program shall have three distinct components: New Teacher Component, second year teacher assistance, and the Permanent Teacher Intervention Component. This article shall supersede Article 16, Evaluation, of the SFUSD/UESF contract for teachers participating in the PAR Program.
41.1.1.	Definitions
41.1.1.1.	PAR Panel: The Program shall be governed by the PAR Panel composed of four (4) District members selected by the Superintendent and five (5) UESF members selected by the Union.
41.1.1.2.	Peer Coach: The teacher selected and directed by the PAR Panel to assist and review teachers will be assigned to the Program to work exclusively with beginning teachers and/or teachers subject to intervention.
41.1.1.3.	Lead Coach: This Peer Coach will be assigned specific duties in addition to those of a Peer Coach. These tasks will primarily be related to the smooth functioning of the program. In order to accomplish these tasks the Lead Coach will be provided a reduced caseload.
41.1.1.4.	Participating Teacher: A teacher who is participating in the Peer Assistance and Review program.
41.1.1.5.	New Teacher: A teacher new to the District and occupying a position for which a probationary teacher could have been employed.

41.1.1.11.	Pre-Intern and Intern Programs: Partnerships between the District,
Union and Universities designed to provide a rigorous and supportive path to a full credential.
41.1.1.12.	Evaluation: Evaluation is the process, reflective of mandated state
requirements and best professional practices, described in Article 16, Evaluation, of the UESF-SFUSD collective bargaining agreement. The Written Summary of the evaluation cycle is placed in the teacher’s personnel file. The principal is responsible for conducting evaluations.
41.1.1.13. Review: The review process, while driven by the same goals as the
evaluation process, involves much more interaction and closer scrutiny; it is central to the Program. The review process requires the PAR Panel to examine documented interactions between the teacher, Peer Coach, and principal, reflect with other Panel members, and discuss the recommendations with the Peer Coach and principal. The review process requires goal setting, performance objectives, close assistance, monitoring progress, and detailed record keeping. The PAR Panel then approves a summary report that is placed in the teacher’s personnel file. At the conclusion of the review process, usually one year, the Panel shall report that 1) the teacher ”Meets Standards” in the California Standards of the Teaching Profession and, if a New Teacher, is suitable for reelection; 2) the teacher ”Does Not Meet Standards” that further assistance and review is not warranted, and that either non-reelection or termination is possible; or 3) in special circumstances, an extension for another year in the program is warranted.
41.1.2.	Program Phase-in
41.1.2.1.	Successful implementation of the Program requires adoption of a standards-
based evaluation system. The District and Union will develop such a system during the 2002-03 school year for implementation beginning with the 2003-04 school year. Said system shall be based upon the California Standards of the Teaching Profession and may require development of appropriate evaluation forms and modification of the rating scale. This effort will require modification of Article 16, Evaluation.
41.1.2.1.1.	The District and Union shall form a committee of equal representation to
incorporate a standards-based evaluation plan, based upon the California Standards of the Teaching Profession, into Article 16, Evaluation. This plan shall include appropriate modifications to evaluation forms and timelines. The plan shall also include implementation timelines.
41.1.2.1.2.	The committee shall be reflective of the District’s grade levels and work
assignments as well as have participation by those who have responsibility for standards and evaluation.
41.1.2.2.	The District and the Union, by mutual agreement, may identify the schools
in which New Teachers participate in the Peer Assistance and Review program.

41.4.13	. Notwithstanding 41.4.12 above, and while the term of this assistance shall normally be for one school year, the intervention may be extended to part of a second year if the PAR Panel believes progress is being made, although the permanent teacher may not have yet “Met Standards.”

41.6	. Miscellaneous Provisions

41.6.4	. Funds shall also be set aside to allow the Peer Coaches release days and/or conferences as developmental tools with the teachers assigned to the Program.

C.	Appendix C: Faltus - Byrd Memo
March 24,1994
To: Restructuring School Communities
From: Mary Welsh Byrd, Program Director State and Federal Funded Projects (SFFP) Rudi Faltus, District/Union Coordinator Restructuring Schools Initiative (RSI)
Re: Restructuring Shared Decision-Making Structures and School Site Councils HISTORY
This memo provides guidance for developing and implementing site shared decision-making (sdm). structures in restructuring schools within the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). The sdm structures in schools are guided by both the Restructuring Schools Initiative (RSl), and the School-Based Program Coordination Act. RSI is a product of the 1989 teachers’ contract between the San Francisco Unified School District and the teachers’ union, the United Educators of San Francisco. That contract set up machinery to involve key stakeholders at both the site and district levels in collectively increasing student achievement. The district-wide structure for determining the district’s restructuring program and priorities and supporting needs of restructuring schools is the Restructuring Council.
The School-Based Program Coordination Act was implemented in (California in 1981 to assist schools in coordinating their state programs to meet the needs of the whole child, and to involve key stakeholders in planning and implementing supplemental programs funded by the State at the school site. The School-Based Program Coordination Act enabled schools to use up to eight days of instructional time per year for professional development. The first School-Based Coordinated Program (SBCP) schools in the SFUSD were the Stage Two and Stage Three restructuring schools, which established coordinated programs in the 1991-92 school year.
SDM STRUCTURES
An important component of both the Restructuring Schools Initiative (RSI) and the School-Based Program Coordination Act is the establishment and use of sdm structures involving all of the key members of the school community (administrators, teachers, parents, classified staff, and students) to determine what needs improvement or revision, and then to make the changes necessary to improve student learning. Authority for shared decision-making regarding district programs is derived from RSI. Authority for shared decision-making regarding state supplementary programs is derived from the School-Based Program Coordination Act.
The sdm structure is the legally responsible decision-making structure of the school in Stage Two and Stage Three restructuring (RSI) schools. Schools develop different names to identify their site sdm structures. All members of the staff and school community members (administrators, teachers, classified staff, students, parents, community organizations, etc.) should be involved in work groups reflecting all of the work that is important and needs to be done. The sdm structure acts as the coordinating body, reflecting all of the needs, plans and activities of the working groups. The sdm structure develops processes among itself or for involving others in prioritizing needs and plans. Within SFUSD, the onesite (school) plan is the vehicle for expressing programs and budget allocations for the district-based and supplemental programs at the site. A major piece of the work of the sdm structure, therefore, is planning and developing this one-site
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Appendix C - 1
August 6, 2002
plan, involving the total school community. The sdm structure in a restructuring school is the body responsible for decisions made by the school community, replacing the principal alone.
DOCUMENTATION
The following guiding documents referred to in this memo should be on the school site. These documents guide the intent, composition, and processes of sdm:
•	UESF Contract (1992-1995)
•	Guidelines for 1993-94 for Improving Student Learning Through Restructuring, provided by RSI
•	School-Based Coordinated Programs (SBCP) Packet, provided by the SFFP Department, which includes the School Based Program Coordination Act, Program Advisory (June 27, 1990), Program Advisory (March 23, 1988), and a booklet, School Site Councils: Their Composition, Role, and Responsibilities (CA Department of Education, Nov. 1991 )
•	WAD notices
This memo is intended to highlight and clarify some areas of confusion and to provide information regarding some of the local peculiarities we experience. It is not meant in any way to substitute for a thorough reading and continually growing understanding of the above documents.
STRUCTURAL OPTIONS
RSI and the SFFP have had three options approved by the State Department of Education for operating sdm structures in restructuring schools in the SFUSD. These three options are:
Option 1: Form a school governance/restructuring team that meets the statutory requirements for a school-based coordinated School Site Council (SSC): 50% parents and community members (or 25% parent and community members and 25% students in secondary schools) and 50% school employees, including the principal, a majority of teachers, and classified staff. Each SSC would establish written bylaws for the SSC that would require all stakeholders (teachers, parents, students, administration, classified employees) to come to consensus on major issues before action is taken. A fallback provision if consensus cannot be reached and a decision has to be made also needs to be written into the bylaws. The SSC will recognize the importance of having all existing advisory groups and new committees develop and implement restructuring and improvement projects connected to the SSC. These relationships will also be reflected in the site’s SSC bylaws.
Option 2: The SSC and the site Restructuring Council (or other term used by site) organize separately and maintain good communication with each other. Bylaws of each group reflect the relationship between the two groups and reflect the clear delineation of roles, duties and responsibilities of each group. (As each group operates as a distinct entity but may have overlapping membership, meetings will be scheduled separately but may occur on the same day or evening.)
Option 3: The SSC and the site Restructuring Council (or other term used by site) work cooperatively together. Some persons may be members of both. The roles, duties and responsibilities of each body would be clearly delineated. Meetings will be conducted concurrently, but agenda items and meeting minutes would delineate which items were within the scope of the entire group and which were within the scope of the SSC
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Appendix C - 2
August 6, 2002
only. As meetings progressed, each agenda item would be discussed with the entire group, but for those items limited to the SSC, only those SSC members would participate in the actual decision-making. All of the SSCs legally-mandated responsibilities will be preserved under this model.
The intent of providing these options for restructuring schools is to enable schools to have some flexibility in developing sdm structures at their sites, recognizing that the SSC has legal authority for SBCPs. An SSC in a Stage Two and Stage Three restructuring school expands its responsibility over the district-based program through its involvement in RSI, thereby eliminating the need for two governance councils. If it is preferable at the site to use Option 2 or Option 3, these options are also available. COMPOSITION
Stage Two restructuring schools develop a shared decision-making (sdm) structure to involve key stakeholders in collectively planning, developing, implementing, and assessing district programs, processes, and budgets at the site. These sdm structures work within district processes unless waivers to the regular process are obtained. These sdm structures derive their authority from the Restructuring Council which was created through the UESF contract. The specific composition of the structure is to be determined by the site, and is guided by the following contract language:
21.2.3. Participation in the process will be open to all with responsibility for student outcomes, such as teachers, united support personnel, administrators, classified staff, parents, students, and others, as determined by the site. (UESF Contract, Article 21)
21.2.7.	The Union Building Committee will serve as the initial conduit to the process of restructuring. A shared decision-making structure must be established to include teachers, united support personnel, the UBC representative, administrators, parents, and others as determined by the site. (UESF Contract, Article 21, Restructuring.)
SBCPs require a SSC to develop the school plan for using the supplemental resources to increase student understanding of and success in learning the core curriculum. It is also responsible for the accompanying budget(s). The required composition of the SSC is described below:
Education Code Sections 52012, 52852, and 54724 require that a school site council be established at each school that participates in SIP, SBCP or SB 65 and sets forth the following composition of that council.
•	The council shall be composed of the principal and teacher representatives selected by teachers at the school; other school personnel selected by other school personnel at the school, parents of pupils attending the school who are selected by such parents; and, in secondary schools, pupils selected by pupils attending the school.
•	At the secondary level the council shall be constituted to ensure parity between (a) the principal, classroom teachers and other school personnel; and (b) equal numbers of parents or other community members selected by parents and pupils.
•	At both the elementary and secondary levels, classroom teachers shall comprise the majority of persons represented under category (a). (School Site Councils: Their Composition, Role and Responsibilities, P. 10)
The major principle and intent of both RSI and SBCP is inclusion of key stakeholders in
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Appendix C - 3
August 6, 2002
the shared decision-making process. If the SSC is used as the shared decision-making structure for a restructuring school, the following points need to be kept in mind:
•	The principal has to be on the SSC.
•	There should be at least three other than classroom teacher employees in the other employee categories: at least one representing united support personnel (instructional aides, community relations specialists and security aides), at least one representing Local 790 classified employees (secretaries, custodians, cafeteria workers, etc) and at least one representing other non-administrative certificated employees who are not classroom teachers (counselors, resource teachers, librarians, etc.). This assumes, of course, that there are people in all of these roles at the site.
•	A Union Building Committee (UBC) representative needs to be on the SSC. If the UBC representative is the Building Rep, he/she would not need to be elected to the SSC, as the Building Rep has already been elected by peers. The Building Rep would fill one of the classroom teacher positions, or other staff positions as applicable. Students in elementary schools would serve on the SSC on the parent and community side, if desired. Student participation in middle and high schools is required by the SBCP, and is to be a quarter of the total number of members. The number of student representatives in elementary school should be less than the number of parent and community representatives, so as not to diminish the number of parent and community representatives significantly.
•	The SSC composition is proportional, but the site has flexibility in determining numbers and roles that need to be represented within the state-defined composition. Reaching consensus on the numbers, and understanding the differences between a SSC for SIP, SB 65 SBCP and a restructuring school is critical.
•	The Faculty Advisory Council, School Advisory Committee, Bilingual Advisory Committee, PTSA, Student Council, etc. all represent constituent voices that need to be heard.
SELECTION AND REPLACEMENT OF MEMBERS
Democratic principles need to be used in electing/selecting members of site shared decision-making structure(s). If the SSC is used as the shared decision-making structure for a restructuring school, the following points need to be kept in mind:
•	There are no statutory requirements that specify the process that a school must utilize to select or replace members on the SSC beyond the requirement that each category of the council must select its own members. Whatever method a school utilizes to select and replace members on the SSC, that procedure should be known to all members of the community, and it should allow for all members of each category represented on the SSC to have a fair and equal opportunity to nominate and select eligible persons, including themselves, for membership on the SSC. (School Site Councils: Their Composition, Role, and Responsibilities, p. 12)
•	If the UBC representative is the Building Rep (UESF), the Building Rep does not need to be elected to the SSC, as the Building Rep has already been elected by peers. “Section 1. The Building Representative shall be the representative of UESF in a school, center, or other unit, and shall serve as liaison between the members therein and the UESF. a. Where appropriate, a school, center, or other unit may have a Building Representative for certificated UESF members and a Building Representative for USP members of UESF. In such cases the Building

Representatives shall be elected by the certificated UESF members and the USP UESF members respectively. Section 2. Building Representatives shall be elected annually by the members in each school, center, or other unit. Should a Building Representative not be elected, the Executive Board may appoint a Building Representative to serve until an election is held.
Section 4. The Building Representative shall be the chairperson of the Union Building Committee (UBC).” (UESF bylaws, Article 7, p. 11)
•	It can be appropriate to move members onto the SSC from other advisory committees if they have been elected by their peers if the group is in agreement. For instance, teachers elected to a Faculty Advisory Council by teachers can serve on the SSC, students elected to a Student Council by students can serve on the SSC, etc.
•	Reaching consensus on the numbers of representatives, criteria for representatives, nomination process and election procedures or selection process among the staff and student community is recommended.
•	SFFP guidelines for parent and community member elections published in the WAD are important and assist in keeping the school in compliance with state and federal regulations.
OPERATING PROCEDURES
Democratic principles need to be used in operating the site sdm structure(s). If the SSC is used as the sdm structure for a restructuring school, the following points need to be kept in mind:
•	Consensus of the sdm council members on important decisions is necessary. The definition of consensus always includes the need for a fall-back democratic strategywhen consensus cannot be reached. Consensus is:
A systematic process used by a group to make restructuring decisions which everyone can support. A consensus decision has been reached when:
1)	Each participant agrees that he or she has had an equal opportunity to influence the decision; and
2)	All group members agree to support the decision though it may not be everyone’s first choice;
3)	Everyone is committed to the decision as if it were the first choice of all group members and agrees to support that decision with their constituencies;
4)	No one raises an objection when the group leader calls for consensus approval of the decision. Consensus is not appropriate for every decision made at a school. Each school must determine what decisions are most appropriate for consensus and which should be made through other decision-making processes. (Guidelines for 1993-94 for Improving Student Learning Through Restructuring, Appendix, page 1)
•	Bylaws created at the site by the members of the sdm structure or a representative group of sdm structure members and other staff and school community volunteers control the specific operating processes, composition of the sdm structure, structures for involvement of the total school community, scope, responsibilities, linkages with other groups, domains of decision-making, work structures, development and timeline of the one-site (school) plan, etc.
•	Bylaws of the sdm structures, if there is a SSC and another governance structure, need to reflect the relationships, roles, functions, scope of each body.
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Appendix C - 5
August 6, 2002
•	Bylaws need to reflect what the school community is doing and thinking.
SCOPE OF AUTHORITY
Authority for shared decision-making regarding district programs is derived from Restructuring Schools Initiative (RSI), and authority for shared decision-making regarding state supplementary programs is derived from the School-Based Program Coordination Act. The sdm structure, therefore, derives its authority from both the SFUSD and the California State Department of Education. The intent of both the district and the state is to shift authority to the school site. As restructuring schools in SFUSD, the sdm structure becomes the decision making entity for the school.
•	If it is not against the law or rules (Ed Code, Board Policy, Union Contract, administrative regulations), it can be done. If it is against the current law or rules and it makes real educational sense to do it, a waiver can be applied for. “Restructuring plans as provided for in this article will operate within legal mandates, economic opportunities, Board of Education provisions, and requirements of the Union contract, unless appropriate waivers are obtained upon mutual agreement.” (UESF contract, Article 21, Restructuring.)
•	Waivers to the Ed Code, Board Policy, Union Contract and administrative regulations are initiated by the site through the Restructuring Council. Restructuring plans that require changes in laws or rules should be sent to the RSI office, and will be forwarded to the Restructuring Council and/or other appropriate bodies.
•	Bylaws of the site sdm structure should reflect how decisions will be made at the site including the types of decisions, who will make what decisions (domains of decision-making), timelines for decisions recognizing district timelines for mandated decisions, etc.

D.	Appendix D: Restructuring
21.1	. Restructuring is not accomplished quickly or easily. Continued success is dependent on the support and participation of those involved in the process at the school site and on the District level. Resources and staff released time, including that provided by law, are necessary components of restructuring and shall be mutually determined by the Union and the District.
21.1.1	. The District and Union agree that by working together they can continue to have a powerful and positive effect on the improvement of the educational program for all San Francisco Unified School District students. Restructuring is a process for moving toward this end through shared decision-making among those directly responsible for student performance.
21.1.2	. Shared decision-making is a process whereby teachers, united support personnel, administrators, classified staff, parents, students, and others, as determined by the site, can collaborate in identifying areas in need of improvement and in developing solutions that will enhance the learning opportunities for all students.
21.1.3	. The parties recognize that the most important interactions that affect student performance are those between instructional staff and students. Instructional staff must be able to share in decisions at the school site if they are to share the responsibility and accountability for the success of the school.
21.2	. In order to provide the maximum opportunity for success in District-wide restructuring, the Union and the District have developed the following guidelines:
21.2.1	. Dissemination of information designed to develop an understanding of restructuring is essential.
21.2.2	. Restructuring will not be imposed but allowed to evolve on a voluntary basis. Since site specific plans may be developed for restructuring, no single model can be specified.
21.2.3	. Participation in the process will be open to all with responsibility for student outcomes, such as teachers, united support personnel, administrators, classified staff, parents, students, and others, as determined by the site.
21.2.4	. The process of consensus decision-making or other democratic decisionmaking process as determined by each site will be utilized at all levels of restructuring.
21.2.5	. Restructuring plans as provided for in this article will operate within legal mandates, economic opportunities, Board of Education policy provisions, and requirements of the Union contract, unless appropriate site specific amendments, including waivers of legal mandates, economic opportunities and Board of Education Policy, are obtained upon mutual agreement.
21.2.6	. Contract language on restructuring will enable the process to evolve. Other forms of agreements outside of the contract may facilitate the process of restructuring. One form may be a trust agreement between the District and the
2001-2004 Teacher Contract
Appendix D - 1
August 6, 2002
Union. Another may be a multilateral agreement whereby the District and the Union jointly enter into a contract with other interested parties.
21.2.7	. The UBC will serve as the initial conduit to the process of restructuring. A shared decision-making structure must be established to include teachers, united support personnel, the Union Building Representative, administrators, parents, and others, as determined by the site in fulfillment of District, State and Federal guidelines. The construction of this structure shall clearly describe the scope of authority as well as a delineation of roles and responsibilities of the constituent parties.
21.2.8	. Site governance structures. See Article 25, Union Building Committee.
21.3	. Restructuring Council — The Union and District recognize that the enabling structure for shared decision-making, as originally defined in the 1989-92 teachers’ contract, has evolved into the single body known as the SFUSD Restructuring Council.
The Union and the District recognize that those most directly involved in improving student performance are a necessary and integral component of all restructuring efforts and should be represented on the Restructuring Council.
21.3.1	. The Restructuring Council shall be comprised of the following members:
21.3.1.1	. The Union President and the Superintendent of Schools.
21.3.1.2	. Nine (9) representatives of the Union, selected from teachers and united support personnel, appointed by the Union President.
21.3.1.3	. Nine (9) representatives of the District appointed by the Superintendent of Schools.
21.3.1.4	. Additional membership as determined by the Restructuring Council.
21.3.2	. The responsibilities of the Restructuring Council shall be to:
21.3.2.1	. develop mission, goals, and operating procedures for the Restructuring Council;
21.3.2.2	. promote the concepts of site-based shared decision-making at all sites as an integral component of restructuring;
21.3.2.3	. provide guidelines to sites for restructuring, including shared decisionmaking and teacher professionalization;
21.3.2.4	. provide direction and assistance to sites participating in restructuring;
21.3.2.5	. approve and monitor site restructuring plans;
21.3.2.6	. conduct on-going evaluations of restructuring efforts;
21.3.2.7	. develop, implement, and monitor the plan for District-wide restructuring;
21.3.2.8	. develop recommendations for Board of Education consideration;
21.3.2.9	. other responsibilities as may be determined.
21.4	. The parties agree that restructuring is an evolving process. By mutual agreement, changes in the provisions contained in this article may be effected.

Peer Assistance and Review
and
Career in Teaching Committee 1999-2000 School Year
It is the sincere belief of the parties that the quality of teaching is the most significant factor in student achievement. The District and Union are committed to a collaborative quest for establishing and maintaining the highest standards for the teaching profession. It is our belief that the pinnacle of teaching can be achieved only through a process of reflection, analysis and collaboration with peers. We will implement Teaching Standards that reflect the California Standards of the Teaching Profession. We will create a rigorous program involving teachers that:
•	supports all teachers, new to the District, in their effort to achieve basic standards of competent teaching;
•	provides a coherent, comprehensive and articulated support and induction program of services for teachers new to the profession - linking and coordinating the PreIntern, Intern, Beginning Teacher Component, BTSA and other professional growth activities;
•	provides an objective and thorough process for evaluating these teachers and nonreelecting those who fail to reach the threshold of satisfactory performance;
•	provides an objective and thorough process that will assist, and review all tenured teachers whose teaching performance is below standard. Once provided a fair and rigorous process of assist and review those teachers whose performance continues to fall below standard will be subject to possible termination of employment; and
•	develops and promotes a standards-based, growth oriented evaluation system for all teachers.
The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program and the Career In Teaching Committee are two key components in the efforts by the District and Union to improve the quality of the teaching force. The District and UESF, as well as UASF, will be involved in the partnership effort necessary to achieve the above goals envisioned for the San Francisco Public Schools.

Peer Assistance & Review
1)	There is a shared commitment to ongoing, tripartite (SFUSD, UESF, UASF) collaboration in the design and development of a new teacher induction program that corresponds to the legal mandates of SB2042.
2)	This tripartite collaboration will continue on a regular basis through the 2002-03 school year, under the auspices of the Career In Teaching Committee as described in Section 18.10 of the UESF/SFUSD teachers contract.
3)	Because of ongoing changes in state legislation and budget allocations, the full design of the induction program is, by necessity, a work in progress. Because of this, contract-relevant provisions will be negotiated as part of the Living Contract Committee as described in Section 26, Living Contract, of the UESF/SFUSD teachers contract.
4)	The role of the principal/site administrator in the evaluation of teachers in their first year in the SFUSD, at schools designated for PAR coach services has been agreed upon by the SFUSD, UESF, and UASF. It has been formalized in the Attachment to this Letter of Transmittal (see attached).
5)	All new credentialed and non-credentialed teachers hired at any of the designated “STAR” schools will receive first priority for PAR coach services. If there is PAR coaching capacity beyond the STAR schools, additional schools would be designated at Superintendent’s discretion to receive PAR services.
6)	Newly hired credentialed teachers at the rest of the SFUSD schools will receive support services during 2002-03 through the BTSA program. Non-credentialed teachers at these same schools will receive support services during 2002-03 through the Intern, Pre-Intern or Para-To-Teacher programs, as appropriate.
7)	This Letter of Transmittal will remain in effect for the term of the new contract, unless new state legislation requires re-negotiation or a signatory seeks to renegotiate a provision.

5)	Attend the first Panel case review, and subsequent Panel case reviews if he/she has a PT who is Not Meeting Standards at the time of that review. The site administrator is encouraged to share his/her perspectives at these reviews.
6)	It is desirable that the site administrator /principal completes the activities described below in 6a - 6d:
a.	Participate in a JOINT FORMAL ASSESSMENT SEQUENCE (preobservation, observation, post-observation conference) with the coach for each first year PT prior to the Second Panel Presentation round (typically in December).
b.	Participate in a JOINT FORMAL ASSESSMENT SEQUENCE with the coach for each tenured PT between February 1st and April 1st.
c.	Hold a post-observation discussion of PT needs and next steps with the coach, specifying principal/site administrator’s role and priorities to be included in the PT’s Individual Learning Plan.
d.	Address and attempt to resolve with the coach any discrepancies between the administrator's and coach’s assessments (see #8).
7)	It is required that the site administrator /principal completes the activities described below in 7a - 7d:

Hold a post-observation discussion of PT needs and next steps with the coach, specifying principal/site administrator's role and priorities to be included in the PT's Individual Learning Plan. d. Address and attempt to resolve with the coach any discrepancies between the administrator's and coach's assessments (see #8). 8) In the event that significant discrepancies exist between the administrator's assessment and the coach's assessment of the PT's performance on any of the Essential Elements of Standards 1-5, the administrator and coach are obligated to document and supply relevant evidence for those differences. The PAR Panel may direct the site administrator and the coach to conduct a second JOINT FORMAL CLASSROOM OBSERVATION, if it is needed, to resolve those differences.
9)	In the event that significant discrepancies still exist after the second joint formal classroom observation or other steps recommended to resolve the situation, both the administrator and the coach must attend the next Panel presentation. Both the administrator and coach must present their assessments and supporting evidence to the Panel. The differences in opinion and evidence will be included in the record, and forwarded with the Panel's recommendation to rehire or not to rehire to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will review the recommendation and the record of evidence, and will make his/her final recommendation to the Board of Education.

2.	On a research-based model of success
C.	Adoption of plan by the site educational community by an established percentage, (super majority)
D.	Opportunity for staff to sign-on (individually) indicating endorsement and plan for implementation
E.	Voluntary transfer for those who do not sign-on to agreement
F.	Monitoring process of implementation of the site plan
G.	Involuntary transfer process for staff deemed not to be implementing or undermining the site plan
1.	it would be a site decision involving stakeholders
2.	there must be an appeal process
II.	Comprehensive long-range plan to be developed during two-year interim period
III.	Peer Assistance and Review (e.g. Columbus, Poway, Cincinnati, Toledo) with parent component
IV.	A timeline for fleshing out and implementing these steps (meeting no later than May 10)
V.	Mutually selected ombudsperson for Mission High School
VI.	No provision of be current collective bargaining agreement between be UESF and be District shall be used as an impediment to interfere with the implementation of the provisions contained herein.
These preliminary components are subject to discourse, dialogue, review, modification involving the educational community stakeholders (i.e., parties to Consent Decree, federal judge overseeing Consent Decree, elected Board of Education officials, and 2nd District PTA).
We will meet again no later than May 10 before any further reconstitution is recommended for the 1996-7 school year
