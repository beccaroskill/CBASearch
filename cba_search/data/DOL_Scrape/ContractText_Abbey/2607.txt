Once waived, coverage may not be reinstated until the next open enrollment period or by special enrollment if proof of loss of the alternate coverage is provided.
Employees who waive these coverages will not be required to reimburse the Employer.
Employees who waive these coverages may not elect to have the Employer provide the dependent coverage described in Section 4 of Article XIX.
