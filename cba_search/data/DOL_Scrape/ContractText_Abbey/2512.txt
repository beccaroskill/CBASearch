CIRCULAR LETTER NO. 568
TO ALL AFFILIATED OUTSIDE ERECTION LOCAL UNIONS:
GREETINGS:
Due to the many inquiries received from our affiliated outside erection local unions relative to clarification of Paragraph A, Section 15, Article XVIII-A, which is captioned “General Working Rules of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers”, it has been decided that this letter of clarification be directed to all outside erection local unions in order to eliminate any future misunderstandings.
Paragraph A of Section 15, Article XVIII-A, states as follows:
“No less than six (6) men and a foreman shall be employed around any guy or stiff leg derrick used on steel erection and, on all mobile or power operated rigs of any description no less than four (4) men and a foreman shall be employed.”
The clarification requested deals with the portion of the above quoted section which states as follows:
“On all mobile or power operated rigs of any description no less than four (4) men and a foreman shall be employed.”
The above quoted section provides for the number of men to be used on a guy or stiff leg derrick and on all mobile or power operated rigs when such equipment is used on steel erection. On all other work operations coming under the jurisdiction of this International Association where members of this Association are employed a sufficient number of men will be employed in order that the work involved can be performed in a safe and expeditious manner. This means that an
73
employer will not be required to use four (4) men and a foreman on work operations not requiring this number of men. It also means that on rigging or unloading operations where more than four men and a foreman are required, such additional members will be employed.
It is of the utmost importance that the officers and members of this International Association exercise good judgment in determining the proper number of members to be used on certain work operations where mobile or power operated rigs are used. The safety of the members employed must be considered as well as the possible over manning of a specific work operation which, in many instances, has resulted in such work operations being assigned to other crafts and subsequently resulted in jurisdictional disputes.
This letter should be read to the membership of your local union at the next regular meeting and all job stewards must be acquainted with the subject matter contained herein.
Fraternally yours,
J. H. Lyons
General President
J. R. Downs
General Secretary
