RELIEF SHIFT, STATIONARY OPERATING ENGINEERS & WASTEWATER TREATMENT OPERATORS
SECTION 1.	Introduction
J	'	f :	'. 1
As stated in Article V, Section 3, Paragraph D, “Special considerations are necessary for relief of such operations," such operations being the shifts worked by the Stationary Operating Engineers and Wastewater Treatment Operators (SOE/WWTOs). The SOE/WWTOs have, by the nature of their -work, different conditions from any other worker on the plantsite. They cannot leave thair work areas unattended. In most, instances, they are oh shift by themselves. Their individual responsibility cannot be lightly dismissed. Their contributions to the end product and to building and area safety^are considerable: The continued satisfactory/ operations of utility equipment are a result of their skill and effort. Because of the need for continuous operations; which in most utility’ areas is covered by one engineer, the “special considerations for relief* are mandatory;

26 SOE/WWTO would require double-time
27 premium pay. The next seven (7)<ays
2o	. worked would not require any premium
29	pay except that due the shift being
30	worked. This section will not apply should 31 the 8th or 9th days worked be caused by a 32 request from the relief SOEAVWTO for 33 special days off as given in Paragraphs B, 34 G, and H of Application.

SUBCONTRACTING
During recent negotiations the issue of subcontracting was discussed. While the parties agree that the interests of the workers that the Company employs and the Union represents are vital, the Company is subject to its obligations under prime contract to the Department of Energy. Additionally, the Company is bound to the conditions outlined in the subcontracting clause of the collective bargaining agreement.
It is the intent of the Company to utilize the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) members to the maximum extent where possible under the terms of its contract with the Department of Energy and its collective bargaining agreement with USWA, Local 8031.

QUALIFYING EXAMINATIONS CLARIFICATION

It ismot the Company’s intent to summarily dismiss employees fronrrthe plantsite or to disqualify them from a job without insuring that they have ample opportunity to become certified, or recertified. If an employee is aware of an upcoming recertification exam and he/she is concerned about passing, then the Company will offer reasonable assistance necessary to pass the test.
In cases where remediation may be possible, such remediation shall be offered to the employee. It is not the Company’s kvtent to utilize the language expressed in the subject paragraph indiscriminately, but rather to ensure that both parties benefit from a well trained, qualified workforce.

PLACEMENT OF HOURLY EMPLOYEE'S UPON ACCESS
AUTHORIZATION REVOCA75GIWJNJAL
(Previously signed by both Company and Union representatives on July 9,1933)
Upon a final Department of Energy (DOE) decision to revoke/deny an hourly employees access authorization, the Company will determine per procedure as provided for in Policy 12-30, whether to continue to employ the individual. Upon a decision to continue employment, the Company will make every reasonable effort to place employees in their current classification. However, if following a decision to continue employment it is determined that due to lack of access authorization the employee can no longer work in his/her original classification, he/she will be laid off in accordance with the layoff procedure. Nothing within this understanding precludes an employee from utilizing the grievance procedure.
