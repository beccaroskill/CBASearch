YOUR RIGHT TO UNION REPRESENTATION
The Supreme Court of the United States decided in the case of the NLRB vs Weingarten, Inc, that:
"an employee has the right to have a union representative present at any investigatory interview conducted by the employer, where the employee reasonably believes the interview might result in disciplinary action."
(See also NLRB vs AAA Equipment Service Company.)
As a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, you can not be required to submit to an investigatory interview where you have a reasonable belief that you may be disciplined, without a representative of your Union present. However you must:
Ask for representation - this right is not automatic. If you are denied this right, offer to return to work or to clock out and go home. Do not stay in the room.
Make no statement, written or verbal, unless they are absolutely true. Any statement you make can be used against you. Always request copies ot any document that you may sign.
You should state:
"I am not being insubordinate, however, I am refusing to talk with you further until my union representative is present. I will either return to my work or I will clock out and leave but I will not continue this interview."
DO NOT WAIVE THIS RIGHT BY ALLOWING THE INTERVIEW TO GO ON.

It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto, by entering into this Agreement, to promote and to improve industrial and economic relationships between the Company and their associates, to recognize mutual interests, to provide a channel through which information and problems can be transmitted from one to another, to formulate rules to govern the relationship between the Union and the Company, and to promote efficiency and service. These objectives shall guide the parties and be observed by them during the term of this Agreement.
WITNESSETH: That the parties have agreed and do, by these presents, agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1	- JURISDICTION
Section 1.1 The Union shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all associates as defined in this Agreement in the City of St. Louis and in the counties of St. Louis, Franklin, St. Charles, Jefferson, Washington, Warren and Lincoln, excluding Store Management, supervisory and other associates as defined by the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and those associates covered by other collective bargaining agreements with the Company.
Section 1.2 Aft work and services connected with all operations carried on at the premises of the Company’s retail establishments including, but not limited to, the handling and selling of all merchandise, shall be performed only by associates within the unit as defined in this Agreement, and by associates working for the first thirty-one (31) days of their employment provided, however, that the foregoing restriction on work jurisdiction may be altered or relaxed in whole or in part by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
The Company agrees to notify the Union, in advance, should a new department be opened or leased within a store.
Section 1.3 Under no condition shall supervisors or Store Managers perform bargaining unit work, except in case of emergency, such as Acts of God or other conditions beyond the control of the Company, and to the extent that they may perform customer services. Customer services shall not be construed to include stocking, price marking, truck unloading or building displays, or any other bargaining unit work on a regular basis.
However, one member of store management will be allowed to perform any bargaining unit work. The company will notify the Union, when necessary, which current member of store management is so designated
Section 1,4 The above described restriction on work jurisdiction has been relaxed and altered in the
following respect: that there shall be no restrictions on outside sales persons delivering and/or servicing commercial bakery products; milk; soda; bottled water products, isotonic drinks and teas delivered by direct store delivery (DSD) vendors; all product delivered by chip and snack vendors; cookies and crackers; beer, wine and liquor; and L'eggs.

This paragraph is subject to the Grievance Procedure.

ARTICLE 7	- HOURS AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Section 7.1
A.	The basic workweek for all associates covered by this Agreement shall be forty (40) hours, to be worked in five (5) eight (8) hour shifts or four (4) ten (10) hour shifts, not necessarily consecutive. The workweek shall be each Company's seven (7) day payroll period.
B.	The regular work day for associates shall not exceed eight (8) consecutive hours per shift [or ten (10) consecutive hours per shift for those associates scheduled to work four (4) ten (10) hour shifts], exclusive of an unpaid meal period.
C.	All time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week or eight (8) consecutive hours per shift [ten (10) consecutive hours per shift for associates working four (4) ten (10) hour shifts] shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (11A) the associate's regular rate of pay. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime or premium pay.
D.	Available schedules for full-time associates of four (4) ten (10) hour shifts shall be on a voluntary basis in accordance with seniority and qualifications to perform the job. The Company will ascertain the number of four (4) ten (10) hour schedules available by department; then determine the actual number to be scheduled by department based on the number of volunteers per department. At no time shall anyone be forced to work a four (4) ten (10) hour schedule.
E.	Scheduled overtime shall be offered by seniority to associates qualified to do the work within the store for the designated time. Associates shall not be required or compelled to work overtime as defined above. However, if an insufficient number of associates volunteer, then qualified associates may be required to work by inverse order of seniority.
F.	All associates shall receive at least one (1) full day off per calendar week, Monday through Saturday, inclusive. If associates are required to work on their scheduled day off, they shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 %) their regular rate.
Section 7.2
A.	The Store Manager will post a work schedule by seniority (in ink or other permanent means) for all associates, by surname and initial, for the succeeding week by 11:00 a.m. on Friday of the current week. Any associate leaving on schedule before 11:00 a.m. and who is not scheduled to work on Saturday will be advised by store management of the associate's schedule to be
7
posted. This schedule shall be accessible to all associates and the Union. Copies of all master food schedules shall be posted in one central location accessible to all associates.
B.	All associates shall have a minimum of eight (8) hours off between shifts except as referenced in Section 7.21 and except that at the associate's option the eight (8) hour minimum may be waived. Associates shall not work split shifts.
C.	Starting time for full-time associates shall not be changed without twenty-four (24) hours notice to each associate affected by such change, except in case of emergency caused by illness, absenteeism, etc.
D.	Thirty-two (32) hours or more per week associates shall have preference of available days off by seniority, job classification, and availability.
Once days off are selected, they will not be changed except in holiday weeks for reasons beyond the control of the Company or for operational changes. By agreement with the Union, the Company may elect to rotate Saturday off between all associates in a particular classification rather than to grant them to the more senior associates. This paragraph shall not preclude the right of the Company to grant, on an individual request basis, a particular day off on an infrequent basis to an associate for a valid reason.
E.	When hours are added to the posted schedule during the week, they shall be given to the most senior qualified part-time associate(s) who are available to work those hours. Such added hours will be given in consideration of the associate(s) present schedule and the operational needs of the store, both in the number of hours added and when the hours are needed; and further provided such hours will not cause the payment of overtime. If the Company offers the hours to an associate not scheduled the day the added hours are needed, the Company will call the most senior qualified part-time associate not scheduled to work five (5) shifts (Monday through Saturday) excluding Sunday and offer the added hours to this associate. However, full-time associates working less than forty (40) hours because of special request, or full-time associates scheduled for thirty-two (32) hours during holiday weeks, will be offered available call-in work in accordance with this section.
F.	If in case of an emergency an associate fails to report to work as scheduled, then those hours will be offered to the most senior qualified part-time associate(s) working that day and is available to work the needed hours or to the most senior qualified part-time associate not scheduled to work on those days. Such hours will be given in consideration of the associate(s) present schedule and the operational needs of the store, both in the number of hours offered and when the hours are needed; provided such hours will not cause the payment of overtime. When the Company offers the hours to an associate not scheduled the day the hours are needed, the Company will call the most senior qualified part-time associate not‘scheduled to work five (5) shifts (Monday through Saturday) excluding Sunday and offer the hours to this associate. However, full-time associates working less than forty (40) hours because of special request, or full-time associates scheduled for thirty-two (32) hours during holiday weeks, will be offered available call-in work in accordance with this section.
G.	Daily overtime shall be offered by seniority and job classification within the store among the
8
associates present and qualified to do the work when the need for overtime arises. Associates shall not be required or compelled to work overtime as defined above. However, if an insufficient number of associates volunteer, then qualified associates may be required to work by inverse order of seniority.
H.	It is agreed that night work after 6 p.m. will be assigned on an equitable basis among all associates who work thirty-two (32) hours or more per week and that no thirty-two (32) hours or more per week associate will be required to work more than three (3) nights per week. For the purpose of applying this clause, this associate shall have worked thirty-two (32) hours or more per week for a period of thirteen (13) consecutive weeks. An associate who works less than thirty-two (32) hours per week for a period of thirteen (13) consecutive weeks shall be disqualified from the above three (3) night provision.
I.	A premium of sixty cents (600) per hour in addition to the regular rate of pay shall be paid for all hours worked between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. Associates scheduled for more than five (5) hours, whose shift encompasses 12 a.m. to 5 a.m., will be paid the premium for the entire shift. Night shift differential shall be included in computing vacation pay. In the week in which a holiday occurs, the week's pay shall not be less than the basic pay plus normal shift differential. An associate working on a night shift which either begins or ends on a Sunday or holiday will be compensated at straight time plus night premium for the entire shift. However, associates who are scheduled both the night shift before and the night shift of a Sunday or a holiday will receive their appropriate Sunday or holiday premium pay (or night premium, whichever is greater) for the entire Sunday or holiday night shift.
Any shift that is scheduled to end after midnight or begin before 4 a.m. is considered to be a night shift. This shift for full-time associates shall be eight (8) hours, not to exceed five (5) nights, forty (40) hours per week, except that full-time associates may be scheduled for forty (40) hours to be worked in four (4) ten (10) hour shifts. In this event, daily overtime shall not be paid until more than ten (10) hours have been worked. Associates working the night shift must have a minimum of twelve (12) hours break between shifts.
The following are pay procedures in conjunction with this Section for associates working night shifts that work during weekends that include holidays that are celebrated on Mondays.
1.	There are three possible night work shifts:
a)	Saturday night into Sunday morning
b)	Sunday night into Monday morning
c)	Monday night into Tuesday morning
2.	If an associate working night shifts works any one (1) of the above shifts, they shall be paid the night premium pay for all hours worked on that shift.
3.	If an associate working night shifts works any two (2) of the above shifts, they shall be paid the night premium pay for the first full shift worked and the appropriate Sunday or Holiday
9
premium pay for the second full shift worked. For example:
Associate works Saturday into Sunday and Monday into Tuesday; the associate shall receive night premium pay for Saturday into Sunday and Holiday premium pay for Monday into Tuesday.
4.	If an associate working night shifts works all three (3) of the above shifts, they shall be paid the night premium pay for the first full shift worked, Sunday premium pay for the second full shift worked and holiday premium pay for the last shift worked.
5.	When Christmas Day falls on Sunday but is legally celebrated on Monday, associates who work their second full night shift from Sunday night into Monday morning shall receive their Sunday premium pay for hours worked on that shift. Associates who work their second full night shift from Monday night into Tuesday morning shall receive their holiday premium pay for hours worked on that shift.
Available night schedules may be selected by qualified associates on the basis of seniority. In the event there are not enough volunteers, inverse seniority shall apply.
Associates working a forty (40) hour night shift schedule may replace a less senior forty (40) hour associate in their store not working a forty (40) hour night schedule seniority and qualifications permitting. Such associate shall give the Company at least ten (10) days written notice.
J.	In scheduling courtesy clerks, the Company shall schedule for a minimum of ten (10) hours per week. When scheduled, they shall not be reduced below ten (10) hours per week that week. It is understood that this guarantee cannot apply to an associate called in for replacement of another associate.
K.	Any associate who averages twenty-five (25) hours or more per week and who is unable to work because of injuries received during the scheduled workweek and whose injuries resulted out of or during the course of employment on the store premises, shall be entitled to full pay not to exceed eight (8) hours [ten (10) hours for associates scheduled to work four (4) ten (10) hour shifts] for each scheduled day lost because of such injuries, but not to exceed three (3) days, provided, however, that the associate shall report upon receipt of the injury to the store manager who shall refer the associate to the Company's physician. The physician's decision with respect to the length of time required off from the job shall be the controlling factor, provided further that nothing in this provision shall affect any rights accruing to either party under the Workers' Compensation Act of the State of Missouri, and that the Company shall receive credit for any payment made under this Article, should any compensation be awarded in accordance with the State Workers' Compensation Act.
The above payment is meant to compensate the associate for scheduled days lost prior to the date Workers' Compensation benefits become effective.
When an associate averaging less than twenty-five (25) hours per week is injured on the job, they will be paid for the balance of that day's work schedule provided that they conform with the
10
procedures set forth above.
When an associate, following an "on-the-job injury", is certified as ready and able to perform all regular duties by the associate’s attending physician and/or Company doctor, but requires continued medical treatments as a result of the same injury, the Company shall adjust the work schedule upon request without penalty to the associate or Company, to provide both the time for medical care and the number of hours of work for which the associate is regularly scheduled by seniority and job classification.
Section 7.3 All associates working shifts of six (6) or more hours per day will be allowed a paid uninterrupted rest period of fifteen (15) minutes for each one-half (%) shift worked, not to exceed two (2) rest periods per day. Associates working four (4) hour shifts up to six (6) hour shifts per day shall be entitled to one (1) paid uninterrupted fifteen (15) minute rest period per day. Rest periods shall not be required until the associate has been on duty at least two (2) hours.
Section 7.4 The meal period, without pay, shall not exceed one (1) hour per day on the associate’s time and shall be allowed between the beginning of the fourth (4th) hour and the ending of the sixth (6th) hour after starting time. Any associate working five (5) hours or more shall be entitled to an unpaid thirty (30) minute lunch period, if requested.
Section 7.5 When an associate shall report for work at the time and place ordered or scheduled, then such associate shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours pay at the regular rate. Students who are available regularly for as much as four (4) hours in any day during regular store hours shall be covered by the four (4) hour guarantee. The four (4) hour minimum may be waived if mutually agreed to between the Store Manager and the associate.
Section 7.6 When supervision or the Company elects to instruct a member of the bargaining unit to report to the store for emergencies, they will be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at time and one-half (172) their regular rate of pay.
Section 7.7 Hours not worked, but compensated for by the Company [up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week] shall be credited as hours worked for purposes of seniority, vacation pay, holiday pay, severance pay and wage progression.
Section 7.8 All associates covered by this Agreement who receive hourly compensation, shall record in person, the exact number of hours worked by use of a time clock or other time record keeping instrument. The Company and the Union agree that a proven violation of established time clock rules, including work before punching in or after punching out, may subject an associate to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Falsification of payroll records shall be cause for dismissal. Upon request to Store Management, the Company agrees to allow the Shop Steward or Union Representative to check time records for hours worked on associates covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement; and further agrees, upon reasonable notice, to allow records to be checked where necessary for wage rates.
Section 7.9	The Company agrees to provide a complete first aid kit in each store.

C.	Associates may claim the entire weekly schedule of a less senior associate, if the less senior associate has a schedule with more weekly hours, in accordance with availability, job classification, and ability to perform the type of work within the store in which they work.
Claims under this provision of the Agreement must be made by the associate to the Company no later than 5 p.m. Saturday or the associate forfeits any claim.
D.	1. In the event a forty (40) hour Master Food or Specialty Department schedule becomes available, exclusive of department manager and assistant department manager positions, the following procedure will apply:
The most senior Master Food or Specialty Department associate as referenced in Section 8.4B above in the grouping of stores of the Company where the forty (40) hour permanent schedule becomes available will be given the first opportunity to work a forty (40) hour schedule.
The Company will offer the position to the most senior associate(s) within the associate's respective group (i.e., Master Food or Specialty Department) in each Company’s grouping of stores (division, district, zone, region, etc.) or by the entire bargaining unit who has indicated to the Company in writing that they desire to work a forty (40) hour schedule.
14
These written requests for forty (40) hour jobs must be sent to the Labor Relations/Human Resources Department prior to August 15‘ and February 1st of each year for each succeeding six (6) month period and must include which store(s) and job classification (s) within the associate’s respective group (i.e., Master Food or Specialty Department) in which the associate is willing to work. Associates will not be offered a forty (40) hour job at a store or in a job classification that they do not have listed on their forty (40) hour request form.
Associates who refuse to transfer to obtain a forty (40) hour schedule that they have listed on their request form relinquish their opportunity for that six (6) month request period to be transferred for a forty (40) hour schedule and will only be offered the opportunity to work an available forty (40) hour schedule by seniority in the associate's store during the remainder of that six (6) month period. Associates will acknowledge in writing each time a forty (40) hour schedule is offered and they refuse the opportunity.
2.	In the event a forty (40) hour schedule becomes available due to volume fluctuations, the most senior associate in the store where the opening is deemed to exist, who desires forty (40) hours will be given an opportunity to work a forty (40) hour schedule.
The associate placed in the forty (40) hour position will be a temporary replacement and not assigned to a full-time seniority date. If the forty (40) hour job continues to exist after three (3) full accounting periods, it will be filled by the process outlined in Section 1. above.
3.	If necessary, training in the job to be performed will be provided. The Company will determine within a two (2) to four (4) week period if the associate can perform the work satisfactorily. If an associate is disqualified because of this provision the associate will be transferred back to the associate’s original store. These associates may only be offered forty (40) hour schedules in the future in the associate's present job classifications (i.e., grocery, produce, checking and office). The associate at any time during or at the end of the four (4) week period may return to the associate's former classification and/or store with no loss of seniority.
4.	If the associate mentioned in No. 1 above refuses a forty (40) hour schedule at a store and in a job classification they have requested, then the Company will repeat the procedure in No. 1 until the ten (10) most senior associates who have requested that store and job classification in writing, have been offered the schedule. If none of these ten (10) associates accept this forty (40) hour schedule, then the Company may offer the schedule to the most senior associate in the store where this opening is deemed to exist who desires to work a forty (40) hour schedule.
5.	The Company will assign, at their discretion, associates to any forty (40) hour jobs available in a new or remodeled store by selecting forty (40) hour associates from other stores or as outlined in Section 8.7D. Forty (40) hour schedules vacated in other stores because of the new store will be filled in accordance with No. 1 above.
6.	The Company may elect not to replace the forty (40) hour job if there is an overage in the full-time ratio.
15
7.	When a forty (40) hour position is filled, the Company will notify the Union in writing of the associate’s name, social security number, store location and full-time date.

The associate shall notify the Company in writing of their intent to claim a schedule with a greater number of hours when their availability is, again, unlimited on a permanent basis.
Associates may limit their availability as it regards total number of shifts they are available to work in a week and/or the total number of weekly hours they are available to work. This shall not be construed to mean preferential shifts.
Section 8.9 It is agreed by the Company that the Store Manager will not use the scheduling of hours as a punitive measure.
Section 8.10 A full-time (40-hour) associate, who has been reduced below forty (40) hours per week for four (4) out of six (6) weeks in the associate’s store, seniority permitting, may replace the least senior full-time associate in the same job classification in the Company's grouping of stores or bargaining unit. Requests to exercise seniority in this regard must be made in writing to the Labor Relations/Human Resources Department within one (1) week following the four (4) week period.

At the time that such a request is made, both the associate and the Union Representative (or in the event of the unavailability of the Union Representative, the steward or another member of the bargaining unit) shall be specifically advised of all of the facts forming the basis of the Company’s belief that the associate may be having a problem that may be drug or alcohol related. The manager requiring the test will complete a report supporting the reason for having the associate tested.
Section 10.4 In our continued effort to provide a safe, drug free and alcohol free work environment, the Company will require a breathalyzer and/or blood test for alcohol and an urinalysis test for drugs as a routine part of the investigation of the circumstances present at the time of an “on-the-job accident" which results in medical treatment away from the store.

Prior to administering discipline, consideration will be given to the associate's length of service [if at least eighteen (18) months], work history, the seriousness of the violation and other factors involved. However, any gross misconduct will result in immediate discharge. Should the associate not be discharged, the associate will be placed on a leave of absence and/or a disciplinary suspension for the first incident of a positive test.

Subsequent positive tests will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

As a further condition of returning to work after the aforementioned Leave of Absence and/or a disciplinary suspension an associate will be subject to random tests during the first (1st) year after returning to work. In the event the random test proves positive for drugs or alcohol, the associate will be discharged.
