A grievance shall be defined as a written dispute concerning the interpretation, application, and alleged violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The grievance shall be dated and signed by the aggrieved employee and his/her District Steward. The grievance shall set forth the facts, including dates, and provisions of the Agreement that are alleged to have been violated and the remedy desired. The grievance shall not be considered submitted until the District Supervisor or his/her designee receives the written grievance. At the time it is received, the grievance shall be dated and signed and a copy (if requested) returned to the District Steward. A meeting will be arranged between the District Steward and the District Supervisor to discuss the grievance. The District Supervisor will then answer the grievance in writing.
-	72 The Chief Steward may be present at any step or steps of the Grievance Procedure as well as an additional representative of the Employer, and if the Employer or the Union request that the aggrieved employee be present at any step or steps of the Grievance Procedure to participate in the discussion, they will be required to do so.

A meeting will be scheduled between the Chief Steward, District Steward, and the representatives designated by the Administrative Head to discuss the grievance. The Administrative Head, or his/her designee will then answer the grievance in writing.
D.	Step III
-75 If the Administrative Head’s written answer is not satisfactory, the grievance may be referred to the Union President who may submit his/her appeal to the Office of Employee Relations indicating the reasons why the written answer of the Administrative Head was unsatisfactory. A meeting between no more than three (3) representatives of the Union and three (3) representatives designated by the Director of Employee Relations will be held to discuss the grievance within twenty (20) working days from the date the grievance is received by the Office
13
of Employee Relations. After the Step III meeting the Employer’s representative will submit a written answer to the Union.
-76 The Union representative may meet at a place designated by the Employer on the Employer’s property for at least one-half (1/2) hour immediately preceding the hearing.
E.	Step IV
-	77 If the Office of Employee Relation’s answer is not satisfactory, settlement may be determined by decision of an Arbitrator selected by the parties. The Union President within thirty (30) calendar days of the Step III answer will notify the Office of Employee Relations in writing that the Union wishes to appeal the grievance to arbitration.
-	78 In the event the parties cannot agree upon an Arbitrator within ten (10) working days of the date of the appeal, the Union shall, within fifteen (15) working days after failing to mutually agree on an Arbitrator, file a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association who shall select an Arbitrator and the Arbitrator shall establish a mutually acceptable hearing date. Grievances processed to arbitration by the Union which pose continuing financial liability to the Employer, shall, at the request of the Employer, displace grievances with arbitration dates which pose no financial liability to the Employer. Such displaced grievances shall be scheduled in the next open date.
-	79 In the event the Union fails to appeal the grievance to arbitration within the specified time limit or fails to file the Demand for Arbitration within the specified time limit, the grievance shall be considered settled based upon the Step III answer given by the Office of Employee Relations. The fees and approved expenses of the Arbitrator will be paid by the parties equally. The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply to all arbitration hearings.
-	80 Grievances, within the meaning of the Grievance Procedure and of this arbitration clause, shall consist only of disputes about the interpretation or application of the clauses of this Agreement and about alleged violations of this Agreement. The Arbitrator shall have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement, nor shall he/she substitute his/her discretion for that of the Employer or the Union where such discretion has been retained by the Employer or the Union, nor shall he/she exercise any responsibility or function of the Employer or the Union.
-	81 Finality of Decisions - There shall be no appeal from the Arbitrator’s decision. Each such decision shall be final and binding upon the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved, and the Employer.

A grievance over a written letter of reprimand or suspension shall be submitted by the Chief Steward at Step II of the Grievance Procedure.

C.	Use of Past Record
-87 In imposing any reprimand, suspension or discharge on a current charge, the Employer will not take into account any prior infractions of which the Employer had knowledge that occurred more than two (2) years previously. No derogatory inference will result and/or the material relating to disciplinary action be held against an employee in relation to his/her employment because of the need to retain records beyond the two (2) year period. Upon written request from a Local 1585 bargaining unit employee, the records section will purge the employee’s file of disciplinary actions over two (2) years old if there have been no intervening disciplinary action. At that time, also, the records unit will instruct the originating department to purge its personnel file of the same material.

After exhausting this procedure and the need still exists, the Employer may require the least senior available, qualified employee to work. The Union reserves the right to grieve what is an emergency. Employees in other classifications may be called if there is a shortage of employees in the classification needed. In such cases they would be called on the basis of least hours of overtime in their classification provided they are capable of doing the work. When employees are notified by telephone, they will be called in order of lowest hours first.
-	220 For the purpose of this clause, time not worked because the employee was unavailable, or did not choose to work, will be charged the average number of overtime hours of the employees working during that overtime period (2 hour minimum).

B.	Retirement for Employees Hired Prior to January 1, 1973
-	255 Effective January 1, 1973, the University Retirement Program ceased to exist. However, to insure that no employee lost credit for prior years of service, the following guidelines were established to provide that an employee will receive no less than what an improved plan formula would give him or her upon retirement.
-	256 Those persons employed prior to January 1, 1973, who were 55 years of age or older and/or had 25 years of service on January 1, 1973, could elect to remain subject to the improved University Plan formula described below.
-	257 The formula governing the old Retirement Plan was improved by basing pensions on an amount equal to the highest three (3) year average earnings, multiplied by two (2%) percent for each year of service, with a $3,600 ceiling.
-	258 For employees participating in TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University, and selected by the employee, with a University contribution, this new formula will be applied for each employee at retirement and will become the minimum received by the employee.
-	259 The annuity value, at the time of retirement, purchased by MSU’s contribution to TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University, and selected by the employee, will be compared to the pension amount as computed in Paragraph 257 above, and the employee will receive the larger of the two figures. Employee contributions to TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University, and selected by the employee, (retroactive to 1-1-73) will provide additional annuity income.
-	260 Those employees not participating in TIAA-CREF or other retirement programs made available through the University, and selected by the employee, will have their retirement income figured solely on the improved formula plus a ten (10%) percent addition added to the base pension prior to actuarial reduction or the selection of a survivor option.
-	261 Employees who terminate without meeting the minimum requirements for retirement will receive a retirement pension from the contributions made to the individual TIAA-CREF annuity contract or other retirement programs made available through the University, and selected by the employee, consistent with provisions of those contracts.
C.	University Retirement

I.	COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES
-	293 Assignment of Employees - Employees in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources may be assigned to other tasks during certain times without an increase or decrease in their regular rate of pay as opposed to being laid off because of lack of available work in the specific classification. It is understood that the above provision does not guarantee twelve (12) months employment each year to any employee but is merely a sincere effort on the part of the Employer to utilize the talents and services of regular full-time employees during normally slow periods.
-	294 The Employer will provide jobs for students to the end that impecunious youngsters may secure an education. Many students are employed in order to receive practical training as a part of their education.

d.	District Stewards and Alternate Stewards who work on a holiday shall have their holiday pay calculated on their regular rate of pay for their normal University classification.

Employees, who, during the course of their regular duties are compelled to occasionally enter the freezer room and are not obliged to spend over one (1) hour consecutively in the freezer room, shall not be eligible for the additional compensation.
