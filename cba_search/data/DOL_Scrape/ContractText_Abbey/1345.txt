2
C.	ALL WORK COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT shall be done by employees of the Contractor or a subcontractor under the terms of an agreement with the Union.
1.	All work done by the Contractor or a Subcontractor on the construction site that falls within the claimed jurisdiction of the Laborers’ International Union of North America shall be done by employees of the Contractor or a subcontractor under the terms of an agreement with the Union.
2.	Neither the Contractor nor any of its subcontractors shall perform any work with employees at the site which comes within the recognized jurisdiction of the Brick Masons unless the Contractor and/or the subcontractor are signed to an appropriate current labor agreement with the Brick Masons. (This provision shall be null and void if the Brick Masons' Union does not have a similar clause in their Agreements).
D.	SUBCONTRACTOR. A subcontractor is defined as any person, firm or corporation that agrees under contract with the General Contractor or his subcontractor to perform any work Covered by this Agreement, including the operation of equipment, performance of labor or the furnishing and installation of materials.

F.	THE CONTRACTOR SHALL NOT permit subcontracting by subcontractor without the Contractor's knowledge and permission in writing.
1.	In the event the Contractor is required to subcontract work on a public works project to a certified MBE/WBE/DBE/DVBE to meet requirements contained in governmental rules or regulations, the contractor shall notify in writing the Local Union in whose jurisdiction the work is to be performed. The Union shall offer to sign the subcontractor to the Unions' MBE/WBE/DBE/DVBE Public Works Short-form Agreement.
G.	DELINQUENCY AND COLLECTION PROCEDURE
1.	The Trustees of the Trust Fund shall furnish the Contractor Associations and the Union with a list of delinquent contractors each month. Such list will also be available to all signatory contractors on request, subject to such reasonable cost as may be determined by the administrative office of the Trust Funds as representing the cost of duplication and transmission of such lists, payment for which to be made in advance. The Contractor agrees he/she will not subcontract any portion of his job to any subcontractor whose name appears on the delinquent list until such subcontractor has paid all delinquent monies to the various Trust Funds. In the event the Contractor subcontracts to any such delinquent subcontractor in violation of the foregoing, the Contractor shall remove such subcontractor from the job immediately, unless such delinquent subcontractor immediately makes full payment for all delinquencies to the Trusts.
2.	If the Contractor fails to remove the delinquent subcontractor, the Contractor will become financially responsible for all fringe benefits owed to any funds established by this Agreement by the Contractor or by his subcontractor or the subcontractor of his subcontractor for work performed on the Contractor's job or project in accordance with the requirements set forth below.
3
3.	The term "Contractor" for delinquency purposes only, shall include all entities of the delinquent contractor, change of name, or change of entity, provided that the delinquent contractor holds at least ten percent (10%) ownership in the new entity.
4.	In the event the Contractor subcontracts to a subcontractor that is not on the delinquency list at the time the subcontract is entered into, the Trust Office shall notify the Contractor of any delinquency of the subcontractor within ninety (90) days of the date the delinquency first occurred and in no case shall the Contractor be liable for fringe benefit contributions of subcontractor for more than ninety (90) days prior to the date the Trust Office notice is sent to the Contractor.
5.	Where a Contractor contracts with a listed delinquent subcontractor or subcontractors, and the Contractor fails to terminate the subcontract of such delinquent subcontractor, or subcontractors, the Contractor shall become financially responsible for the liability of the delinquent subcontractor's fringe benefits on that job from the commencement of the work under the subcontract the date of termination of that subcontract.
6.	The Trust Fund Office shall send delinquency notices to Contractors whose contributions are not paid as required. The Trust Office shall notify the Union of those Contractors who fail to pay within five (5) days of such notice and the Union shall within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of such notice withhold service from the Contractor involved until contributions are paid or satisfactory arrangements made with the Trustees for payment.
7.	Any employee rendered unemployed by reason of the foregoing shall not be deemed engaged in a work stoppage or labor dispute but shall be deemed constructively laid off by the Contractor by failure to pay monies due for the benefit of the employees. Contractor agrees that such employees are entitled to unemployment insurance and warrants that he will take no action to interfere with the employee's application for unemployment insurance. Any dispute in connection with this paragraph is subject to the grievance procedure.
8.	The Trust Office shall issue delinquency notices and clearances to Contractors confirmed in writing.
9.	All employees shall be covered by this Agreement and the provisions applicable to Trust Funds. The Trustees shall have authority to audit Contractor records to determine the appropriate contributions and shall have specific authority to examine the Contractor's records, including but not limited to payroll records, time cards, Federal W-2 Forms, 1099 and 1096 Forms, Quarterly State Tax returns and cash disbursement ledgers, all canceled checks, check registers and invoices. If requested by the Trusts, the Contractor shall provide payroll breakdown by job when a lawsuit has been filed against a contractor. The Trustees may file suit to enforce this obligation, and, if successful, shall recover their attorneys fees and costs, whether or not the audit reveals a delinquency. Any Contractor delinquent under this Article may be required by the Trust Funds to submit, in addition to regular reports, payroll breakdowns by job, and the failure to submit timely job breakdowns shall be considered a delinquency under this Article. If a Contractor refuses to furnish the foregoing the Union may take economic action.
4
10.	It is recognized that a delinquency in contributions causes damages beyond the value of the unpaid contributions, which are difficult to quantify. These damages include, but are not limited to, the administrative costs of processing and collecting delinquencies, the costs of adjusting benefit credits and notifying participants, the additional burden placed on Contractors who faithfully pay their contributions, and the burden upon participants and beneficiaries who may be unable to qualify for benefits they may have otherwise been entitled to but for the delinquency of the Contractor. Because these damages are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify on a case-by-case basis, the parties agree that liquidated damages, not a penalty, for such losses shall be set at the greater of $25 or 20% of the contributions late or unpaid for each Trust Fund. The parties have reviewed the costs of collection by the Trust Funds, and agree that 20% liquidated damages is an accurate projection of the Trusts' damages that result from a delinquency. In addition, any Contractor delinquent in its obligations under this Article shall be required to pay interest on the delinquent contributions (at a rate to be set by the Trustees of the Trust Funds), and any audit fees. In the event that litigation is necessary to collect any delinquent contributions (including litigation to enforce mechanic liens, stop notices, bond claims or similar remedies, and any bankruptcy or receivership proceedings) or to enforce any obligation under this Article, in addition to liquidated damages owed by the delinquent Contractor, the Contractor shall also be liable for all reasonable attorney fees and legal costs incurred in such litigation. The Trustees of the Trust Fund may waive or reduce the amount of liquidated damages, at their sole discretion and consistent with their fiduciary duties. The decision of the Trustees in any request to waive or reduce liquidated damages shall be final and binding upon the parties.
11.	For the purposes of this Agreement, delinquency in failure to make the required reports and contributions to the Trust Fund as determined by the Trustees, shall consist of the following:
a.	Failure	to	submit trust report forms.
b.	Failure	to	report on all employees.
c.	Failure	to	make the payments as required on time.
d.	Failure	to	pay audit amounts and audit fees and
other costs and damages as determined by the Trust.
e.	Failure	of	the bank to honor checks submitted.
f.	Failure	to	pay monies due.
g.	Failure	to	submit to an audit.
12.	In addition to any other remedies under this Article, the Union may terminate the participation of a delinquent contractor. Notice of such termination shall be sent to the Contractor, and each of the employees listed on the last report submitted by that Contractor, and shall be effective 30 days from such notice. Upon
5
termination, no employee of the delinquent Contractor shall accrue credit for any benefits for hours worked for that Contractor. However, termination shall not end or alter the obligations of the Contractor (or any Contractor subcontracting to that Contractor) under this Article. In addition to any other damages under this Article, a Contractor so terminated shall be liable to the Trust Funds for the cost of notice, and shall be liable to its employees for the value of any benefits lost in an amount not exceeding the hourly contributions and liquidated damages that would otherwise have been due.

7.	Contractor Furnishes Information. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor, when ordering workers, to give the employment facility all of the pertinent information regarding the prospective employment.
8.	(a) Dispatch on Nondiscriminatory Basis. The employment facility

The selection of applicants for dispatchment to jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall not be based on, or in any way affected by Union membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership, policies or requirements. The order of preference in the dispatchment of applicants for employment is as follows:
Group A: Applicants whom a Contractor requests by name who have been laid off or terminated from employment of the type covered by this Agreement and in the area served by the particular employment facility, within five (5) years before a request from the same Contractor or joint venture of which one (1) or more members is a former employer, who laid off or terminated them, provided they are available for employment. This provision shall also apply to individual employers wishing to rehire employees of a joint venture of which the individual employer was a member.
Group B: In addition to requests permitted in Group A, above, the Contractor may request for employment any person registered as a ’’Bricktender" on the out-of-work list out of order for any reason; provided, however, that the person has worked at least three hundred (300) hours under this Agreement in the previous six (6) months in the area served by the Local Union employment facility, or has been available for work on the out-of-work list at least 300 hours (calculated at 8 hours per day) at the Local Union employment facility, or a combination of both totaling at least 300 hours. Under this section, working in the area served by the Local Union employment facility shall include a person dispatched to a Contractor in that area and then transferred by the Contractor to another area pursuant to the transfer provisions contained in this Agreement.

7
Group E: The Local Union, through the Brick Tenders' Apprenticeship Training Program. Shall dispatch Apprentices from a separate list on a first-in, first-out basis; that is, the first person registered in that group shall be the first person referred; provided, however, a Contractor may request an Apprentice by name and such Apprentice shall be dispatched regardless of the Apprentice's placement on the list.
(b)	Expedited Dispatch Group: The Union recognizes the need of the Contractor to have the Union dispatch workers on an expedited basis to jobsites, and the Contractor recognizes the requirement for the Union to operate a fair hiring hall. Notwithstanding any such provision of this Article, if the Contractor contacts the Local Union after posted dispatch hours and requests a worker(s) to be dispatched to a jobsite within twenty-four (24) hours of the Contractors' call to the Local Union (and the Contractor does not request the worker by name pursuant to Group A and B, above), the Local Union shall dispatch the person nearest to the top of the out-of-work list who is present at the Local Union hiring hall and if no one is present, then the person nearest the top of the out-of-work list who can be contacted by telephone. If the Local Union cannot contact a person by telephone after one telephone call, the Local Union shall call the next qualified person on the list. A person who is not present at the Local Union hiring hall or reachable by telephone for an Expedited Dispatch shall not be eliminated from the out-of-work list.
(c)	Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, a worker shall be given preference in the order of dispatch under any of the following circumstances:
(i)	A Contractor becomes newly bound to this Agreement and requests the dispatch of its existing employees at the time the Contractor becomes bound.
(ii)	A Contractor agrees to sponsor an employee as a Journeyman Bricktender who has not worked under any Laborers Union Agreement in any geographic area; provided that Contractor agrees in writing that it intends to employ the worker on a full time basis. The Contractor shall send a letter to the Local Union to document its request.
(iii)	A worker is "stripped" from a non-union employer and is dispatched to a Contractor.
(iv)	A worker is a certified job steward and is dispatched to the job to act in such a capacity.
At no time shall any job contain more than fifty percent (50%) of persons requested under subsection (ii), (iii) and (iv), above. Any Local Union, may at its option, permit a percentage of individual requests greater than fifty percent (50%) on any job.
8
(d)	For Contractor requests by name pursuant to the provision of Article II, Section 8 (a), Group A and B and Apprentices, above, the Contractor shall document the request in writing, dated, signed by an appropriate management representative, specifying whether the person is a rehire and names the job for which the referral is requested.
(e)	Available for employment shall mean persons eligible for referral and present at the hiring hall or present at their residence telephone (if the Local Union permits dispatching by telephone) during the Local Union's posted dispatch hours, and all persons eligible for referral and present at the hiring hall after posted dispatch hours, unless excused for the following reasons:
(i)	When death occurs in the immediate family, from the date of death and not exceeding one (1) week after the date of burial; provided, however, that the applicant produces bona fide proof of such death.
(ii)	Persons on jury duty, provided they produce bona fide proof they are serving on jury duty.
(iii)	Persons temporarily serving in the U.S. Military Reserve, provided they produce bona fide proof of such service.
(iv)	Required attendance at a Workers' Compensation hearing or other administrative or court hearing, provided they produce bona fide proof of their required attendance at such hearing.
(v)	Any other reason stated in the Local Union's hiring hall dispatch rules.
(f)	Persons shall be eliminated from the registration list for the following reasons:
(i)	Dispatched to a job, except that a person who is rejected by the Contractor and fails to complete five (5) days of work (or such other period of time set forth in a Local Union's hiring hall dispatch rules) shall retain his/her position on the list. Upon request of the Contractor, no person who is rejected by the Contractor shall be dispatched again to the Contractor. Upon a Local Union's request, the Contractor will confirm its request in writing.
(ii)	Failure to accept the dispatch.
(iii)	Unavailable for employment during posted dispatch hours.
9
(iv)	Failure to report to a job to which the person was dispatched.
(v)	Failure to register or attend roll call in accordance with the Local Union's rules
(vi)	Any other reason stated in the Local Union's hiring hall dispatch rules.
(g)	There is hereby established a Joint Referral Committee consisting of two (2) representatives of the Contractor and two (2) representatives of the Union. The establishment of the Committee is for the purpose of interpreting and enforcing all the terms and provisions of Article II, A. Any person having any disagreement with an applicant's placement or dispatch under Article II, A, shall submit his grievance to the Joint Referral Committee, by filing a written grievance with the Local Union stating the reasons for the grievance within ten (10) working days after the occurrence of the grievance. The Joint Referral Committee shall have full power to adjust the grievance and its decision shall be final and binding upon the person submitting the grievance and all other parties involved in the dispute. In the event of a deadlock of the Joint Referral Committee, the grievance shall be referred to the permanent hiring hall neutral arbitrator, whose decision shall be final and binding. The costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Employer and the Local Union involved in the dispute. Forms for the submission of any such grievance shall be available at all times in the offices of the Local Unions. Neither the Joint Referral Committee nor the permanent hiring hall neutral arbitrator has the authority to modify, vary, change, add to or remove any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.
(h)	The parties agree that, at its option a Local Union may elect to delete Group C by posting written notice of such election at the place of dispatch.
B. 1. New employees who have not worked under this Agreement may be employed by the Contractor as a Journeyman. If so requested by the Contractor and if in accordance with this Agreement. Otherwise, all such employees should be screened and tested by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee to determine whether the employee is a journeyman or should be registered as an apprentice.
2. In the event an employee is employed as a Journeyman at the request of a Contractor pursuant to Section B.l above, and leaves the employment of the Contractor and returns to the Local Union for dispatch, the employee shall be referred to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee for screening and testing to determine whether the employee shall maintain journeyman status or should be registered as an apprentice. The JAC's decision shall determine whether the employee is placed on the journeyman or apprentice out-of-work list for dispatch top another employer.
10
C CONTRACTOR MAY OBTAIN WORKERS FROM ANY SOURCE IF UNION DOES NOT REFER IN TIME. When ordering workers, the Contractor will give notice to the appropriate Local Union, or its Agents, not later than 2:30 p.m. of the day prior (Monday through Friday), or in any event, not less than 17 1/2 hours before the required reporting time; and in the event that 48 hours after such notice, the appropriate Local Union, or its Agents, shall not furnish such workers, the Contractor may procure workers from any other source, or sources. If workers are so employed, the Contractor will immediately report to the Local Union having work and area jurisdiction, or its Agents, each such worker by name.
1.	If the Union is unable to refer applicants for employment to an employer in sufficient number, or sufficient type, from the groups represented within the local area as may be necessary to enable the Employer to fully comply with minority or female hiring requirements imposed by its construction contract with any Federal, State or governmental body, commission or agency or enable the employer to fully comply with all Federal and State Laws, Presidential Executive Order, regulations, rules, directives or orders which cover hiring and which are applicable to the Employer, the Employer may directly recruit from any source such number of minority or female applicants acceptable to the Employer as may be necessary to satisfy the Employer's needs to effect such compliance. As an exception to the dispatch procedures in Article II, the Union may dispatch workers who are not next in order, to aid the Employer in complying with government requirements.
2.	The Employer shall submit to the Union, in writing, any such request for minority or female applicants for employment, together with a copy of the order, directive, rules or regulations pursuant to any such Presidential Executive Order, Federal, State or local law, the Construction project number, and a copy of the compliance order.
D.	UNION MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED ON EIGHTH DAY AFTER EMPLOYMENT OR AFTER EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICHEVER IS LATER. It is agreed that all workers or employees covered hereby shall be, or become members of the Union in good standing on the eighth (8th) day after employment, or on the eighth (8th) day after the execution of this Agreement, whichever is later and remain continuously members in good standing of the Local Unions having work and area jurisdiction and on whose behalf this Agreement is executed as a condition of employment.
The Contractor shall discharge any employee pursuant to the foregoing section upon written notice from the Union of such employee's non-payment of initiation fees or dues. Such written notice shall indicate the amount of initiation fees or dues which are in a state of delinquency and shall give the employee forty-eight (48) hours within which to cure the delinquency. The Contractor agrees to furnish a copy of such notice to the employee forthwith. The Union will hold the Contractor harmless for compliance with this Section.
Subject to the following conditions, the Contractor agrees that the Contractor shall, if the Contractor has been furnished with the employee's written authorization to do so, deduct the sum certified by the Union as the amount owing for
11
supplemental dues from the vacation contribution portion of the wages of each employee covered hereby for each hour worked or paid for in each payroll period special supplemental dues. The Union shall have the right to make allocations of additional contributions from wages hereafter falling due in accordance with Article VII-A.
Said supplemental dues shall be transmitted concurrently with and as a part of the Employer's monthly vacation contribution with respect to his employees covered by this Agreement to the Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern California (Vacation Trust). All sums transmitted by employers pursuant to the above provisions for which authorizations for each employee have not been timely provided shall be deemed vacation contributions to the Vacation Trust and held by it for the account of the employee.
