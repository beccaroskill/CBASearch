AGREEMENT
RECOGNITION AND DURATION
This Agreement is made and entered into this 17th day of March, 2002, by and between Verizon California Inc., R hereinafter referred to as 'Company,' and the Communications Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as "Union." It is I agreed that:
1.	The Company recognizes the Union as the collective bargaining agent for all hourly-paid employees, excluding all other employees (professional employees, managerial employees, guards, supervisors as defined in the Act, and confidential employees as agreed to by the parties), during the life of this Agreement for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment pursuant to National Labor Relations Board Certification, dated September 13,1967.
1.1	The Company agrees to provide in the contract of sale or assignment of its business or any portion thereof, should this occur, that the purchaser or assignee shall be bound by all of the contract rights under this collective bargaining Agreement.
2.	Should any valid Federal or State law or final determination of any board or court of competent jurisdiction affect any provision of this Agreement, the provision or provisions so affected shall be made to conform to the law or determination and otherwise this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
3.	This Agreement (hereafter referred to as 'Primary Agreement*), wage schedules, and job classifications listed in Appendix A shall take effect on March 17, 2002, and R shall remain in full force and effect until midnight, March 19, 2005, and shall automatically continue in full force and effect thereafter until terminated or amended, in accordance with the following procedures:
1
3.1	If this Agreement is to be terminated, a written notice must be sent by either party to the other not less than sixty (60) days prior to the termination date set forth above, or not less than sixty (60) days prior to any date thereafter on which such termination is to become effective.
3.2	This Agreement may be amended or modified by either party giving written notice to the other of such desire to so amend or modify sixty (60) days prior to the termination date set forth above, or sixty (60) days prior to the 1st or 16th day of any month thereafter.
3.3	Addendum One, Group Life Insurance, shall be made a part of this Agreement and shall have the same effective date and termination date as this Primary Agreement.
3.4	Addendum Two, Medical Plan, shall be made a part of this Agreement and shall have the same effective dates and termination dates as this Primary Agreement.
3.5	Addendum Three, Team Performance Award, shall be made a part of this Agreement and shall have the same effective dates and termination dates as this Primary Agreement.
ARTICLE 1 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
1.	Management, at its own discretion, shall have the right to select persons for employment, to retire employees in accordance with the provisions of the "Plan for Employees' Pensions," or to transfer employees from one occupation to another or from one location to another if their services are required in another location for a period of six (6) months or more, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein. Any employee who believes he is being prejudiced in the exercise of these rights by Management shall have the right
2
to proceed tn accordance with Article 12 herein which deals with grievances.
2.	It is agreed from time to time the Company will employ people who do not fully meet the Company's normal employment standards, and place such employees in jobs which they can perform, within their limitations. Nothing in the foregoing, however, will preclude Management assigning these employees to higher rated jobs at a later time if they are qualified to perform the higher rated jobs, provided that such assignment does not supersede a senior qualified employee with a bid on file for the job at that location.
ARTICLE 2 NONDISCRIMINATION CLAUSE
1.	Management will not discriminate directly or indirectly against any employee because of his membership or nonmembership in the Union or because of any Union activity in which he properly engages. Neither the Management nor the Union nor any employee in the bargaining unit will discriminate against or exert either mental or physical duress upon any employee of the Company because of his membership or non-membership in the Union or any other union; provided, however, that the Union will not be liable for the act of any employee who violates this Article and who is not a representative of the Union.
2.	Neither the Company or the Union will discriminate against any employee designated as part of a special class protected by Federal and/or State law.
3.	The use of the masculine or feminine gender in the language or in job titles within this Agreement shall be construed as including both genders.
3
ARTICLE 3
NO LOCKOUT • NO STRIKE CLAUSE
1.	During the life of this Agreement, the Company will not conduct any lockout which will affect the Union or any employees subject to this Agreement.
2,	During the life of this Agreement, the Union and its members will not engage in any strike, walkout or other work stoppage of any nature whatsoever in sympathy with any labor dispute not directly involving the Company or because of any dispute which is subject to arbitration hereunder, and in the event any such strike, walkout, or work stoppage or threat thereof should occur, the Union and its officers will do everything within their power to end or avert the same. Nothing contained in this Section 2 shall be so construed so as to require any member of the bargaining unit to go through any legal picket fine but it is agreed that the failure of members of the bargaining unit to go through a picket line established by any labor organization contesting the right or jurisdiction of the Union or the members of the bargaining unit to perform the Company's normal work is a work stoppage within the meaning of this Section 2,
ARTICLE 4 DISTRIBUTION OF AGREEMENT
1,	The Company and the Union will jointly have copies of this Agreement and the attached wage schedules printed and bound into pocket size pamphlets. The Company will deliver a copy of this pamphlet to each employee and sufficient additional copies will be printed to provide both the Union and the Company with sufficient copies to meet their administrative needs. The costs of printing the contract will be divided equally between the Union and the Company.
4
ARTICLE 5

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
LEAVE OF ABSENCE - VACATION ELIGIBILITY
An employee who returns from a leave of absence, for which credited service is not granted, will be eligible to take an accrued vacation when he has completed twelve months of credited service, computed from the date he was last eligible for vacation, prior to going on leave.
The required completion of 12 months of service is computed by adding the two periods (1) amount of service accrued between date of last vacation eligibility and the start date of the leave, plus (2) date returned from leave up to the accumulation of 12 months of credited service.
Under the provisions stipulated herein, such employee's vacation eligibility date will return to January 1 of the year following the accrual of twelve months of credited service.
For example: An employee begins a six-month leave of absence, for which credited service is not granted, on 10/1777. This employee has five years of service and was eligible for two weeks'vacation on 1/1/77. (Note: He would have either taken his 1977 vacation prior to 10/1/77 or have been paid for it at the time he went on leave.) The employee returns to work on 4/1/78.
To be eligible for a vacation in 1978 the employee will have to work three months. When combining the three months worked in 1978 with the nine months worked in 1977, the employee would meet the requirement of accruing twelve months of credited service.
143
To summarize the example: Employee
Action	Date	Computation
Leave begins	10/1/77	Employee accrued nine months’ vacation eligibility in 1977 (1/1/77 to 9/30/77)
Returns from Leave	4/1/78	
Accrues 12 months' service	7/1/78	4/1/78 to 6/30/78

NATIONAL MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter “CWA" or “the Union") and Verizon Communications companies which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the "Verizon/GTE Companies" or “the Companies' or “the Company") have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
175
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
This agreement between Company and the Union covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing, access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sates and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon's business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principals regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to Verizon’s former “GTE Network Services Companies" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon’s former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1, Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive
176
that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented In a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting wilt be performed by Verizon Labor Relations staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti-Management.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a third party" or “outsider".
(0	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties communications with employees will be In accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
177
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of Interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit,
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will "start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union
178
from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a Labor Union. Management's role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called "Consent Election." This process will work as follows:
0)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use "Consent Election."
(2)	The Union shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The ‘show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be
179
conducted to determine the wifi of the unit if the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN wifi count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% +1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
7.	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the CWA for access, Verizon Labor Relations staff, in conjunction with local management and CWA representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the CWA representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the CWA that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access
180
agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the CWA are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the CWA commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of nonrepresented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate CWA representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the CWA that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either Verizon or the CWA can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
181
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from Sie time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties Verizon and CWA believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN
182
should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the CWA agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issue subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and CWA.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be non*represented, represented in whole or in the part of the CWA, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth shall terminate on July 1,2004, or as otherwise extended and agreed in writing by the parties. If, however, the parties do not reach agreement on successors they shall renew for one year.
