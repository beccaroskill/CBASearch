(3)	Where unusual or one-shot jobs are required which are not usually performed by the Company.
(4)	Where the volume of work on any particular job precludes the possibility of its completion within scheduled time limits.

(5)	Where it would be more cost-effective.

The application of this section shall be reviewed quarterly, or more frequently if requested by either party. Such review will be performed by the Technical Maintenance Services Manager and up to three (3) Facilities Maintenance employees selected by the Union.

All funds so deducted shall be forwarded monthly to the Treasurer of the MNPL as soon as reasonably possible after the end of each month in which deductions are made, accompanied by a record stating the name of employee, social security number, and amount contributed and so deducted.
(l)Such deductions shall be made in accordance with instructions on said authorization cards which have been delivered by the Union to the Payroll Department of the Company.
(2)	Such deductions shall be made each week from the employee's pay check for that week while an employee, as defined in Article I, Section 1, of said Agreement.

(3)	In the event there are more Union Stewards on a shift in a department than are provided for in this Section, the Company shall furnish the Local Union a list of all stewards where the surplus exists and the Local Union shall promptly notify the Company in writing of those employees who are to remain as stewards.

Seniority shall not be carried from other facilities of the Lockheed Martin Corporation except as specifically provided in this Agreement; however, seniority credit for service in a subsidiary corporation or other Division of Lockheed Martin Corporation granted to employees and persons prior to the date of this Agreement shall be continued in effect.
(2)	A part-time employee shall be entitled to seniority in the same proportion that time regularly worked by such part-time employee bears to the time regularly worked by a full-time employee. Part-time employees shall be eligible for health care benefits upon payment of 40% of the health care premium after ninety (90) calendar days of continuous service time from the date the employee starts work after hire or rehire without seniority.
(3)	A full-time employee may be assigned as a part-time employee for up to 120 calendar days by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union and will retain full-time employee placement and layoff rights.
B.	Probationary Period

On matters other than discharge or layoff, such employee shall be entitled to the same representation as other employees. By request of the Company, an employee's probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Company, the Union Business Representative (Base Steward for C.E.G. C, D, or E), and the probationary employee. Such extensions apply solely to the provisions of this paragraph herein.

Such loans will be for a reasonable period of time and any loan extended beyond ninety (90) calendar days will be reviewed by the next higher level of management.

ARTICLE VII
APPLICATION OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Section 1.	Job Descriptions
Job descriptions for the classifications listed in each C.E.G. or for classifications established in each C.E.G. pursuant to Subsection C of Section 1 of this Article are incorporated therein.
The following basic principles govern the preparation of these descriptions; these same principles are to govern their use.
A.	General
(l)The title selected for a classification is that which most clearly indicates the general nature and character of the work performed, and yet serves to set the classification apart from others described.
(2)	The Summary developed for each classification is a brief description of the classification as a whole, the purpose of which is to set it forth in separation from other classifications.
(3)	The job description describes typical and normal requirements. These requirements are characteristic of the job and illustrate a level of difficulty of work and are not intended to list or describe all work operations, or tasks done within the classification. These requirements may not fit all specific individual work assignments, as the description when written was stated so as to be broad enough to include all variations of work in the classification as it existed throughout the Company.
B.	Interpretation and Application of Job Descriptions
(l)The job description is written to define and illustrate the job standard to be established and as such shall be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a composite picture of the job requirements. This means that the Summary, Work Performed (Typical Materials, Tools and Equipment Used, when applicable) and Knowledge and Ability Required, all must be considered in arriving at the proper classification.
(2)	In order to secure, or hold the classification, the employee must be assigned regularly and consistently to that work which distinguishes the classification from other classifications.
(3)	An employee's classification shall be determined in the light of the highest requirements for knowledge, ability and skill necessary to perform his/her regularly assigned duties. In making this determination, duties that are performed infrequently or rarely shall not be considered or made the basis of granting the higher classification. This would not be applicable, however, to intermittent duties of a higher level to which the employee is specifically assigned in an area where
76
Article VII, Section 1
the prevailing day-to-day routine may fall in lower requirements. If the employee on such an assignment is expected to possess and apply the knowledge, skill and ability necessary for performance of the higher level work, he/she is entitled to the higher classification even though the majority of work time may be spent on the lower level work. In such a case, the employee is assigned to bring to the job the higher skills which he/she is expected to use as requirements demand. To cite an example:
An employee spends most of his/her time in the performance of machinist work properly classified as that of a Machinist-Lathe. In addition, he/she is, on occasion, required to perform machinist level work on a milling machine and a planer. Assignment to these latter two machine tools at the machinist level, though it is performed only infrequently, warrants classification as a Machinist-General.
(4)	The job descriptions herein referred to are of a composite nature and do not thereby require an individual employee to perform all of the work therein mentioned, except where the job description indicates otherwise.
(5)	The work operations, duties and other distinguishing characteristics described in a job description are those which are performed under guidance or instruction which is considered usual and normal for the work described.
(6)	The job descriptions are not intended for, and should not be confused with, operation sheets, work instructions, or work assignment sheets, etc.
(7)	Job descriptions were prepared on the basis that:
a.	As a part of promotional procedure, an employee occasionally performs some of the work of higher-rated jobs under close guidance and instructions in order to qualify for advancement.
b.	An employee performs the work of lower-rated jobs when required.
c.	The normal duties of any employee may include assistance to other workers on work operations.
d.	Normal job relationships between employees include giving guidance and instruction to each other, as long as such guidance and instruction is not extended to conflict with the duties of a Lead.
C.	Establishment of New Jobs
(l)The Company shall develop an appropriate job description and place such job in one of the Labor Grades set forth in the affected C.E.G. if, after the effective date of this Agreement, a new job is established as a result of any of the following:
a.	Introduction of new work of a nature comparable to that covered by existing job descriptions for classifications referred to in Section 1 of this Article VII.
b.	The combination of work covered by such existing job descriptions.
c.	A substantial change in the duties or requirements of an established job.
(2)	The Company shall furnish the Local Union with the new job description and shall submit for approval by the Local Union the placement of such classification in one of the Labor Grades for the affected C.E.G.. If agreement on such placement is not

reached within seven (7) calendar days from the date of submission, the Company may place the new job description and rate into effect, subject to continued negotiation of such placement in the Labor Grade structure. The Company will notify the Union on the date the new job description and rate are placed into effect.
(3)	If agreement as to placement in the proper Labor Grade is not reached within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the job is placed into effect, either party may refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Agreement. The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine in which of the Labor Grades the new or amended classification shall be placed on the sole basis of the relationship the new job bears to other classifications in the Labor Grade structure.
(4)	Any change in the established rate resulting from these negotiations shall be retroactive to the.date.the Company placed such rate into effect.
(5)	The Company may reinstate (reactivate) without any change of language, a previously deleted job classification, placing it into the same labor grade in which the job. classification was assigned at the time of its deletion. In reactivating a classification, the Company will notify the Union of the date the classification is to be reactivated and the organizations in which it will be initially used. The Company will not fill any opening in such job classification until fourteen (14) days following notification to the Union.
D._ Classification of an Employee
Each employee shall be placed in the classification proper for the work he/she performs and job descriptions shall be applied in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 of this Article.
Section 2.	Glossary of Terms and Phrases
A. Glossary of Terms and Phrases Used in Job Descriptions
In preparation of the job descriptions the following terms and words are given definition and meaning to clearly indicate the common and consistent interpretation to be placed in them by all persons using the descriptions.
The meaning of words and phrases not included in this glossary shall be as defined in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.
ADAPTS: Means to utilize for other purposes than originally intended.
ANGLE, COMPOUND: Means the angle between the two non-coinciding sides of two oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side in common.
Making a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from the holding within tolerance of two adjoining component angles.
78
Article VH, Section 2
AS REQUIRED: Means performance of work operations if and when such are necessary as long as they are within the level of difficulty described.
AUTHORIZED DOCUMENT: Means any type of document which is used by the Company to transmit to the worker what is to be done, how it is to be done, and/or what specifications or requirements are applicable to the work.
BLUEPRINTS, ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATIONS: Are blueprints which provide information for the installation and/or assembly of fabricated and accessory parts into an assembly.
BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL: Are any class of blueprints which give necessary detailed information for fabricating one or more parts.
BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL ASSEMBLY: Are blueprints which provide information for assembling parts together with the necessary information for making some or all of the individual parts.
CHECK: A clerical function of examining and comparing facts, figures or other data to determine completeness and accuracy.
CHECK, FUNCTIONAL: Means to determine or ascertain whether a unit or a portion of a system performs the function for which it is intended and whether rework or alteration is required.
CHECK OUT, OPERATIONAL: Means making a complete check of an entire completed independent system to determine if rework or alteration is necessary.
CONTOUR: Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths all of which lie in parallel planes or the same plane, such planes being perpendicular to the curved surface, or a curved line having radii of different lengths all of which are in the same plane. The surface of a cone or section thereon, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the curved layout line guiding the making of a router block are examples. Contour surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section of a circle are excluded since the radii are the same length.
CONTOUR, COMPOUND: Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths which lie in non-parallel planes.
CONTOUR, REVERSE: Means a contour that reverses its curvature so that it has both concave and convex portions.

Section 3. Coded Letters For C.E.G. B
Coded Letter B-3
March 2.2002 |
Subject:	UNION STEWARDS
This will set forth the understandings reached between the parties concerning Union Stewards.
1.	Steward Coverage in Decentralized Departments
(a)	If less than ten (10) bargaining unit employees are regularly assigned to a decentralized area of a department without steward coverage, such employees will be represented by the department's Senior Steward, if the Department Manager concerned is willing that such Senior Steward take the time from work necessary for contacts within the decentralized area permitted under applicable sections of the Agreement. Alternatively, employees in such a decentralized area may be represented by a steward from another department. Should this alternative course be taken, the designation of a steward from another department will be the subject of discussions and agreement between the cognizant Union Business Representative and the Labor Relations Manager. In such discussions, the | guidelines set forth under Paragraph 2 (b) below will be observed.
(b)	When ten (10) to twenty-five (25) such employees are assigned to a decentralized area of a department without steward coverage, the Union may elect or appoint an additional Group Steward from among such employees to represent such employees.
(c)	If twenty-five (25) or more such employees are assigned to a decentralized area of a department without steward coverage, the Union may appoint or elect either an additional Group Steward or an additional Senior Steward from among such employees to represent the employees in such area.
2.	Coverage for Departments Without Stewards
(a) In those situations where the Union is unable to designate a steward from among represented employees assigned to a department, and until a steward can be obtained in that department, upon mutual agreement of the cognizant Business Representative and the Labor Relations Manager at Sunnyvale, a steward from | another department may be designated to provide representation.

Part B, Section 3
Coded Letter B-3
0)) The following guidelines shall govern the selection of such steward:
(1)	The steward should be assigned from the same geographical area.
(2)	The steward should be familiar with the department and the nature of its operations.
(3)	The steward should be selected from a department within the same major organization (i.e., Manufacturing, Quality Assurance, Materiel, Finance, etc.) unless such selection would not be consistent with the aforementioned geographical consideration.
3.	A steward designated to provide coverage for a department other than the steward's own will be governed by all applicable provisions of the Agreement with specific reference to the following:
(a)	For purposes of contacts with other stewards and/or discussing complaints or grievances with employees, such a steward will be allowed up to one-half (1/2) hour per shift for all contacts both within the steward's department and the other department to which assigned.
(b)	The steward will be allowed time necessary for meetings with cognizant department managers.
4.	Notification to Departments of Designated Stewards
Labor Relations will defer notification to affected departments of new steward appointments until the effective date of such appointment.
5.	Contacts Between Senior Stewards
It is recognized that a Senior Steward normally represents bargaining unit personnel only in the department to which the steward is assigned, and the steward's contacts with respect to Union and Company-Union matters will be within that department. Contacts with other Senior Stewards in the same building may sometimes be warranted, but will be kept to a minimum, and will be handled in a manner consistent with the provisions of Article II, Section 1.

Subject:	REPRESENTATION - SPECIAL AREAS
This will confirm the understanding reached between the Company and the Union during the recently concluded negotiations for the current Agreement regarding steps to be taken to ensure that employees assigned to special areas are properly represented in matters related to the Agreement.
The Company and the Union will establish a committee comprised of three stewards and a Representative of the Union and three Company representatives, plus the Labor Relations Manager or a designee to meet, confer, and attempt to resolve problems or | Company-Union matters having particular significance in special areas.
The Company, through its representatives on the committee, will take necessaiy steps to enable assignment of stewards in all such areas.

However, it is expected that the committee will work together cooperatively in an effort to ensure conformance with the Agreement and to maintain constructive relations between the employees, the Union and the Company.
The effectiveness of this committee will be reviewed at least once annually during the life of this Agreement by the Area 5 Director, District 725 and the Vice President of Human Resources to determine if modification of this letter of agreement is required. Modification or continued existence of this letter of agreement after each annual review shall require their mutual agreement.
In no way shall the conditions set forth in this letter substitute for or modify any of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

For purposes of this letter, a "red-circled" employee shall be defined as an employee who has been surplused from any of the above classifications into a lower-rated classification while a less-senior employee remains in that classification. Rate of pay and benefits of the higher classification, including appropriate rate progression will be retained. These employees shall be placed on the recall list for the classification from which they have been surplused. When an employee is no longer eligible to be red-circled, rate reduction provisions in accordance with Article VI, Section 1 will apply.
A. Surplus Procedure - the provisions of Article IV, Section 6 shall be modified to the following extent if an employee has placement rights into or within any of the above classifications:
(1)	There will be no displacement into or within any of the classifications listed above except as noted in (a) below. In the event of a surplus, the surplused employee will have the following options:
a.	If employee is in a red-circled classification, may displace the most-senior employee in that classification requesting transfer to a red-circled job.
b.	Where qualified, placement into a lower-rated available opening with red-circle status or placement into a lateral opening.
c.	Displacement of the employee who would have been displaced if the leastsenior in the affected classification was surplused. Such a displacement will cause the surplused employee to be red-circled.
d.	Layoff from the payroll with all rights of a laid off employee.
132
Part B, Section 3
Coded Letter B-9
B. Placement Procedures - The provisions of Article IV, Section 4 and 5 shall be modified to the following extent:

(2)	In the event there are fewer than six employees on the recall list, consideration will be given to employees on the recall list plus the remaining number up to six in the following order:
a.	The most-senior employees requesting lateral transfer within the same classification.
b.	The most-senior qualified employees requesting promotion.
c.	The most-senior qualified employees requesting lateral transfer into the classification.
(3)	If a recall candidate is not selected, all recall candidates who are active employees shall be red-circled and/or the most-senior laid off employee will be placed in the available opening created as a result of the promotion, if any, and red-circled.
(4)	If there are no employees on the recall list, the panel shall be comprised of employees in the order outlined in (2) a, b, and c above.
(5)	Interviews will be arranged at the convenience of management and each candidate. Time off work for this interview will not be unreasonably denied.
(6)	Interviews shall be conducted in seniority order until a selection is made.

In cases where an employee on recall declines to accept a total of six offers made for available openings in any of the above classifications, the employee will no longer be eligible for red-circle status.
(8)	Any one of the six candidates on the panel outlined above may be selected. It is understood that this selection will be made in accordance with all federal and state laws and Article I, Section 12 of the Agreement.

Subject:
OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION
Coded Letter B-15
March 2, 2002
This is to set forth the agreement between the Company and the Union with respect to overtime distribution.
A.	AFFECTED GROUP
An affected group for overtime purposes is normally those employees within a department, classification, workweek and shift; however, by mutual agreement an affected group may be further defined as employees in a supervisory group, and the Union shall not unreasonably refuse to agree. Department Heads and Senior Stewards may .agree on a different definition of affected group based on recognition of operational requirements in their area. All such proposals will be documented in writing, signed by the Department Head and Senior Steward and forwarded to the Area 5 Director, District 725 and the Labor Relations Manager for concurrence or rejection by either party. In the event there is rejection by either party, either party may present their proposal to the Labor Relations Committee. Any such agreement may be terminated by either the Area 5 Director, District or the Labor Relations Manager through written notice to the other party with such notice to become effective within ten (10) working days. In the event such agreement is terminated by either party, overtime records will be handled in accordance with paragraph J of this Coded Letter. (Probationary employees work overtime only after all other employees in the affected group have been scheduled or asked to work.)
B.	OVERTIME RECORDING
(1)	Accurate information will be maintained on Overtime Record, Form LMSC 837-3 or equivalent computerized record, within each department in order to assure equitable distribution of overtime among employees. Hard copies will be given to the Union Steward upon request and will be made available to employees upon request.
(2)	The department's central record will be updated weekly to reflect overtime hours worked or refused.
(3)	Overtime records will be maintained to reflect the equivalent of straight time hours paid. Fractional hours will be rounded off to the nearest tenth of an hour; e.g., 3.3 x 1.5 = 4.95. 5.0 hours will be recorded.
(4)	The Overtime Records will be retained within the Department for two years.
(5)	Overtime hours for an affected group may be “zeroed out” only by agreement with the Senior Steward, Department Head, Area 5 Director, District 725 and the Labor Relations Manager.
140
Part B, Section 3
Coded Letter B-15
(6)	Reduction of hours within an affected group may be made by subtracting a common factor. For example, in an affected group where all employees have more than 100 accumulated hours, all may be reduced by 100, resulting in no relative change within the group.
C.	SCHEDULING
(1)	Affected employees will be notified of overtime work schedules as soon as reasonably possible. An employee absent from work normally will not be scheduled for overtime until returning to work after the absence. Normally, if an employee accepts weekend overtime and is absent on Friday, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled unless the Friday absence is for an approved one day vacation, personal leave or Union call-out. Similarly, if an employee is asked to work overtime two days hence but is absent the day before the scheduled overtime, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled. If overtime offered is canceled, the employee will be notified when reporting their absence to supervision.
(2)	The Company normally will offer the first available overtime to the employee with the lowest accumulated overtime hours in the affected group who is qualified to perform the work involved unless continuity of work operations requires an employee to follow through on work started during regular working hours.
When due to specific job skills or job continuity requirements an employee's accumulated overtime is substantially higher than that of the next person in the affected group, and it appears that the overtime difference will continue to grow, the department will initiate appropriate cross training for interested employees who are qualified to be cross trained. The cross trained employee with the lowest accumulated overtime will be rotated into the job being performed by the high overtime employee. Refusal of cross training will be documented.
(3)	An employee who refuses overtime will be charged for those hours offered unless the employee who worked was sent home early at Company request, in which case the actual hours worked will be charged.
(4)	No charge will be made to the overtime record if overtime is refused because:
a.	The overtime assignment is on an agreed upon holiday.
b.	The employee is on Union business and the Company has been properly notified.
c.	The employee is on jury duty during the day when the overtime is to be worked or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a Court of Law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
d.	Overtime is on the 6th or 7th day immediately preceding or following the employee’s vacation of at least one week.
e.	Overtime work anticipated is subsequently canceled.
f.	The employee is called for temporary military duty.

(5)	Employees who do not want to work overtime or do not want to change job assignment or location necessary for more equitable distribution of overtime, shall indicate those preferences in writing. Such written notice wi 11 remain active for a minimum of 90 calendar days.
(6)	If a sufficient number of employees in the affected group are not available for overtime work after the appropriate trainee classification is exhausted, supervision normally, as determined by operational requirements, will attempt to locate employees in the following order:
Department	Classification	Shift	■
a. Same	Different	Same	
b. Same	Same	Different	
c. Same	Different	Different	
(7)	If a .sufficient number of employees are not available after exhausting the provisions of Paragraph 6, the Department Manager may impose Mandatory Overtime as defined under either Short Term Mandatory Overtime or Extended Mandatory Overtime, or may attempt to locate employees in other departments in the following order:
Department	Classification	Shift
a.	Different	Same	Same
b.	Different	Different	Same
c.	Different	Different	Different
(8)	If a sufficient number of employees are not available after exhausting the provisions of Paragraphs 7a, b, and c, the Department Manager may still impose Mandatory Overtime as defined under either Short Term Mandatory Overtime or Extended Mandatory Overtime.
D.	MANDATORY OVERTIME DEFINITIONS
An extended mandatory workweek may be established in recognition of operational requirements. Such overtime may be short term or long term as defined below.
The approval of the Department Head is required whenever mandatory overtime is to be invoked.
(1)	Short Term Mandatory Overtime
Short term mandatory overtime is an overtime assignment such as one day or one weekend, normally directed to the least-senior employee(s) in the affected group.
When mandatory overtime is required on successive days, it shall be rotated. The least-senior employee(s) in the affected group will be required to work overtime on the first day, the second least-senior employee(s) on the second day, etc.
142
Part B, Section 3
Coded Letter B-15
In the event of a hardship situation affecting an employee's ability to work, the employee may request a hardship exemption in writing, and if the cause of the employee's hardship cannot be resolved, the employee will not be directed to work overtime, but will be charged with the highest overtime worked.
(2)	Extended Mandatory Overtime
Extended mandatory overtime is a work schedule that exceeds one week requiring the affected overtime group to work in excess of their normal shift or workweek. The operational requirements that necessitate the extended mandatory overtime will be documented by the Department Head to the Labor Relations Manager and | forwarded to the Union. Employees will be notified of such mandatory overtime in writing.
In the event of a hardship situation affecting an employee's ability to work, the employee may request a hardship exemption in writing. Such request must be submitted to the Department Head for approval. When an employee has such an approved request on file, the employee will not be asked to work the overtime, but will be charged with the highest overtime worked in each one day period.
E.	OVERTIME CHARGES - WHEN ALL OR PART OF OVERTIME SHIFT OFFERED IS NOT WORKED
(1)	When all or part of the overtime shift offered is not worked due to cancellation by management, employees will be charged only for hours worked. Employees who initially declined overtime will be charged for hours worked. The charge will be deleted if overtime is canceled before the end of the shift in which the overtime is offered.
(2)	Tardies
An employee who is tardy in reporting to an overtime assignment will be charged the full amount of time scheduled to be worked.
(3)	Short Times
An employee who short times when work still is available, will be charged for the time scheduled to be worked.
(4)	Absences
An employee who has agreed to work overtime but fails to report for work without a legitimate excuse will be charged for double the time scheduled to be worked.
(5)	Employees who accept overtime and then do not report as scheduled for the accepted overtime may be subject to disciplinary action in addition to the appropriate overtime charges.

Coded Letter B-22
March 8, 2002
Subject:	9/80 ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE
The Union and the Company have thoroughly discussed implementation of the 9/80 alternative work schedule. The following summarizes our understanding:
1.	The 9/80 alternative work schedule may be implemented based on operational requirements subject to a 2/3 approval vote of the total affected employees. The affected group will be identified to the Union 30 days prior to the vote; either party may address any group irregularities for consideration. The vote will be conducted by the Union in the facility. The first vote will be to establish a pilot program and can be conducted once annually.
2.	There will be a six-month pilot program starting on an agreed upon date. Continuation of the program after completion of the six-month pilot program will be mutually decided between the Union and the Company after another 2/3 approval vote (once annually), conducted by the Union, of the total affected group.
3.	The basic 9/80 workweek will include a nine (9) hour workday Monday through Thursday; an eight (8) hour workday Friday and an “off" Friday every other week. The workweek will begin at mid-shift on Friday. The 9/80 work schedule retains a 40 hour workweek (see attached workweek schedule) and may have two tracks. Track “A"" and Track “B”. Where there are two tracks, initial track selection will be by volunteer by seniority.
4.	Each pay period will be for 40 hours unless overtime is worked.
5.	Overtime pay at time-and-one-half will be paid for hours worked in excess of nine (9) on a nine (9) hour workday (Monday through Thursday) and over eight (8) on the work Friday. Overtime at time-and-one-half will be paid for work on an “off’ Friday. All other provisions requiring the payment of overtime will continue in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
6.	Vacation pay may be taken up to nine (9) hours for a vacation day taken on a nine (9) hour day Monday through Thursday; and up to eight (8) hours for a vacation day taken on a work Friday, or in increments as currently allowed under the CBA. The accrual policy will remain the same as defined in the CBA.
148
Part B, Section 3
Coded Letter B-22
7.	Sick leave may be taken in increments in accordance with the CBA or up to nine (9) hours for full workdays Monday through Thursday and eight (8) hours on a work Friday.
8.	Holiday pay will be nine (9) hours for a Holiday that falls on Monday through Thursday and eight (8) hours for a Holiday that falls on a "work Friday.” No payment will be made for a Holiday that falls on an “off’ Friday. However, payment for hours worked on a designated Friday Holiday will be paid at the double time rate.
9.	Total Holiday hours under the 9/80 work schedule will not be less than what is negotiated under the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
a) If the 9/80 work schedule results in a reduction of negotiated Holiday hours, these hours will be credited to the employee’s vacation account annually.
10.	An employee who is unable to work regularly scheduled hours due to jury/witness duty will be paid nine (9) hours for Monday through Thursday and eight (8) hours for a “work Friday” not to exceed the total number of days covered under the CBA.
11.	The number of employees scheduled on either track (“A” or “B”) at any time will be determined based on operational requirements. Initial selection of employees will be by volunteers by seniority. Once an employee is assigned to a track, the Company will not reassign to another track without mutual agreement, provided that operational needs are satisfied.
12.	The following procedure shall apply in the transfer of employees between schedules and tracks:
a)	Employees may submit a written request to transfer from one schedule/track to another schedule/track once each 12 months in accordance with operational requirements. However, the Company will not be obligated to transfer any employee between schedules/tracks.
b)	Any employee transferring in accordance with this provision shall have “Holiday” hours adjusted in order to prevent any loss in negotiated “Holiday” hours resulting from a transfer. Adjustments to paid holiday hours will be made to the employee’s vacation account. If an employee changes work schedules or 9/80 tracks, the effective date of the change will be at mid-shift Friday.
13.	Exemptions from the 9/80 schedule or variances may be approved on an individual basis by the cognizant manager as operational requirements allow to accommodate certain hardships such as those related to personal health, medical care, daycare, and transportation. An employee who is denied may file a grievance at Step 2.

14.	It is not the Company’s intent to utilize the 9/80 to circumvent the overtime provisions of the CBA not covered by this letter.
15.	The provisions of this agreement apply only while a 9/80-work schedule is in force and effect. Should a 5/40-work schedule need to be implemented by the Company for any reason, the provisions of the current labor agreement will appjy. Should this be necessary, the Company would give the Union and the employees at least 30 days advance notice, unless operational requirements require more immediate implementation.
16.	A Friday attendance infraction can only count as one infraction.
17.	This letter of understanding will be reviewed annually for continued concurrence.

Subject:	PROCESSING OF GRIEVANCES - STEPS 2 AND 3
During the recent contract negotiations the parties mutually agreed to process grievances in Steps 2 and 3 of the Grievance Procedure (Reference Article III, Section 2) in the following manner:
Step 2
The grievance shall be delivered by the Steward to the Human Resources Office of the Company. After investigation, the Human Resources Representative and the Base Steward shall meet and use their best efforts to reach a settlement. If agreement is reached, the Step 1 answer may be either modified or agreed upon with the Base Steward acknowledging by signing the grievance as a Step 1-1/2 settlement. If the grievance remains unsettled, another meeting shall be held at the request of either party.
At a minimum, the attendees shall be: the above representatives and the assigned Union Business Representative. If, after discussion, a settlement cannot be reached after twenty (20) working days, either party may move the grievance in accordance with Step 3.
Step 3
The Union shall notify the Human Resources Office that it desires to present the grievance to the Labor Relations Committee. Union representation on this Committee shall consist of three (3) employees of the C.E.G. and the Business Representative or an authorized representative. Company representatives shall consist of a like number to be chosen in such a manner as the Company may desire.
The Santa Cruz Facility Base Steward and the Human Resources Representative will not normally be members of the Labor Relations Committee. The Base Steward may be a member if he/she has not participated in prior steps of the grievance being presented to the committee. The decision of the Labor Relations Committee shall be considered final if a majority of the Union Representatives and a majority of the Company Representatives concur. If the Committee fails to settle a grievance, either party may proceed in accordance with Step 4 of the Grievance Procedure.
Time limits established above may be extended by mutual understanding.

Subject:	SANTA CRUZ FACILITY HOURLY ATTENDANCE CONTROL
PLAN
PURPOSE
In order to reduce absenteeism, establish reasonable standards of employee attendance, provide a uniform means to enforce these standards, and provide recognition of good attendance habits, the Company and the Union have agreed to the following. In recognition of the unique location of the Santa Cruz Facility (SCF) and the fact that difficulties accessing the Facility may occur, the Company and the Union agree to the following modifications to the Hourly Attendance Control Plan Letter of Agreement.
GENERAL
A.	Regular attendance by each employee is essential so that Company work may be performed on schedule.
B.	This Procedure provides a uniform guide for management's use in monitoring attendance and taking appropriate action.
C.	Management judgment must be exercised in applying these standards. Consideration must be given to the facts in each employee's case before taking disciplinary action. Cases which the organization manager believes warrant deviation from the disciplinary sequence in Procedure B.4., below, should be reviewed with the Labor Relations Manager.	|
PROCEDURE
A. Attendance
1.	The following attendance codes are infractions (except as noted) for purpose of this Procedure: B, N, 0, S, T.
NOTE: (1) A maximum of three periods of B code absences per calendar year shall be excused if preceded by a medically authorized W code, as specified in Paragraph 4 below, or doctor's verification is received for the days absent. Such B code absences are to be circled on the employee's record.

(2)	In instances where an employee’s tardiness is caused by a verified circumstance such as road closures or adverse weather conditions causing unsafe driving conditions, Acts of God, fire or flood, the SCF Human Resources Representative will inform Base supervision that such attendance code will be circled and not charged as an attendance infraction.
(3)	Paid sick leave days of absence will not be attendance infractions.
2.	Any one continuous period of B or 0 codes is considered as one infraction.
3.	In situations where an employee can show that his/her phone service has been lost due to storms, etc., consideration shall be given regarding his/her inability to report an absence.
4.	Reasonable allowance for part-day absence for necessary medical/dental care is provided when an employee submits written verification of doctor and dentist visits. Such part-day absences are coded W for a maximum of six within a calendar year. Beyond six, each is documented as a short-time infraction (code S).
The Company will review cases where mitigating circumstances may be present to determine if additional verified doctor or dentist visits should be excused.
5.	Employees who become ill after reporting to their work station and starting their shift may be granted an approved W code at the discretion of supervision, prior to leaving the plant. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.
6.	All absences must be reported, if possible, within two (2) hours of the start of shift to the supervisor or department office. At that time, the anticipated length of absence and/or expected return date should be explained. If unable to call personally, each employee should have someone call for them where possible.
7.	A reported absence is valid until the date of return specified by the employee or, if the return date is indefinite, for two working days. The third day of absence constitutes the first day of unreported absence.

Part C, Section 3
Coded Letter C-7
B.	Discipline
1.	Employees having combined attendance infractions as specified in A.I., which exceed five (5) in the preceding six-month (or shorter) period are considered to have unsatisfactory attendance and are subject to progressive disciplinary action as set forth in B.4.
2.	When it is apparent that an employee's attendance infractions are approaching the unsatisfactory level for the first time, that employee should be counseled about the importance of regular attendance.
3.	Prior to imposing discipline, the complete attendance record of the employee should be reviewed and the nature and frequency of infractions considered.
4.	Progressive disciplinary action for unsatisfactory attendance, as specified in B.I., will be imposed in the following sequence:
a.	Oral Criticism - recorded on record. The employee must be advised of action in writing.
b.	Employee Performance Notice - formal written criticism.
c.	Second Employee Performance Notice - formal written criticism.
NOTE: When it is apparent that an employee’s attendance infractions may result in dismissal, the employee will be counseled in order to ensure the employee has a clear understanding of the severity of the situation and the imminent possibility of dismissal.
d.	Dismissal.
NOTE: An employee may be subject to termination depending upon the circumstances involved without regard to the progressive discipline sequence if absence from work becomes excessive to the point that the individual has become unemployable or whenever an employee's attendance is considered unsatisfactory even after applying aforementioned standards set forth in Section B.4. above. All such cases must be reviewed by the Labor Relations Manager prior to termination.

5-	The following criteria are guides to the administration of disciplinary action: a. Each month, normally during the first week, each employee's attendance record is examined by the department.
b.	When an employee's attendance infractions exceed five (5) within any sixmonth (or shorter) period, that employee's record must be reviewed for possible disciplinary action.
c.	Once discipline has been issued for specified attendance infractions, those infractions cannot be counted in determining the need for subsequent discipline. A new six-month period begins immediately after the issuance of discipline.
d.	When an employee who has received disciplinary action makes a serious attempt to improve his or her attendance record, the following recognition shall be given for the effort.
(1)	If the employee compiles five or fewer attendance infractions in a sixmonth period following receipt of disciplinary action, that disciplinary action shall be cancelled insofar as issuance of subsequent disciplinary action is concerned, (i.e., the disciplinary action remains in the record but is not considered in the event of subsequent unsatisfactory attendance.)
Example: An employee has been given oral criticism followed by the first Employee Performance Notice (EPN). In a six-month period following receipt of the EPN, only five attendance infractions occur. Five months later the employee compiles six infractions; the discipline issued will be an EPN.
(2)	If the employee compiles five or fewer attendance infractions in any two consecutive six-month periods following receipt of disciplinary action, then two steps of prior discipline shall be cancelled; (i.e., the disciplinary action remains in the record but is not considered in the event of subsequent unsatisfactory attendance.)
Example: Referring to the example cited in d(l) above, the Oral Criticism and the EPN would not be considered in the event the employee's attendance subsequently becomes unsatisfactory.
e.	Prior to dismissal of an employee, the Base Human Resources Representative must be consulted.
166
Part C, Section 3
Coded Letter C-7
6.	Absentee terminations
a.	A five-day unreported absence (or four-day for employees on a 4x10 workweek) on scheduled workdays without a reasonable explanation for failure to report shall be considered a resignation.
b.	If an employee’s medical absence continues for more than 10 consecutive workdays, medical documentation must be submitted to the Company certifying the employee’s disability. An employee who fails to provide such documentation may be terminated (unless a reasonable explanation is offered for not complying).
c.	To effect the termination of an absent employee under this procedure, a telephone call will be made followed by a registered letter sent to the employee's address of record.
C.	Commendation
Employees with six months of perfect attendance should receive a Commendation Notice. Perfect attendance is defined as no absences, tardiness or short-times except those caused by military duty, Union business, jury duty, vacation or holidays.
D.	Implementation
1.	Responsibility for maintaining attendance standards rests with each organization manager.
2.	Employees should be made aware of the attendance requirements set forth in this Procedure.
3.	The Base Human Resources Representative is available to assist in the interpretation and application of attendance standards.
Please refer questions to your Base Human Resources Representative.

Subject:OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION
This is to set forth the agreement between the Company, and the Union with respect to overtime distribution.
A.	AFFECTED GROUP
An affected group for overtime purposes is normally those employees within a department, classification, workweek and shift: however, by mutual agreement an affected group may be further defined as employees in a supervisory group, and the Union shall not unreasonably refuse to agree. Department Heads and Senior Stewards may agree on a different definition of affected group based on recognition of operational requirements in their area. All such proposals will be documented in writing, signed by the Department Head and Senior Steward and forwarded to the Area 5 Director, District 725 and the Labor Relations Manager for concurrence or rejection by either party. In the event there is rejection by either party, either party may present their proposal to the Labor Relations Committee. Any such agreement may be terminated by either the Area 5 Director, District or the Labor Relations Manager through written notice to the other party with such notice to become effective within ten (10) working days. In the event such agreement is terminated by either party, overtime records will be handled in accordance with paragraph J of this Coded Letter. (Probationary employees work overtime only after all other employees in the affected group have been scheduled or asked to work.)
B.	OVERTIME RECORDING
(1)	Accurate information will be maintained on Overtime Record, Form LMSC 837-3 or equivalent computerized record, within each department in order to assure equitable distribution of overtime among employees. Hard copies will be given to the Union Steward upon request and will be made available to employees upon request.
(2)	The department's central record will be updated weekly to reflect overtime hours worked or refused,
(3)	Overtime records will be maintained to reflect the equivalent of straight time hours paid. Fractional hours will be rounded off to the nearest tenth of an hour: e.g„ 3.3 x 1.5 = 4.95. 5.0 hours will be recorded.
(4)	The Overtime Records will be retained within the Department for two years.
(5)	Overtime hours for an affected group may be "zeroed out” only by agreement with the Senior Steward. Department Head, Area 5 Director, District 725 and the Labor Relations Manager.

Coded Letter C-13
(6)	Reduction of hours within an affected group may be made by subtracting a common factor. For example, in an affected group where all employees have more than 100 accumulated hours, all may be reduced by 100, resulting in no relative change within the group.
C.	SCHEDULING
(1)	Affected employees will be notified of overtime work schedules as soon as reasonably possible. An employee absent from work normally will not be scheduled for overtime until returning to work after the absence. Normally, if an employee accepts weekend overtime and is absent on Friday, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled unless the Friday absence is for an approved one day vacation, personal leave or Union call-out. Similarly, if an employee is asked to work overtime two days hence but is absent the day before the scheduled overtime, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled. If overtime offered is canceled, the employee will be notified when reporting their absence to supervision.
(2)	The Company normally will offer the first available overtime to the employee with the lowest accumulated overtime hours in the affected group who is qualified to perform the work involved unless continuity of work operations requires an employee to follow through on work started during regular working hours.
_____________When due to specific job skills or job continuity requirements an employee's accumulated overtime is substantially higher than that of the next person in the affected group, and it appears that the overtime difference will continue to grow, the department will initiate appropriate cross training for interested employees who are qualified to be cross trained. The cross trained employee with the lowest accumulated overtime will be rotated into the job being performed by the high overtime employee. Refusal of cross training will be documented.
(3)	An employee who refuses overtime will be charged for those hours offered unless the employee who worked was sent home early at Company request, in which case the actual hours worked will be charged.
(4)	No charge will be made to the overtime record if overtime is refused because:
a.	The overtime assignment is on an agreed upon holiday.
b.	The employee is on Union business and the Company has been properly notified.
c.	The employee is on jury duty during the day when the overtime is to be worked or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a Court of Law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
d.	Overtime is on the 6th or 7th day immediately preceding or following the employee's vacation of at least one week,
e.	Overtime work anticipated is subsequently canceled.
g.	The employee is called for temporary military duty.

(5)	Employees who do not want to work overtime or do not want to change job assignment or location necessary for more equitable distribution of overtime, shall indicate those preferences in writing. Such written notice will remain active for a minimum of 90 calendar days.
(6)	If a sufficient number of employees in the affected group are not available for overtime work after the appropriate trainee classification is exhausted, supervision normally, as determined by operational requirements, will attempt to locate employees in the following order:
	Department	Classification	Shift
a.	Same	Different	Same
b.	Same	Same	Different
c.	Same	Different	Different
(7)	If a sufficient number of employees are not available after exhausting the provisions of Paragraph 6, the Department Manager may impose Mandatory Overtime as defined under either Short Term Mandatory Overtime or Extended Mandatory Overtime, or may attempt to locate employees in other departments in the following order:
	Department	Classification	Shift
a.	Different	Same	Same
b.	Different	Different	Same
c.	Different	Different	Different
<8} If a sufficient number of employees are not available after exhausting the provisions of Paragraphs 7a. b. and c. the Department Manager may still impose Mandatory Overtime as defined under either Short Term Mandatory Overtime or Extended Mandatory Overtime.
D.	MANDATORY OVERTIME DEFINITIONS
An extended mandatory workweek may be established in recognition of operational requirements. Such overtime may be short term or long term as defined below.
The approval of the Department Head is required whenever mandatory overtime is to be invoked.
(1)	Short Term Mandatory Overtime
______Short term mandatory overtime is an overtime assignment such as one day or one weekend, normally directed to the least-senior employee! s) in the affected group.
______When mandatory overtime is required on successive days, it shall be rotated. The least-senior employeefs) in the affected group will be required to work overtime on the first day, the second least-senior employee! s) on the second day, etc.

a.	When an employee is on vacation.
b.	When an employee is on extended recognized Union business.
c.	When an employee is on jury duty or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a Court of Law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.

(1)	Posting - The permanent (home) department overtime record will be posted as notification is received from the borrowing department of overtime hours worked.
(2)	Distribution of Overtime to Employees on Loan - Departments utilizing the services of employees on loan from other departments will use the following basic rules as a guide in the distribution of overtime:
a. Employees who have been on loan for less than ten (10) working days will not be considered eligible for overtime. Exceptions to this rule may be made when any of the following conditions exists:
1.	All of the affected employees of the department are required to work overtime.
1.	The borrowed employee possesses special skills necessary to perform the overtime assignment, and none of the affected employees of the department is qualified to perform the work.
3. Continuity of work operations requires the borrowed employee to follow through on overtime work started during regular working hours. When this condition exists to the point that operational requirements would be adversely affected, the employee on temporary loan may be assigned to the overtime work.
178
Part C, Section 3
Coded Letter C-13
b. Employees who have been on loan for ten (10) or more working days will be considered members of the "affected group” in the borrowing department for purposes of equitable distribution of overtime.

______EXAMPLE: If there are 10 names in the affected group, add the overtime of the 5 highest and divide by 5.
J.	ADDITION OF TRANSFERRED OR RECALLED EMPLOYEES
The average overtime charged to and/or worked by others in the affected group as of the date the employee begins work in the new affected group will be calculated and posted to the overtime record for the transferred or recalled employee.
K.	CONSOLIDATION OF TWO OR MORE DEPARTMENTS
(1)	Overtime hours will revert to zero for employees in a classification common to two or more of the consolidated departments.
(2)	Overtime records will be carried over without change for employees in a classification common to only one department.

Subject: 9/80 ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE
The Union and the Company have thoroughly discussed implementation of the 9/80 alternative work schedule. The following summarizes our understanding:
1.	The 9/80 alternative work schedule may be implemented based on operational requirements subject to a 2/3 approval vote of the total affected employees. The affected group will be identified to the Union 30 days prior to the vote; either party may address any group irregularities for.consideration. The vote will be conducted by the Union in the facility. The first vote will be to establish a pilot program and can be conducted once annually.
2.	There will be a six-month pilot program starting on an agreed upon date. Continuation of the program after completion of the six-month pilot program will be mutually decided between the Union and the Company after another 2/3 approval vote (once annually), conducted by the Union, of the total affected group.
3.	The basic 9/80 workweek will include a nine (9) hour workday Monday through Thursday; an eight (8) hour workday Friday and an “off’ Friday every other week. The workweek will begin at mid-shift on Friday. The 9/80 work schedule retains a 40 hour workweek (see attached workweek schedule) and may have two tracks,' Track “A” and Track “B”. Where there are two tracks, initial track selection will be by volunteer by seniority.
4.	Each pay period will be for 40 hours unless overtime is worked.
5.	Overtime pay at time-and-one-half will be paid for hours worked in excess of nine (9) on a nine (9) hour workday (Monday through Thursday) and over eight (8) on the work Friday. Overtime at time-and-one-half will be paid for work on an “off’ Friday. All other provisions requiring the payment of overtime will continue in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
6.	Vacation pay may be taken up to nine (9) hours for a vacation day taken on a nine (9) hour day Monday through Thursday; and up to eight (8) hours for a vacation day taken on a work Friday, or in increments as currently allowed under the CBA. The accrual policy will remain the same as defined in the CBA,

7.	Sick leave may be taken in increments in accordance with the CBA or up to nine (9) hours for full workdays Monday through Thursday and eight (8) hours on a work Friday.
8.	Holiday pay will be nine (9) hours for a Holiday that falls on Monday through Thursday and eight (S') hours for a Holiday that falls on a “work Friday.” No payment will be made for a Holiday that falls on an “off” Friday. However, payment for hours worked on a designated Friday Holiday will be paid at the double time rate. ,
9.	Total Holiday hours under the 9/80 work schedule will not be less than what is negotiated under the 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
a) If the 9/80 work schedule results in a reduction of negotiated Holiday hours, these hours will be credited to the employee’s vacation account annually.
IQ.An employee who is unable to work regularly scheduled hours due to jury/witness duty will be paid nine (9) hours for Monday through Thursday and eight (8) hours for a ‘"work Friday” not to exceed the total number of days covered under the CBA.
11.	The number of employees scheduled on either track (“A” or “B”) at any time will be determined based on operational requirements. Initial selection of employees will be by volunteers by seniority. Once an employee is assigned to a track, the Company will not reassign to another track without mutual agreement, provided that operational needs are satisfied.
12.	The following procedure shall apply in the transfer of employees between schedules and tracks:
a)	Employees may submit a written request to transfer from one schedule/track to another schedule/track once each 12 months in accordance with operational requirements. However, the Company will not be obligated to transfer any employee between schedules/tracks.
b)	Any employee transferring in accordance with this provision shall have “Holiday” hours adjusted in order to prevent any loss in negotiated “Holiday” hours resulting from a transfer. Adjustments to paid holiday hours will be made to the employee’s vacation account. If an employee changes work schedules or 9/80 tracks, the effective date of the change will be at mid-shift Friday.
13.	Exemptions from the 9/80 schedule or variances may be approved on an individual basis by the cognizant manager as operational requirements allow to accommodate certain hardships such as those related to personal health, medical care, daycare, and transportation. An employee who is denied may file a grievance at Step 2.

14. It is not the Company’s intent to utilize the 9/80 to circumvent the overtime provisions of the CBA not covered by this letter.
15,The provisions of this agreement apply only while a 9/80-work schedule is in force and effect. Should a 5/40-work schedule need to be implemented by the Company for any reason, the provisions of the current labor agreement will apply. Should this be necessary, the Company would give the Union and the employees at least 30 days advance notice, unless operational requirements require more immediate implementation.
16.	A Friday attendance infraction can only count as one infraction.
17.	This letter of understanding will be reviewed annually for continued concurrence.

Subject:	OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION AND RECORD KEEPING
This agreement between the Company and the California Central Coast Lodge 2786 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is entered into following a review of local overtime practices, understanding and agreements. The purpose of this agreement is to standardize overtime procedures for the benefit of both parties. Nothing herein is intended or understood as a deterrent to Management or the Local Union on any other matter other than the establishment of a standardized overtime agreement of all local organizations. The agreement supersedes all prior local practices, and agreements or parts thereof, whether written or oral, and is not in any way intended to give or gain an advantageous overtime position to any employees.
A.	GENERAL
In order to assure equitable distribution of overtime among employees, uniform records shall be maintained within each organization/department. Overtime lists shall normally be by employee classification or "work group", by shift and organization/department. (Work group as used herein means several related classifications of employees working together as a work unit.)
B.	POSTING PROCEDURE
(1)	Enter employee's name by shift, by classification or "work group", cumulative overtime balance brought forward, number of overtime hours worked each day, number of hours charged at the appropriate rate if overtime is refused, and any absence code if the employee is not at work. Overtime records will be maintained to reflect the equivalent of straight time hours.
(2)	No charge or entry will be made to the overtime record if overtime is refused because:
a.	The overtime assignment is on an agreed upon holiday.
b.	The employee is on Union business and the Company has been properly notified.
c.	The employee is on jury duty during the day when the overtime is to be worked or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a Court of Law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
193
Part D, Section 4
Coded Letter D-3
d.	Overtime is on the 6th or 7th day immediately preceding or following employee’s vacation.
e.	Overtime work anticipated is subsequently canceled.
f.	On the day an employee is called for temporary military duty.
An employee who refused overtime for any reason not listed above will be charged an amount equivalent to the time worked had the employee accepted.
(3)	An employee who is absent for over five (5) working days will be charged overtime hours in the amount of the average overtime worked by their work group during the absence, except in the following listed circumstances: (Note: No entry is made to the employee's O.T. Record when there is an absence of five (5) working days or less.)
a.	When an employee is on vacation.
b.	When an employee is on extended recognized Union business.
c.	When an employee is on jury duty or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a Court of Law in a case to which employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
d.	When an employee is required to engage in annual two (2) consecutive weeks of Military Reserve training.
e.	Employees may be returned to regular duty after medical restrictions are removed that prevented any overtime being worked. The amount of O.T. worked divided by the number of eligible employees in the work group, from the date the restrictions were imposed to the date the restrictions were removed, shall be added to the employees O.T. Record. This would not apply to an employee who was injured on the job and is the subject of a Worker's Compensation case. This employee would retain the overtime hours accumulated immediately prior to the injury.
(4)	A new/recalled employee is added to the overtime group when employee becomes eligible to work overtime. Calculate the average overtime hours of the highest fifty percent (50%) of the employees in the classification or “work group” on their shift and show the average by inserting a red circled figure on the overtime list.
194
Part D, Section 4
Coded Letter D-3
(5)	When an employee is transferred from one “work group” to another (other than temporary) use the following formula to determine employees new overtime average:
EMPLOYEE'S PRESENT OVERTIME TOTAL
PRESENT WORK GROUP AVERAGE
EQUALS (=)
EMPLOYEE'S NEW AVERAGE
NEW WORK GROUP AVERAGE
EXAMPLE:
An employee with sixty (60) hours charged overtime is transferred from Organization A to B. The average in A's overtime group is seventy-five (75) and the average in the B overtime group is sixty (60). The employee's new overtime charge in Organization B is as shown:
60	EMPLOYEE'S NEW AVERAGE
75	60
60	48
75	60
However, in no case is a transferred employee’s new average to be greater than that of the highest employee in the new group, or below that of the lowest in the new "work group". If such be the case, the employee will be assigned either the highest or the lowest figure in the new group. The new average is to be indicated by a circled red figure on the overtime list.
(6)	Employees (including leads) who are temporarily loaned from one “work group” to another, for more than a one (1) day assignment, will assume the average overtime hours (after two (2) calendar days) of the “work group” to which they are reporting. When the employee returns to the permanent “work group” any overtime worked or refused will be posted to the employees' permanent overtime record. An employee on travel or field duty shall have all overtime charged (worked, refused, traveled) added to the permanent overtime record upon return from such assignment.
195
Part D, Section 4
Coded Letter D-3
Employees temporarily transferred or promoted to a position outside the CEG will be charged with the overtime hours worked by the employee or the average of the employee's group while the employee was absent, whichever is greater.
(7)	An employee who does not want to be offered overtime should submit a signed written notice to that effect. The written notice will be placed in the organization/ department personnel folder. The overtime record will show: “employee declines overtime. See written notice dated (date).” The employee must understand they are still subject to work if operational requirements so dictate. Should the written notice be rescinded at a later date, the employee shall be reaveraged into the operational unit as a new employee, thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the dated written notice (employee will not be eligible to work overtime until reaveraged in the work group), but in no case will the employee's relative position in the operational unit be improved.
(8)	A mutually agreed upon written notification form will be provided to each employee within five (5) calendar days of the time an employee is loaned from one organization/department to another organization/department.
(9)Employees will carry their accumulated overtime with them when transferred and/or re-transferred to other shifts within their organization/department and classification.
(10)Effective the date of the Agreement the employee with the lowest accumulated overtime balance in an overtime group will revert to a zero balance, and all employees’ overtime balance in the group will be reduced by the same number of hours, and annually on the anniversary date of the Agreement.
C.	SCHEDULING
(l)In accordance with Article VI, Section 2 of the Agreement, overtime will be divided as equally as practicable among affected employees. The Company will normally offer the first available overtime to the employee with the lowest accumulated overtime hours in the affected group, including holiday overtime.
Exceptions to this general rule include such things as: Not qualified to perform the work assignment, bonafide safety and medical limitations, access considerations.
It is herein agreed that holiday overtime scheduling will be handled in the same manner as pre-shift, post-shift, or weekend overtime.
196
Part D, Section 4
Coded Letter D-3
(2)	Employees will be notified of overtime work schedules as soon as reasonably possible.
(3)	Nothing herein is meant to prevent an employee from being scheduled or working consecutive normal assigned work shifts such as the sixth and seventh work day, or working in excess of twenty (20) hours in a given week.
(4)	For Call-in and Call-off purposes, a list of all employees scheduled for overtime will be passed from shift to shift and designation made as to high O.T. employee, next high employee, etc. In cases where O.T. is to be canceled the Company will refer to this list and attempt to cancel starting from the highest overtime employee,
(5)	An employee who volunteers for a temporary shift or loan assignment will not be considered if the employee's accumulated overtime is fifty (50) hours greater than other employees in the employee’s working group who have volunteered for the assignment.
(6)	When employees are assigned to pre-shift overtime in areas other than their normal work area, they will report directly to the overtime area. Sufficient travel time will be allowed for the employee to report to the employee's normal work area. In the case of post-shift overtime in an area other than the employee's normal work area sufficient travel time will be allowed for employees to report to the overtime assignment. In neither case will the employee be reimbursed for travel expense or be furnished Company transportation.
(7)	If an insufficient number of employees in the affected group are available for inweek, weekend, or holiday overtime (i.e., all employees in the “work group” have been asked to work and where necessary directed to work in inverse seniority order - holiday overtime excluded), supervision will normally, as determined by operational requirements, attempt to locate employees in the following order:
a.	Same classification or “work group”, same organization/department, different shift.
b.	Same classification or “work group”, same shift, different organization/ department, if employees are qualified to do the work.
c.	Other classifications, same shift, same organization/ department, if employees are qualified to do the work.
197
Part D, Section 4
Coded Letter D-3
All additional agreements and/or understandings concerning overtime distribution or any other factors affecting equal distribution of overtime shall be handled by a letter of understanding agreed to by the Local Negotiating Committee and Human Resources.

Subject:	OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION AND RECORD KEEPING
| This agreement between LMSSC, M&SO and Local Lodge 1323 of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers supersedes all previous written and oral agreements, prior local practices.
GENERAL
I A. Overtime will be distributed by classification, by operational unit, by shift. An operational unit is defined as: Those employees on a shift who report to the same supervisor or designated coordinator. In some areas, a supervisor or coordinator may have more than one operational unit as depicted by the department or organization chart. In this case, overtime will be distributed by each operational unit reporting to the supervisor or coordinator.
B.	In some areas overtime will be distributed by "work group". Work group, as used herein, means several classifications of employees working together as a temporary work unit. Overtime will be distributed by classification, by shift within the work group.
C.	In the event that an insufficient number of employees accept an overtime assignment, the Company may direct the employee low on the overtime list within the classification, operational unit and shift to fulfill the overtime requirement. In the event that an insufficient number of employees accept the overtime assignment within the operational unit, the Company may ask within the needed classification from other operational units. When determining which employees are to be selected for overtime, the employee who is lowest in overtime hours within the classification needed will be selected. Should two (2) or more employees have the same number of hours, the most senior employee will be selected. If no employees outside the original operational unit accept the overtime, then the employee who is lowest on the overtime list in the original group will be required to work the overtime. For equitable distribution of overtime, there will be a one-time, action to zero out all overtime lists prior to implementation of this Coded Letter .
I
216
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
OVERTIME RECORDS
A.	Accurate information will be maintained on the overtime record (Form LMSC 837s3 or equivalent) within each operational unit in order to assure equitable distribution of overtime among employees. The overtime record will be openly posted within each operational unit and shall be retained for two (2) years on a continuing basis.
B.	Employees' names (by classification) within the same operational unit will be entered | on the overtime record, and cumulative overtime balances will be brought forward from any previous overtime record. Overtime will be recorded daily to show overtime hours worked or refused on the appropriate calendar day, A cumulative total will be made at the end of each day.	[
C.	Overtime records will be maintained to reflect the equivalent of straight time. Fractional hours will be rounded off to the nearest tenth of an hour, e.g. 3.3 x 1.5 = 4.95, 5.0 hours will be recorded.
D.	Overtime offered but refused will be recorded to show the number of hours the employees would have worked, had it been accepted, by an "O" to denote "offered”.
E.	Reduction of hours may be made by subtracting a common factor. For example, in an | affected group where all employees have more than 100 accumulated hours, all may be reduced by 100, resulting in no relative change within the group. When a reduction takes place it must be coordinated with all operational units to be done concurrently and in the same manner
SCHEDULING
A.	Affected employees will be notified of overtime work schedules as soon as reasonably possible. An employee absent from work normally will not be scheduled for overtime until returning to work after the absence. Normally, if an employee accepts weekend overtime and is absent on Friday, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled unless the Friday absence is for an approved one day vacation, personal leave or union call-out. Similarly, if an employee is asked to work overtime two days hence but is absent the day before the scheduled overtime, the overtime offered to that employee will be canceled. If overtime offered is canceled, the employee will be notified when reporting their absence to supervision.
B.	The Company normally will offer the first available overtime to the employees with the lowest accumulated overtime hours in the affected group who is qualified to perform the work involved. Exceptions to this rule will include: job continuity, which requires the employee to follow through on overtime work started during normal
217
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
working hours. When this condition exists to the point that operational requirements would be affected, the employee may continue the overtime work. Other exceptions include: qualifications, access considerations and medical limitations.
When due to specific job skills or job continuity requirements an employee's accumulated overtime is substantially higher than that of the next person in the affected group, and it appears that the overtime difference will continue to grow, the department will initiate appropriate cross training for interested employees who are qualified to be cross trained. The cross trained employee with the lowest accumulated overtime will be rotated into the job being performed by the high overtime employee.
Refusal of cross training will be documented.
C.	An employee who refuses overtime will be charged for those hours offered unless the employee who worked was sent home early at company request, in which case the actual hours worked will be charged.
D.	No charge will be made to the overtime record if overtime is refused because:
1.	The overtime assignment is on an agreed upon holiday.
2.	The employee is on union business and the company has been properly notified.
3.	The employee is on jury duty during the day when the overtime is to be worked or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a court of law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
4.	Overtime is on the 6th or 7th day immediately preceding or following the employee’s vacation of at least one week.
5.	Overtime work anticipated is subsequently canceled.
6.	The employee is called for temporary military duty.
7.	When an employee has a medical or dental appointment prior to the time the overtime is offered (Doctor’s verification required).
8.	All employees outside of the requesting operational unit refuse the overtime and the Company returns to the original operational unit.
E.	Employees who do not want to work overtime or do not want to change job assignment or location necessary for more equitable distribution of overtime, shall
218
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
indicate those preferences in writing. Such written notice will remain active for a minimum of 90 calendar days.
F.	Drivers required to drive the vehicle to transport missiles and/or missile motors shall be qualified and licensed operators^ When employees are assigned as '’shotgun” riders for missile and missile motor transport, they will be assigned from the above supervisory group. Should the "shotgun” rider be required to perform duties calling for specific skills in addition to the "shotgun” duties, the assignment shall be per the affected classification. In all overtime assignments, "scheduling" provisions of this agreement shall apply.
OVERTIME CHARGES - WHEN ALL OR PART OF OVERTIME SHIFT OFFERED IS NOT WORKED.
A.	When all or part of the overtime shift offered is not worked due to cancellation by management, employees will be charged only hours worked. Employees who initially declined overtime will be charged for hours worked. The charge will be deleted if overtime is canceled before the end of the shift in which the overtime is offered.
B.	Tardies
An employee who is tardy in reporting to an overtime assignment will be charged the full amount of time scheduled to be worked.
C.	Short times
An employee who short times when work still is available, will be charged for the time scheduled to be worked.
D.	Absences
An employee who has agreed to work overtime but fails to report for work without a legitimate excuse will be charged for double the time scheduled to be worked.
E.	Employees who accept overtime and then do not report as scheduled for the accepted overtime may be subject to disciplinary action in addition to the appropriate overtime charges.
Absence from affected group more than 5 working days.
A.	An employee who is absent for over five (5) working days will be charged overtime hours in the amount of the average overtime worked by their affected group during the absence, except in the following circumstances:
219
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
1,	When an employee is on vacation.
2.	When an employee is on extended recognized union business.
3.	When an employee is on jury duty or is to appear as a subpoenaed witness in a court of law in a case to which the employee is not a party either directly or as a member of a class.
4.	When an employee is required to engage in annual two consecutive weeks of military training.
5.	When an employee is absent 30 days or more, .the provisions specified for "addition of transferred or recalled employees" will apply.
j 6. When an employee cancels a "no overtime" request the provision specified for "additional or transferred or recalled employees" will apply.
B.	The average overtime worked by their affected group during the absence will be calculated and added to the employee's accumulated total prior to the absence.
| TRAVEL AND FIELD DUTY
All overtime worked while on travel and field duty shall be added to the employee's permanent overtime record.
LOANED EMPLOYEES - POSTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME.
A.	Posting - the permanent (home) department overtime record will be posted as notification is received from the borrowing department of overtime hours worked.
B.	Distribution of overtime to employees on loan - departments utilizing the services of employees on loan from other departments will use the following basic rules as a guide in the distribution of overtime:
1.	Employees who have been on loan for less than ten (10) working days will not be considered eligible for overtime. Exceptions to this rule may be made when any of the following conditions exists:
|	(a) all of the affected employees of the department are requested to work overtime.
220
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
(b)the borrowed employee possesses special skills necessary to perform the overtime assignment, and none of the affected employees of the department is qualified to perform the work.
(c) continuity of work operations requires the borrowed employee to follow through on overtime work started during regular working hours. When this condition exists to the point that operational requirements would be adversely affected, the employee on temporary loan may be assigned to the overtime ■ work.
2.	Employees who have been on loan for ten (10) or more working days will be considered members of the ’’affected group” in the borrowing department for purposes of equitable distribution of overtime. Such an employee will be given the average of the affected group as of the 10th working day or the first date on which overtime occurs, whichever is first.
ADDITION OF NEW OR REHIRED EMPLOYEES
The average overtime hours of 50% of the employees in the affected group who have worked the highest number of overtime hours as of the date the new or rehired employee begins to work overtime or at the end of the probationary period whichever occurs first will be calculated and posted to the overtime record for the new or rehired employee.
Example: if there are 10 names in the affected group, add the overtime of the 5 highest and divide by 5.
ADDITION OF TRANSFERRED OR RECALLED EMPLOYEES
The average overtime charged to and/or worked by others in the affected group as of the date the employee begins work in the new affected group will be calculated and posted to the overtime record for the transferred or recalled employee.
CONSOLIDATION OF TWO OR MORE OPERATIONAL UNITS
A.	Combination of two or more operational units will be agreed upon by the Company and the Union.
B.	Overtime records will be carried over without change for employees in a classification common to only one operational unit.
REMOVAL FROM OVERTIME RECORD
221
Part E, Section 4
Coded Letter E-9
A.	An employee who does not want to be offered overtime should submit a written request to that effect. The written request will be placed in the organization personnel folder. The overtime record will show: "Employee declines overtime. See written request dated (DATE)." The employees must understand they are still subject to work if operational requirements so dictate.
B.	Should the written request be rescinded at a later date, the employee shall be reaveraged into the operational unit as a new employee, but, in no case, will the employee's relative position in the operational unit be improved.
C.	AU additional agreements and/or understandings concerning overtime distribution shall be handled by a letter of agreement between the Base Steward and the Human Resources Representative.
