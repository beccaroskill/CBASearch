PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, The parties hereto have maintained a mutually satisfactory bargaining relationship in the work area covered by collective agreements between them which have been in effect over a substantial period of years; and
WHEREAS, The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers, and Helpers and/or subordinate subdivisions thereof embrace within their membership large numbers of qualified journeymen who have constituted in the past, and continue so to do, a majority of the employees employed by the Employer herein;
WHEREAS, The Contractor and the Brotherhood recognize that this Agreement must take into consideration the transitory nature of the work done by the Contractor; and
WHEREAS, The nature of many of the products of the Contractor is such that a sufficient proportion of skilled and trained workers is required to construct them safely, economically, and well; and
WHEREAS, The comparatively short duration of most field erection jobs compels the skilled and trained workers to live a migratory life, which makes it impossible to localize such construction; and

handling without additional supervisory help. Final determination, however, of the size of the force to be supervised lies exclusively with the Contractor. Likewise, a foreman who serves as an assistant to another foreman on a large job may give orders directly to the men on the job.
Art. 8(b) Pushers (Assistant Foremen). Pushers (assistant foremen) may be regular employees of the Contractor, or the Contractor may select them from among the available local boilermakers. The number of pushers will be determined by the Contractor. Pushers (assistant foremen) may work with the tools at the discretion of the Contractor. The Contractor is entitled to require that any pusher be capable of personally performing any of the work done by the men over whom he will have supervision, and he must have the ability and show a willingness for carrying out his orders in a manner satisfactory to the Contractor’s foreman.
Art. 8(c) Where twelve (12) or less are employed on a job, the foreman will be permitted to work with the tools, if required by the Employer. Where thirteen (13) or more men are employed on a job, the foreman shall not work with the tools but shall act in a supervisory capacity. It is understood that in the performance of his function in a supervisory capacity the primary duty of a foreman is that of supervision and it is not intended that he take the place of a production worker on the job. Any work the foreman performs is for the purpose of instructing and demonstrating.
