ARTICLE 2:	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Unless the Employer agrees otherwise in this Contract, nothing in Chapter 4117 of the Revised Code impairs the right and responsibility of the Employer to determine matters of inherent managerial policy which include, but are not limited to, areas of discretion of policy such as the functions and programs of the public employer standards of services, its overall budget, utilization of technology, organizational structure; direct, supervise, evaluate, or hire employees; maintain and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations; determine the overall methods, process, means, or personnel by which governmental operations are to be conducted; suspend, discipline, demote or discharge for just and proper cause, lay off, transfer, assign, schedule, promote, or retain employees; determine the adequacy of the work force; determine the overall mission of the employer as a unit of government; effectively manage the work force; and take actions to carry out the mission of the public employer as a governmental unit. Further, this Article does not limit the rights of the DHS under Ohio Revised Code Section 4117.08.
ARTICLE 3:	NO STRIKE/NO LOCKOUT
Section 1.	The Union shall not, directly nor indirectly call, sanction, encourage, finance, and/or assist in any way, nor shall any employee instigate or participate, directly or indirectly, in any strike, walk-out, work stoppage, or slow down, at any operation or operations of the DHS for the duration of this Contract.

When the DHS notifies the Union by certified mail that any of its members are engaged in any such strike activity, as outlined, the Union shall immediately, conspicuously post notice over the signature of an authorized representative of the Union to the effect that a violation is in progress and such notice shall instruct all employees to immediately return to work.
Section 3.	The DHS agrees that neither it, its officers, agents or representatives... individually or collectively, will authorize, instigate, cause, aid or condone any lockout of members of the Union, unless those members shall have violated Section 1 of this Article.

Section 1.	The provisions of this Contract shall be applied equally to all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination as to age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, political opinions or affiliation or disability.

Section 2.	The DHS will deduct regular monthly dues from the pay of employees covered by the Contract upon receipt from the Union of individual written authorization cards voluntarily executed by an employee for that purpose and bearing his signature, provided that any employee shall have the right to revoke such authorization by giving written notice to the Union at any time during the fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the termination of this contract.

On an annual basis, the Union will provide the Employer with the same information regarding its calculation of the fair share fee as it is required by law to provide to fair share fee payers.

Such visit(s) shall be made by appointment with the Director or his designee and shall not interfere with the work of any employee or the operations of the DHS. If a need to enter the premises of any operation of the DHS occurs between the hours of five o'clock (5:00) p.m. and eight-thirty (8:30) a.m., Monday through Friday, or on Saturday or Sunday, said representative of the Union shall contact the Director or his designee for permission to enter the premises of the DHS.

The DHS shall provide the Union with bulletin boards with doors and locks at mutually selected locations in all departments of the DHS. All bulletin board notices of the Union shall bear the signature of an official of the local union and/or Ohio Council 8. A copy of all posted notices shall be given to the Director and/or Human Resource Manager prior to posting. Failure to follow the condition set forth above will be grounds for the DHS to remove any posting without recourse from the Union.
ARTICLE 8:	UNION REPRESENTATION
Section 1.	Employees selected by the Union to act as Union representatives for the purpose of processing grievances under the Grievance Procedure shall be known as "Stewards". Each Steward shall have an alternate who shall act as Steward when the regular Steward is absent from work, or is unavailable due to job duties.
Section 2.	The DHS shall recognize one Steward for each ninety (90) employees in active pay status. The Union shall notify the DHS regarding the actual assignments of the Stewards by location and/or classification.
Section 3.	The expectation is that Stewards will remain in their offices regardless of the fluctuation of the DHS staffing patterns until the next election of Stewards. However, in the event of a significant reorganization or deployment of employees that impacts on the location of Stewards, the parties will meet in an effort to resolve the issue. The Union President, Vice President, Recording Secretary and Recording Treasurer shall remain on their respective shifts during their terms of office. The Stewards and Alternate Stewards shall remain in their respective locations and on their respective shifts during their terms of office.
5

On a quarterly basis, the Union shall provide DHS with a list of the dates and times of each Stewards’ meeting for the quarter.
Section 8.	All Stewards are expected to perform their job duties. However, each Steward and Recording Secretary and Treasurer shall be allowed reasonable time off with pay to conduct appropriate union business.
Section 9.	Where there is a reduction in workforce, every effort shall be made to retain at work the Union President, Vice President, Recording Secretary, Recording Treasurer, Stewards and Alternate Stewards. If their jobs are not operating, they will be placed on other jobs that are operating in their respective areas provided that they are qualified to do the work.
Section 10.	The Union shall furnish the DHS a written list of names of the Union President, Vice President, Recording Secretary, Recording Treasurer, Stewards, and Alternate Stewards, including locations to which each is assigned. Further, the Union shall promptly notify the DHS in writing of any changes therein.
Section 11.	Stewards and Union Officers shall adhere to the following procedure in processing grievances and carrying out all other functions of their offices:
A.	An employee having a grievance as defined herein shall notify his Steward who will notify the employee's immediate supervisor to arrange for the release of the employee to meet with the Steward. This shall be done in accordance with the provisions in Section 8 of this Article.

D.	Upon returning to his job, the Steward shall first report to his own supervisor before resuming work if the supervisor is available (or if he is unavailable, as soon as possible after resuming work).
E.	The Vice President and the Recording Secretary shall abide by the rules applicable to Stewards. In the event of the absence of a Steward and his Alternate Steward, the President shall be called in their place. In the event of the absence of the President, the Vice President shall be called in his place.
Section 12.	A Steward having an individual grievance in connection with his own work may ask for the President or Vice President to assist him in adjusting the grievance with his supervisor.
Section 13.	There shall be a Grievance Committee consisting of the Union President, Vice President, Recording Secretary and six (6) Stewards to be selected by the Union.

ARTICLE 9:	PERSONNEL RECORD
Section 1.	An employee shall have the right to inspect his personnel record provided ample notification is given to the Office of Human Resources. The employee may compile, date, and insert in said record a list of the documents he finds therein.
Section 2.	If an employee after examining his file has reason to desire a copy of a document contained therein, a copy shall be provided at a nominal fee not to exceed the actual cost of duplication. Any materials in the employee's personnel record which have not been seen or signed by him or a copy sent to him will not be used against him. The signing of any materials to be placed into an employee's personnel record will not indicate an agreement by the employee as to the contents of the material, but does acknowledge he has seen it. Any such material placed into the record of an employee after May 1, 1972, without his knowledge shall, upon his request, be removed from his personnel record and destroyed.
Section 3.	All personnel file examinations shall be made by appointment with the Office of Human Resources, and in the presence of a representative of the Office of Human Resources. The Office of Human Resources will maintain a log in the personnel file of each bargaining unit member of the date and name of all persons who review the file pursuant to the Public Records Act.
Section 4.	No employee shall be permitted to remove any item from his personnel record, remove the file(s) from the custody of the Office of Human Resources, or otherwise alter his personnel record in any manner. Subject to the approval of the Office of Human Resources, an employee may request that a document relating to his education, training or work performance be added to his personnel record. Any such request shall not be unreasonably denied.
Section 5.	The terms of this Section shall not be applied in such a way as to interrupt the work schedule of the employee or cause any expense to the Employer.
ARTICLE 10:	DISCIPLINE
Section 1.	In imposing discipline on a current charge, the DHS shall not take into account any prior infraction that occurred more than two (2) years previously. Except in emergency situations, the DHS shall issue discipline within sixty (60) working days of the date of the Pre-Disciplinary Conference.
Section 2.	An employee shall be given a copy of any warning, reprimand, or other disciplinary action entered into his personnel record as maintained by the Office of Human Resources within five (5) working days of the action taken. Further, the employee and the Union President will receive a copy of any suspension and/or discharge notice within five (5) working days of the action taken.
8
Section 3.	Any employee who has been disciplined by suspension or discharge will be given a written statement describing in detail the reason or reasons for which he has been suspended or discharged. In case of suspension, the employee shall be advised of his right to have a Steward present. Further, if the employee so requests, he shall be granted a private interview with his Steward before the employee is required to leave the premises.
Section 4.	Any suspension shall be for a specific number of consecutive days on which the employee shall be regularly scheduled to work. Holidays occurring during a period of suspension shall be counted as work days for the purpose of suspension only.
Section 5.	It is important that the employee complaints regarding unjust or discriminatory suspensions and/or discharge be handled promptly. Therefore, all such disciplinary action may be reviewed through the Grievance Procedure, beginning at Step 3.
Section 6.	The State Personnel Board of Review shall not be an entity in the Grievance Procedure.
Section 7.	Discipline must be applied in an objective, equitable and reasonable manner, and shall be progressive and corrective and never punitive. It is expected that discipline will be imposed in a reasonably timely fashion under the facts and circumstances of a particular case. However, depending on the severity of the situation, the DHS may skip or repeat one or more of the steps in the disciplinary process. No employee shall be reduced in pay or position, suspended, discharged, or removed except for just cause.
Section 8.	No employee shall be suspended or terminated without first being given the opportunity to participate in a Pre-Disciplinary Conference conducted by the Human Resource Manager or his designee. At said conference, the employee may show cause why the disciplinary action should not be imposed. The employee shall receive notification in writing at least three (3) working days prior to the conference. Such notice shall include the date of the conference, time of the conference, location of the conference, nature of offense and the rights to union representation.
Section 9.	Any disciplinary action entered into an employee’s personnel record as maintained by the Office of Human Resources shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
9
ARTICLE 11:	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	The term "grievance" shall mean an allegation by a bargaining unit employee or the Union that there had been a breach, misinterpretation or improper application of this Contract. It is not intended that the Grievance Procedure be used to effect changes in the Articles of this Contract nor those matters not covered by this Contract.
Section 2.	When a grievance arises, the following procedure shall be observed:
Oral Step. Immediate Supervisor
An employee who has a grievance shall take it up orally with his immediate supervisor accompanied by a steward within five work days after the events upon which the grievance is based. The supervisor shall give an answer to the employee and steward within five work days and shall verify the date, time, and result of such meeting.
Step 1. Human Resources Manager/Designee and Immediate Supervisor
If the meeting does not resolve the grievance, then the union steward solely with the aggrieved employee shall present the grievance in writing to the Human Resource Manager within ten (10) working days after the event upon which the grievance is based, except that for Homemaker's grievances only the time limit will be extended to fifteen (15) days after the events have taken place. Within ten (10) working days after the receipt of the grievance in writing, the supervisor and the Human Resource Manager or designee shall meet with the grievant and the Steward in an attempt to resolve the grievance. In addition, each party shall have the right to invite a resource person on an as needed basis. Within ten (10) working days after the Step 1 meeting, the supervisor or the Human Resource Manager shall give a written answer to the Steward. In the event the grievance is not resolved, the answer shall set forth, in detail, the reasons for the denial of the grievance.
Step 2.	Department Director/Designee
If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 1, it must be received in writing by the Director of the appropriate department from the Union President within seven (7) working days after the receipt of the Step 1 answer. Within ten (10) working days thereafter, the Director and/or his designee shall meet with the Union President, Vice President, Steward, and Grievant in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Within ten (10) working days after the Step 2 meeting, the Director and/or his designee shall give a written answer to the Union President. In the event the Director chooses to have the grievance heard by his designee, said designee shall be an employee of the DHS and shall be vested with the full authority of the Director. A Labor/Management meeting may be a part of the second step agenda.
10
Step 3.
Division of Labor Relations
If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 2, it must be received in writing by the Administrator of the County Division of Labor Relations of the Department of Human Resources and/or his designee from the Union President or his designee within seven (7) working days after receipt of the Step 2 answer. The Administrator of the Division of Labor Relations and/or his designee shall consider the grievance at the monthly Step 3 Grievance meeting to be held on the second Thursday of each month. The Union President may request the Regional Director of Ohio Council 8 and/or his designee to join the meeting. Within twenty (20) working days after the Step 3 meeting, the Administrator of the Division of Labor Relations shall give a written answer to the Union President. A copy of the answer shall also be provided to the Regional Director of Ohio Council 8 and/or his designee. In the event that the Administrator of the Division of Labor Relations chooses to have the grievance considered by his designee, said designee shall be vested with his full authority.
Step 4. Mediation
A.	Once a grievance has been appealed to arbitration, it will be referred to mediation unless either party determines not to mediate a particular grievance. Arbitration scheduling will give priority to cases that have first been mediated.
B.	The parties shall mutually agree to a panel of five (5) mediators to serve in the capacity of grievance mediators. Panel members must be experienced, neutral mediators and/or arbitrators with mediation skills. Mediation panel members may not serve as arbitrators at any time under this Agreement.
C.	Mediation shall be scheduled on a rotating basis among the panel members to the extent the mediator is available and his/her schedule allows. The parties agree that they will ordinarily schedule between two and five mediations in a day.
D.	Representatives designated by each party shall have the right to be present at the mediation conference. Each party will have a representative vested with full authority to resolve the issues being considered, subject to approval, when necessary, by the Board of County Commissioners. Representatives of the Union are the Local President, Local Vice President, applicable Steward, Grievant (if applicable) and an Ohio Council 8 Representative. The employer shall be represented by human resources representatives and applicable management representatives.
E.	The mediator may employ all of the techniques commonly associated with mediation, including private caucuses with the parties, but the taking of oaths and the examination of witnesses shall not be permitted and no verbatim record of the proceeding shall be taken. The purpose of the mediation effort is to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute and there will be no procedural constraints regarding the review of facts and arguments. There shall be no
11
formal evidence rules. Written materials presented to the mediators will be returned to the party at the conclusion of the mediation hearing.
F.	Mediation efforts will be informal in nature and shall not include written opinions or recommendations from the mediator. In the event that a grievance that has been mediated is appealed to arbitration, there shall be no reference in the arbitration proceeding to the fact that a mediation conference was or was not held. Nothing said or done by the mediator may be referenced or introduced into evidence at the arbitration hearing. Nothing said or done by either party for the first time in the mediation conference may be used against it in arbitration.
G.	At the mediation conference the mediator shall first seek to assist the parties in reaching a mutually satisfactory settlement of the grievance, which is within the parameters of the collective bargaining agreement.

In the event there is a dispute as to whether the issue appealed to arbitration is also an issue to the employee's complaint to the OCRC and/or EEOC, the Union and the Office of Labor Relations shall meet in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute it is agreed that the Arbitrator shall have the jurisdiction to determine whether the issue appealed to arbitration is also the issue in the employee's complaint to the OCRC or EEOC.

C.	When DHS determines that overtime work is necessary for special projects, the overtime will initially be offered on a rotational basis to employees within the classification, within the department, in order of seniority. If sufficient employees do not voluntarily accept, the DHS shall then have the right to offer overtime on a rotational basis to employees within the classification and within the next highest bargaining unit classification within the classification series, outside the department, in order of seniority.

Overtime may be initially refused, but if sufficient employees do not voluntarily accept, DHS shall assign the overtime work to on-duty employees within the classification, within the operating unit, within the shift that precedes the shift where the absence occurs, in inverse order of seniority. The employee so assigned must work such time when assigned.
B.	Scheduled overtime. When a part-time employee is not available to work non-overtime hours to cover an open shift that is anticipated more than fortyeight (48) hours in advance (e.g. vacation coverage, manpower shortages), the overtime will initially be offered on a rotational basis to off-schedule, fulltime employees within the classification, within the operating unit, in order of seniority. Any remaining overtime work will be offered on a rotational basis to off-schedule employees within the same classification in other operating units of the department in order of seniority, provided the employee is qualified to perform the available work. Any remaining open schedules shall be filled in accordance with mandatory overtime provision of Section 3.A hereof.
Section 4.	At the Metzenbaum Center, overtime work will initially be offered to employees within the classification, within the operating unit, in order of seniority.
Overtime may initially be refused, but if sufficient employees do not voluntarily accept, the DHS shall assign the overtime work to employees within the classification within the department in the inverse order of seniority and the employee so assigned must work such time when assigned. In the course of a calendar year, DHS shall endeavor to make an equitable distribution of overtime among eligible employees within a classification at the Metzenbaum Center. The supervisor will record all overtime hours worked or refused by each employee and post this record openly in the department.
Section 5.	An employee shall not be entitled to voluntary overtime work if A) the employee has been disciplined for performance-related reasons within ninety (90) calendar days of the overtime opportunity; or B) during the period an employee is subject to a corrective action plan if the employee is given an opportunity to work overtime that is associated with the employee’s regular case load or workload as part of the corrective action plan.

Employees transferring to the DHS from another governmental subdivision must work twelve (12) months before being eligible for vacation. This does not affect an employee's rate of accrual or service credit.
Section 3.	If an employee is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily) prior to taking his vacation, he shall receive the pro-rated portion of any fully earned but unused vacation leave which he has accrued under Section 2 of this Article.

Section 4. An employee's paid vacation leave shall be adjusted (or pro-rated) to reflect time spent on unpaid leave(s) of absence totaling thirty (30) days or more (i.e., for each thirty (30) days spent on unpaid leave of absence an employee shall lose one-twelfth (1/12) of his regular paid vacation leave). This pro-rating of vacation leave shall in no way affect an employee's seniority date. With submission of appropriate evidence, an employee who experiences illness, injury or death in the family while on vacation leave shall be granted sick leave instead, upon request.
Section 5.	If a recognized holiday falls within an employee's vacation leave, the employee shall receive an additional paid vacation day in lieu of the holiday.
Section 6.	Employees may take their vacations during the calendar year. During the first quarter of each calendar year employees will be given an opportunity to indicate, on a standardized BOCC Request for Leave Form, their vacation leave preference. By May first (1st) of each year, a written vacation schedule (by department) will be prepared by the DHS and posted (and individual written confirmation given to each employee) with priority given to employees according to their DHS seniority. Once the vacation schedule is determined it shall not be changed without the consent of the involved employee. Any employee who fails to make his vacation application during the appropriate period will be given his vacation leave without regard to seniority based upon when the application was made except when two (2) employees request vacation on the same day for the same future time period, seniority will govern. The Employee will receive a response to the unscheduled vacation request no later than three (3) work days of receipt of the request by their respective team leader or immediate supervisor.

Any employee who has been on sick leave with pay for five (5) or more consecutive workdays may be required, at the discretion of the DHS, to provide a physician’s statement before being permitted to return to work. In the case of an employee’s injury or illness, the certificate shall indicate that the employee was under a physician’s care, was advised by the physician to remain home from work, and that the employee is fit to return and to perform his duties. In the case of injury or illness of an immediate family member, the certificate shall indicate that the family member was under a physician’s care and that the employee’s presence was reasonably necessary for the health and welfare of the family member.
