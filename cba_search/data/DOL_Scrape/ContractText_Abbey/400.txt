To assure maximum harmonious relations and in order to obtain the best qualified employees with the least risk of a delay in the scheduled departure of any vessel covered by this Agreement, such Company agrees to secure all Unlicensed Personnel through the hiring halls of the Union. If, for any reason, the Union does not furnish such Company with capable, competent and physically fit persons when and where they are required, and of the ratings needed to fill such vacancies, in ample time to prevent any delay in the scheduled departure of any vessel covered by this Agreement, such Company may then obtain members of the Unlicensed Personnel from any available source, in which case the Union shall be notified.
SECTION 3.	The Association and each member Company thereof agree that as a condition of employment, all Unlicensed Personnel shall become members of the Union or agency fee payers within thirty-one (31) days after the execution of this Agreement, or within thirty-one (31) days after hire, whichever is later, and shall either remain members in good standing of the Union or up to date agency fee payers during the Life of this Agreement. Such Company is not obligated to take steps to enforce this provision unless due notice is received in writing from the Union, to the effect that a member of the Unlicensed Personnel is not in compliance herewith.
SECTION 4.	(a) The Union agrees that each member Company has the right to reject (by written notation on the job assignment slip or by written notification at the time of assignment) any applicant for employment who such Company considers unsatisfactory or unsuitable for the vacancy, or to discharge any member of the Unlicensed Personnel who, in the opinion of such Company, is not satisfactory. If the Union considers the rejection of any applicant for employment or the discharge of any member of the Unlicensed Personnel as being without reasonable cause, such action by such Company shall be dealt with under the grievance procedure, and the Union agrees that such rejection or discharge shall not cause any vessel to be delayed on her scheduled departure.
(b)	Unlicensed Personnel, when applying for employment, shall be required to be in possession of a valid S.LU. Clinic Card indicating the person has a complete physical examination less than one (1) year prior to date of application; and may also be required to pass a physical examination as prescribed by such Company, and shall submit from time to time thereafter to such physical examinations as may be required by such Company. The fees and expenses, including transportation, associated with any such required initial examination shall be at the Company’s expense. Such Company shall have the right to reject an applicant for employment or to discharge any member of the Unlicensed Personnel who shall be determined by such Company's medical examiner to be unfit for employment.
Any dispute with regard to the physical fitness of any such applicant or member so examined shall be resolved by such Company's physician and the appropriate Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Clinic designated physician. If these two (2) physicians are unable to resolve the dispute, then they shall select a board certified physician of die appropriate specialty to make a final and binding decision. The fees and expenses of such third physician shall be shared equally by the parties.
(c)	All Unlicensed Personnel shall comply with all rules and regulations required by the Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard and/or Charter Parties relative to substance and alcohol abuse testing.
SECTION 5.	Each Company agrees not to discriminate against any member of the Unlicensed Personnel for legitimate Union activities, and each Company further agrees that no person referred in accordance with this Article, shall be discriminated against because of race, creed, color, sex, age, national or geographic origin, and status as a Vietnam vet

Such accommodation will not, however, be required if it would create an undue hardship or would represent a substantial threat to the safety and well being of the employer, the employee requesting the accommodation, or other Unlicensed Personnel.
In applying the protections of the ADA to any individual, the parties agree that the standards formulated in the Johns Hopkins Study shall be followed.
SECTION 6.	The term Unlicensed Personnel as used in this Agreement shall not include super-cargoes, cadets, pursers and livestock tenders.

(b)	The Union and the Companies pursuant to collective bargaining provisions established and maintain a training school facility for training and upgrading of the Companies’ Unlicensed Personnel.

4
Standard Tanker Agreement 2001
It is the purpose of the above paragraph to provide for the automatic payment of advances—in a sum equal to the agreed allotment—and to do this automatically, which advances are then to be charged against any claim for earned or unearned wages. The advances are to be paid in exactly the same time and manner and to the same person or persons that the allotment would have been paid had not illness or injury taken place. The term “repatriation” refers to the entire period for which unearned wages are due, and “advances” are made during the entire period, except in those cases where the law sanctions a refusal to pay unearned wages (which can be established under law to be gross negligence, willful mis-j	conduct, etc.).	-
■	If repatriated on a vessel of the Company, he shall be signed on as a nonworking workaway. If repatriated on a

46
Standard Tanker Agreement 200!
t rat ion cards shall be time and date stamped when issued and shall show the registrant's class of seniority rating, Department and Group.

Coast Guard discharges, may also be submitted.
Seamen seeking employment aboard LNG vessels, in addition to the documents heretofore specified, must also possess a certificate of satisfactory completion of the LNG program offered by the Seafarers Hany Lundeberg School of Seamanship for the department in which such seamen regularly ship.
Seamen permanently employed aboard LNG vessels must register for re-employment aboard LNG vessels within seventy-two (72) hours following completion of their designated tour of duty.

Misleading or false statements on the examination form or a failure to disclose prior injuries or illnesses shall be considered willful misconduct and just cause for discharge and may result in loss of seniority.
(c)	If any employee in possession of a clinic card shall become unfit-for-duty for seven days or more during the indicated valid period of the card, such card may be invalidated by the office of the Medical Director of the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan and subject to surrender upon demand by an authorized representative of either the Seafarers International Union, AGLIWD/NMU or the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Plan.

The dates and times for such stamping shall be determined by the Port Agent for each port, and each registrant shall be notified of the dates and times for stamping when he receives his shipping registration card. A seaman who fails to have his shipping registration card so stamped during any month shall forfeit the same and shall be required to re-register. In the event circumstances beyond his control prevent a seaman from having his shipping registration card so stamped, the Port Agent may stamp such card as if the seaman had been present on the required time and date upon submission by the seaman of adequate evidence of the circumstances preventing his personal appearance.
(7.) Subject to the provisions of these Rules, shipping registration cards shall be valid only for a period of
Standard Tanker Agreement 200i
47
