9.	A flight attendant may voluntarily reduce her/his day(s) off below the monthly minimum to perform special assignments for the Company. S/he will not have her/his day(s) off restored to the minimum.
10.	Between the first and fifth day of the bid month additional lines may be constructed from remaining vacation drops, month-to-month adjustments and any remaining open time. Regardless of how constructed, these additional lines will be awarded in seniority order. The lines will be constructed to comply with Section 5.A.1, and will be built with comparable days off as contained in the reserve line awarded. The days off will be as comparable as reasonably possible considering both available trips for the line construction and known operational requirements. A reserve move-up list will be displayed on the Inflight web site no later than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the first day of the bid month.

4.	If a bid line holder is more than fifteen minutes (:15) late for her/his required check-in time, a reserve will be assigned the open trip and the lineholder will be replaced. The lineholder will receive a report late if s/he arrives before schedule departure. A lineholder who arrives after scheduled departure will receive a missed trip.
5.	On trip pairings where the initial segment is a deadhead between flight attendant bases (for example, EWR-IAH or CLE-EWR) flight attendants may elect to check-in at the deadhead destination base, which will be her/his new point of origin. Check-in may not be done at outstations. Such check-in times will be the same as those required for other originating pairings. A flight attendant must notify Crew Scheduling if s/he elects to check-in downline a minimum of twenty-four hours (24:00) prior to the deadhead departure time. A flight attendant exercising this election shall be responsible for her/his transportation to the new point of origin. S/he will also be responsible for providing Crew Scheduling with a contact number for use in the event of reassignment. Flight attendants utilizing this downline check-in option shall conform to reasonable
5 - 5 Scheduling
Company procedures governing such check-in. A flight attendant electing to check-in downline who complies with the terms of this paragraph shall receive her/his regular pay for the scheduled deadhead segment as specified in Section 4.L.
6.	Pairings Ending in a Deadhead
a.	When a pairing ends with a deadhead segment, a bid line holder may, with prior notice to Crew Scheduling, and a reserve may, with prior approval from Crew Scheduling, elect not to fly such deadhead segment but shall then be responsible for any alternative transportation to another airport. A flight attendant electing not to fly a deadhead segment shall receive her/his regular pay for the scheduled deadhead segment as specified in Section 4.L.
b.	When an international pairing ends with a deadhead segment, a flight attendant may, with prior approval from Crew Scheduling, elect not to fly such deadhead segment, s/he but shall then be required to fly such alternative deadhead segment as agreed upon with Crew Scheduling. A flight attendant electing to fly an off-pairing international deadhead segment as described herein shall receive her/his regular pay for the
Scheduling 5 - 6
originally scheduled deadhead segment as specified in Section 4.L, but shall not be entitled to any additional or premium pay related her/his election to engage in the off-pairing deadhead.
7.	Duty limitations

The duty period ends at the conclusion of any nonflying duty, block-in from deadheading, or the later of fifteen minutes (:15) (thirty minutes (:30) for trips when Customs clearance is required) after block-in of a flight, or actual release.
9.	Rest periods
a.	Minimum scheduled rest periods will be:
1.	Ten hours (10:00) block in to block out at home base domicile.
Exception: Reserves will be scheduled for a minimum rest period of eleven hours (11:00) block in to block out at their base.

5 - 9 Scheduling
free from all duty at her/his domicile upon completion of such trip assignment.
e.	The Company will not interrupt a flight attendant’s minimum rest, starting at the conclusion of the duty period, except in emergency circumstances or as provided in paragraph I.16 below. Emergency circumstances include notification of operational changes to the flight attendant’s schedule and urgent personal situations (e.g., death in the family). Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter or extend the minimum rest provisions of paragraph B.9 above.
C. Reduced Flying
1.	Subject to the operational needs of the Company and to the terms of this Section, flight attendants may reduce their scheduled hours below sixty-five hours (65:00) in a bid month.
2.	If a flight attendant intends to fly less than forty hours (40:00), notice of such intent must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
a.	To be eligible to reduce their schedules below forty hours (40:00) in a bid month flight attendants must provide advance notice in the
Scheduling 5 - 10
month(s) preceding the month in which such reduction is desired. The notice must be provided for each month that a reduction below forty hours (40:00) is desired, even when those months are consecutive.
b.	The Company shall designate the time and manner required for the notice to be provided, whether through the normal monthly bid process, by means of a special form, or by such other means as will be sufficient to effectively initiate the actions and processes contemplated by this Section.
c.	The submission of a notice of intent to perform reduced flying shall not be considered to be a guarantee or an assurance that a flight attendant desiring to reduce her/his flying will be able to do so. All trip drops and trip trades conducted by such flight attendants will remain subject to the normal rules,	procedures,	and
restrictions, if	any, which	are
generally applicable to such transactions.
d.	A flight attendant who has not indicated her/his intention to fly less than forty hours (40:00) in a month in the manner indicated by the Company shall not be eligible or entitled to do so.
5 - 11 Scheduling
3.
Pay consequences of election to fly less than forty hours (40:00)
a.	On the first day of the calendar following the month in which a flight attendant provides notice of her/his desire to be eligible to fly less than forty hours (40:00) the flight attendant will be issued a paycheck in an amount equal forty hours (40:00) (twenty hours (20:00) for job share flight attendants or flight attendants on half month leaves) pay at the appropriate hourly rate, provided s/he was on active duty during the previous two (2) weeks or due to receive credited time for such two (2) weeks. (This pay is an estimated amount due for the last half of the preceding month.)
b.	On the sixteenth day of the calendar month following the month in which a flight attendant provides notice of her/his desire to be eligible to fly less than forty hours (40:00) s/he will be issued a pay/expense check containing an amount equal to the value of twelve hours and thirty minutes (12:30) if the flight attendant was on active duty or due to receive credited time for the previous two (2) weeks, and pay earned in excess of the amount(s) previously received for the previous month’s flight time.
Scheduling 5 - 12
(This pay is an estimated amount due for the first half of the current month plus “cleanup” pay from the prior month.)
c.	On the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the flight attendant desired to fly less than forty hours (40:00) the flight attendant will be issued a paycheck in an amount equal to twenty hours (20:00) pay at the appropriate hourly rate, provided s/he was on active duty during the previous two (2) weeks or due to receive credited time for such two (2) weeks. (This pay is an estimated amount due for the last half of the prior month.)
For example: A flight attendant desiring to fly less than forty hours (40:00) in April must advise the Company of her/his desire in March in the manner designated by the Company. The flight attendant will receive:
1.	A pay check on April 1 containing an amount equal to the value of forty hours (40:00) for flying performed in the last half of March,
2.	A pay/expense check on April 16th containing an amount equal to the value of twelve
5 - 13 Scheduling
hours and thirty minutes (12:30) for flying performed in the first half of April plus March cleanup pay/expenses, and
3.	A paycheck in an amount equal to twenty hours (20:00) pay at the appropriate hourly rate on May 1 for flying performed in the second half of April.
4.	The May 16th pay/expense check will contain cleanup for flying performed in excess of thirty-two hours and thirty minutes (32:30) in April, or in the event that the flight attendant flew fewer than thirty-two hours and thirty minutes (32:30) in April, the corresponding deduction.
Note: Paychecks relating to a month in which a flight attendant has designated her/his desire/intention to fly less than forty hours (40:00) will be paid based upon twelve and a half hours (12:30) for the mid-month paycheck and twenty hours (20:00) for the first of the month paycheck, regardless
Scheduling 5 - 14
of whether the flight attendant actually drops time.
4.	If a flight attendant drops no time, and actually flies all of her/his scheduled trip pairings, s/he will still receive paychecks reflecting her/his notice of desire to fly less than forty hours (40:00). Such a flight attendant will receive pay for all remaining unpaid hours on the following month’s cleanup paycheck.
5.	Seniority and benefits
a.

A flight attendant working less than forty hours (40:00) but at least twenty (20:00) hours of credited time (including only scheduled or actual flight time (whichever is greater), training, trip rig, deadhead, vacation, and for reserves only, guarantee hours) in a bid period shall receive fifty percent (50%) of vacation accrual credit, sick leave accrual, and occupational injury accruals for that bid month.
c.	A flight attendant working less than twenty (20:00) hours of credited time (including only scheduled or actual flight time (whichever is greater), training, trip rig, deadhead, vacation, and for reserves only, guarantee hours) in a bid period shall not receive any vacation accrual credit, sick leave accrual, and occupational injury accruals for that bid month.
d.	A flight attendant electing to fly less than forty hours (40:00) shall receive variable pay elements (including on-time bonuses), passes in accordance with Corporate policy, and group insurance coverage (including medical, dental, vision, expense reimbursement accounts, personal accident, long-term disability, Company paid life, and optional group universal life).
Scheduling 5 - 16
6.	Any flight attendant who engages in outside employment while electing to fly less than forty hours (40:00) will be subject to discharge unless s/he has received prior written permission.
7.	A flight attendant who flies no hours and receives no flight credit for an entire month will be considered to have been on a personal leave of absence for that month, including for purposes of benefit accruals and entitlements, and for incentive programs and payments. A flight attendant who flies no hours and receives no flight credit for the entire month in consecutive months will accrue seniority for all purposes for the first ninety (90) days, and thereafter will accrue seniority for bidding and pass longevity purposes only.
8.	Either party may request a meeting to discuss the administration of the program at any time during the life of this Agreement.

5 - 19 Scheduling
8.	To be eligible to bid a line, a flight attendant must be qualified and current. S/he must be available for no less than fifteen (15) consecutive days of the bid period.
9.	Two (2) active flight attendants who are assigned to the same base and want to fly a line of time together may “buddy” bid. Procedures for buddy bidding may be established by the Company and will be stated in the monthly bid packet. Flight attendants who are buddy bidding will be allowed to position bid.
10.	Bid packets shall be distributed in each domicile no later than the fifteenth of each month unless unusual circumstances prevent such timely distribution. Bid packets will reflect positions/assignments. Bids shall close no earlier than six (6) days after distribution.
E.	Month to Month Line Adjustments
Flight attendants who bid incompatibly are subject to the following month-to-month line adjustment procedures:
1.	Trips and trip pairings originating in the old bid period will be flown to completion.
2.	If a flight attendant is unable to fly the first trip(s) in the new bid period and her/his original new month line projection is reduced by three hours (3:00) or more, s/he will be subject to adjustment.
Scheduling 5 - 20
3.	A flight attendant who is subject to adjustment shall have the option of utilizing the self-adjustment window.
4.	The self-adjustment window will occur during the adjustment period.

b.	If there are no trips in the base which can	satisfy (a) above,	then
adjustments are to be made to + three hours (3:00) of the flight attendant’s awarded line value using trips in her/his base on any available day(s).
c.	If there are no trips in the base which can satisfy either (a) or (b) above, a flight attendant may adjust her/his line with any trip in the base on any day(s) which will bring her/his line value as close as possible to, but not more than five hours (5:00) greater than, the originally awarded line value.
5 - 21 Scheduling
d.	Adjustments must be made to comply with minimum rest periods and on-duty limitations.
e.	If a flight attendant is unable to adjust her/himself or if s/he fails to do so, regardless of the reason(s) for such inability or failure, the Company will adjust her/him using the above parameters.
1.	If no trip(s) is available, the flight attendant may first be assigned to “RA” days on days originally scheduled to fly, and then on a remaining day(s) off in the new bid period.
2.	A flight attendant may require that the Company not use RA days when adjusting her/his schedule. If a flight attendant elects this option, and is not adjusted, or not fully adjusted, then her/his guarantee will be reduced accordingly.
3.	A flight attendant on an “RA” day will be considered a Ready reserve.
f.	Flight attendants who may be awarded incompatible schedules from one month to the next will be
Scheduling 5 - 22
allowed to submit adjustment requests before the published bid closing date and time.
g.	Jobshares and Partners bidding incompatibly will be adjusted up to a minimum of forty hours (40:00), plus or minus two hours (2:00).

c.	The Company shall be entitled to staff flights on which it determines that FLSs are needed with any combination of FLB flight attendants and at-large FLSs from other base(s) in numbers no greater than those which have been agreed upon by the Company and the Union.
FLSs who are staffing at-large speaker lines solely pursuant to Section 5.F.4.a above shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations relating to FLSs who are staffed in the FLB and shall, for purposes of Section 5.G.5 below, be deemed to be staffed in the FLB for the entire bid month in which they hold the at-large line. Flight attendants who are entitled to and are holding at-large speaker lines without regard to Section 5.F.4.a above shall be considered to be staffed in the base in which they bid, and shall not be subject to the Section 5.G.5 limitations applicable to FLSs.
Regardless of any other provision herein, leaves, jobshares, reductions and displacements, and transfers into foreign language bases shall be awarded to foreign language speakers according to their seniority from among those holding and/or bidding for the same primary language position(s). In addition, for purposes of drafting and assignment of reserves, the Company may first assign FLBs having the required primary language qualification.
5 - 25 Scheduling
G. Adding, Dropping, or Trading Trips
1.	Personal drop
a.	Flight attendants may personal drop a trip pairing subject to operational requirements. Requests will only be accepted the day before report time of the trip pairing and will be granted on a first come, first served basis.
b.	Flight attendants may drop a portion/portions of a trip when it transits the base the day of the trip, if staffing allows.
2.	Equipment Change
In the event of an equipment change which does not require the original number of flight attendants scheduled, Scheduling will first reassign reserves, if any. If the trip still does not require the remaining number of flight attendants, the senior bid line holder(s) may take or opt off the trip. However, FLSs and the ISM may be required to take or complete the trip when the trip still needs their special qualification(s). If the trip does not require the original number of FLSs, the senior FLS may take or opt off the trip. If the reserve is not reassigned and travels on the same flight, s/he will be included in the senior option as provided in Section 5.G.6. The surplus flight attendant (who is either bumped off or who opts off the trip) shall, at
Scheduling 5 - 26
her/his option, be pay protected in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.K.
3.	Restoration of Days Off
A flight attendant who is entitled to restoration of a day(s) off and who declines payment for the day must be given the day off within ninety (90) days after the original day(s) was lost, on a regular scheduled work day(s). When there is a choice of days off to be restored, the restoration will be given on a day(s) mutually agreed upon by Scheduling and the flight attendant. Restoration of a day(s) off during a multiple day pairing will be either the first or last day of the pairing subject to mutual agreement between the flight attendant and Scheduling. A flight attendant will receive pay and credit for the value of the flight time lost on the restored day(s). If a flight attendant must drop a multiple day pairing to restore a day(s) off, s/he will have the option of not accepting reassignment for the remainder of the dropped pairing. In this case the flight attendant will either have her/his guarantee reduced or receive her/his pay guarantee in accordance with Section 5.K. Unless a flight attendant declines payment or will be unable to maintain the eight (8) day minimum, s/he will receive five hours (5:00) pay in addition to all other pay for the month in lieu of a restored day(s) off. If the day being restored was a reserve flight attendant’s immovable day off, the restored day will likewise be immovable. If the lost day off is not restored
5 - 27 Scheduling
as provided above within ninety (90) days, the flight attendant will be entitled to five hours (5:00) pay in addition to all other pay for the month for the lost day off. To receive the pay, the flight attendant must submit a pay claim.
4.	Trip duplication
When two (2) or more flight attendants are assigned to the same trip in the same position, the trip will be awarded by seniority option. When a flight attendant is removed from a trip due to a trip duplication or any other Company error, s/he will have the option of being released from assignment and having her/his line guarantee reduced or receive her/his line guarantee in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.K. If the trip duplication is a result of Company error, and if the error is not corrected prior to the calendar day of the trip, the senior flight attendant involved in the duplication error shall have the first option of being released from assignment with no reduction in her/his line guarantee.
5.	Trip trades and pick-ups
a. General Rules applicable to all trip
trades and pick-ups:

2.	Requests for trades must be made through the computer at least one (1) calendar day, central time, before scheduled departure time of the first trip, except that if the trip being dropped occurs after the trip being picked up, the request must be made at least twelve hours (12:00) prior to check-in of the trip being picked up. Trades involving two (2) trips which both have scheduled departures less than one (1) calendar day after the trade must be done by exception, and are subject to operational needs. Trades other than with open time (except position trades on the same pairing) may also be requested up to six hours (6:00) prior to check in through the trip trade exception line.
3.	A trade between two (2) flight attendants on the same trip pairing may be requested at check in, even if it involves the FFA (“A” position).
5 - 29 Scheduling
4.	A trade between two (2) flight attendants in the same base may be for an entire pairing or for a portion of a pairing provided that the offered time begins and ends at the base. The Company will provide a Crew Communications System (“Crew Com”) bulletin board for the advertising of flight attendant trips or portions of trips for trade/pick up within the domicile. The flight attendant is required to fly her/his original trip if no other flight attendant picks up that flying within six (6) hours prior to scheduled departure.
5.	If the FFA (“A” position) is picked up from open time, seniority option shall be permitted among the flight attendants on the same pairing.
6.	Only two (2) flight attendants may participate in a trip trade. Three (3) way trades are not permitted. One (1) flight attendant may drop one (1) or more pairings to another flight attendant without picking up any pairing in return.
Scheduling 5 - 30
7.	Complete line trades are permitted including line trades between bid line holders and reserves. Line trades will be permitted even if vacation is involved with either line. Line trade requests must be submitted one (1) calendar day local time before the first day of the new bid month.

10.	A bid line holder may displace a reserve flight attendant assigned to a trip(s) at any time up to twelve hours (12:00) prior to check-in of the trip, provided the bid line holder is more senior than the reserve flight attendant, except as provided in Sections 5.G.6 and 5.I.10.b.3.
11.	Reserve FLSs may only be displaced by senior FLS bid
5 - 31 Scheduling
line holders having the same primary language qualification.
12.	Reserve ISMs may only be displaced by senior ISM bid line holders.
13.	Open time trades involving an unequal number of days cannot cause a decrease of flight time of more than two hours (2:00). Open time trades involving an equal number of days are not subject to the two-hour (2:00) decrease parameter. A single duty period which contains a flight segment that departs the base before midnight and a return segment arriving back in the base after 0400 local time (“redeye turns”) will be considered to be one day pairings. For trip trading purposes, this pairing will be considered to occur on the pairing origination date.
14.	Open time trades may involve multiple trip pairings. There must be a minimum of one hour and thirty minutes (1:30) block-in to block-out between trip pairings scheduled for the same duty period.
Scheduling 5 - 32

16.	Flight attendants may not adjust schedules to conflict with or eliminate scheduled training or required meetings without the prior written permission of their Base Director.
17.	Scheduling may adjust flight attendant schedules to conflict with training or required meeting day(s) so long as Scheduling secures a new date to replace those missed due to the reassignment.
18.	Pick up of ISM open time by flight attendants not having ISM qualifications may be denied if Scheduling anticipates that ISM qualified flight attendants will be used to cover the trip.
19.	The placement of trips on other flight attendant’s lines to facilitate trip trading (“parking”) is not permitted.
b.	Trip trades and pick-ups involving flight attendants and Foreign
5 - 33 Scheduling
Language Speakers not in a Foreign
Language Base

3.	Less than fourteen hours (14:00) prior to departure FLBs may pick up any other open time or advertised trips in any base.
4.	Minimum days off, minimum rest and maximum duty limitations will apply. FLBs who do not maintain a sixty-five hour (65:00) (forty hours (40:00) for job-shares and partners; thirty-two hours and thirty minutes (32:30) for halfmonth leaves) minimum in their primary designated language may only pick up and trade time in their primary designated language.
5 - 35 Scheduling
d.
Trip trades and pick-ups involving International Service Managers
1.	ISMs will have unlimited trip trades with, and pick ups from, ISM open time in their base, and unlimited trip trades with other ISMs in their base subject to the provisions of Section 5.G.5.a above.
2.	ISMs cannot drop trips to non-ISMs, however, an ISM can pick up a trip from a non-ISM in their base. This must be handled through the trip trade exception desk.
3.	Less than fourteen hours (14:00) prior to departure ISMs may pick up any trip, including a non-ISM trip, from open time or advertised trips in any base.
4.	Minimum days off, minimum rest and maximum duty limitations will apply. ISMs who do not maintain a sixty-five hour (65:00) (forty hours (40:00) for job-shares and partners; thirty-two hours and thirty minutes (32:30) for halfmonth leaves) minimum of ISM trips may only pick up and trade ISM time.
Scheduling 5 - 36
5.	Only active ISMs can trade for open time ISM trips.
6.	ISMs will be paid the flight attendant rate of pay when they acquire non-ISM trips.
e. Trip trades involving trips having days which are blocked due to minimum staffing requirements
1.	Reserves Needed means the minimum number of reserve flight attendants needed to staff flights, as determined by the Company (“MIN LVL” -available on the CMPD screen in CMS).
2.	Reserves Available means actual flight attendant reserves available for duty (“NET RESV” - available on the CMPD screen in CMS).
3.	To calculate Reserve Coverage for a particular day, subtract Reserves Needed from Reserves Available.
4.	To determine Reserve Coverage for a trip pairing, add the cumulative sum of Reserve Coverage for each day of the trip pairing.
5 - 37 Scheduling
Example:
Date:	7th	8th	9th
Reserves Available:	94	102	107
Reserves Needed:	100	100	110
Reserve Coverage:	-6	+2	-3
Reserve Coverage for this three day trip is -7 (-6+2-3).
5.	Flight attendants desiring to trade two trips each of which contains one (1) or more days that are blocked due to minimum staffing coverage restrictions may do so if the trip being dropped has a greater cumulative sum Reserve Coverage than the trip being picked up, and:
a.	If the trip being dropped occurs later in the month, its lowest Reserve Coverage day can be no more than five (5) lower than the lowest Reserve Coverage day on the trip being picked up, or
b.	If the trip being dropped occurs earlier in the month, its lowest Reserve Coverage can
Scheduling 5 - 38
be no lower than the lowest Reserve Coverage day on the trip being picked up. This trade must be executed at least seven (7) days prior to the first day of the trip being dropped.
6.	Trading Example 1:
	Trip 1			Trip 2		
Date:	7th	8th 9th			18th 19th 20th		
Reserves Available:	95	102	107	104	109	94
Reserves Needed:	100	100	110	100	110	100
Reserve Coverage:	-5	+2	-3	+4	-1	-6
The Reserve Coverage for Trip 1 is (-5+2-3) = -6
The Reserve Coverage for Trip 2 is (+4-1-6) = -3
A flight attendant wants to drop Trip 2 and pick up Trip 1. Since Trip 2 (the trip being dropped) has better Reserve Coverage, the trip trade is acceptable under paragraph 5, above. Trip 2 is later in the month, so paragraph 5.a applies. The lowest day in Trip 2 is -6, and the lowest
5 - 39 Scheduling
day in Trip 1 is -5. Since the lowest day in Trip 2 is only 1 lower than the lowest day in trip 1, the trade is allowed under paragraph 5.a.
Trading Example 2:
	Trip 3			Trip 4		
Date:	9th 10th 11th			18th 19th 20th		
Reserves Available:	105	108	97	94	100	109
Reserves Needed:	100	110	105	100	100	110
Reserve Coverage:	+5	-2	-8	-6	0	-1
The Reserve Coverage for Trip 3 is (+5-2-8) = -5
The Reserve Coverage for Trip 4 is (-6+0-1) = -7
On the third day of the month a flight attendant wants to drop Trip 3 and pick up Trip 4. Since Trip 3 (the trip being dropped) has higher Reserve Coverage, the trade is acceptable under paragraph 5. Trip 3 is earlier in the month, so paragraph 5.b applies. Since the lowest day in Trip 3 (-8) is lower than the lowest day in Trip 4 (-6), the trade would be denied. In addition, the trip trade does not occur at least 7 days prior to the first day of Trip 3 (the 2nd), and would be denied for this reason also.
Scheduling 5 - 40
7.	All trip trades involving carryover pairings will be handled pursuant to the rules of this paragraph 5.G.5.e.
a.	The beginning Reserve Coverage for days in carry-over trips occurring in the following bid month will be considered to be zero (0).
b.	When a flight attendant trades off of a day in a carryover trip which occurs in the following bid month, the Reserve Coverage will be reduced by one (1).
c.	When a flight attendant picks up a day in a carryover trip which occurs in the following bid month, the Reserve Coverage will be increased by one (1).
8.	In summary, if the trip you want to drop is later in the month than the trip you want to pick up, paragraphs 5 and 5.a, above apply. If the trip you want to drop is earlier in the month than the one you
5 - 41 Scheduling
want to pick up, paragraphs 5 and 5.b, above apply. If the trip you want to drop is earlier in the month than the one you want to pick up, the trade must be accomplished seven calendar days before the first day of the trip being dropped (see, 5.b). Finally, both trips must have blocked days (see, 5).
6.	Seniority option
Under the following circumstances reserve flight attendants may be opted out of a position by a lineholder, but only if the lineholder is a more senior flight attendant. At the airport, only the open bid position is available for senior option. If a more senior flight attendant opts for the open bid position, the reserve flight attendant assumes the position vacated by the more senior flight attendant. The reserve may only be opted out of a position once, and the seniority option can occur only at the beginning of a pairing and before preflight duties begin. Reserve flight attendants assigned to a load position which is a different pairing number shall not be opted out of the position, unless the pairings contain identical flight segments. Reserve FLBs may only be opted by FLB lineholders having the same primary language qualification. FLBs may not senior opt nonlanguage speaker positions. Non-speaker
Scheduling 5 - 42
reserve flight attendants assigned to an FLS position may be opted by a more senior lineholder.
H.	Open Time
1.	All unassigned time, except as defined in Section 5.A.5, will be available in each base. Load/variable staffing may be included in open time, but is not required to be. Additionally, the Company shall provide at the beginning of the adjustment period approximately three (3) ISM, FLS, FLB, and FA hours of open time per ISM, FLS, FLB, and FA line in each base. All trip(s) that are placed in open time and changes to open time will be made available as soon as possible. Time may be moved from one base to another to accommodate staffing requirements and the operations.
2.	The Company will request flight attendant volunteers to work required positions on inaugural flights. Selection of the crew will take into account availability (trip conflicts), special qualifications and/or situations, and seniority. Inaugural position(s) may also be placed in open time.
3.	All trips removed from open time by a bid line holder and placed in the bid line holder’s schedule will become part of her/his bid line for the month unless the flight attendant contacts Scheduling within one hour (1:00) of the transaction to withdraw it.
5 - 43 Scheduling
4.	The Company may place reserve days in open time. These days will be referred to as “RO” days. RO days may be picked up by lineholders provided they are legal and available to fly on the day(s) picked up. A trip assignment on an RO day(s) is limited to the RO day(s). An RO day where no assignment occurs does not constitute a calendar day free from duty. A flight attendant who picks up an RO day shall be paid and credited for the value of a reserve day or the value of the assigned trip if it is greater.
I.	Reserve Duty
1.	A reserve	is always subject to
reassignment.
2.	Regular reserve lines will be published with a minimum of ten (10) days off; where staffing allows, some reserve lines will be built with eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), or fifteen (15) days off. On reserve lines built with more than ten (10) days off, the reserve guarantee will be reduced by four (4) hours for each day off in addition to ten (10). A regular reserve flight attendant who is involuntarily assigned a line with more than ten (10) days off may, at her/his option, contact crew scheduling to restore reserve day(s) and corresponding guarantee, provided that such restored line retains a minimum of ten (10) days off. ISM reserve lines will be published with twelve
Scheduling 5 - 44
(12)	days off. One set of four (4) days off on the line will be designated immovable. Reserves will automatically be released from duty at 1600 local time prior to immovable days off unless prior assignment has been made. In the event the four (4) immovable days are at the end of the larger block of days off, the provision for early release from duty does not apply.
3.	Reserve assignments may be classified as either “Ready” or “Callout” reserve. Except as provided in I.7.b below, reserve assignments which are dropped or traded will retain their original classification.
a.	Ready reserves must be available to be contacted for duty assignments on a twenty-four (24) hour standby basis.
b.	Call-out reserves are required to be available to be contacted for duty assignments only during assigned notification periods contained in the monthly bid packet. Assigned notification periods may not exceed either eight hours (8:00) or number more than two (2) in a calendar day. Scheduling may change the assigned notification period(s) a maximum of three (3) times in a bid period provided that the newly assigned notification period(s) does not exceed a total time of eight hours (8:00) in a calendar day.
5 - 45 Scheduling
1.	Scheduling may attempt to contact Call-out reserves outside of the notification period. If contacted, the Callout reserve must accept the assignment.
2.	Call-out reserves may be converted to Ready reserve status a maximum of three (3) days per bid period.
c.	Reserve time in each base will be constructed so that a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the reserve time is Call-out reserve.
d.	For the first three (3) days of each bid period, and during the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays which will be from July 1 to July 7; 3 days before Thanksgiving, 3 days after Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving Day; and December 21 to January 4 respectively, all reserves will be Ready reserves.
4.	Reserve flight attendants will be given flight assignments after consideration of all of the following (listed in order of importance):
a.	Prevent flying into a scheduled day off.
b.	Need for foreign language speaker qualification.
Scheduling 5 - 46
c.	Maximize utilization of available duty periods.
d.	The more limited availability of Callout reserves.
e.	Assignment on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The FIFO list will be available for flight attendant viewing on the Crew Communication System (CCS).
f.	Equalization of duty periods assigned (leveling).
5.	When applying the above-listed criteria flight attendants’ expressed preferences through the reserve request screen will also be considered. Reserve flight attendants will be provided an opportunity to express their preference for Airport Alert assignments and for minimum flying or maximum flying. Reserves requesting these options will be assigned in FIFO order. Reserves selecting the option to fly more hours are indicating a willingness to be turned first upon completion of trips or have days off rolled first to increase flying time. (However, other reserves may also have their days off rolled or be turned if insufficient reserve coverage exists.) Reserve flight attendants desiring maximum flying will be given flying assignments prior to other similarly situated flight attendants who have expressed a preference for minimum flying.
5 - 47 Scheduling
6.	Reserve flight attendants must be able to report for duty on two hours (2:00) notice. Reserves must keep Scheduling advised of local phone numbers where they can be reached while on reserve duty. An alternate contact number such as a beeper is permitted. Scheduling will attempt to contact each reserve flight attendant at least twice within twenty minutes (:20). Scheduling will call each contact number twice to allow for a dialing error. A reserve flight attendant will respond to a beeper contact within twenty minutes (:20). The two hour (2:00) report time will begin at the time the reserve is first called or beeped.
7.	A reserve may trade a day off with another reserve in her/his base.
a.	Trades may be done anytime during the month, however, the request must be made at least one (1) calendar day, Central time prior to the day to be traded.
b.	Throughout the month reserves may trade an unlimited number of days off with the reserve availability pool. Call-out reserves may trade a maximum of four (4) days which shall be call-out status and originally awarded contact periods. Days acquired through additional call-out trades and ready reserve trades will be Ready reserve days.
Scheduling 5 - 48
c.	Reserves must maintain availability
for the shortest trip in their base.
d.	Minimum reserve coverage will be
determined by Scheduling. Reserve pool trades will start with the 72-hour open window.
e.	When a reserve elects to trade an immovable day(s) off, only the traded day(s) will become a movable day off.
8.	When a reserve performs Airport Alert duty for a four hour (4:00) period, s/he may be extended for an additional two hours (2:00) only if there are no Reserves available at home in her/his geographic domicile and on duty who are eligible for a multiple day trip. A trip assignment must be given within the six hour (6:00) alert period, or the reserve will be released by Scheduling into a day(s) off, crew rest, or a twenty-four hour (24:00) break. If an Airport Alert is assigned to a trip entitling her/him to per diem, the per diem shall commence when the flight attendant started her/his alert assignment. When a reserve performs Airport Alert duty for a four hour (4:00) period, and is extended for an additional two hours (2:00) and sits any portion of that additional two hours, she/he shall be credited with the greater of six hours (6:00) or her/his flight time plus four hours (4:00) for that duty period.
5 - 49 Scheduling
9.	A reserve flight attendant who completes an airport alert assignment of two hours (2:00) or more with no flight assignment shall receive four hours (4:00) pay. When a reserve flight attendant is given a flight assignment after completing two hours (2:00) of Airport Alert duty, such reserve flight attendant shall receive four hours (4:00) pay or two hours (2:00) pay plus flight time, whichever is greater. A reserve flight attendant who reports for duty and is subsequently released shall receive two hours (2:00) show-no-go pay. A flight attendant shall not be entitled to receive both Airport Alert pay and show-no-go pay for the same duty period.
10.	Trip Pick-Up by Reserve Coming from Days Off
a. Reserves who are returning to duty from a day(s) off, including vacation days, personal drop days, personal leaves of absence and twenty-four (24) hour breaks containing a calendar day or who are unassigned after completing Airport Alert may pick up any trip in open time for the next day departing at 1100 local time or before or may pick up an airport alert assignment beginning at 1100 local time or before. Airport alert assignments not beginning on the hour may be picked up through a call to Scheduling. Reserve flight attendants picking up trips pursuant
Scheduling 5 - 50
to this paragraph may not be displaced by lineholders, and will be released to check-in.
1.	A call in to Scheduling must be accomplished between 1500 and 1800 Central Time or within thirty minutes (:30) of the termination of the Airport Alert assignment if the assignment terminates after 1800. These trip pick-ups may be denied if incompatible with the number of duty days or when the reserve is at or above sixty-five (65) credit hours in the month.
2.	A reserve who picks up a trip in this manner will be released to check-in and is not subject to displacement by a senior bid line holder, but may be subject to reassignment in accordance with paragraph 5.K (for example, if the trip has been cancelled). A pickup may only be denied when necessary to equalize duty periods (leveling) between reserves.
b. If no trips are available departing at 1100 local time or before, the reserve may pick up any trip in open time that departs the next day.
5 - 51 Scheduling
1.	A call in to Scheduling must be accomplished between 1500 and 1800 Central Time or within thirty minutes (:30) of the termination of the Airport Alert assignment if the assignment terminates after 1800. These trip pick-ups may be denied if incompatible with the number of duty days or when the reserve is at or above sixty-five (65) credit hours in the month.
2.	A reserve who picks up a trip in this manner may be subject to reassignment in accordance with paragraph 5.K (for example, if the trip has been cancelled) or if s/he has been displaced by a senior bid line holder in the base).
3.	A reserve who picks up a trip in this manner may be bumped up to 12 hours prior to check-in of the trip by a senior lineholder in her/his base.
4.	A reserve who picks up a trip in this manner will be required to verify the assignment during the assignment window provided for in paragraph 12
Scheduling 5 - 52
below. A pick-up may only be denied when necessary to equalize duty periods (leveling) between reserves.
5.	Reserves who pick up trips during the 15:00 reserve window and are subsequently bumped prior to the 18:00 assignment window will be allowed to pick up another trip that satisfies the parameters set forth in Section 5 (I)(4) of the collective bargaining agreement.
11.	An automated voice-response assignment system will be used to facilitate reserve assignments and releases. Scheduling will attempt to have assignments for all trips and airport alert assignments that begin before 1200 on the following day available on the VRS no later than 2100 Central time.
12.	All Call-out reserves not previously given an assignment for the following day are required to call the assignment VRS between 2100 and 2400 Central time on the evening before any duty day to:
a.	Confirm trip assignments and airport alert assignments for the following day. If no assignment is provided, the reserve shall be considered released until her/his Call-out period(s) on the following day;
5 - 53 Scheduling
b.	Confirm the times of their Call-out responsibilities for the following day if no assignment has been provided;
c.	Confirm that their status has not been changed to Ready reserve for the following day.
d.	A Call-out reserve who fails to contact the VRS between 2100 and 2400 Central time prior to a day of duty shall be converted to Ready reserve for the remainder of her/his scheduled block of reserve days, except that a flight attendant who is on flight duty during that time period shall not be so converted if she/he contacts Scheduling promptly upon the block-in of her/his trip. Such conversion shall not be considered as part of the limitation set forth in paragraph 5.I.3.b.2.
13.	Ready reserves must call the VRS between 2100 and 2400 to confirm trip assignments and airport alert assignments for the following day. All ready reserves will remain ready reserves, subject to assignment/ reassignment, even if an assignment has been confirmed through the VRS.
14.	Reserve flight attendants assigned to Airport Alert will not be assigned a trip which leaves two hours (2:00) beyond the end of the alert assignment without her/his
Scheduling 5 - 54
agreement unless insufficient reserve coverage exists.
15.	Reserve flight attendants may call Scheduling once a day about their status and/or to request a release from standby duty.
16.	Reserve flight attendants must contact Scheduling before leaving the airport after the completion of their assigned trip, Airport Alert assignment or scheduled training. Reserves will be allowed to block-in with scheduling at the end of a trip assignment by phone from anywhere in the airport terminal rather than being required to physically block-in with scheduling from the crew lounge hotline phone. Phone availability for such calls outside of the crew lounge shall be the sole responsibility of the flight attendant. When blocking-in reserves must be available to be reassigned and may be required to report to such reassignment or to the crew lounge at the time of the call. Within thirty minutes (:30) of such contact, Scheduling will give the reserve flight attendant her/his next assignment or release her/him for crew rest. Upon release to crew rest Scheduling will only contact a reserve flight attendant during the last hour of the crew rest period at home base.
17.	Reserve flight attendants who are given an assignment by the VRS will be given the pairing number, check-in time, termination
5 - 55 Scheduling
time and date, and the open position(s) on the pairing. If the pairing is not contained in the monthly bid schedules, the Company will make available information regarding the complete assignment including layover points, length of layover, length of duty day and scheduled return to base.
18.	Whenever possible, reserve flight attendants who have been given a trip assignment/Airport Alert will be released until the designated reporting time of such assignment.
19.	Subject to Company agreement, a reserve flight attendant who loses a duty day(s) due to illness, injury or emergency drop will be allowed to make up the lost day(s) on her/his remaining day(s) off that month. The day(s) on which the make-up occurs is subject to mutual agreement. When a lost day is made up in this manner four hours (4:00) will be returned to the flight attendant’s reserve guarantee.
20.	At the time a reserve flight attendant becomes a bid line holder s/he will remain on reserve status until released by Scheduling. This will occur at the end of the last trip assignment of the bid month in which s/he is a reserve flight attendant or on the last day of the month, whichever is later. No days off are restored as a result of carry-over trips unless the resulting loss reduces the flight attendant’s days off below the applicable minimum. In cases where a
Scheduling 5 - 56
lineholder is returning to reserve duty all conflicting days off will be restored so that the published amount of days off remain.
21.	Reserve flight attendants are required to carry their passports during any trip/Airport Alert assignment.
22.	Reserves must call Scheduling to remove themselves from duty when they are ill. A separate call is required on each scheduled duty day on which the reserve is ill, unless the reserve is aware that the illness will prevent working for multiple duty days, in which case a minimum of one (1) call for each block of duty days on which the reserve is ill is required.
23.	If a reserve flight attendant is displaced by a bid line holder after reporting to the airport and is not reassigned, s/he shall receive two hours (2:00) pay and credit. His/her duty period shall commence at the time s/he is scheduled to report to the airport or when s/he reports to the airport, whichever is later.
24.	A reserve flight attendant who has an assignment which carries into his/her day off four hours (4:00) or more, or past midnight if her/his originally scheduled arrival time was 1900 Local time or earlier, shall have his/her day off restored in accordance with Section 5.G.3, provided s/he maintains minimum reserve days off. In the event a reserve flight attendant has
5 - 57 Scheduling
an assignment which carries into his/her day off, s/he shall be given the day off unless the Company has to roll such day due to operational requirements.
25.	Reserve flight attendants who are required to pre-board after completion of an assigned trip will be credited with one hour (1:00) toward line value for the performance of such duties. Reserve flight attendants who are given a pre-boarding assignment that extends beyond the four hour airport alert period will be credited with the one hour (1:00) toward line value in addition to their airport alert pay.
J.	Drafting
Drafting is the mandatory assignment of a flight attendant(s) or ISM(s) in reverse order of seniority to fly a trip pairing that cannot be covered by a reserve flight attendant. Drafting for ISM trips may be limited to reverse order of seniority among ISMs. When there are no reserve flight attendants available and eligible for flight assignment, the Company may assign open time in the following order:
1.	Time permitting, the Company may assign the trip in seniority order to any flight attendant who is legal and willing to work the trip assignment;
2.	Time permitting, in reverse order of seniority, any flight attendant who can be contacted who will not have his/her
Scheduling 5 - 58
regularly scheduled trip assignment interrupted by such drafting;
3.	Time permitting, in reverse order of seniority, any flight attendant who can be contacted without regard to his/her scheduled trip assignments;
4.	If unable to cover the trip assignment by the application of the first, second, or third steps above, the Company may draft any flight attendant to the trip in reverse order of seniority who will cause the least delay of the trip.
5.	A flight attendant who has been drafted shall be replaced with a reserve flight attendant at the first point where operational requirements permit, and the Company has a qualified reserve flight attendant who is available and eligible to fly.
6.	A bid line holder who is drafted will be paid and credited for her/his originally scheduled credited time missed due to the drafting or for her/his actual credited time flown, whichever is greater.
K.	Loss of Flight Time
1.	Notice on same calendar day as departure
Within two hours (2:00) of being notified that a flight attendant has lost her/his trip pairing or any portion thereof for any reason
5 - 59 Scheduling
other than her/his own unavailability for duty s/he may:
a.	With the concurrence of the Company, be relieved of all assignment responsibility with no loss of pay, or
b.	Be given a replacement pairing.
2.	If a Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) is in effect, the Company may have the following options:
a.	Provide a replacement pairing up to four hours (4:00) past the time the original trip was scheduled to depart, or
b.	Provide a replacement pairing at the time of notifying the flight attendant of the loss of her/his trip pairing, or
c.	Provide a replacement pairing within two hours (2:00) of notifying the flight attendant of the loss of her/his trip pairing. A flight attendant who is required to remain available for assignment pursuant to this paragraph K.2.c. more than four hours (4:00) past the time the original trip was scheduled to depart shall receive an additional four hours (4:00) pay and credit.
Scheduling 5 - 60
3.
Notice of one or more calendar day
At the time of the notification, if the Company does not advise the flight attendant of a replacement pairing or relieve her/him of responsibility, at her/his option s/he will:
a.	Make up the time lost on days not originally scheduled to fly in which case her/his line guarantee will be adjusted. S/he will then be relieved of all reassignment responsibility; or
b.	Make up the time as close as possible to the time lost on days originally scheduled to fly with no loss of pay. S/he will then be relieved of all reassignment responsibilities; or
c.	Be subject to reassignment in accordance with the following:
1.	After 1600 local time the day before check-in of the original trip, the flight attendant may contact Scheduling which will advise the flight attendant whether s/he is likely to be given a trip assignment.
2.	If s/he chooses to remain subject to reassignment, the flight attendant must contact Scheduling between 1800 and
5 - 61 Scheduling
2200 local time the day before the original trip was scheduled to depart. Scheduling will either reassign the flight attendant or relieve him/her of all responsibility with no loss of pay.
4.	Reassignment and/or replacement pairing provided for in Section 5.K.1 and 3, above will comply with the following:
a.	Reassignments may not be scheduled to depart earlier than two hours (2:00) before the scheduled departure of the trip lost. If an earlier reassignment interferes with a flight attendant’s prior day off, s/he shall receive fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour, in addition to his/her regular rate of pay, for all time worked prior to the scheduled departure of the trip lost.
b.	Reassignments may not be scheduled to interfere with the next scheduled calendar day off appearing in the flight attendant’s bid line without the flight attendant’s consent.
c.	Flight attendants who are reassigned to trips originating from domestic bases, other than those resulting from changeover pairings, which are scheduled to terminate more than two hours (2:00) after the original
Scheduling 5 - 62
scheduled arrival time of the trip lost shall receive fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour and fraction thereof (prorated), in addition to their regular rate of pay, for all time on duty beyond the original scheduled arrival time of the trip lost.

c.	A flight attendant who is required to remain at a downline location to protect equipment that is unserviceable for mechanical reasons will be returned to her/his base no later than twenty-four hours (24:00) after her/his originally scheduled return.

When a flight attendant becomes ineligible for his/her next scheduled trip(s), s/he shall notify Scheduling as soon as possible upon return to her/his domicile from the trip which caused her/him to become ineligible. At that time s/he shall be subject to reassignment in accordance with Section 5.K.1.
L.	Notification
Whenever possible, Scheduling will notify flight attendants of cancellations, equipment substitutions or delays over thirty minutes (:30). This will usually be feasible when Scheduling has at least two hours (2:00) notice of the change. At downline stations, Crew Coordination will notify the “A” position flight attendant only.
M.	Waiving of Limitations

5.	In the instance a flight attendant is asked to voluntarily exceed her/his limitations in violation of Section 5.M.4. above, the appropriate remedy for such violation shall be the payment to the flight attendant of one hour’s pay at her/his regular rate of pay for each hour or portion of an hour actually on duty in excess of sixteen hours (16:00) if the flight is a domestic flight and in excess of seventeen hours and thirty minutes (17:30) if the flight is an international flight.

If a doctor’s release is not received, the flight attendant will have seventy-two hours (72:00) after
Sick Leave 9 - 5
her/his first trip flown or Airport Alert assignment to provide the note.
5.	The Company may also require medical verification for all sick calls originating during the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays which will be from July 1st to July 7th; any trip touching Thanksgiving Day; and December 20th to January 4th respectively. If the Company intends to require medical verification for sick calls occurring during such holiday period, the Company will first notify the Union and give flight attendants adequate notice. Such notice for the Fourth of July holiday will be posted in the Briefing Books on June 14th and June 28th; Thanksgiving: November 1st and November 15th; Christmas: December 1st and December 15th. Flight attendants who have had no absences in the prior twelve (12) calendar months will not be subject to the medical verification requirement imposed during these holiday periods.
6.	Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Company from requiring a flight attendant to provide satisfactory verification of an incapacitating illness from an accredited physician when circumstances suggest that abuse or misuse of sick leave has occurred.
9 - 6 Sick Leave
I.
Occupational Injury Administration
1.	Occupational injury absences which are caused by the same accident and are part of the same occupational injury claim will be considered to be a single incident.
2.	Any flight attendant desiring to challenge or protest action(s) by the Company relating to occupational injury, may in addition to any other appeal raise her/his claim to the Union’s designee(s) who will attempt to achieve a prompt resolution of the matter with the Senior Director, Inflight Services.
3.	During absences due to occupational injuries, a flight attendant who has applied for or is receiving workers’ compensation benefits will receive direct payment from the Company equal to only thirty percent (30%) of the forty hour (40:00) semi-payment paid on the first of the month, thirty percent (30%) of the twenty-five hour (25:00) semipayment paid on the sixteenth of the month, and thirty percent (30%) of pay earned in excess of sixty-five hours (65:00) in a month. The Company shall deduct an amount equal to all hours paid (directly and indirectly via workers’ compensation) from the flight attendant’s occupational injury bank not to exceed a maximum of eighty three (83:00) hours (forty-one hours and thirty minutes (41:30) for job share/partnership/half month leave flight attendants) unless the flight attendant has more than two hundred hours (200:00) in
Sick Leave 9 - 7
her/his O/I bank following the withdrawal, in which event the flight attendant’s month end pay total shall not be capped. This will continue until the flight attendant’s occupational injury bank is exhausted. When a flight attendant’s occupational injury bank is exhausted, s/he may continue to supplement Workers’ Compensation benefits using her/his sick leave bank on an hour for hour basis, deducting one hour (1:00) of sick bank for each additional hour paid from the sick bank not to exceed a maximum of eighty three (83:00) hours (forty-one hours and thirty minutes (41:30) for job share/partnership/half month leave flight attendants) unless the flight attendant has more than two hundred hours (200:00) in her/his O/I bank following the withdrawal, in which event the flight attendant’s month end pay total shall not be capped, Workers’ Compensation benefits will continue in accordance with state law.
4.	Flight attendants who receive state worker’s compensation benefits will have their occupational injury leave pay reduced by the same amount excluding any lump sum payment resulting from a temporary total disability and/or temporary partial disability.
J.	A flight attendant on sick leave or occupational injury leave who engages in outside employment without receiving prior written permission from the Company may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
9 - 8 Sick Leave
K.	All credit for sick leave and occupational injury will be canceled if employment stops. No payment for accumulated sick leave or occupational injury credit will be made. A flight attendant on leave of absence or on furlough status will retain, but not accrue sick leave credit.
L.	A flight attendant’s per diem and lodging, as provided in Section 7 (Traveling Expenses), will be provided until the flight attendant returns to her/his base if s/he becomes ill or injured while en route, unless the flight attendant is at the place of their residence.
M.	If a flight attendant has been absent due to illness or injury for thirty (30) days or more, s/he may bid for the month s/he returns to duty. S/he must first provide written verification from her/his personal doctor indicating s/he will be able to return by the fifteenth day of such month.
N.	Misuse of sick leave or occupational injury leave, excessive absenteeism or unreliable attendance will be grounds for termination.
O.	A flight attendant’s pay voucher will show her/his sick leave accrual and occupational injury leave accrual each month.
P.	If a flight attendant’s spouse or minor child is injured or becomes ill so that the flight attendant is unable to report for work, s/he will be allowed to use sick time for up to three (3) consecutive days, or the duration of the pairing, whichever is greater. The absence will be treated the same as the flight
Sick Leave 9 - 9
attendant’s sick time, and will count for attendance/ disciplinary purposes.
9 - 10 Sick Leave
Section 10 - Medical Examinations
A.	The Company may require a fitness for duty medical examination when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a flight attendant’s physical or mental health impairs her/his ability to safely perform the duties of a flight attendant, or when a flight attendant claims such an inability and the Company has a reasonable basis to believe that the flight attendant’s physical or mental health does not impair her/his ability to safely perform flight attendant duties. The supervisor will contact the Vice President, Inflight or her/his local management designee for a second review and authorization before requiring the fitness for duty. The Company will pay for the examination by a Company approved medical examiner. Unless s/he is earlier found to be not fit for duty, an active flight attendant held out of service for a fitness for duty will continue to receive her/his regular pay for fourteen (14) days or until the first scheduled date for her/his examination by the Company approved medical examiner, whichever is later. The medical examiner will provide both the Company and the flight attendant with her/his diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
B.	If the flight attendant disagrees with the medical examiner’s findings, s/he has the right to have another examination by a qualified medical examiner of her/his choice at her/his expense. S/he will schedule this examination to occur within fourteen (14) days after s/he receives the Company approved medical examiner’s findings,
Medical Examinations 10 - 1
and will provide the Company with a copy of her/his medical examiner’s diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis immediately upon receiving it. Reasonable additional time will be allowed if her/his medical examiner believes that special laboratory analysis or other procedures are needed either to confirm or disprove the Company approved medical examiner’s findings.
C.	Medical Dispute Resolution Procedures
1.	If the findings of the flight attendant’s medical examiner confirm those of the Company-approved medical examiner, the findings will be final.
2.	If the findings of the two (2) medical examiners disagree, the flight attendant may make a written request for the appointment of a third medical examiner to resolve the conflict. S/he must do so within ten (10) days of receiving the second report. The Company will then ask the two (2) medical examiners to agree upon a third qualified and disinterested medical examiner (preferably a specialist in the area of the flight attendant’s possible disability).
3.	The third medical examiner is entitled to the written conclusions of the other two (2) medical examiners if s/he wishes them. S/he will make a further examination of the flight attendant.
4.	The third medical examiner will mail a copy of her/his findings to the Company and the
10 - 2 Medical Examinations
flight attendant within ten (10) days of the third examination. Reasonable additional time will be allowed if the third doctor believes special laboratory analysis or other procedures are needed.
5.	The Company and the flight attendant will each pay one-half (1/2) of the expenses for the third medical examiner.
6.	The third medical examiner’s findings will be final and binding on the Company and the flight attendant.
7.	If the final opinion is that the flight attendant is fit to fly, s/he will be returned to flight status immediately. If s/he has been withheld from service against her/his wishes, s/he will be paid retroactively any difference between what s/he did earn (including unemployment compensation if any) and what s/he would have earned had s/he been in flight status for the period between the date of the first scheduled examination by the Company approved medical examiner, and the date s/he was returned to flight status, except as provided in paragraph 8 below.
8.	A flight attendant who fails to obtain her/his second examination within fourteen (14) days after receiving the Company approved medical examiner’s findings, as provided in paragraph B above, shall forfeit all claim or entitlement to any pay from the end of that fourteen (14) day period until the second
Medical Examinations 10 - 3
examination actually occurs, unless the parties expressly agree to the contrary.
9.	In the event that the flight attendant becomes entitled to retroactive pay pursuant to paragraph 7 above, her/his paycheck shall be issued as a special check made available to the flight attendant within two (2) business days after the day the Company was notified that the flight attendant was fit to fly.
D.	Any medical information obtained through any of these examinations will be kept strictly confidential. This does not prevent providing this information to relevant management to determine appropriate actions. The information will not be given to any other person without the written permission of the flight attendant.
E.	Medical examinations involving possible drug and alcohol abuse will be handled under the Company’s published Drug and Alcohol Policy.
10 - 4 Medical Examinations
Section 11 - Alcohol and Drug Testing
Part 1 - Testing Occasions
A. Random Testing
1.	All flight attendants will be subject to random drug and/or alcohol testing to the extent required by applicable federal regulations.
2.	The Company may conduct random drug and/or alcohol testing of flight attendants any time just before, during, or just after a trip sequence. A flight attendant undergoing drug and/or alcohol testing will, for the purpose of Federal Aviation Regulations relating to duty time and minimum rest, be deemed to be on duty until the testing collection process is completed.
3.	Following positive verification of identification using photographic identification, flight attendants selected for random drug and/or alcohol testing will be given a written notice, in duplicate, stating the location where the flight attendant is to report for the collection process, and advising her/him that refusal or failure to immediately report and to provide the required urine and/or breath specimen will result in termination of the flight attendant’s employment.
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 1
B.
Post Accident Testing
1.	Post accident drug and/or alcohol testing of flight attendants will be required when the Executive Vice President, Operations, the Vice President Inflight, or the Senior Director Safety and Regulatory Compliance determines that an event has occurred which constitutes an aircraft “accident” as defined in applicable federal regulations and the flight attendant’s performance contributed to the accident and/or her/his performance cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident.
2.	Flight attendants required to submit to post accident testing shall do so as soon as possible after the accident. If unusual circumstances result in a delay of the testing, the flight attendant(s) must remain available for alcohol testing for a period of eight hours (8:00) following the accident. Drug testing may be required up to thirty-two hours (32:00) following the accident. (Normally both drug and alcohol test collection will be required, and will be administered at the same time.)
3.	If the flight attendant has incurred significant physical injury in the accident, medical treatment will take priority over drug and/or alcohol testing. Drug and/or alcohol testing shall be accomplished as
11 - 2 Alcohol and Drug Testing
soon as possible after necessary medical aid has been rendered.
C.	Reasonable Cause Drug Testing
When reasonable cause exists, based on observable and objective criteria, to believe that a flight attendant is using drugs prohibited by applicable federal regulations, the Executive Vice President, Operations, the Vice President Inflight, or the Senior Director Safety and Regulatory Compliance may require that the flight attendant submit to drug testing. Reasonable cause must be established by direct observation of two (2) management officials, one (1) of whom may be a management designee, and one (1) of whom must be trained in detecting the indications of drug use. The two (2) officials must substantiate and concur in the decision to recommend that the flight attendant be tested. Once the determination is made, the testing will be done promptly. Reports and observations must be documented.
D.	Reasonable Cause Alcohol Testing
When reasonable cause exists, based on articulable observation of the flight attendant’s appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors, to believe that a flight attendant is using alcohol in a way which is prohibited by applicable federal regulations, the Executive Vice President, Operations, the Vice President Inflight, or the Senior Director Safety and Regulatory Compliance may require that the flight attendant submit to alcohol testing. Reasonable cause, based on such articulable observation must be established by
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 3
direct observation by a management employee who is trained in detecting the indications of alcohol abuse. Once the determination is made, the testing will be done promptly. The reason for any delay shall be documented.
Part 2	- Drug Testing Procedures
A.	Specimen Collection
1.	The Company may elect to have collections services performed by a third party agency.
2.	Collection and shipment of urine specimens for drug testing shall be in accordance with applicable federal regulations.
3.	Urine specimens shall be split.
4.	If testing of the first half of the specimen yields a confirmed negative result, the Company shall order that the second half of the specimen be destroyed.
B.	Drug Testing Laboratories
Drug tests will be performed only at laboratories certified by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
C.	Medical Review Officer
1.	The Company shall designate the medical review officer (MRO). The MRO will be a licensed medical doctor who has knowledge of substance abuse.
11 - 4 Alcohol and Drug Testing
2.
The MRO shall perform his responsibilities in accordance with applicable federal regulations.
D.	Retesting
1.	A flight attendant who has been notified that her/his test resulted in a confirmed verified positive finding may request a retest of the split portion of the specimen by the same laboratory which tested the original sample, provided s/he does so within seventy-two hours (72:00) following such notification. At the flight attendant’s option and expense, the second test will be done at a different NIDA certified laboratory.
2.	If a second specimen (which must also be split) was provided at the time of the original collection, the flight attendant may request that the second sample also be tested. At the flight attendant’s option and expense, the second sample will be tested at a different NIDA certified laboratory.
3.	To the extent that it is practically feasible and does not conflict with applicable federal regulations, a flight attendant who has been notified of a confirmed verified positive result may elect to have the specimen(s) DNA tested at the flight attendant’s expense. DNA testing will only be done at accredited forensic laboratories which have been certified through the American Association of Blood Banks, the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors or a
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 5
laboratory that follows the technical working group for DNA analysis methods. All specimen transfer shall be done in accordance with applicable federal regulations.
4.	Should the test of either the split portion of the initial specimen or the second specimen be negative, then the test shall be considered to be negative. Similarly, should the DNA testing establish conclusively that either specimen is not that of the flight attendant, the test shall be deemed to be negative.
E.	Positive Drug Tests
1.	After receiving a confirmed positive, but before verifying that result, the MRO will make all reasonable attempts to contact the flight attendant (including, if necessary requesting that the Vice President, Inflight direct the flight attendant to contact the MRO) to discuss the test result.
2.	Following the discussion with the flight attendant and any other appropriate inquiry the MRO will determine whether to verify the test result.
3.	In the event that the MRO verifies the confirmed positive result, s/he shall in addition to any other duties, refer the matter to Continental’s Employee Assistance Program Director, who shall notify the Vice President Inflight.
11 - 6 Alcohol and Drug Testing
Part 3	- Alcohol Testing
Testing for alcohol shall be conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations by appropriately certified personnel. The Company shall not be obligated to preserve breath specimens for retesting. A flight attendant who has been informed that s/he has tested positive for alcohol at a concentration of 0.02 or higher may request that a blood alcohol test be administered. Such testing must be administered as soon after the breath test as is reasonably possible.
Part 4	- Consequences of a Verified Confirmed Positive Drug Test
A.	Inadvertent Ingestion
1.	Inadvertent and unknowing ingestion of any drug of abuse (or its metabolite) shall not be grounds for discipline.
2.	The burden of proving inadvertent and/or unknowing ingestion rests upon the flight attendant.
B.	Illicit Drugs
1.	Except as described in paragraph A above, on her/his first such occasion, a flight attendant who has a verified confirmed positive drug test, shall be given the following options:
a.	Voluntary resignation without eligibility for rehire.
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 7
b.	Termination for cause. However, a flight attendant exercising this option may be conditionally reinstated subject to the following terms and conditions:
1.	The flight attendant must submit to initial evaluation by Continental’s EAP Director or the Director’s designee. (Eligibility for conditional reinstatement will not be contingent upon a diagnosis of chemical dependency.)
2.	If one is recommended, the flight attendant must successfully complete the course of rehabilitation recommended by Continental’s EAP, include-ing all continuing terms and conditions attached to such course of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation will be directed and facilitated by Continental’s EAP, but will be funded entirely by the flight attendant, except that s/he shall not be precluded from using any insurance benefits to which s/he is otherwise entitled.
3.	The flight attendant must execute and deliver to the EAP Director an undated letter of resignation to be used
11 - 8 Alcohol and Drug Testing
to terminate the flight attendant’s employment should s/he fail to satisfy any of the terms of this Paragraph B or of the rehabilitation directed by EAP.
4.	During the remainder of her/his career with Continental, should the flight attendant subsequently fail any drug test the undated letter of resignation will be accepted by the Company, and her/his employment severed.
5.	The flight attendant shall commit in writing to remain drug free for the remainder of her/his career at Continental and shall agree in writing to be subject to “no notice” drug testing at the direction of the Company as frequently as the Company may decide for a period of five (5) years from the completion of the formal rehabilitation program. Following the five (5) year period during which the flight attendant shall be subject to no notice testing, s/he shall be obligated only to submit to such further testing as may be required by applicable federal regulations or this Agreement.
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 9
6.	If the flight attendant fails to comply with the provisions of the conditional reinstatement, termination will result, and her/his right to challenge such termination through the grievance process shall be waived. No grievance of the matter shall be permitted.
7.	A flight attendant who is offered conditional reinstatement shall be solely responsible for ensuring that s/he is fully licensed and certified to perform the duties of a commercial flight attendant.
8.	If a flight attendant elects to
use this option B, but the Company nevertheless declines to conditionally reinstate her/him despite his/her compliance with the terms of this Paragraph, the Company shall reimburse her/him for all out of pocket costs for his/her course of rehabilitation.
11 - 10 Alcohol and Drug Testing
Part 5 - Consequences of a Positive Alcohol Test
A.	When a flight attendant’s breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration between 0.02 and 0.039, s/he shall be retested no sooner than fifteen minutes (:15) from the administration of the initial test. If the second test also indicates an alcohol concentration between 0.02 and 0.039, the flight attendant shall not be permitted to resume flight duties until either eight hours (8:00) have elapsed since the original test, or his breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. If the second test indicates an alcohol concentration below 0.02, the test shall be considered negative, and the flight attendant shall be permitted to resume flight duties.
B.	A flight attendant whose breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration between 0.02 and 0.039 twice within eighteen (18) months shall thereafter be subject to no notice alcohol testing for a period of twelve (12) months from the time of the second such test.
C.	If a flight attendant’s breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, s/he shall be required, as a condition of continuing employment, to undergo evaluation by Continental’s EAP Director, or the Director’s designee and to complete any rehabilitation recommended by EAP prior to resuming any flight duties. Such rehabilitation shall be funded entirely by the flight attendant, except that s/he shall not be precluded from using any insurance benefits to which s/he is otherwise entitled. In addition, s/he shall be subject to no notice alcohol testing for a
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 11
period of five (5) years from the date of her/his completion of the formal rehabilitation program. Thereafter the flight attendant will not be subject to further no notice testing relating to the rehabilitation.
D.	If at any time during the balance of the flight attendant’s career s/he has a breath alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, s/he shall be forever barred from working as a flight attendant for Continental, or from performing any other safety sensitive duties at Continental.
Part 6	- No Notice Testing
A.	No notice is drug and/or alcohol testing administered by the Company in aid of rehabilitation as described elsewhere in this Part. Flight attendants will be subject to no notice testing under each of the following circumstances:
1.	The flight attendant has submitted to a rehabilitation program requiring no notice testing.
2.	A System Board of Adjustment has directed no notice testing.
3.	The flight attendant has had a previous verified confirmed positive drug test result, a breath alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, or two breath alcohol tests indicating an alcohol concentration between 0.02 and 0.039 within eighteen (18) months.
11 - 12 Alcohol and Drug Testing
B.	During the period a flight attendant is subject to no notice testing, the Company may require no notice drug and/or alcohol testing as frequently as it deems necessary or advisable.
C.	No notice testing may be conducted just before, during, or just after any trip sequence.
Part 7	- Voluntary Rehabilitation
A flight attendant who has not had a verified confirmed positive drug test result or a breath alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, may enter voluntarily into any FAA approved drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program, including any such program recommended by Continental’s EAP. A flight attendant who has voluntarily entered into a rehabilitation program pursuant to this Part shall be entitled to use any accumulated sick leave to the extent needed to complete the rehabilitation program. Upon completion of the formal rehabilitation program and appropriate certification by the FAA, the flight attendant shall assume the bid position to which s/he is otherwise entitled by the terms of this Agreement.
Part 8	- Refusal or Failure to Cooperate
A flight attendant who refuses or fails to cooperate in any drug or alcohol test as mandated by applicable federal regulations or by this Agreement, or in any rehabilitation related testing by refusing to provide a breath or urine specimen, or a breath or urine specimen of sufficient quantity will be withheld from service without pay pending investigation. If the investigation fails to find a valid medical reason for the flight attendant’s failure to
Alcohol and Drug Testing 11 - 13
cooperate, or in the case of an insufficient specimen if a medical evaluation determines that there was no genuine inability to provide the required specimen, s/he shall be terminated.
Part 9	- General
A.	Consistent with applicable federal regulations and Part 1, Paragraph A.3, above, a flight attendant will be permitted to notify the Union regarding any matter concerning this Section as soon as possible.
B.	A flight attendant who is subjected to random drug and/or alcohol testing shall be paid as provided in Section 4.W. (Note: alcohol and drug testing are sometimes conducted together. A flight attendant who is required to provide both a breath and a urine specimen on the same occasion shall receive only one payment for such an occurrence, not two.)
C.	Except for no notice testing, drug testing shall be limited to those drugs (and their metabolites) listed in applicable federal regulations.
D.	In the event that the flight attendant requests, or applicable federal regulations require that, a blood test be accomplished, the drawing of the blood shall only be done by a trained, qualified, medical professional, and only in a clinical setting.
11 - 14 Alcohol and Drug Testing
E.	It is the parties’ intent that this Section be and remain in full compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations.

If Scheduling is unable to provide the necessary consecutive days free from duty at the time of the relocation, additional time may be granted in accordance with the procedure described in Section 14.B.2. The adjustment will be on a non-paid basis and must be arranged within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the transfer.
C.	Opening of a New Base
The Company will post a notice of a newly established base at all existing bases as far in advance as possible, but not less than thirty (30) days in advance of the new base opening. The notice will state the anticipated number of vacancies. It will remain posted in the bulletin books until the initial vacancies for the new base are filled. All flight attendants, including those who are specially qualified, will be entitled to bid the vacancies. They will be awarded in system seniority order.

If no or insufficient bids are received from the base(s) that is over complement, the most junior flight attendants and/or specially qualified flight attendants from the base will be assigned to fill the remaining temporary vacancy(s). If there are no bases over complement, the Company will post the temporary vacancies in all bases. They will be awarded in system seniority order and/or considering special qualifications, if applicable. If no or insufficient bids are received, the most junior flight attendants and/or specially qualified flight attendants on the system will be assigned to fill the remaining temporary vacancy(s)
2.	If there is insufficient time to utilize the procedures in Section 12.D.1 above, the vacancies will first be offered in seniority order to those flight attendants who have permanent transfers on file to that base, and then filled by assignment of the most junior flight attendants and/or specially qualified flight attendants from the base(s) which has an over complement of flight attendants. If no base is over complement, the most junior flight attendants and/or specially qualified flight attendants on the system may be assigned to fill the vacancy(s). If these procedures are utilized,
12 - 7 Filling of Vacancies

Filling of Vacancies 12 - 8
Section 13	- System Furloughs, Base Reductions, and Base Closures
A.	The Company’s goal is to maintain its flight attendant group intact. However, if it is necessary to reduce the number of flight attendants (“System Furlough”) or to adjust staffing levels in the bases (“Base Reduction”), the Company will first offer leaves of absence to the potentially affected flight attendant groups.
B.	If a System Furlough and/or Base Reduction is necessary, the following will apply:
1.	Seniority will be used in selecting flight attendants to be furloughed. The most junior flight attendant on the system will be involuntarily furloughed first. An involuntary furlough occurs when a flight attendant’s seniority is insufficient to allow her/him to hold any position on the system.
2.	Seniority will be used in selecting flight attendants to be displaced from their base. The most junior flight attendant in the base will be displaced first.
3.	Inactive flight attendants are subject to furlough or displacement.
C.	In the month before a System Furlough, Base Reduction, or a Base Closure the Company will post a written notice stating:
13 - 1 System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions
1.	The approximate number of flight
attendants to be furloughed or reduced;
2.	The name and seniority of each flight
attendant in the base who may be subject to furlough or displacement;
3.	Location of anticipated system permanent vacancies:
4.	Location of the most junior flight attendants on the system in the case of a furlough or Base Closure.
D.	The notice will be posted in the Briefing Books no later than thirty (30) days before the first day a flight attendant will be subject to furlough or displacement.
E.	Flight attendants who may be subject to a furlough, displacement, or base closure will be given written notice not later than twenty-five (25) days before the date they may be furloughed or displaced, stating:
1.	That a Base Reduction and/or System Furlough and/or Base Closure may occur, and that no later than twenty (20) days prior to the date s/he may be furloughed or displaced s/he must submit his/her preference for the following options. His/her preference should be indicated in order of preference. Preference will be awarded in order of seniority until the option is no longer available, subject to the limitations provided in Section 13.B:
System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions 13 - 2
a.	Fill a permanent vacancy on the system to which her/his seniority entitles her/him and for which s/he is qualified; or
b.	Displace the most junior flight attendant on the System; or
Note: If options “a” and/or “b” are available, but waived, the flight attendant will not be entitled to exercise these options again.
c.	Be placed on voluntary furlough in her/his base; or
Note: If this option is awarded, the flight attendant must state whether or not s/he wishes to temporarily return in a month(s) in which job shares and/or personal leaves are granted. A furloughed flight attendant electing active duty for such month(s) must return on the first day of the month(s), unless authorized not to return. S/he must return to furlough status during any month(s) when her/his services are not required, until recalled to a permanent vacancy. A furloughed flight attendant may not bump an active flight attendant from the payroll.
d.	In the event of a base closure, take a one (1) year Company offered leave
13 - 3 System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions
of absence. A flight attendant will be removed from the System Seniority List and considered resigned if a vacancy is available, and s/he fails to return from her/his leave of absence after one (1) year, unless the leave is extended in writing by the Company. Flight attendants accepting the one (1) year leaves, and those in the base where the one (1) year leave is offered who are on contiguous Company offered leaves, will retain and continue to accrue seniority and longevity.
2.	The location of anticipated system permanent vacancies.
F.	Moving/Relocation
1.	If a flight attendant is being required to change bases to a different geographic domicile as a result of a System Furlough, Base Reduction, or Base Closure s/he is entitled to payment of $500 relocation pay. In the event of a Base Closure, a flight attendant who chooses to displace the most junior flight attendant on the system rather than fill an existing vacancy, will waive the $500 relocation pay.
2.	Alternatively, upon presentation of receipts for such expenses, a flight attendant will be eligible for reimbursement of actual moving expenses if s/he is being required to change bases to a different geographic domicile as a
System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions 13 - 4
result of a System Furlough, Base Reduction, or Base Closure, and if s/he moves within one (1) year of the effective date of the transfer to a location within a radius of one hundred and fifty (150) miles of her/his newly awarded domicile. Moving expenses, including the packing, transport, and unpacking of household goods, mileage at $0.22 per mile for each vehicle driven (maximum of 2 vehicles), unrefunded security deposits, charges for the breaking of leases, short term storage of household goods, and hotel and meal expenses for the flight attendant and her/his immediate family while enroute will be paid to a total maximum of $10,000 (ten thousand dollars). In the event of a Base Closure, a flight attendant who chooses to displace the most junior flight attendant on the system rather than fill an existing vacancy, will waive the reimbursement of actual moving expenses.
3.	A flight attendant who is moving and who is eligible for reimbursement pursuant to paragraph F.2 above will be given one (1) day of travel for each four hundred (400) miles or fraction thereof (of at least one hundred (100) miles) from her/his current residence to her/his new domicile using the most direct AAA routing, to a maximum of seven (7) days. Additional time may be granted in accordance with the procedure described in Section 12.B.13. The flight attendant shall designate the moving days prior to the open window in the month of the move.
13 - 5 System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions
4.	The mileage and cost obligations under this section will be the actual mileage and cost incurred in the move, but in no case greater than the mileage and cost of moving from the current residence to the newly awarded domicile. These days must be taken as a block, and flights or duty days falling within the block will be paid to a maximum of four (4) days.
5.	A flight attendant who is required to change bases to a different geographic domicile will be entitled to fee waived, positive space (PS5B) passes from her/his residence to her/his new base for three (3) months from the effective date of her/his transfer, and to fee-waived space available passes for a further three (3) months. This paragraph will not apply to a flight attendant who is either furloughed or takes the one (1) year leave option.
G.	Furlough
1.	When a flight attendant is involuntarily furloughed, s/he will remain on furlough status from her/his base until a permanent vacancy occurs at her/his base or at another base to which her/his seniority entitles her/him. If such a vacancy occurs, the flight attendant will be recalled from furlough, unless s/he has been removed from the System Seniority List. If more than one (1) flight attendant is on furlough from a base and insufficient permanent vacancies
System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions 13 - 6
occur to accommodate all such flight attendants, such flight attendants may elect in seniority order who will remain displaced or on furlough and who will fill the vacancy(s) that occurs.
2	. When a flight attendant is awarded a voluntary furlough, s/he will remain on furlough status until s/he is recalled to the base from which s/he was furloughed, or until the Company receives notification of her/his election to fill any permanent vacancy on the system to which her/his seniority entitles her/him, and s/he is subsequently awarded such a vacancy. The flight attendant’s notification must be in writing and shall be sent by certified mail to Corporate Inflight Administration in Houston. A flight attendant who has submitted her/his notification of election to return to any permanent vacancy on the system must fill the next available permanent vacancy in accordance with seniority or s/he will be removed from the System Seniority List and will be administratively terminated, unless s/he has withdrawn her/his election to return no later than 1000 Central time, on the fifth day of the month in which the vacancy is to be awarded. At the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the voluntary furlough a flight attendant who has not submitted her/his notification of election to return to any permanent vacancy on the system will be removed from the System Seniority List and will be administratively terminated.
13 - 7 System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions
3.	Except as otherwise provided herein, a flight attendant who has not been recalled within five (5) years of the date of her/his furlough will be removed from the System Seniority List and will be administratively terminated.
H.	When a flight attendant is furloughed s/he shall be paid for vacation days accrued in the prior year and not taken in the current year. Such vacation shall be paid at the flight attendant’s current rate of pay at the time of payment. Unless s/he returns from furlough in the same calendar year in which s/he was furloughed, when a flight attendant returns from furlough s/he may elect either to be paid for the vacation days s/he accrued in the year in which s/he was furloughed, or to take an available vacation period in the calendar year in which s/he returns.
I.	1. Furloughed flight attendants and displaced flight attendants, including flight attendants displaced due to a Base Closure, will have priority recall rights to the base from which they have been furloughed or displaced for two (2) years, regardless of subsequent transfer(s). Unless such flight attendants notify the Company of their desire to waive recall to their prior base by the deadline set forth in Section 12.B.3, they will be required to return to their former base when recalled.
2.	Seniority will be honored in filling vacancies. Vacancies will be awarded to the senior qualified eligible bidders in the following order:

System Furloughs, Base Closures & Base Reductions 13 - 10
K.	A flight attendant will be removed from the System Seniority List and considered resigned if s/he fails to accept recall from system furlough within fourteen (14) days of notification of recall.

I.	The Company will not be responsible for resolving any disputes between jobshare flight attendants.
J.	Two (2) reserves jobsharing a line must treat each block of reserve days as a trip. Therefore, they may not split blocks of days unless one (1) block must be split to evenly divide the line.
21 - 2 Jobsharing
Section 22	- Partnership Flying
A.	For purposes of this Section, active flight attendants are those currently holding a place on the monthly bidding seniority list. For example, if a flight attendant is on furlough or in a management position, and is not on the bidding seniority list for the month of October, s/he is not eligible to be included in the October 15, award process. Once returned to work, and placed on the monthly bidding seniority list, her/his name shall be placed on the Partnership Flying waiting list, if s/he so chooses by submitting the appropriate request.
B.	Active flight attendants having at least two years seniority as flight attendants, including those who are already in the program and who desire to continue shall be eligible to bid for partnership vacancies. To be considered for an annual award, bids must be submitted no later than 10:00 a.m., central time, October 5. On or before September 15, the Company will post the anticipated number of annual permanent partnership vacancies. Following receipt of the October 5 bids, the Company, in its discretion, will determine the final number of annual permanent partnership vacancies that will be available in each base. The total number of partnership lines will not be more than five percent (5%) of the expected base complement on January 1 of the following year, unless the parties mutually agree to exceed this amount.
Partnership Flying 22- 1
C.	Annual awards shall be granted based on seniority among similarly qualified flight attendants competing for partnership positions within each base. An ISM who has applied for entry into the program and whose bid is not awarded due to a lack of application by other ISMs will be given an opportunity to elect to change her/his application to apply for the bid as a flight attendant or to place her/his name on the waiting list described in paragraph F below as an ISM.
D.	Partnership flying awards shall be announced annually on October 15 for the ensuing calendar year. A flight attendant who is awarded his/her partnership bid will be required to remain in the partnership position for the duration of the partnership award except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section. Removals from the program due to hardship may be granted upon mutual agreement between the Vice President of Inflight or her/his designee and the President - Directing General Chairman of the Union or her/his designee.
E.	Flight attendants who have been awarded partnership flying may elect to form voluntary partnerships with any other similarly qualified flight attendants who also have been awarded partnership flying in their base no later than November 15 by submitting a partners team request in such form as the Company may establish. Those flight attendants who have not submitted partners forms by 10:00 a.m., central time, November 15, will be paired by the Company in order of seniority (i.e., the most senior unpaired
22 - 2 Partnership Flying
flight attendant with the next most senior unpaired flight attendant). Final annual partnership teams will be posted no later than December 1. All partnership awards, whether voluntary or seniority controlled, will be limited to flight attendants in the same base and to qualified partners (i.e., language speakers with other language speakers holding positions in the same primary language and ISMs with ISMs).
F.	If the Company determines to fill vacancies which occur during the year as a result of the transfer, termination, furlough, or displacement of partnership flight attendants, it will do so by awarding the remainder of the year of partnership flying in seniority order to flight attendants whose names shall be maintained on base partnership flying waiting lists. The lists shall contain the names of eligible flight attendants who bid, but were not awarded partnership positions as well as those of eligible flight attendants whose written bids are received any time after the October 5 deadline, but prior to 10:00 a.m., central time, on the fifth day of the month. A flight attendant may remove his/her standing partnership bid at any time by withdrawing it in writing, but the deadline for such withdrawal in any given month shall be 10:00 a.m., central time, on the fifth. All bids, whether submitted during the year or pursuant to the annual rebid as provided in paragraph A above, will be removed from the active file prior to the annual posting of anticipated openings as provided in paragraph A above. All flight attendants who wish to be considered for inclusion in the following year’s program must submit bids every year, including incumbent participants and
Partnership Flying 22- 3
those who submitted bids during the course of the year.
G.	Partners who elect to transfer in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 will be removed from the partnership program once the transfer is awarded. When such a flight attendant reports for duty in her/his new base, s/he may place her/his name on the waiting list at her/his new base. In the event that the transfer is rescinded the flight attendant shall return to her/his previous base as a non-partner flight attendant. A flight attendant whose partner exits the program (e.g., as the result of a transfer, termination, furlough, displacement, etc.) will continue in the program, and will be paired with another unpaired partner, or if a vacancy is announced by the Company, with the next person on the waiting list. If there are no other unpaired partners and no flight attendants on the waiting list the remaining partner will drop fifty percent (50%) of her/his line each month until a new partner is awarded using these procedures.
H.	Monthly partnership line awards will be determined by the bid of the senior partner on the team. The two partners will split the line 50/50 to the extent possible. Two (2) reserve partners sharing a line must treat each block of reserve days as a trip, therefore they may not split blocks of days unless one block must be split to evenly divide the line.
I.	Within forty-eight (48) hours after the bid results are posted, the partners will notify Scheduling of the name of the partner responsible for covering each specific trip for the month.
22 - 4 Partnership Flying
J.	Pay will be based on the flight attendant’s credited flight time in her/his portion of the partnership bid line.
K.	A partnership flight attendant is limited to a monthly maximum of fifty-five hours (55:00) pay and credit.
L.	A partnership flight attendant may request a personal drop(s), subject to operational requirements, which reduces her/his monthly projection below forty hours (40:00). Additionally, a partnership flight attendant may trip trade with open time, subject to operational requirements, and such trade may reduce her/his monthly projection below forty hours (40:00). Similarly qualified partnership flight attendants will be permitted to trade with each other regardless of whether one flight attendant may go below forty hours (40:00). Language qualified flight attendants must maintain forty hours (40:00) in their primary language specialty before being permitted to pick up trips outside such primary language specialty.
M.	The Company will not be responsible for resolving disputes between partnership flight attendants regarding the monthly division of their line.
N.	Partnership flight attendants will accrue and retain seniority and longevity in the same manner as all other flight attendants.
O.	Partners shall receive all variable pay elements (including on-time bonuses), passes in accordance with Corporate policy, and group insurance coverage (including medical, dental,
Partnership Flying 22- 5
vision, expense reimbursement accounts, personal accident, long-term disability, Company paid life, and optional group universal life). Partners shall receive vacation accrual credit, sick leave accrual, and occupational injury accruals as provided in Section 5.C.5.
P.	Either party may request a meeting to discuss the administration of the program at any time during the life of this Agreement. In addition, it shall have a duration which is coterminus with the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Q.	It is understood that the Partnership Program is not intended to replace month-to-month jobshares, as provided for in Section 21. The Company will continue to determine the availability of monthly job-shares in the same manner and upon the same bases as it has in the past, without regard to the existence of, or level of participation in the Partnership Program.
22 - 6 Partnership Flying
Section 23	- Non Flying Duties
A.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 above, the Company may utilize either Inflight management personnel or scheduled flight attendants on a trip(s) as long as any resulting displaced flight attendants suffer no flight pay loss.
B.	If a flight attendant engaged in non-flying duties within the Company returns to flight attendant status, s/he will be permitted to return to the base to which s/he is assigned. If the flight attendant does not have sufficient seniority to hold her/his previously assigned base, s/he will be permitted to fill a permanent vacancy to which her/his system seniority entitles her/him or to displace the most junior flight attendant on the system, provided the flight attendant is junior to her/him. After the flight attendant accepts one (1) of these assignments, or is furloughed, her/his seniority rights will be governed by the provisions of this Agreement.
Non Flying Duties 23- 1
Section 24	- Benefits
A. Each Flight attendant covered by this Agreement shall be eligible to participate in certain Company wide benefit programs made available to other employees of the Company on the terms and conditions established in the benefit programs for flight attendants’ participation, and pursuant to the terms of such programs.

RE: California Resident Disability
Dear Bill:
This will confirm our conversations regarding California Resident Disability Plan participation.
When the Los Angeles flight attendant base closed and California State Disability coverage ceased, a number of flight attendants raised the question of whether we could reinstate California State Disability coverage for those who remained resident in California. After supplying full disclosure information to the California resident flight attendants, the IAM conducted extensive inquiries regarding the flight attendants’ desires in the matter. It is my understanding those disclosures and following a substantial period of time to object to the reinstatement of California State Disability, not only did no flight attendant object to the reinstatement, but in fact many flight attendants continued to affirmatively request California State Disability Plan reinstatement.
Given those facts, the IAM has requested and Continental has agreed to provide for the continuation of California Disability for all California resident flight attendants under the following conditions:
California Resident Disability LOA 5 - 1
A.	As soon as reasonably practical after the signing of the Agreement Continental will take such steps as may be necessary to reinstate California State Disability coverage for flight attendants residing in California, excepting only those who are already covered under the New Jersey or other state disability plan.
B.	It is expressly recognized and agreed that all flight attendants living in California, whether residing there at the time this Agreement is signed or subsequently becoming California residents, will be included, unless Section 702.6 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code expressly excludes them.
C.	It is also expressly understood and agreed that the premiums will be paid entirely by the affected flight attendants, and that the Company will collect the monthly premium amounts from affected flight attendants via payroll deduction.
D.	The parties acknowledge that the premium amount is presently approximately 0.9% of wages, that the premiums are set by the state of California, and that they may increase in the future.
E.	This Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect as if it were incorporated as a part of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement unless and until it is changed by subsequent mutual agreement.

Regarding
Conscientious Reporting Program
WHEREAS, the parties desire to provide a uniform method of resolving issues related to certain matters relating to reporting for duty;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
A.	This Agreement establishes standards for managing flight attendant attendance when certain unavoidable circumstances preclude flight attendants from reporting as scheduled. While all concerned are required to conduct themselves with reasonableness, prudence, and good judgment, the obligation and responsibility to report for work as scheduled remains that of each flight attendant.
B.	This Agreement governs circumstances in which flight attendants are unable to report for scheduled assignments due to any of the following:
1.	Unforecasted severe weather conditions or other natural disasters (i.e., blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other similar events), or
LOA 6 - 1 Conscientious Reporting Program

Flight Attendants who commute by automobile, bus, train, or public surface transportation will be afforded the same privileges contained in this Policy for unforeseen events related to severe unforecasted weather conditions or natural disasters which render roads hazardous or impassable, or enroute mechanical problems, provided that they call their Inflight Duty Office as soon as the unforeseen event becomes known and it appears s/he will not make it to the airport to arrive at her/his domicile in time for her/his scheduled report (e.g., road accident, mechanical breakdown, severe weather). Flight attendants are expected to exercise prudent judgment and planning regarding checking load factors, flight availability, forecast weather, traffic reports, and otherwise generally “planning ahead” to avoid commuting problems. For example, it is not sufficient to utilize a flight(s) whose
Conscientious Reporting Program LOA 6 - 2
arrival/departure time is likely to be adversely impacted by forecasted weather events.
b.	A flight attendant commuting by air, must exercise good judgment and exert every reasonable effort to report for work, including having the legitimate reasonable potential to commute on either of at least two (2) flights listed through the Company’s employee reservations systems (so long as such seats are controlled by the Company (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours prior to the first flight’s departure time both flights must be under authorization as displayed on the Company’s employee reservations systems, including accounting for non-revenue space available travelers that are listed and have either a higher boarding priority or greater seniority than the flight attendant) that are scheduled to arrive at her/his domicile or the point of her/his duty assignment at least one hour (1:00) prior to her/his report time for such assignment.
c.	A jumpseat(s) is not considered an available seat for commuting purposes.
C.	This Agreement applies to flight attendants whose mode(s) of transportation to report for work are rendered unavailable by any of the conditions in
LOA 6 - 3 Conscientious Reporting Program
paragraph B only if there are no other reasonable alternative means of timely reporting for their scheduled assignments. A flight attendant may utilize two or more airports in proximity to each other for purposes of satisfying the two flights requirement of this Policy (e.g., one flight from Tampa, on flight from Orlando, or one flight from Sarasota) as long as the scheduled departure times between the two flights reasonably allow the flight attendant to travel by surface transportation (i.e., automobile, bus, train or taxi) from one airport to the other and physically check in at the gate in time for the scheduled departure of each flight. The commuting flight attendant must be at the gate and have checked in for the flights(s) to be utilized for purposes of this policy.
D.	This Agreement does not apply to any other circumstance or condition related to a flight attendant’s failure to report for her/his scheduled assignment, or to timely report for her/his scheduled assignment, including personal emergencies.
E.	When an unforeseen event takes place (e.g., no available seat, weight restriction, delay or cancellation due to unforeseen significant weather at the intended airport of departure or arrival, ATC or aircraft maintenance), affecting the flight attendant’s first commuting flight, s/he must immediately contact Crew Scheduling. A flight attendant commuting by air will notify Crew Scheduling that s/he will be utilizing the back-up flight immediately upon discovering that s/he is unable to commute using the primary flight, regardless of the reason for such inability. S/he
Conscientious Reporting Program LOA 6 - 4
shall also recontact Crew Scheduling immediately upon discovering that s/he will be unable to commute on her/his back-up flight. In the case where a flight attendant is physically onboard her/his first or back-up flight and the flight diverts enroute, the flight attendant shall call Crew Scheduling as soon as s/he can make a telephone call. Upon notification to Crew Scheduling, the flight attendant shall continue on to her/his Base if possible, unless released by Crew Scheduling/ Coordination. He/she will be subject to assignment as follows:
1.	S/he may be directed to report to her/his original trip pairing or to a portion of the original trip pairing, joining it at a later point; or
2.	S/he may be assigned a substitute pairing scheduled to fly on the same days as the original pairing; or
3.	S/he may be assigned a substitute pairing which begins on any day following the start of the original pairing, so long as the substitute pairing terminates on the same day as the original pairing; or
4.	S/he may be given any other substitute assignment which is mutually agreeable to the flight attendant and Crew Scheduling; and
5.	If requested by the flight attendant, the Company will provide a hotel room for a lineholder flight attendant who commutes
LOA 6 - 5 Conscientious Reporting Program
by air and who is in compliance with this Policy if the lineholder receives no immediate assignment or receives an assignment with a report time more than five (5) hours after the flight attendant arrives at her/his base. The Company shall not be obligated to provide more than the number of nights in a hotel than would otherwise have been provided on the flight attendant’s original pairing.
F.	A flight attendant given an assignment pursuant to Paragraph E will be compensated as if the original assignment had never occurred, and the substitute assignment had in fact been her/his original assignment. If no substitute assignment is given, the original assignment shall be treated as a personal drop, and the flight attendant shall receive no pay or credit relating to it.
G.	1. This Policy shall be applicable to all flight attendants, whether lineholders or reserves.
2.	Upon request, flight attendants shall be responsible for providing documentation required by the Company to establish their compliance with the terms of this Policy.
3.	Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to limit or abridge the Company’s existing rights to make assignments/reassignments as necessary, and consistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement to protect the operational integrity of the schedule.
Conscientious Reporting Program LOA 6 - 6
H.	A flight attendant who is unable to meet her/his scheduled report time as a direct result of any of the circumstances listed in paragraph B, and who has complied fully with all of the terms of this Agreement be considered to have an authorized absence without pay, and shall not be subject to discipline as result of her/his inability to report, unless such inability occurs repeatedly. The parties have intentionally not specified a precise number of instances that will be afforded the protections of this Policy. Each invocation of this Policy will be considered an independent event and judged on its own unique circumstances, however repeated invocations of this Policy may be considered in evaluations of a flight attendant’s overall attendance/reliability.

RE: Domestic Partner Health and Welfare Benefits
Dear Bill:
This is to confirm the understanding recently reached in collective bargaining negotiations regarding the provision of benefits, including health and welfare (health, dental and vision care insurance), dependent life insurance, and COBRA continuation benefits for flight attendants’ domestic partners, as that term is defined in the collective bargaining agreement.
We have agreed that, to the extent Continental is able to make them available, the Company will make the abovereferenced benefits available to Domestic Partners. It is understood, for example that some states’ insurance regulations do not allow Health Maintenance Organization health insurance coverage for domestic partners.
Flight attendants shall be entitled to designate a domestic partner in lieu of a spouse for these benefits upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreement, and each year during the Company’s annual benefits enrollment period.
LOA 12 - 1 Domestic Partner Health & Welfare Benefits
To the extent reasonably possible, benefits will be provided on a basis consistent with similar benefits for employees' spouses, except that flight attendants obtaining domestic partner benefits shall be responsible for any cost(s) incurred which are not incurred or borne by the Company for the same benefit(s) when provided to employees’ spouses. By way of example only, such costs may include federal and state tax liabilities. The Company is expressly authorized to deduct all such additional costs from flight attendants’ paychecks.
Please confirm your understanding that the foregoing accurately reflects our agreement by signing one copy of this letter and returning it to me. Thank you.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
between
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, INC.
and
THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS
AND AEROSPACE WORKERS
Regarding
Family And Medical Leave (“FMLA”)
Continental Airlines, Inc. (“CAL” or “the Company”) and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM” or “the Union”) have reached this memorandum of understanding in order to comply with the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (“FMLA”). This memorandum of understanding provides some benefits which are greater than those set forth in the CAL/IAM agreement. FMLA leave may be used up to twelve (12) months after the birth or adoption of a child, when a family member suffers a serious health condition requiring continuing care and a medical health care provider certifies that the flight attendant is needed for such care, and when the flight attendant her/himself is seriously ill or injured. Family member is defined as spouse (as recognized by state law where the flight attendant lives), a parent (a biological parent or person who raised the flight attendant when he/she was a child), son or daughter (a biological, adopted, foster or step child, legal ward or minor child who is being raised by the flight attendant). The child(ren) must be under 18 years of age or incapable of self-care (due to mental or physical disability). Each non-probationary flight attendant who has been available for duty for 60% of the time during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the FMLA leave is entitled to the
LOA 15 - 1 FMLA
equivalent of ninety (90) calendar days (approximately sixty (60) work days) of unpaid FMLA leave in any twelve (12) month period. All FMLA leave is unpaid.
1.	Flight attendants are required to give thirty (30) days advance notice if the leave is foreseeable, such as with the birth or placement of a child or planned medical treatment. If thirty (30) days is not practicable, as much advance notice as possible should be given.
2.	The Company may require medical certification for FMLA leave and will be using the prescribed Department of Labor model form. Flight attendants may be required on a periodic basis, to provide evidence of continuing eligibility for FMLA leave.
3.	When FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, additional leave may be granted in accordance with the CAL/IAM agreement. Flight attendants suffering from serious health conditions or who are pregnant will have the option of using paid sick leave prior to utilizing unpaid FMLA leave. All flight attendants may choose to exhaust unused vacation time before using FMLA leave.
4.	Flight attendants who are using FMLA leave to recover from a serious health condition or to care for a family member who has such a condition may take the leave on an intermittent basis if the treating medical care provider deems it necessary. For the purpose of tracking intermittent FMLA leave usage, flight attendants shall be entitled to two hundred, fifty hours (250:00) (three (3) months at eighty-three and one third hours (83:20) per month) of FMLA leave in any twelve (12) month
FMLA LOA 15 - 2
period. Flight attendants will be charged the actual time missed or four hours and nine minutes (4:09) (eighty-three and one third hours (83:20) per month divided by twenty (20) work days per month) for each day or portion of a day missed for FMLA leave purposes, whichever is less.
5.	Seniority for all purposes will continue to accrue during the ninety (90) days of family medical leave. Thereafter, continuing absences will accrue bid seniority only. Application of family medical leave will not be considered for attendance related purposes.
6.	The Company will maintain group health benefits during the family medical leave period on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the flight attendant had been employed continuously during the leave period.
7.	Flight attendants on FMLA leave who wish to travel must request a letter of authorization. This letter must be signed and approved by the employee’s supervisor and the Employee Relations Manager. The original letter of authorization must be carried with the eligible traveler when traveling. Pass travel on maternity/paternity leaves is available with authorization. Pass travel during a serious health condition leave is available only for travel to/from the location of the family member requiring care.
8.	Nothing in this agreement shall preclude a flight attendant from taking family medical leave (a) before the birth of a child for prenatal care if her condition makes her unable to work or (b) before the actual placement or adoption of a child if an
LOA 15 - 3 FMLA
absence from work is required for the placement, adoption or foster care to proceed.
9.	The Company and the Union agree to meet and confer after the Department of Labor promulgates the final regulations implementing FMLA to ensure that this memorandum of understanding complies with those regulations.

Regarding
Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement
WHEREAS, Continental desires to promote the acquisition and utilization of foreign language expertise among its flight attendants, and
WHEREAS, the parties recognize that the cost of acquiring language skills can be significant, and
WHEREAS, Continental is, under certain circumstances willing to assist in deferring some or all of the costs of such training, and
WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to establish specific parameters for the reimbursement of language training expense,
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1.	The Company will designate from time to time those languages for which it has a business need, and for which it is willing to provide educational expense reimbursement.
LOA 17 - 1 Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement
2.	The Company may require as a condition of reimbursement that flight attendants wishing to obtain reimbursement submit such advance information regarding instructional programs as it may deem necessary or desirable.
3.	No later than thirty (30) days following the submission of all information required pursuant to paragraph 2 above, the Company will indicate whether the instructional program is approved for this reimbursement program.
4.	Seniority shall govern the selection(s) in the event that there are more applicants than the Company can accommodate for either the jobshare/leave features of this program or in competition for positions in foreign language bases.
5.	Flight attendants engaging in foreign language instructional programs pursuant to this agreement shall be entitled to priority consideration for leaves and jobshares should they so request for a maximum period of one (1) year from the initial date of enrollment in the language program.
6.	The Company shall select objective standards/means (comparable to Berlitz standards) for determining language proficiency/ qualification. Upon request by the Union, the Company will promptly meet and confer regarding the standards which are being applied and/or the means by which those standards are applied.
Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement LOA 17 - 2
a.	The testing authority will utilize a ranking system made up of three (3) categories:
1.	Pass
2.	Pass with	Condition
3.	Fail
b.	A flight attendant may enter the “Pass with Condition” program if the testing authority so recommends.
c.	A “Pass with Condition” flight attendant must be generally conversant in the language, even if s/he does not possess sufficient skill or knowledge of the language to qualify as a Continental Foreign Language Speaker. It is the intent of this Program that such individuals have the opportunity to develop the necessary language skill by utilizing the language while working the speaker position on a three (3) month trial basis.
d.	Flight attendants falling into the “Pass with Condition” category will be subject to the following rules:
1.	Flight attendants may only qualify for the “Pass with Condition” Program one (1) time per language.
2.	“Pass with Condition” participants will be transferred into language speaker vacancies only if vacancies remain in the base after “pass” candidates are transferred.
LOA 17 - 3 Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement
3.	“Pass with Condition” flight attendants will have three (3) months to develop their skill level. At the end of three (3) months, they will be retested. If they do not achieve a “pass” ranking at that time, they will be returned to their prior base. Such flight attendants may subsequently seek transfers to language speaker positions, but must first qualify by achieving a “pass” ranking. No flight attendant may receive a second “Pass with Condition” ranking in the same language.
4.	During the three (3) month trial period, the flight attendant may receive flight evaluations to review language proficiency.
5.	“Pass	with Condition” flight
attendants will receive the language override on the terms provided in the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
6.	“Pass with Condition” lineholders will be included in the senior attendant premium numbers.
7.	Upon demonstration of language proficiency and the submission of receipts (or outstanding charges) from a program approved pursuant to paragraph 3 above, the Company
Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement LOA 17 - 4
will reimburse expenses incurred (limited by the expense reimbursement parameters contained in corporate policy) for the program, and all tuition or other similar charges to a maximum of $4,000.00. “Pass with Condition” flight attendants will not be entitled to the $4,000.00 reimbursement unless and until they have achieved the test result of “pass.”
8.	A flight attendant who has obtained tuition reimbursement pursuant to this program may be assigned by the Company to a foreign language base, and if so assigned, will remain in the base for a period of at least eighteen (18) months from the date of the assignment. A “Pass with Condition” flight attendant who subsequently obtains tuition reimbursement and is assigned to a Foreign Language Base will remain in the base for a period of at least eighteen (18) months from the date of the conversion of her/his “Pass with Condition” ranking to a “pass” ranking.
9.	Flight attendants holding a foreign language qualification may be required to revalidate their language proficiency on an annual basis. The Union shall be entitled to observe the administration of the qualification
LOA 17 - 5 Foreign Language Tuition Reimbursement
and/or revalidation processes established by the Company.

This will confirm our conversations regarding health and welfare benefits and contributions for Flight Attendants.
For the duration of the Agreement and thereafter, the aggregate amount of projected participant premiums for Flight Attendants each year will not exceed 20% of the projected total cost of coverage (aggregate projected Company contributions plus aggregate projected participant premiums).
In addition, for the duration of this Agreement and thereafter, the Company will not increase the amount of office visit copays, specialty care visit co-pays, employee co-insurance, hospital visit co-pays, emergency visit co-pays, urgent care copays, deductible amounts, out-of-pocket limits, and will not change the existing lifetime maximum (unlimited), for all plans or their equivalent in effect calendar year 2005, provided, however that changes may be made for optional “build your own” medical options.

Dear Bill:
This will confirm our discussions during the recently concluded collective bargaining agreement negotiations. We agreed that all current International Service Managers who had attained their third year ISM rate as of June 23, 1992 will continue to receive no less than the third year ISM pay rate override that was in effect prior to that date (30% above base rate up to $6.30 per hour).
Please confirm your understanding that the foregoing accurately reflects our agreement by signing one copy of this letter and returning it to me. Thank you.

Re: Jetway Trades
Dear Bill:
This letter will confirm the discussions we had concerning Jetway Trades.
A flight attendant who wishes to drop the last leg of a pairing in order to remain downline at the end of a trip may initiate a “Jetway Trade.” Jetway Trades require the approval of Crew Scheduling. A flight attendant may trade a portion of a trip pairing in accordance with the following:
1.	Jetway Trades must be requested by calling Crew Scheduling, and may not be done utilizing the CCS or VRS systems.
LOA 20 - 1 Jetway Trades
2.	Crew Scheduling will approve the Jetway Trade if all of the following conditions are met:
•	The replacement flight attendant must be on a day off, and must satisfy all contractual and FAR requirements (e.g., duty limits, rest requirements, check-in, etc.), The trade may not result in any flight attendant illegality. A trade that results in an unforeseen illegality will not cause any pay protection; make-up of the lost time is the flight attendant’s obligation.
•	Both flight attendants are lineholders,
•	The segment traded is domestic, Alaska or Hawaii,
•	The segment traded is the last segment of the pairing,
•	The segment traded is not a deadhead segment,
•	The trade is requested no earlier than one (1) calendar day and no later than four (4) hours prior to the scheduled departure of the traded segment,
•	SWAP is not in effect and no other emergency situation exists.
•	Special qualifications must be maintained.
3.	If Crew Scheduling approves the trade, the resulting change in flying will be considered part of the Flight Attendant’s scheduled duty day.
4.	The replacement Flight Attendant must confirm the assignment with Crew Scheduling at least two (2) hours prior to scheduled departure.
Jetway Trades LOA 20 - 2
5.	The original Flight Attendant must remain with the aircraft until the replacement Flight Attendant is present. (I.e., There must be a physical handoff at the airplane.) The replacement flight attendant must be at the airplane no later than one (1) hour prior to scheduled departure. If, for any reason the replacement Flight Attendant does not report for duty, the original Flight Attendant must operate the segment.
6.	When the trade is approved neither flight attendant may personal drop (PD), Trade, or drop the trip.
7.	Approval of a Jetway Trade will not, of and by itself, entitle either Flight Attendant to be provided a hotel room.

We have agreed to clarify that management employees below the officer level currently on the flight attendant system seniority list should remain on the list.

Re: Military Charter Flying
Dear Bill:
This will confirm our discussions regarding the settlement of Grievance No. 08511, which raises issues arising as a result of military charter flying and CRAF flights, in anticipation of or during war. We have agreed that military charter flying and CRAF flights will be conducted pursuant to the following rules:
A. When necessary the Company may build “Military Charter Pairings” (pairings that contain only scheduled military charter and/or CRAF duty days, or if known, military charter and/or CRAF duty days and flight legs operated to stage personnel for such duty). Upon reasonable notice the Company may provide a special designation for such pairings, and may apply the following scheduling and staffing rules to them.
1.	Flight attendants may place their name on a preferential list of volunteers to indicate their willingness to fly Military Charter Pairings. Assignments not placed in
LOA 23 - 1 Military Charter Flying
monthly bid schedules or picked up from open time will be made available to those on the list who are legal and available to fly on the day(s) of the Military Charter Pairing. Legal and available flight attendants will be selected in seniority order from the list, beginning with the person next on the list following the last person selected for the immediately preceding pairing. This process will continue until the list has been exhausted, at which point it will start over again, beginning with the most senior person on the entire list who is legal and available to fly the pairing.
2.	Military Charter Pairings will be treated like any other pairings in open time and may be picked up by lineholders in the base, assigned to flight attendants from the volunteer list, or to reserve flight attendants.
3.	Trading of Military Charter Pairings may be restricted to trades with other Military Charter Pairings.
4.	Flight attendants on Military Charter Pairings who are “staged” (pairings which contain military duty days rather than known military flights and which require that flight attendants be positioned downline) will not be considered to be on reserve; however they will be required to check with Crew Scheduling at 1000 and 1700 LT for flight assignments on calendar days for which they do not have a previously scheduled flight/deadhead assignment.
Military Charter Flying LOA 23 - 2
5.	Flight assignments to flight attendants who are staged downline for Military Charter Pairings will be made on a first-in, first-out basis.
6.	Any day of a staged Military Charter Pairing where no assignment occurs for a reserve flight attendant may be designated as a twenty-four (24) hour break, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(A)(7) of the collective bargaining agreement regarding reserve breaks at home domicile. This designation may not be made retroactively.
7.	A flight attendant on a staged Military Charter Pairing will receive credit (line value) for the greater of:
a.	four hours (4:00) times the number of calendar days in the pairing, or
b.	flight time, including all deadhead, flown during the block of days in the pairing, or
c.	the value of the trip rig as provided in Section 4, Paragraph N (for any pairing which, as of the time of assignment, has a period of twenty-nine hours (29:00) or greater without a scheduled trip assignment).
8.	If operations covered by this agreement should cease and Military Charter Pairings have been picked up by a lineholder, those
LOA 23 - 3 Military Charter Flying
pairings shall be subject to reassignment in accordance with Section 5, Paragraph K.
B.	A flight attendant on a Military Charter Pairing may be reassigned as needed, and may be required to remain downline beyond the scheduled pairing termination. Every effort will be made in such cases to return the flight attendant to her/his base as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances, and if the flight attendant is not returned to her/his base on the same calendar day as provided in the scheduled pairing, the restoration of days off provisions of the collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) shall apply.
C.	Military Charter Pairings may be constructed with the large “block” pairings containing a maximum of ten (10) consecutive days. Flight attendants awarded/assigned these compressed lines will only be used for operations covered under the provisions of this agreement. Flight attendants on compressed reserve lines may trade days off only with Scheduling approval. A flight attendant whose staged Military Charter Pairing equals or exceeds eight (8) calendar days downline may elect to take a personal drop of her/his next duty assignment if that assignment is scheduled to begin less than forty-eight hours (48:00) after her/his release from the staged Military Charter Pairing.
D.	A flight attendant who completes a staged Military Charter Pairing assignment whose next scheduled assignment is also a staged Military Charter Pairing in the same staging location may, with notice, elect to take her/his intervening days off at the downline staging location. The Company will
Military Charter Flying LOA 23 - 4
establish appropriate procedures to facilitate such elections.
E.	The Company will, to the extent possible, not exceed the duty limitations found in Section 5(B)(7)(b) of the CBA; however, for these operations flight attendants may be scheduled for duty periods to a maximum of twenty hours (20:00). Additional compensation for flights in excess of the Section 5(B)(7)(b) limitations, shall be as provided below. The actual duty period limit shall be as provided in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs).
F.	We have further agreed that scheduled international Military charters which exceed the limitations provisions of Section 5(B)(7)(b) of the CBA, will receive additional pay at the flight attendant’s regular rate of pay for each hour or portion of an hour actually on duty in excess of sixteen hours (16:00) in accordance with the following schedule:
Time Actually On Duty Payment Amount
16:01 - 17:00
17:01 - 18:00
18:01 - 19:00
19:01 - 20:00
20:01 or greater
1	(one) hour
2	(two) hours
3	(three) hours
4	(four) hours
5	(five) hours
Scheduling will apply the override described above based on scheduled duty time, and pay for such time will be reflected in the pay register as “Add Pay.” Flight attendants whose actual duty time exceeds such scheduled duty time will be required
LOA 23 - 5 Military Charter Flying
to submit pay claims for the difference, if any, in entitlement pursuant to this paragraph, up to the maximum of five (5) hours add pay.
G.	Suitable single-room accommodations shall be provided at regular layover points. The Company shall make every effort to provide suitable singleroom accommodations, including appropriate amenities (i.e., phone, computer access and suitable eating facilities) when layovers occur at points other than regular Continental layover locations. If suitable single-room accommodations can not be provided, flight attendants shall receive payment in accordance with Section 7(I)(1) of the CBA.
H.	In addition to all other life or accident insurance provided by the Company, Business Travel Accident Insurance shall be provided for flight attendants engaged in Military Charter Flying, in the principal sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for death, dismemberment, or total and permanent disability other than by natural causes as a result of participation in the operations covered in this agreement.
I.	Flight attendants on Military Charter Pairings shall be provided full intelligence/safe passage briefings prior to operation of the pairings.
J.	Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of the CBA shall apply to Military Charter Pairings, including Section 3(D)(2), Section (4)(O), Section 5(B)(9), and Section 5(G)(3).
K.	The Company agrees to arbitrate any grievance filed by the Union alleging a violation of this
Military Charter Flying LOA 23 - 6
Agreement on an expedited basis directly before the System Board of Adjustment sitting with a neutral arbitrator mutually acceptable to both parties. If a mutually agreed upon arbitrator cannot be selected within three (3) days of the filing, an arbitrator will be selected pursuant to Section 20 of the CBA. The dispute shall be heard no later than thirty (30) days following the submission to the system board (subject to the availability of the arbitrator), and shall be decided no later than thirty (30) days following submission, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.
L.	This agreement shall remain in full force and effect for sixty (60) days from the date of signing, and shall thereafter renew itself for succeeding sixty (60) day periods unless written notice of termination or intended change is served by either party on the other. In the event that notice of change is served, the parties shall promptly meet and discuss such intended changes at a mutually agreed time and location.
Please confirm your understanding that the foregoing accurately reflects our agreement by signing one copy of this letter and returning it to me. Thank you.

Continental Airlines, Inc. (Continental or Company) and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM or Union) desire to protect the future retirement security of Continental flight attendants, and
The parties believe that a pension decision should only be made after a full and fair opportunity to review all pertinent information and data.
It is therefore agreed and understood:
1.	Continental flight attendants will have the right to choose (by majority vote) whether to join the IAM National Pension Plan or to remain participants in the Continental Retirement Plan (“CARP”).
2.	The Company, the Union agree that the parties shall be bound by the decision of the IAM-represented flight attendants, which shall be made through an IAM ratification process.
3.	The pension vote shall take place at a time to be determined by the Union.
Pension LOA 27 - 1
4.	Information regarding both pension plans shall be available to the flight attendants in advance of the voting.
5.	If the flight attendants elect to remain participants in the CARP, the plan shall be retained for flight attendants, without any material change, including the lump sum distribution provisions, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
6.	If the flight attendants elect to join the National Plan:
a.	As soon as practical after the date of the pension vote, Flight Attendants shall become participants in the IAM Plan; and
b.	Benefits under the CARP shall be frozen upon the effective date of admission into the IAM Plan, and the flight attendants will retain their existing CARP benefits as of that date, but shall not accrue any additional CARP benefits after that date.
c.	Flight Attendants will retain the right to obtain a lump sum distribution from the CARP in accordance with its plan provisions, and
d.	Thereafter for the remaining term of the collective bargaining agreement, Continental Airlines shall make contributions to the IAM Plan on behalf of each eligible Flight Attendant equal to at least one dollar and sixty cents ($1.60) times the number of hours paid, multiplied by one point eight nine one (1.891), to the maximum specified by the IAM Plan.

Dear Bill:
This will confirm our conversations regarding the Company’s continuing efforts to ensure that flight attendants enjoy a safe work environment.
As you know, the Company believes that everyone, including our employees and passengers has the right to be free from the threat of physical violence against them.
Be assured that Continental intends to continue its policy of not tolerating physical assaults against its employees, including its flight attendants. An on-duty flight attendant who is the victim of a physical assault will have the full cooperation of the Company in pursuing criminal charges brought by appropriate authorities. When it is necessary for flight attendants to meet with law enforcement authorities or to appear as witnesses in connection with such an occurrence, they will be given time off with pay to do so, and other appropriate assistance (e.g., EAP assistance) as may be required.

The Company has examined the economics and operational feasibility of establishing satellite bases, and determined that cost factors, such as layover hotel and per diem expense, and the impact on flight attendants in the parent base of moving flight time from their base to the satellite, make establishing such bases inadvisable at this time.
As you know, the Company has agreed to re-examine the satellite base question for pilots once their new preferential bidding system is established. At that time the Company will also examine whether there have been material changes which make one or more airport locations viable options for flight attendant satellite bases. Should the Company conclude that such a location exists, then the Company will meet and agree with the Union regarding the terms and conditions upon which such satellite base or bases could be established.

Re: Sick and Welfare Committee
Dear Bill:
This will confirm the our discussions during the recent collective bargaining negotiations regarding occupational injury transitional return to work duty and light duty programs.
Nothing in this letter should be understood to require that the Company establish, maintain, or retain a particular level, of either transitional or light duty, however should the Company elect to do so, it is our intention that these policies be implemented in an equitable, uniform and reasonable manner.
Should the Company elect to continue to utilize or to implement a transitional duty program, it will only do so in consultation with a flight attendant Sick & Welfare Committee comprised of flight attendants appointed by the Union and management representatives, to be established in each flight attendant base. These Committees shall be responsible for identifying and recommending appropriate work opportunities for flight attendants who have been released by their physician to work in some capacity, but who remain medically restricted from performing in-flight flight attendant duties. Such work opportunities may only encompass such
LOA 34 - 1 Sick and Welfare Committee
duties as are within the returning flight attendant’s medical restrictions. The duration of transitional opportunities shall be determined by the Company, but may not exceed the period of partial disability.
Should the Company elect to continue its Transitional duty program, the program shall have the following features:
1.	Transitional duty assignments will be available only for flight attendants who sustain occupational injuries and are temporarily unable to perform their regular inflight duties.
2.	A flight attendant may be assigned to perform transitional duty only if the treating and/or consulting physician has released the flight attendant for Limited Duty, and work is available within the identified restrictions. A flight attendant whose restrictions are not removed after one hundred twenty (120) days of a transitional duty assignment will be returned to either Sick Pay, Occupational Injury Pay or unpaid leave status.
3.	For the purpose of determining the maximum number of days a flight attendant shall be assigned transitional duty, the following shall apply:
a.	A flight attendant whose most recent full month bid award contained seventeen (17) or more days off will be assigned transitional duty for no more than three (3) days per week.
Sick and Welfare Committee LOA 34 - 2
b.	A flight attendant whose most recent full month bid award contained sixteen (16) or fewer days off will be assigned transitional duty for no more than four (4) days per week.
c.	A flight attendant who held weekends off on her/his most recent full month bid award will not be required to work weekends while on transitional duty.
4.	The parties will exert every reasonable effort to avoid conflicts between transitional duty and medical appointments or therapy sessions required for the flight attendants recovery from her/his injury. That is, flight attendants will try to schedule such appointments on days/times free from transitional duty, and where reasonably possible, the Company will schedule transitional duty around the flight attendant’s medical appointments. When unavoidable conflicts do occur, the flight attendant shall be entitled to attend the medical appointment, and her/his transitional duty pay shall be prorated for the absence.
5.	A flight attendant performing Transitional Duty for a full bid month will be paid eighty-five (85) times her/his regular base hourly rate per month. This amount will be prorated for any absences or partial months.
6.	Flight attendants on transitional duty shall be considered to be full time active employees for all purposes, including but not limited to having entitlement to all regular travel pass and reduced-
LOA 34 - 3 Sick and Welfare Committee
rate travel benefits for themselves, their buddies, and their eligible dependents.

RE: Commuter LOA
Dear Bill:
The recent announcement regarding the withdrawal of 69 aircraft from ExpressJet has raised a question regarding the application of the Conscientious Reporting Program letter in the new CBA. This purpose of this letter is to reaffirm the Company’s commitment to that program, and to confirm our conversation regarding the treatment of commuting issues in the event that Continental replaces ExpressJet with a similar capacity purchase agreement with any other commuter carrier.
Simply stated, the Company will apply the terms of the Conscientious Reporting Program letter to any commuter carrier or carriers that operate any of the 69 aircraft or any additional aircraft withdrawn from ExpressJet Specifically, the language which provides that a flight attendant commuting by air must have “the legitimate reasonable potential to commute on either of at least two (2) Continental/ExpressJet flights” will be read to include any commuter airline who replaces ExpressJet as the capacity purchase supplier of commuter feed traffic for Continental.
Very truly yours,
/s/

Re: Work Life Committees
Dear Bill:
This will confirm our discussions during the recently concluded collective bargaining agreement negotiations, in which the Company agreed to provide the Union with notice of the formation and the initial meeting of Flight Attendant employee committees which have been created to deal with questions or issues directly relating to the work life of a Flight Attendant, not including collective bargaining matters. (An example of such an employee committee is the Occupational Injury Recovery Committee.) The Union shall have the right to attend and participate in these committee meetings.
Please confirm your understanding that the foregoing accurately reflects our agreement by signing one copy of this letter and returning it to me. Thank you.
Very truly yours,	Agreed:

Re: Reciprocal Cabin Seat Privileges
Dear Tom:
This letter will confirm our recent discussions in which the Company agreed to implement off-line reciprocal cabin seat privileges with other airlines as soon as possible following ratification of the collective bargaining agreement. We expect that such agreements will commence no later than sixty (60) days following that ratification.

Reciprocal Cabin Seat Privileges LOA 38 -1
INTERIM AGREEMENT
Between
Continental Airlines, Inc.
and the Flight Attendants represented by the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers
This Interim Agreement is made, and entered into, in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (the “Act”) by and between Continental Airlines, Inc. (“Continental”) and the Flight Attendants in the service of Continental, as represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM” or the “Union”). All parties are collectively referred to herein as the “Parties.”
This Interim Agreement is entered into in light of the merger of Continental Airlines, Inc. with United Air Lines, Inc to form the “New United Airlines.”. The Interim Agreement shall govern the allocation of Flight Attendant work until either a combined agreement is negotiated for all Flight Attendants on the merged New United Airlines or until the Parties agree to change or terminate this Interim Agreement. Pre-merger Continental Flight Attendants and pre-merger United Flight Attendants will perform work in accordance with their respective collective bargaining agreements, and will not be interchanged between the operations of premerger Continental and pre-merger United.
All aircraft in the service of, or stored by, pre-merger Continental or pre-merger United (the “Airlines”), and all orders, options and anticipated returns as set forth in the Airlines’ respective fleet plans as of May 2, 2010, shall be
LOA 39 - 1 Interim Agreement
designated as “United Aircraft” or “Continental Aircraft.” Except for Flight Attendants hired from one Airline by the other, and except as may be needed to comply with conditions prescribed by the FAA for the purpose of transition to, and eventual operation under, a Single Operating Certificate no Flight Attendant of either Airline will fly as a crewmember on an aircraft in the fleet of the other Airline.
In the event that aircraft are acquired to replace aircraft that were in the service of, stored by, or on order or option, as of May 2, 2010, each acquired aircraft shall be designated as a United Aircraft or a Continental Aircraft, based upon the aircraft being replaced. For purposes of this section, the term “replacement” means that the newly acquired aircraft can be matched, on a one-to-one basis, to an aircraft that has left or will leave the service of the applicable Airline within six (6) months before or after the new aircraft enters service.
If aircraft are acquired that are not replacement aircraft, pre-merger United Flight Attendants will operate any newly-acquired B747, A321, A320, A319 or A318 aircraft, and pre-merger Continental Flight Attendants will operate any newly-acquired B737 aircraft. As to all other aircraft entering the service, the Parties will promptly meet and confer regarding which pre-merger Flight Attendant group shall operate such aircraft. If the Parties are unable to so agree, the aircraft shall be operated by the Flight Attendant group whose operation will result most closely in maintaining the ratio of Flight Attendant positions that existed between pre-merger United and pre-merger Continental Flight Attendants on May 2, 2010.
Nothing in this Interim Agreement will serve to prevent fleet reductions attributable to economic reasons not
Interim Agreement LOA 39 - 2
related to the merger, or the retirement of existing aircraft in the normal course of business or as a result of casualty loss, consistent with the Airlines’ obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements.
In witness thereof, the Parties hereto have executed this Interim Agreement effective this 3rd day of April, 2011.
