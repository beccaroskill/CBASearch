Additionally, we will agree to include in these discussions the development of a process whereby Labor Relations will have oversight of new RN positions to determine bargaining-unit status prior to the commencement of recruiting activities.

1.	Coverage and Term: This Letter of Agreement is applicable for the Northern California KFH facilities for the period of July 15, 2002 through August 31, 2002, unless extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.
2.	No Cancellation Definitions and Limitations: No Hospital or Home HealtiVHosplce Registered Nurse covered by this Letter of Agreement will be cancelled from his or her regularly assigned shift except as specifically provided for In this Letter of Agreement. Nurses working as regular full-time or part-time, regularly scheduled short-hour employees, per-diem employees, and employees confirmed to work extra hours or shifts are Included in this Agreement. Travelers are specifically excluded from this Agreement.

For the purposes of this Letter of Agreement, the Parties understand that when the GRASP ratio on any affected unit exceeds 110%, and RNs are working away from their unit on assignments, RNs will be recalled to patient care responsibilities In sufficient numbers to return such ratio to not more than 110%. There shall be a review of the bell shaped staffing matrixes (catalyst) Region-wide with the objective to determine whether the Region should return to standard GRASP matrixes In all facilities.
3.	Procedure for Alternative Assignment: During times of low census or when regular work is otherwise unavailable, an employee, upon arrival at the facility, will be offered an alternative assignment in lieu of cancellation. Should a nurse decline such assignment, s/he may take a voluntary leave without pay (LWOP), a vacation day or float holiday (if the nurse has the vacation day or float holiday accrued and available). Employees who are offered and who decline alternative assignments will not be eligible for report pay.
The procedure for advance request of an LWOP or vacation day will remain in accordance with current practice. A nurse who wishes to take time off rather than accept alternative work (except for mandatory assignments, such as competency/regulatory modules) may notify the employer by placing his or her name on a list made for such purposes in the facility staffing office.

To operationalize the above, it may require floating an RN with validated competency to the unit provided with the fourth Resource Nurse, and back-filling such nurse’s position from the available No Cancellation pool. In no case shall patient care be jeopardized in order to accomplish this assignment.
When nurses are sent to educational modules as their alternative assignment, CEUs will be granted when applicable under provisions of the California Board of Registered Nursing. Obtaining CEUs under this provision shall have no effect on the individual nurse’s Educational Leave.
All alternative assignments will be granted on a rotational basis. Nurses will not be required to take alternative assignments when this would result in registry staff being provided with a patient care assignment.
5.	Staffing; The practices regarding cross-training will remain as is current practice. The practices regarding floating will remain as current practice. Unless specifically modified by this Letter of Agreement, all current staffing practices will remain in force.
$. Meetings: The No Cancellation Agreement shall be a standing agenda item on the monthly Professional Performance Committee agenda.
