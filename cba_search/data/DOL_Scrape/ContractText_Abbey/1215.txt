In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I	- RECOGNITION
The Company, pursuant to a certification of the National Labor Relations Board (Case No. 21-R-18520) dated September 16, 1977 and (Case No. 21-RC-18528) dated December 8, 1989, recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent of the Company's office clerical employees employed at the Company's premises located at 5405 Garden Grove, Suite 200, Westminster, CA 92683, excluding professional employees, confidential employees, guards, watchmen, supervisors as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act, and all other employees.
This certification will be interpreted by the parties to apply to any transfer or expansion by the Company of its existing operations to other or new facilities or joint ventures which are an accretion to the existing Unit where the jobs and the work performed by the Company's employees are substantially the same as are covered by the Certification.

ARTICLE II	- UNION SECURITY
It shall be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and all employees hired after the execution of this Agreement, shall, on the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members of the Union. Any employee who fails to tender the initiation fee and/or periodic dues uniformly required of Union members shall be subject to termination ten (10) days after the Company has received written notice from the Union that such employee is sixty (60) days or more in arrears. The Company agrees to provide dues check-off and any Credit Union deductions for all employees covered by this Agreement who have executed a voluntary dues deduction and Credit Union deduction authorization.
The Union agrees to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless against all and any suits, claims, demands and liabilities, back-pay or penalties that shall arise out of or by reason of any action that shall be taken by the Company pursuant to this Article.

ARTICLE III	- NOTIFICATION TO UNION
Section 1.
The Company will notify the Union of any temporary vacancy, scheduled or unscheduled, and will fill such temporary vacancies on the first day - except vacancies resulting from leaves of absence (including funeral, medical/disability leaves), which will be filled on the 31st day - unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Company, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.
Section 2.
The Company will notify the Union in writing via fax or e-mail when any permanent job vacancy exists. The notice will be in writing via fax or email and will include job interview period, interviewer name and contact information (i.e., telephone, fax or e-mail), and status of posting. In such cases, the Company will fill the permanent vacancy in accordance with the requirements of Article XIII, Section 4.
Section 3.
The Union will refer all experienced and fully qualified persons who advise the Union that they will accept employment if offered. Such referrals will come as follows:
a)	Class A's (on layoff status from an employer signatory to a Local 63 OCU contract, notwithstanding recall rights).
b)	Class B's.
c)	Class C's.
Section 4.
The Company will consider such referrals in that order. The Company will hire from among such experienced and fully qualified Class A referrals or others referred by the Union who are able to step in and perform the work in question. Should the Union not have such referrals for a required position, the Company shall be free to hire from any source.
Section 5.
Section 1 notification will not be required to call for a “temp” when the temporary vacancy can be filled by a Floater or to replace a Floater who is absent and is not scheduled to be on an assignment when the absence begins. If the Floater is on an assignment when the absence begins, a temporary worker will be called as provided in Section 1 of this Article unless another Floater is available to fill the assignment. If all Floaters are assigned to fill a vacancy, a temporary worker will be called.

ARTICLE VI - WORK BY NON-BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES
Section 1.
The parties recognize that in an office operation, bargaining unit employees and nonbargaining unit employees, including supervisors, work closely together. Nonbargaining-unit employees, including supervisors, will not be allowed to perform bargaining unit work. This shall not be construed, however, to limit work by supervisors in the following instances:
a)	To correct operational difficulties that cannot reasonably first be resolved by bargaining unit employees.
b)	To instruct or train employees on new or existing procedures; provided, however, that bargaining unit employees will provide instruction and training on existing procedures to permanent or temporary employees in new positions, unless otherwise mutually agreed. Such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.
When any non-bargaining unit employee receives calls, e-mails, faxes, or other forms of communication requesting information normally provided by bargaining unit employees, they will direct such requests to bargaining unit employees who will provide the necessary information, unless the customer requires a management decision or resolution of a problem that a bargaining unit employee cannot resolve. The Company will not direct customers or others to non-bargaining unit employees for the purposes of performing bargaining unit work. Employees not covered by this Agreement may continue to use computers to perform non-bargaining unit work.
Section 2.
If the Company violates Section 1, the employee who would have performed the work will be paid four (4) hours time in lieu at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's straight time rate (including shift differential and flex premium, where applicable) for each offense to be paid no later than the pay period following the Company’s agreement or an arbitrator’s decision.
When the Company agrees that it has violated Section 1, and agrees to take prompt corrective action, the Union will then make a good faith effort to mitigate the total number of time in lieu’s for the same offense. Upon request, the Company will advise the Union in writing within seven (7) days confirming what corrective action has been taken.

ARTICLE VII - NO STRIKE - NO LOCKOUT
The Company agrees that while this Agreement is in effect it will not engage in any lockout of its employees. Except as provided in Article XIV Section 3 or Article XXXIV Section 1 of this Agreement, the Union and the employees agree that while this Agreement is in effect, they will not engage in or in any way encourage or sanction any strike, sit-down, boycott, slow-down, secondary boycott or picketing, and that they will take all available steps to stop any such activity if it occurs. It is understood, however, that no employee will be required to do the work of any employee who is on strike, and no employee need cross a lawful, primary, and bonafide picket line which has been officially sanctioned in writing by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, or if his physical health or safety will be jeopardized by crossing a picket line.

ARTICLE IX - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 1.
The workweek will consist of forty (40) hours, five (5) consecutive days, Monday through Friday. Employees will be guaranteed forty (40) hours of work per week or, if the employee is directed and required to work less than the workweek, pay in lieu thereof. If that workweek presents a hardship to the Company's operation at a particular location or in a particular job, the Company will discuss the problems with the Union, and both will make a genuine effort to mutually agree upon a Side Letter which is fair to the Company, the Union, and the employee(s) affected.
Section 2.
a)	The normal work day for a day shift will consist of eight (8) hours of work within nine (9) consecutive hours commencing at 8:00 A.M., which may be changed or varied upon mutual agreement.
b)	In the event a second shift is established, it will consist of eight (8) hours work within nine (9) consecutive hours commencing between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
In the event a third shift is established, it will consist of a five (5) hour period not to exceed seven (7) hours commencing between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., a thirty-five (35) hour regular workweek, Monday through Friday.
No second or third shift will be established until ten (10) days after notice has been given the Union.
c)	No change in start time will be established until ten (10) days after notice has been given to the Union, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
Section 3.
Employees who are called back outside their regular working hours or on Saturdays, Sundays, or Holidays will be paid for all time actually worked and will receive a minimum of eight (8) hours work or pay at the appropriate rate; provided, however, that where there is more than one (1) call back concerning a single vessel during a twenty-four (24) hour period commencing at 8:00 AM, the maximum obligation will be to provide a total of eight (8) hours work or pay and not eight (8) hours for each call back. This provision will not apply to continuance of work after a dinner break. The 3rd shift will be a six (6) hour call out.
If an employee is required by his supervisor to call in to the Company during a stated period of time on Saturday or Sunday to find out if work is required of him, or is told by his supervisor to stand by his telephone for a stated period to await a call from his supervisor, and there is no work assigned to him, he will be paid for such standby time
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
12 of 104
until work is assigned or he is released. If work is assigned, the employee will then be entitled to the eight (8) hour minimum call out. The standby pay up to the time he is instructed to report to work is included in the eight (8) hour minimum guarantee unless the standby is eight (8) hours or more, and then the standby time is in addition to the eight (8) hour minimum call out.
Section 4.
a)	The lunch hour shall be from 12:00 Noon to 1:00 PM for day shift persons. An employee who is directed and required by the Company to work through all or part of his lunch period shall not be sent home prior to the normal quitting time unless the employee and his supervisor agree. An employee who is directed and required to work through the lunch hour or portions thereof will receive one (1) hour of overtime (8 hours straight time, 1 hour overtime) and allowed to take lunch at 11:00 to 12:00 or 1:00 to 2:00. If this is not possible, such employee will be paid at eight (8) hours straight time, one (1) hour overtime and one (1) hour penalty at the overtime rate of pay (no lunch). In such case, an employee will be allowed to eat while working,
b)	The lunch hour for the second shift will be from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. An employee working through all or part of his lunch period will be paid according to Section 4(a) above.
c)	There is no lunch hour for the third shift; however, employees will be allowed to take one-half (1/a) hour relief period to eat.
Section 5.
Overtime will be paid for at one and one-half (11/a) times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay, including shift premium if applicable, for all hours worked outside of the normal shift (as defined in Section 2 of this Article), outside of the normal workweek (as defined in Section 1 of this Article) and on Holidays (as defined in Article XVII).
All hours worked outside the normal shift (as defined in Section 2 of the Article) on a holiday will be paid at two (2) times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay, including shift premium if applicable.
All hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any day shall be paid at two (2) times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay, including shift premium if applicable.
For the purpose of computing overtime, all hours worked or paid for by the Company will be counted as time worked, but in no circumstances will this be interpreted to require any pyramiding of overtime. Pyramiding of overtime means counting overtime hours worked or paid a second time for the purpose of obtaining additional overtime pay.
Section 6.
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
13 of 104
No employee shall be required to work over twelve (12) consecutive hours in any one (1) day so long as the employee advises the employer when he is first offered overtime that he is not willing to work beyond twelve (12) consecutive hours, in which case the employer may offer the overtime to an employee who can step in and perform the work and who will agree to work more than twelve (12) hours.
Any time an employee is required or agrees to work past twelve (12) consecutive hours of work, the employee, without loss of pay, will not be required to work the next calendar day.
Section 7.
Relief periods not to exceed fifteen (15) minutes shall be provided each employee at or about the mid-point of the first half of the shift and at or about the mid-point of the second half of the shift having due regard for the continuity of work.
Section 8.
The Company will post notice by the end of the normal workday each Thursday concerning the current status of overtime work for the coming weekend. It is understood, however, that circumstances may change thereafter, so that the Company may find it necessary to require or cancel weekend overtime despite the Thursday status notice.
Section 9.
For the purpose of this Article, all hours worked on a second or third shift will be considered to have been on the day of the start of the first shift.
Section 10.
Overtime shall be assigned by shift on a rotating basis to those
bargaining unit employees (except temporaries) in the department who are normally assigned to perform the work according to seniority. If no such bargaining unit employee(s) is available or if additional bargaining unit employees are needed to perform the overtime work in question, it will be assigned to other bargaining unit employees by seniority on a rotating basis (except temporaries) who can step in and perform the work assigned.
b)	Bargaining unit employees shall not be required to accept overtime if there are other bargaining unit employees who can step in and perform the work and are willing and available for the time needed. However, this does not negate the employer's obligation to offer such work to the bargaining unit employees normally assigned to perform such work as in (a) above.
c)	At its option, the Company may utilize temporary employees to perform overtime that has been turned down by bargaining unit employees as
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
14 of 104
outlined in (a) and (b) above.
Section 11.
In no event shall overtime or premium pay be pyramided or duplicated.
Section 12.
Paydays will be every two weeks on Friday. If said Friday falls on a holiday, employees will be paid the preceding day. An employee who has a question about the amount paid in his paycheck will be provided a written explanation of the calculation within two (2) working days of such request; if a correction is necessary, it will be paid within two (2) working days, unless the employee caused the error or delay, in which case it will be paid in the next payroll period.
If the Company has the employees' paychecks available for distribution on Thursday afternoon and the Company is satisfied that such distribution has not or will not cause absenteeism on Friday, the Company will then distribute such paychecks on Thursday afternoon.
Section 13.
Employees will not be required to utilize any time keeping device including but not limited to time clocks.

07/01/19 through 06/30/23

ARTICLE X - SHIFT CHANGE AND DIFFERENTIAL
Section 1.
The regular starting time of a shift to which the employee is assigned shall determine whether the shift the employee is working is a day shift, second shift, or third shift.
Section 2,
With regard to shift rates, the first shift hourly rate shall be the basic straight time hourly rate. The second shift hourly rate shall be 1.333333 times the basic straight time hourly rate (Monday through Friday). The overtime and weekend rate for second shift will be 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay (shift premium included). The third shift hourly rate shall be 1.6 times the basic straight time hourly rate (Monday through Friday). The overtime and weekend rate for the third shift will be 1.8 times the basic straight time hourly rate. The normal third shift in the industry shall consist of a five (5) hour period not to exceed seven (7) hours, the regular workweek consists of thirty-five (35) hours, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Company.
Section 3.
In the event a second or third shift is established, the job will be posted and filled in accordance with Article XIII.
Section 4.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from temporarily transferring, without regard to seniority, an employee who has special skills or abilities to another established shift where such skills and abilities are required. At the time of such transfer, the employee(s) must be informed as to the approximate length of such transfer. The Company agrees that the length of such transfer will be as short as practicable and will not exceed thirty (30) days unless extended by mutual agreement.

ARTICLE XI - WAGE RATES AND JOB CLASSIFICATION
Section 1
Effective July 1,2016, the Company agrees to pay not less than the wage rates shown on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.
Section 2.
Employees shall be classified according to duties performed during the majority of the time; however, it is understood that sometimes the nature of the work requires employees to perform work of several classifications. Nothing contained herein will apply to the provisions of Article IX, Section 10.
Section 3.
Any employee who volunteers or is requested by the Company to work temporarily in a position with a lower rate of pay will not suffer any reduction in pay.
Section 4.
In the event of establishment of a new classification, the Company has the right to determine the appropriate classification and rate. Employees assigned to such new classification shall have the right, after commencing work in such classification, to take the question of the appropriateness of the rate in relation to Exhibit A through the Grievance Procedure and to arbitration, if necessary.
Section 5.
All employees will be given on-the-job training as is practicable. The Company further agrees that it will meet with the Union in good faith to discuss a training program, which is tailored to the particular circumstances of their Company. Such employee’s request for training will not be unreasonably withheld.

It is understood that the Company need not go to employees outside the facility to meet the requirements of this section for such temporary assignment of short duration.
b)	Such temporary assignment will be offered on a rotating basis according to seniority in the following order: first, to employees within the affected job classification (Exhibit B), second, the affected department, and finally to any other bargaining unit employees who can step in and perform the work assigned with reasonable assistance.
c)	If unable to fill the job as outlined in (a) and (b) above, the Company may utilize temporary employees.
Section 2.

There shall be no restrictions for assignments to non-represented jobs up to ninety (90) days. Extensions beyond ninety (90) days may be made by mutual agreement.

Seniority is the length of continuous service of the employee with the Company from his date of hire, or date of rehire. No employee shall acquire any seniority until he has completed his probationary period. There shall be a probationary or trial period of ninety (90) days for all employees. The Company shall have the absolute right, in its discretion, to discharge any probationary employee. When the probationary employee is retained, however, beyond said ninety (90) days, his seniority shall date from date of hire.

Section 3.
Seniority shall be terminated if the employee:
a)	Voluntarily quits.
b)	Is discharged for cause.
c)	Is absent from the payroll for a period equal to the lesser of the employee’s length of seniority or twenty-four (24) months, unless the absence is due to a work-related injury or illness.

e)	The successful bidder must be placed in his/her new position within seven (7) working days, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.
f)	On a posted job, the Company must give the position to the senior bidder provided that the affected employee can step in and perform the job with reasonable assistance within twenty-one (21) consecutive calendar days. The twenty-one (21) days may be extended to an additional twenty-one (21) consecutive calendar days by mutual agreement only.
g)	If, during the agreed upon time frame, the employee who is assigned to the permanent vacancy terminates or proves to be incapable of satisfactorily performing the job or elects to return to the job previously held, the Company must fill the job from among the original bidders and the provisions of subsection (f), above, will apply.
h)	If there are no bidders or none of the bidders placed in the posted position prove to be acceptable, the vacancy will be filled by the Company with an applicant from other sources as described in Article III without being required to post the job again.
i)	The Company shall not be required to consider an employee's bid for any position unless the employee has been in his present job classification for at least six (6) months. This restriction shall not apply:
1)	if the bidder is a non-probationary employee and is the only bidder;
2)	to an employee who has been bumped from his/her former job classification;
3)	to an employee who has been displaced from his/her former job
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23

ARTICLE XIV - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.
Stewards, not to exceed one (1) and one (1) alternate for each location at which the Company operates under the contract, may be designated by the Union for the purpose of taking up grievances with the Company as hereinafter provided. The Union will notify the Company in writing the names of the stewards. Employees may consult with the steward of their choice. Alternate may only be used in the absence of a regular steward.
Section 2.
If any differences arise between any employee, or the Union, and the Company involving the meaning or application of the terms of the Agreement which such employee, or the Union, desires to have considered by the Company, such difference shall be discussed with the immediate supervisor within thirty (30) days upon knowledge of incident or when the employee reasonably should have known of the incident. Thereafter, the supervisor and steward shall make a bona fide effort to amicably settle such difference.
Section 3.
In the event such difference is not settled as aforesaid and the employee, or the Union, desires further consideration thereof, it shall be deemed a grievance and presented in writing to the Human Resource Department stating the unresolved issues of fact and contract agreement provisions.
a)	Said grievance must be presented to the local Labor Relations Committee (consisting of Company representatives and Union officials) within five (5) working days from the time the Section 3 written notice was given, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. In the case of grievances that affect the majority of OCU-signatory employers that cannot be resolved at the local LRC level, a meeting will be held among OCU officers and representatives of other affected OCU employers (industry LRC) in an effort to resolve the grievance. If the industry LRC meeting does not occur within twenty-one (21) days from the time the grievance was first presented, then the said grievance will be moved to arbitration as provided in subsection (b), below, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
b)	If said grievance cannot be adjusted in front of the local or industry Labor Relations Committee, the matter will be set before an arbitrator within two (2) weeks unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The arbitrator will be selected in each case from the following panel of arbitrators:
1.	Kenneth Cloke
2.	Douglas Collins
3.	Jon Monat
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
25 o(104
4.	Kenneth Perea
The arbitrator in each case will be determined by alternate strikes. The first strike will be awarded to the winner of a coin toss. The parties shall strike names alternately from the panel until only one name remains. The name remaining after each party has struck two names from the list shall be designated as the arbitrator for the case.
Grievances not resolved or submitted to the arbitrator within six (6) months of the LRC are withdrawn, unless mutually agreed to continue discussions.
1)	Authority of Arbitrator - The jurisdiction of the Arbitrator shall be limited to the terms of the Agreement between the two (2) Parties and he shall not have authority to alter, modify or amend the Agreement. In no circumstances shall the arbitrator have the authority to require the Company to employ more persons to perform a job or function than the job or function requires, or to reduce the headcount below the number reflected in Exhibit B, except as permitted under Article XXXI, Section 1 of this Agreement.
2)	The Arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and will be final and binding. All decisions of the Arbitrator will be observed and/or implemented. If any dispute arises regarding observance or implementation, the issue shall be determined by the Arbitrator. If the Arbitrator determines that such party has not observed or implemented the Arbitrator's decision, the Arbitrator shall advise such party in writing of the additional step(s) required to comply with his decision, which compliance shall be completed within three (3) working days unless a longer period is permitted by the Arbitrator in his decision due to legitimate operational difficulties with immediate compliance. If the party so ordered does not comply with the order within the time specified by the Arbitrator the other party may use economic action, including but not limited to a strike or other stoppage of work, to require compliance with the Arbitrator's decision. This limited exception to Article VII will not, however, be used to accomplish an unlawful purpose.
3)	Costs of arbitration including the transcript if either party requests same, shall be equally shared, except for attorney fees. Each party will be liable for his attorney's fees.
c)	The Labor Relations Committee shall utilize the arbitrator to resolve all grievances that may arise between the parties hereto, with the exception of grievances involving any clerical job assignments covered by this Agreement transferred to other labor forces (i.e., other ILWU labor bargaining units); this provision will be used for that purpose only. Such grievances involving clerical job assignments or lack thereof shall be referred to the Coast Arbitrator under the PCLCD, John Kagel, or his successor, for final adjudication.

d)	For jurisdictional disputes not involving the ILWU or any of its affiliates, the Company agrees to be bound by the outcome of applicable internal union dispute resolution procedures, e.g. Article 20 of AFL/CIO Constitution, and implement the written decision, so long as those procedures are completed within one-hundred eighty (180) days and do not result in a dual award of the work at issue. The Union will promptly initiate a written request for adjudication under such internal Union dispute resolution procedures, with notice to the Company. Should such procedures (including issuance of a written decision) not be completed as specified above, the Company may initiate action to have the matter decided by the National Labor Relations Board.
Section 4.
Agreements reached at any stage of the Grievance Procedure shall not be applied retroactively prior to the date of the occurrence of the grievance, excluding claims for pay adjustments. However, no obligation for retroactivity shall exceed the period of thirty (30) days prior to the grievance, except for pay adjustment where the employee was paid the wrong rate or amount.
Section 5.
By mutual agreement of the parties, any step of the Grievance Procedure may be waived in order to proceed directly to arbitration.

(30)	hours in each calendar year for bona fide dental or doctor appointments on written proof from doctor or dentist. Any time off for a doctor or dental appointment in excess of two (2) hours per visit or the maximum allotment of thirty (30) hours per calendar year shall be deducted from sick leave pay, and if there is no available sick leave, will be unpaid time off. If the employee did not attend the scheduled appointment, then pay for the missed working time shall be deducted from the employee’s paycheck. Medical appointment time cannot be carried over into a different year or cashed out.
If there is evidence of abuse of doctor visits during working time, the Company may request the employee to authorize the doctor’s office to confirm that the employee in fact went to the doctor’s office for the doctor’s appointment. If the employee refuses to authorize such confirmation by the doctor’s office, the doctor visit will be paid out of the employee’s sick leave, and if there is no available sick leave, will be unpaid time off.
Section 7.
The employee, at the time of retirement will have the right to cash out accrued sick leave at one hundred percent (100%) of his job rate of pay including all shift differential and flex premiums, or use all sick leave as an early out.
Section 8.
If an employee becomes totally disabled for a period of in excess of ninety (90) days, the employee may qualify for a Long Term Disability (“LTD”) benefit. The LTD benefit, payable monthly will be calculated at no less than seventy percent (70%) of the preceding month’s gross base pay, plus applicable shift differential, and will be paid so long as the employee remains totally disabled without reduction for a benefit period to no less than normal retirement age or until the employee is no longer disabled, whichever comes first.

ARTICLE XXXIV - SUCCESSOR CLAUSE
Section 1.
This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors, administrators, executors and assigns.
Should the Company sell, lease, transfer or assign all or part of its operations covered by this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee or assignee, such entity must be advised by the Company of the existence of this Agreement, including the obligations set forth in this Article. Such notice will be in writing, with a copy to the Union, at least sixty (60) days in advance of the effective date of the transfer. If said entity fails to assume this Agreement, on the effective date of transfer the Company will pay the terminated permanent employees severance pay in the amount of their regular hourly pay (including any shift differential) for twelve (12) months, and will provide the employees with continued medical insurance benefits for a period equal to the months of severance pay. In addition, the Company shall be liable to the Union and to the bargaining unit employees covered by this Agreement for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to assume the terms of this Agreement for the life thereof, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, transferee, or lessee has assumed the Agreement. In any action, including grievance and arbitration, brought to enforce the terms of this Article, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs, including attorneys' fees.
Before the Company closes, sells, leases, transfers or assigns all or part of the operations covered by this Agreement, the Company shall give the Union sufficient advance notice of such action to permit the parties to bargain in good faith about any matters not covered by this Agreement. Notice shall be in writing and shall be at least sixty (60) days in advance of the effective date of the transfer. Either party may raise any issue not provided for by this Agreement.
Should the parties reach an impasse at any time, then Article VII shall be waived and either party may initiate a strike or lockout.
In the event all or part of the operations covered by this Agreement are sold, leased, transferred, assigned or taken over by receivership or bankruptcy proceeding, such operations shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof, unless modified by agreement of the parties or by court order.
The Company shall not enter into any joint venture, partnership, merger, restructuring, consolidation, or the like, with any other entity without ensuring that the bargaining unit work and staffing levels ("headcount") are maintained at no less than the levels that exist as of the effective date of the transfer.
Section 2.
In the event the Company extends or transfers all or part of its operations covered by this Agreement to another location, or ceases to perform bargaining unit work, and
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23

thereafter resumes such work, bargaining unit employees must be offered the first opportunity to follow their work, and this Agreement shall apply to the performance of all such bargaining unit work, or any portion thereof. The remedy for violation of this section shall be a "time in lieu" as described in Article VI, Section 2.
Transfers covered by this Article include, but are not limited to, stock sales, exchanges, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, transfers, spin-offs, leases, and joint ventures by which bargaining unit work or any portion thereof is transferred.
Section 3.
This Agreement shall apply to all newly acquired, newly established, or consolidated facilities or locations where bargaining unit work is transferred, wherever located, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Section 4.
The Company agrees it will not sell or cease business, transfer work, restructure or eliminate jobs covered by this Agreement for the purpose of avoiding the Union's representation rights or otherwise evading its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE XXXV - SCOPE OF WORK
Section 1.
It is the intent of the parties to permit the Company to remain technologically competitive and meet its client’s needs so long as work opportunities now and in the future are preserved for the employees employed within the bargaining unit identified in Article I to perform bargaining unit work or functions generally described in the job descriptions attached to this Agreement. As new technologies develop or existing technologies are modified, bargaining unit employees will be trained and assigned to perform such bargaining unit work or functions, resulting from such technologies.
To administer this Article, the Company and Union will follow the following three steps prior to its implementation of any new technology or modification to existing technology that changes bargaining unit work.
Step One:
A.	At least thirty-five (35) days prior to such implementation, the Company will provide the Union with a letter with the following information:
1)	Area of bargaining unit work or functions (including job classifications) likely to be affected,
2)	Details of each step of current work process,
3)	A statement as to whether that step will or will not change,
4)	A diagram or flowchart describing the change,
5)	A general description of the software and hardware to be used in connection with the change,
6)	An outline of the training to be offered to bargaining unit employees to enable them to fully perform the changed work process,
7)	Other information not specified above that reasonably would be required for the Union to evaluate how the change is likely to impact bargaining unit work or functions, and
8)	A statement as to whether the test environment for the interactive demonstration will be in an actual production environment.
B.	No later than fourteen (14) days prior to the implementation, the Union will be provided an opportunity to observe a live, interactive demonstration, at the Company’s facility, in a test environment which would represent a real time situation. By mutual agreement of the Union and the Company, the test may be deferred to a later date.
Step Two: Within fourteen (14) days of the Union’s receipt of the letter in Step 1, the Union will advise the Company in writing of any questions they have regarding, or any objections to such implementation.
Step Three: Within seven (7) days of the Company’s receipt of the Step 2 letter, the
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
56 of 104
Company will make a good faith effort to answer the questions, including providing written responses upon Union request, and resolve any differences regarding implementation of the new technology.
Step Four: The Company may implement the new technology after the completion of Step 1A and Step 1B within the times provided therein. If, at any time after the Step 1B demonstration, the Union has additional questions about the implementation, the Union and the Company will meet and mutually make a good faith effort to resolve any differences regarding implementation of the new technology, and to discuss any bargaining unit work or functions resulting from the implementation of such technology, related training to be offered, and whether other work may be assigned to the bargaining unit employees.
If the Union believes that the implementation has or will violate the Agreement, the Union may file a written grievance, but no later than twenty (20) days following such implementation. The Union's grievance will set forth how the implementation has or will violate the Agreement.
Upon request of the Union following its filing of a grievance as provided in Step 4, the Arbitrator will hold an arbitration hearing within twenty-one (21) days and issue a decision within thirty (30) days of the hearing. If the Arbitrator determines the implementation has violated the terms of this Agreement, he may order an appropriate remedy, including time in lieu payments, and restoration of the status quo ante, so long as it is consistent with the intent of this Article.
Step Five: Either party may appeal the arbitrator’s decision to the Coast Arbitrator within ten (10) days of receipt of Arbitrator’s decision. The Coast Arbitrator will issue his final decision within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal.
Section 2.
The Company agrees it will not permit or allow others, including but not limited to vendors or non-bargaining unit employees, to perform bargaining unit work or functions via modem, router, internet, intranet or network connection (regardless of the means of connection whether hardwire or wireless), or other electronic means; provided however, that non-bargaining unit employees may continue to perform nonbargaining unit work or functions using new technology.
Bona fide customers who require the Company to do so may enter data for the limited purpose of completing bills of lading or placing booking orders, subject to review and correction by bargaining unit employees, as necessary, and may access data for purposes of verification, tracking, and review, but not to displace bargaining unit employees.
This Agreement does not prevent changes in the work process as the result of new technology. It is not required for data to be re-entered.
If the Union has reason to believe the Company is violating this Section, the Union will request a meeting with the Company’s key labor relations representative, which
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
57 Of 104
meeting will take place within fifteen (15) days of such request unless mutually agreed to a later date. At such meeting, the Union will explain its position to the Company. In response, the Company will provide its explanation. If the Company agrees with the Union’s position, it will propose remedial action. If it does not, it will provide at that meeting and/or at a follow-up meeting within fifteen (15) days, any documents or other information which supports its belief that no violation of this Section occurred and the Union will do the same regarding its belief that a violation has occurred. If the Union does not agree to the remedial action proposed and if necessary to resolve the issue, the Company will provide appropriate access to relevant Company systems, including audit trails or database update histories related to the issue in dispute.
Should such good faith discussions by each party fail to resolve the Union’s belief, the Union may then file a grievance pursuant to Article XIV.
Section 3.
In the event new clerical processes, documents, methods, systems, equipment, or other changes in clerical operations are developed, introduced or used by the Company which replace, modify or add to existing clerical operations or work currently covered by this Agreement, the Union will be provided reasonable notice and bargaining unit employees shall be assigned to perform such new or modified work and shall be trained to perform such new or modified work as required.
Section 4.
This Agreement shall apply to all new or existing office clerical work or functions that have been traditionally performed, or are functionally similar to those performed by bargaining unit employees.
Nothing in this Article or Article XXXIV shall be interpreted to preclude the Company from continuing to employ the types of technology and methods of utilizing technology that the Company currently employs, which do not violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”).
Section 5.
The Company will not permit its proprietary or licensed software, data, hardware, equipment or facilities, to be used by others to perform work or functions that replace work or functions being performed by bargaining unit employees.
Bargaining unit work or functions may be eliminated only as a result of labor-saving devices and technologies implemented in accordance with Section 1, above, and not as a means to achieve labor cost savings by allowing non-bargaining unit employees to perform bargaining unit work or functions.
Section 6.
In addition to the Company's commitment not to layoff for any reason in Article XXXII,
ZIM-OCU
07/01/19 through 06/30/23
58 of 104
during the term of this Agreement, there will be no layoffs due to implementation of technology.
Section 7.
The Company will not transfer or reassign, or allow the transfer or reassignment of any portion of work covered by this Agreement to any other entity, facility or location without the consent of the Union. The Union's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 8.
The transfer of bargaining unit work or control of bargaining unit work to any entity of substantially identical ownership, management, business purpose, or function, e.g., parent, subsidiary, etc., whether or not on the dock where bargaining unit work is being performed, without the Union's consent is specifically prohibited by this Agreement. The Union's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 9.
information made available to customers on Company systems or communications will contain contact information for bargaining unit employees where the communication reasonably relates to bargaining unit work.
Section 10.
Bargaining unit employees will be given access at their workstations to information on Company websites and portals as necessary to answer inquiries they receive about their bargaining unit work.
The Company will also provide internet access on the computer at their workstation during non-working time, i.e., off duty meal periods and breaks. Employees must comply with the same Company policy covering internet use that applies to other hourly employees; provided, however, that any disciplinary action is subject to Articles XXVII and XIV.
Section 11.
No provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted to acquire work for the bargaining unit over which the Company does not have the right of control.
