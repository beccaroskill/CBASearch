13.4.2	The prime focus of this PAR Program is to provide assistance and renew quality teaching.
13.4.3	Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense and multifaceted and shall be preceded by a conference in the spring of the year when the teacher receives the “unsatisfactory” evaluation. The conference shall involve the teacher being referred, the evaluator who evaluated the teacher, and the lead coach to begin the development of an Individual Learning Plan. If the permanent teacher so desires, MDEA
13-3
6/4/02
shall provide representation in this meeting.
13.4.4	During the period of assistance, the permanent teacher’s evaluation shall be the joint responsibility of the coach and the Panel. It is the intent of the parties that this process serve as the sole evaluation process for the permanent teacher and that it be based on the permanent teacher’s adherence to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and Article 11 (Evaluation) of this Agreement.
13.4.5	The assistance shall be provided by the peer coaches under this article
and shall be closely monitored by this PAR Program’s governing Panel.

observations, nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or in writing regarding incidents or events related to the teacher’s fulfillment of his/her professional obligations.
13.4.7.1	Should the principal deem it necessary to communicate
with a teacher in this intervention program in a manner that relates to progressive discipline, i.e. letter of warning, reprimand, etc., he/she may copy the coach who shall report the same to the Panel.
13.4.8	The coach will share all written and verbal evaluation reports during a
conference with the teacher at least once every eight weeks unless there are conflicting contractual evaluation timelines. Evaluation timelines shall take precedence over PAR timelines. Prior to the conference, there will be an opportunity for input from the principal. A copy of the written reports will be provided to the principal and the Panel.
13.4.9 At the same time reports are made to the Panel regarding first year
teachers’ performance, the Coach will provide an oral report and all written documentation regarding the progress of the permanent teacher in the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
13.4.9.1	The teacher and principal may be present for the coach’s
presentation and will be given an opportunity to respond to the report.

13.4.10.	7 The parties understand that every possible subject matter competency may not be available within the corps of coaches; and therefore, it shall occasionally be necessary to secure additional assistance to fully address identified deficiencies. In such cases, the peer coach shall maintain prime responsibility for the Individual Learning Plan, but may function more like a case carrier who assures the availability of appropriate resources.
13.4.1	1 At the conclusion of the year of remediation, the Panel shall report to the permanent teacher, the principal, and the Board of Education of the School District that:
13.4.11.	1 Either the permanent teacher is now “proficient” in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, and the principal shall evaluate the unit member the next year; or
13.4.11.	2 The Panel and assisting coach do not consider that further assistance and remediation will be successful with reasons in support of this conclusion. The District may then initiate dismissal proceedings or may send the member back to the principal for evaluation the next year.

The categorical budgets were under spent by $8,127,483 and the school site budgets were under spent by $5,309,126. Since the budgets are based on 2000-2001 revenue, these amounts should be considered as 2000-2001 expenditures.

After adjusting for these items, the difference between ongoing revenue and ongoing expenditures is ($1,274,073).

Retiree Medical/Dental Benefits
22.7.1.	Medical and Dental Benefits for a Spouse or Eligible Dependent
22.7.1.1.	The District will reimburse medical benefits for the employee and spouse or one (1) eligible dependent and will pay for the cost of dental insurance to each employee and dependent(s) for a maximum of ten (10) years or until retiree reaches (or would have reached) age sixty-five (65), whichever comes first. This benefit is available upon retirement of the employee, provided such retirement occurs no later than the end of the fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) in which the employee reaches age sixty (60). Furthermore, to qualify the employee must submit his/her retirement letter to the District on or before the second Friday in April. The employee must complete the appropriate applications in the Risk Management Department at least thirty (30) days prior to their retirement date in order for reimbursement of medical benefits to begin immediately upon retirement.
22.8. CalPERS Payment
22.8.1	. Beginning in 1998, the District will contribute twelve dollars ($12.00) per year ($1.00 per month for 12 months) directly to CalPERS for each eligible retiree for medical insurance. This amount shall increase annually by at least 5% of the employer contribution for active employees ($16.00/month) until such time as both are equal. In addition, the District will contribute to each retiree who qualifies under §22.7.1, on an individual basis an amount which, when added to the $1.00 per month, will cover the medical and dental plans for the plans as provided in §22.7.1.
22.8.2	The District’s medical benefit allocation for each retiree will be an amount which, when added to the amounts:set out in 22.8.1, will provide a total monthly contribution equal to the highest premium at each tier
22-7
Board Approved 1/22/02
of coverage for HMO plans offered by CalPERS, to be adjusted annually for the term of the agreement. By way of example only, these rates were as follows for 1998.
One Party Premium $176.13 per month
Two Party Premium $352.25 per month
(NOTE: Although the foregoing premiums are all from Lifeguard, designation of the highest premium at each tier can be from different plans.)
22.8.2.1	Should the retiree subsequently enroll in a more expensive plan, the District’s obligation is limited to the lower amount.
22.8.3 Because PERS/STRS requires that the CalPERS premiums be deducted from the retiree’s PERS/STRS warrant, the District will provide a concurrent, non-taxable monthly reimbursement up to the amount designated above.
22.9	Benefits for Retirees Who Retire After Age 60
22.9.1	Retirees who retire after the fiscal year in which they turn age 60 shall be provided district paid medical coverage through the month prior to which they turn age 65 (pursuant to §22.8, above). This benefit applies to the employee only.
22.10	Requirements/Conditions Imposed by Carriers
22.10.1	The benefits provided under this section (Retiree Medical/Dental Benefits) shall be subject to any requirements or conditions which may be imposed by the carrier and/or provider.
