the National Labor Relations Act and shall not be interpreted or expanded in any other manner or for any other purpose.
ARTICLE 2 DEFINITIONS
Section 2.1.	Employee: Employee(s) means a person who is employed by the Employer.
Section 2.2.	Employee - Full-time: An employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for at least thirty-six (36) hours per week shall be classified as a full-time employee. An employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for seventy-two (72) hours in a two-week pay period shall be considered a full-time employee for both weeks.
For operational reasons, the Employer may determine, for purposes of fringe benefit eligibility, to consider a group of employees as full-time even though they are regularly scheduled to work less than thirty-six (36) hours.
Section 2.3.	Employee - Part-time: An employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for at least sixteen (16) hours per week, but less than thirty-six (36) hours per week, shall be classified as a part-time employee(s) unless covered by the second paragraph of Section 2.2. Employee(s) who is in a position budgeted for at least thirty-two (32) hours, but less than seventy-two (72) hours in a two-week pay period shall be considered a part-time employee for both weeks.
In the event a full-time employee goes on a leave of absence and the Employer determines to fill their position during the leave, the Employer shall determine, prior to such leave commencing, if possible, whether a part-time, supplemental, contingent or per diem employee in the affected classification and unit wishes to fill such full-time employee’s position on a temporary basis. The senior part
14
time, supplemental, contingent or per diem employee in the classification and unit who indicates such interest in response to a unit posting shall be given preference. While the part-time, supplemental, or contingent employee temporarily fills the full-time employee’s position, they shall be treated as a full-time employee for eligibility for insured benefits under Article 22, commencing with the first of the month following the month in which such employee makes such election. Such full-time employee benefits shall cease beginning with the first of the month following the month in which such employee no longer fills the temporary full time position. If a per diem employee fills the temporary position, they shall be paid the wage rate applicable to a full time employee, which is consistent with the length of the per diem employees licensure, and they would be eligible for benefits as per this agreement. For purposes of this paragraph, Clinical Nurse II, III, and IV shall be considered as being in the same classification.
If a part-time, supplemental, contingent or per diem employee in the unit does not accept such position, the Employer may fill such position during the period of the leave of absence in any manner it determines, including offering additional hours in the unit, hiring a temporary person or using agency employees. Nothing in this Section prohibits the Employer from soliciting employees outside of the unit to fill such available hours. This solicitation process, if used, is informal and is not intended to create any obligation for the Employer, including any obligation to select a particular employee(s) if more than one employee responds to such solicitation. The picking up of such additional hours as provided in this paragraph will not result in a change of status.
i If the employee on a leave of absence does not return to work within the 120 days provided in Article 12, Section

Section 2.5.	Employee - Contingent: An employee who is scheduled for a minimum of two shifts per month, and is not classified as a supplemental employee or a per diem employee. If a contingent employee does not work during any continuous six (6) month period, he/she will lose seniority and be considered not employed by the Employer. However, for purposes of computing such six (6) months, a contingent employee scheduled to work and precluded from working due to VTO/MTO will be considered as having worked.
Section 2.6.	Employee - Per Diem: An employee who is employed on a day-by-day basis and added to the schedule as needed. Except as provided in Attachment N a per diem employee is not eligible for fringe benefits or premium pay provided under this Agreement. A per diem employee will be paid a fixed rate negotiated with the Union. A per diem is not guaranteed any hours or work. If a per diem employee does not work during any continuous six (6) month period, he/she will lose seniority and be considered not employed by the Employer. However, for purposes of computing such six (6) months, a per diem employee scheduled to work and precluded from working due to VTO/VTU/MTO/MTU will be considered as having
16
worked. Except as modified by this Section, per diems are covered by this Agreement.
Section 2.7.	Employee - Temporary: An employee(s) employed to fill a specific vacancy for a limited, defined period of time up to one-hundred twenty (120) calendar days. The Employer shall provide the bargaining unit Chairperson with an electronic list of Temporary Employees on a monthly basis.

Applicable terms and conditions for weekend staffing employees are set forth in Attachment N, (1), (2) and (3). Weekend staffing employees will be paid a fixed rate negotiated with the Union.

Section 2.15.	Status: Status means an employee’s condition of employment as full-time, part-time, supplemental, contingent, or per diem.
Section 2.16.	Days: For purposes of the Grievance Procedure, the word "days" means calendar days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays recognized under this Agreement. For all other purposes, days means calendar days.

18
ARTICLE 3 UNION - SECURITY
Section 3.1.	Union Memberships - Future Employees. Employees who transfer into the bargaining unit or who are hired into it shall become members of the Union upon completion of their probationary period consistent with the applicable provisions of the law. Union dues shall not be deducted from the employee’s pay until the pay period following the pay period in which the employee completes their probationary period.
Section 3.2.	Satisfaction of Membership Requirement. Under Section 3.1, an employee shall satisfy the requirement of membership by tendering to the Union the uniform initiation fee and the financial core membership dues as permitted by law.
Section 3.3.	Termination For Failure to Tender Dues. Any employee to whom membership in the Union is denied or whose membership is terminated by the Union by reason of his failure to tender such initiation fee and membership dues shall not be retained in the bargaining unit. No employee shall be terminated under this Section however, unless the Union has first notified such employee by letter addressed to their last known address of their delinquency and warning them that unless such fees and dues are tendered within seven (7) days they will be reported to the Employer for termination of employment as provided herein. The Union will furnish a copy of such letter to the Employer’s Chief Human Resources Officer or designee on the same date that it mails the letter to the employee.
If the Union notifies the Employer’s Chief Human Resources Officer or designee that an employee has failed to tender his/her delinquency within such seven (7) days and is subject to termination, the Employer within thirty (30) days
19
of receiving such notice, will terminate the delinquent employee, provided the Union has advised the employee of all of his/her legal rights.
ARTICLE 4 CHECK-OFF
Section 4.1.	Union Dues Check-Off. The Employer agrees to deduct dues of employees subject to the Union security provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that such employees have executed the Union’s assignment, authorization and direction.
Dues shall be deducted commencing with the pay period following the pay period in which the employee completes his probationary period. Such dues shall be deducted from every pay check issued, provided the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover such deductions, and remitted to the Union not later than ten (10) days after the last pay day in the month in which they are deducted. The amount of such deductions together with an alphabetical list of those for whom deductions have been made and a list from whom deductions were made in the past but are not being made in the current pay shall be remitted to the Financial Secretary of Local 12 of the Union within ten days of the last pay day in the month. In cases where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Union’s Constitution or By-Laws, or such deduction has already been remitted to the Union, refunds will be made by the Union.
Section 4.2.	Employer Held Harmless. The Union agrees to hold the Employer harmless, including any costs for attorney fees, as a result of the Employer deducting dues for the Union as provided in this Article.
20
Section 4,3.	V-Cap Deduction.

Deductions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions and in the amounts designated on the V-CAP forms. A properly executed V-CAP form delivered to and on file with the Employer shall be a prerequisite and precondition to the deduction of such monies.
The deductions shall be deducted from every paycheck issued in each calendar month, provided there are sufficient funds, and an electronic report indicating the amount deducted, will be forwarded to the UAW V-CAP on a monthly basis, together with a list of names of the Union members within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement for whom deductions have been made. The Employer further agrees to furnish UAW V-CAP with a yearly report of each Union member’s deductions.
The Union shall protect and hold the Employer harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits and other forms of liability by reason of actions taken by the Employer to comply with this Article.
ARTICLE 5 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Section 5.1.	Management Rights. The Union recognizes and agrees that the Employer retains sole and exclusive responsibility for the management, control and operation of the business and complete authority to exercise those rights and powers incidental thereto, including by way of general example and not by limitation, exclusive right and authority to determine the number and location of its buildings, facilities, and services, and to determine whether to open or close facilities, branches, clinics, or any other
21
type of facility, merge with hospitals, hospital systems, and the number, type and kind of services to be rendered by the Employer; to determine all methods of marketing, advertising, promoting and rendering its services, including the prices to be charged therefore, and the exclusive right to approve all contracts for any of its services; to make all financial decisions, including the accounting, bookkeeping and other record keeping methods and procedures, to determine the organizational and business entity structure of the Employer; to determine whether to transfer, lease, sell, merge, or discontinue the entire business operation or any part thereof; to determine the methods of providing services, schedules of employees, to determine whether to purchase any materials or goods or services from other persons; to subcontract work; the right to determine the number of employees to be hired, employed and working, and the selection, promotion or transfer of employees to supervisory, managerial, or other positions outside the bargaining unit; the right to establish the starting and quitting time, the number of hours to be worked, and the business hours of all of its facilities; the right to establish and maintain and enforce reasonable work rules and regulations; to determine the allocation and assignment of work to employees, it being understood and agreed by the Employer and the Union that the general nature of the Employer’s operations requires employees to be employed interchangeably in various positions, and that any employee may be assigned duties in other areas of work as needed. The above rights of management are not all inclusive, but only indicative of the type of matters or rights which belong to and are inherent to the Employer.
Section 5.2.	Management Rights Retained. Additionally, it is understood and agreed that all rights, powers and authority of the Employer are retained by the Employer, except those specifically abridged or modified by
22
the Agreement and any supplementary agreements that may hereafter be made.
Section 5.3.	Management Rights Re: Work Force. In addition to the foregoing exclusive responsibilities of management, it is further recognized that the Employer has the responsibility for the selection and direction of the working forces, including the right to hire, to discipline, to maintain discipline and order, suspend or discharge for just cause, to promote or permanently transfer, to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work, or for other reasons determined by the Employer, subject only to specific terms of this Agreement and to the grievance procedure.
f Section 5.4(a). Subcontracting — Prior to Ratification or Agency Persons. Subject to sub Sections (b) and (c), bargaining unit work being performed by bargaining unit employees on the effective date of this Agreement will generally be performed by members of the bargaining unit. This Section does not apply to any work subcontracted before the date of the Union’s ratification of this Agreement, or the use of agency persons consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Section 5.4(b	). Subcontracting - Duration of Less Than One Month or During Emergency. The Employer may subcontract any work which is less than one (1) month’s duration or results from an emergency. However, with respect to subcontracting of less than one (1) month and subcontracting due to an emergency, if possible, the Employer will notify the Union’s Chairperson of the bargaining unit of the subcontracting and the reasons and length prior to the commencement of the subcontracting.
For purposes of this Section, “emergency” shall mean those situations which occur as a result of unforeseen
23
circumstances and require the commencement of the subcontracting within a time frame which precludes the Employer from giving the advance notices and meeting with the Union as provided in this Article.
Section 5.4(c	). Subcontracting - Future Work in General. The Employer may also subcontract bargaining unit work whenever such subcontracting does not result in the actual layoff from work, or the actual reduction of straight time hours of bargaining unit employees. In addition the Employer may subcontract bargaining unit work which may result in such layoff or reduction of hours provided: (1) it has given the Union notice at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such subcontracting, and, (2).at the Union’s request, negotiate with the Union about alternatives to such subcontracting. In addition the Employer agrees that it will not subcontract work to discriminate against the Union or employees covered by this Agreement because of their Union affiliation, and will not subcontract work if it has available equipment and employees with the required expertise, and, on an economic basis, and/or efficiency basis the performance of such work by employees will be as economically advantageous as performing the work on a subcontract basis.
Section 5.5.	Lease of Facilities. The Union recognizes that the Employer may lease a part of its facility to a third party which is not legally related to the Employer, and which employs its own employees, and establishes its own terms and conditions of employment for those employees.
Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits . such lease and the Employer and Union recognize that this Agreement shall not be binding on such lessee. This provision is not applicable to the Employer subcontracting
24
its own work or services to a contractor. Subcontracting is covered by Article 5, Section 5.4.
Section 5.6(a	). Job Redesign/Merger of Jobs. The Employer and the Union recognize that the ultimate responsibility of determining job content and job responsibilities rest with the Employer. To the extent that, in determining such job content and responsibilities, the Employer determines to redesign the essential job content and responsibilities of a job or to merge job classifications, it will notify the Chairperson of the bargaining unit of its intent, as provided in Section 5.9.
In redesigning job content and responsibilities, the Employer subscribes to the principle, as provided in Section 5.9, that seeking employee input is valuable, provided that nothing in subscribing to this principle in any way erodes the Employer's responsibility of making the final determination, nor requires employee input if circumstances make seeking such input impractical for morale, technical, or strategic reasons.
Section 5.6(b	). Job Elimination Due to Redesign or Merger. In the event an employee's job is eliminated as a result of a job redesign or merger and they are permanently laid off from their classification, they shall exercise their seniority as provided under Article 11, Section 11.2 to bid for open or posted jobs, or under Article 11, Section 11.4 to displace another employee. In either event, the employee exercising their seniority shall receive a trial period as if he haid bid for a vacancy under Article 11, Section 11.2.
Section 5.7.	Job Redesign/Merger/New Job Classification — Pay Rate. In the event the Employer determines to establish a new classification or to redesign a classification by materially changing the essential job responsibilities or qualifications of that classification, or to
25
merge classifications, the Chairperson of the bargaining unit will be notified at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the effective date of such classification, redesign or merger, and the Employer will negotiate with the Union concerning the applicable rate of pay. In the event the Employer and the Union are unable to reach agreement on such wage rate within such fourteen (14) days, the Employer may implement the classification and wage rate, subject to the Union grieving such wage rate. Such grievance shall proceed directly to Step Four of the Grievance Procedure. In reviewing such wage rate, the arbitrator must base their determination on the comparative relationship between the qualifications and responsibilities for the new job or redesigned or merged job classification and existing job classifications in the bargaining unit, and may select only the last offer of the Employer or the Union.
Section 5.8.	Relocation of Service/Unit/Operation. In the event a service or unit or operation or sub-division thereof is physically transferred from the Employer to a related entity within a radius of thirty miles of the Employer's main campus on Cherry Street of Toledo, Ohio, the Employer will notify the Union thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such transfer and review with the Union the reasons for such transfer. The Employer agrees that such transfer will be for sound and compelling business reasons, and will not be for discriminating against the Union or the employees covered by this Agreement because of their representation by the Union.
For purposes of this Section, a related entity is defined as St. Charles Mercy Hospital, St. Anne Mercy Hospital, Mercy College of Northwest Ohio, or other similar entities or corporations formed after the ratification date of this Agreement, in which the Employer is a partial owner of the entity and involved in the management of the operation.
26
Employees affected by the decision will be offered the following options: (a) to transfer to the other entity, provided there are available jobs; or (b) to exercise their seniority as provided in this Agreement.
/ If an employee accepts a transfer to another entity related to the Employer, the employee shall not suffer any reduction in their wage rate; if, after the transfer, a staffing reduction occurs at the other entity which affects such employee, the employee’s continuous service with the Employer and the other entity will be recognized.
Although an employee accepting transfer to a related entity will not be covered by this Agreement, an employee electing a transfer will retain seniority within the bargaining unit which was accrued as of the date of transfer. As a result, such an employee may elect to use their seniority to bid.for open positions in the bargaining unit, or to exercise their seniority within the bargaining unit, if laid off as a result of a reduction in force at the related entity to which they were transferred.
Section 5.9.	Job Security Committee. The Union is committed to the success of St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center and recognizes that the job security of its employees depends upon Employer’s success in providing quality patient service in a cost effective manner.
Therefore, consistent with Section 5.6(a), prior to making a final determination regarding the redesign of a classification’s essential content and responsibilities, or the merger of classifications or unit, or the transfer of essential job responsibilities from one classification or bargaining unit to another classification or bargaining unit (“change”) the Employer will give the Union Chairperson(s) 30 days notice prior to the implementation of such proposed change if the change will result in the layoff of employees, or
27
reduction of straight time hours, or have a major adverse impact on employees in the classification(s), such as requiring all employees in the classification(s) in the applicable unit to re-bid jobs.
The Union Chairperson(s) and the Chief Human Resources Officer will convene the Job Security Committee, consisting of the Union Chairpersons and the remainder of the Bargaining Committee members representing the affected bargaining units, and one representative of the Union’s choosing from each of the affected units and up to an equal number of Employer representatives.
The Committee will meet within ten (10) days after the notice is given to discuss alternatives or modifications, and identify any possible negative financial impact to employees.
While the ultimate goal of the Committee is to seek mutual endorsement of any change and to encourage to the fullest degree friendly and cooperative relations between the respective representative at all levels, nothing in stating that goal in any way erodes the Employer’s right to make the final decision(s) as provided in Section 5.1 and 5.6 of this Agreement.
Every six to twelve (6-12) months, and ongoing, following a change as, provided above, mutually agreed upon quality assessment evaluations of the determination will be conducted by this Committee.
Section 5.10.	Work Rules Changes. Regarding the Employer’s right to change its work rules, the Employer shall give the Union at least sixty (60) days notice of any changes in such rules, and during such sixty (60) day period, at the Union’s request, meet and review with the Union, the change(s), and the reasons for such changes(s).
28
Within seven (7) days after its implementation, the Union may grieve at Step Three of the Grievance Procedure, the appropriateness and reasonableness of such rule changes and whether it meets the just cause standard for discipline, provided in Article 5, Section 5.3.
For purposes of this section, “change” means additions, deletions from, or modifications of any rule.
. Section 5.11. Negotiations - Waiver of Right to Bargain. The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of the right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, the Employer and the Union for the life of this Agreement each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and agrees that the other shall not be obliged, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
Section 5.12.	Entirety of Agreement. Subject to the
Management Rights provisions of this Agreement, the Employer and the Union agree that this Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement between the parties as to terms and conditions governing employment of employees in the bargaining unit.
29
ARTICLE 6 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 6.1.	Grievance Defined and Grievance Steps. A grievance is defined as a dispute with respect to an alleged violation or with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement, and shall include any and all disciplinary actions taken by the Employer, provided that, “Employee Conferences” or “Coachings” shall not be deemed disciplinary actions taken by the Employer. Therefore, such action will not be considered a “grievance” and, therefore, excluded from application of the procedure set forth in this Article. Employee conference/coaching forms will only be used, considered or raised by the Union or the Employer in any phase of the grievance process under the following circumstances: (i) when the conduct at issue is related to the conduct that was the subject of a prior conference/coaching session; or (ii) to rebut a claim by an employee of a good work record.
To be considered a grievance, such dispute has to be processed in the following manner:
STEP ONE: When an employee(s) has a grievance, they shall first notify their Manager/Supervisor, or designee, and discuss the grievance with them; at the employee’s request, the employee may have the steward assigned to process grievances for their area present. Such discussion must take place within five (5) days after the incident, which gave rise to the grievance, initially occurred.
STEP TWO: If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step One, the employee(s) may so inform the steward assigned to process grievances for their area, who shall, if they believe the grievance should be processed, discuss the grievance with a Bargaining Committee member who shall reduce the grievance to writing within five (5) days after the
30
discussion at Step One on a standard form, in triplicate, and signed by the employee(s) involved, and presented to the Administrative Director or Manager/Supervisor of the employee's unit. The grievance must specify the facts which it is based on, cite the section(s) alleged to have been violated, the date on which the Step One discussion occurred, the Manager/Supervisor involved in the Step One discussion, and the resolution requested. Such Administrative Director or Manager/Supervisor, or their designee, shall within five (5) days after receipt of the grievance, state their disposition of the grievance in writing on the grievance form, sign their name thereto, and give it to the Union’s Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee.
STEP THREE: If the Administrative Director’s or Manager’s/Supervisor’s, or their designee’s, answer is not agreeable, the Union may appeal the grievance to the Employer's Chief Human Resources Officer, or their designee, by giving them written notice of such appeal within five (5) days after the answer at Step Two is received by the Union's Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee. The Employer's Chief Human Resources Officer, or their designee, the Administrative Director or Manager/Supervisor for the unit in which the employee works, and one other Employer representative, and the Union's Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee, one other Union representative involved, and the Grievant shall meet to review the grievance within fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal is received by the Chief Human Resources Officer. The Employer's Chief Human Resources Officer, or their designee, shall give their answer to the Union's Chairperson of the Bargaining Committee within ten (10) days after such meeting. A representative of the International Union may at the Union’s discretion be present at the Step Three meeting.
31
STEP FOUR: If the Employer’s answer at Step Three is not agreeable to the Union, it may, if done within thirty (30) days after the Union's Chairperson receives the Employer’s Step Three answer, appeal the grievance to arbitration. The appeal shall be taken within such thirty (30) days by a written notice to the Employer's Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, which is signed by the Union's Chairperson, or designee, and by on line notice filed with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service ("FMCS"). The FMCS filing fee will be paid on an alternating basis, beginning with the Employer making the first payment.
The arbitrator shall be selected by the Employer and the Union alternatively striking a name from the panel of arbitrators received from the FMCS, with the last remaining arbitrator being the person selected to hear the grievance. Each party may reject one list submitted by the FMCS. Unless otherwise agreed, the list furnished by the FMCS shall contain seven (7) names.
Grievances shall be arbitrated separately, unless otherwise agreed by the Employer and the Union.
Arbitrations shall be held at a mutually convenient site selected by the Employer and the Union.
The Arbitrator's jurisdiction shall be limited to an employee's grievance arising out of the interpretation or application of this Agreement, including any written amendments or supplements hereto, provided, regarding any retirement plan or other deferred compensation plan, or insured benefit plan, whether self insured or otherwise, the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction only to interpret the terms negotiated and set forth in this Agreement regarding such plans, but shall not have any jurisdiction to interpret or apply any of the terms or administration of such plan. The
32
arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to add to, subtract from, or modify any of, the terms of this Agreement, or amendments or supplements hereto, or to specify the terms of a new agreement, or to substitute his discretion for that of the Employer or the Union, or to exercise any of their functions or responsibilities.

An employee awarded a job under this Section will not be eligible to bid for another bargaining unit position under this procedure for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer to the position filled under this Section, provided, if an employee is bidding for a vacancy within their own classification and unit, the six (6) month prohibition is waived.
Section 11.2 (i). Job Bid Trial Period - Ability to Perform. An employee awarded a job under this Section will have a trial period of up to forty-five (45) calendar days within which to demonstrate the ability to perform the job requirements in a competent manner. This time period can be extended by agreement of the Employer and the Union. The Employer is not required to allow an employee to continue in the trial period for the complete forty-five (45) days, but, after the first fourteen (14) days of actual work, may remove the employee from the position because the Employer determines that the employee is unable to perform the job requirements, and that further training during the balance of the trial period will not result in the employee demonstrating such capability. If an employee does not successfully complete their trial period, they will be returned to their former position, and any employees transferred as a result of such employee's transfer, shall also be returned to their position(s), unless the Employer determines to allow such employees to remain in their positions.
Section 11.2 (j). Job Bid Trial Period - Returning to Former Position. During such forty-five (45) calendar day trial period, the employee may elect to return to their former position, in which event, any employee who filled a bid as a result of such employee's transfer shall also be returned to their former position(s), unless the Employer determines to allow such employee(s) to continue to work in that job classification, status, shift, and unit.
56
j Section 11.2 (k). Job Bid - Pay Rate. When an employee is transferred under this Section to a position his rate of pay in the new position shall be determined as provided in Article 21, Section 21.6.
Section 11.2	(1). Employer Withdrawal of Posting. Prior to filling a position, the Employer may withdraw any posting if it determines that, due to changes in circumstances, it will not fill the position at that time.
Section 11.2	(m). Posting of Leader Positions and Selecting Applicant. Leader positions such as the following positions shall be posted only in the unit where the position is located:
Clinical Coordinator - C.D.G.

Senior Staff Nurse 4
The Employer has the right to select the employee signing the posting for such positions whom it determines to be the most qualified based on merit and ability, provided if merit and ability are equal the senior employee within the bargaining unit will be given preference. If the Employer determines that there is not a bidder within the unit meeting th!e standards for the position, it will solicit other employees wjithin the bargaining unit and outside applicants for the position. Among such applicants, the Employer will hire the most qualified applicant based on merit and ability, provided that, if it hires an applicant from outside of the bargaining unit, such applicant must be more qualified for tne position then those who bid for it. In making its
57
selection decision, the Employer agrees that it shall not act arbitrarily or capriciously.
Additional positions can be added to the leader positions provided in this sub Section by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union. If mutual agreement is not reached, the Employer may file a grievance at Step Three of this Grievance Procedure, and appeal that grievance to arbitration if not resolved at Step Three. The arbitrator selected shall have jurisdiction to evaluate the proposed leader position, and determine the appropriateness of the additional leader position including whether it is comparable to the leader positions listed, and the definition below, and, therefore, covered by this Section.
For purposes of this sub Section, leader is a classification within the bargaining unit in which an employee is responsible for directing and leading a group of employees, including releasing employees from work and arranging schedules, but has no authority regarding discipline.
A Senior Staff Nurse will be subject to their units’ on call and overtime policy. Additionally a Senior Staff Nurse will be included in the MTO/MTU/VTO/VTU rotation provided in Section 11.3(b).
Section 11.3(	a). Temporary Closure of Unit - Effect on Staff. In the event that the Employer determines to reduce staff due to a unit being temporarily closed or partially closed for a period of up to fourteen (14) days, and the employees affected cannot be temporarily assigned within or to another unit, the employees in the affected classifications and unit shall be reduced, and such employees shall not exercise their seniority under the permanent layoff procedure provided in Section 11.4. If such temporary reduction in force is to continue for more
58
than fourteen (14) days, the Employer will notify the Union, and the affected employees will exercise their seniority as provided in Section 11.4.
Section 11,3 (b). Temporary Staff Reduction -Transfer of Employees. The Employer and the Union recognize that the Employer may have situations involving a need to temporarily reduce staffing in a unit even though the unit is not temporarily closed or partially closed as provided in sub Section 11.3 (a).
In such situations, the following procedure will be followed:
(1)	The Employer may temporarily assign employees on a rotating basis starting with the least senior employee to another position within their classification, if needed.
(a) Those employees who are working an “extra day”, or in overtime status that day, as a result of a “help-out” request from the manager, will not be forced into reassignment.
(2)	If after such transfers, there has to be a further temporary reduction in staffing, the Employer will send home employees who are picking up hours in a unit, who do not hold an actual position within the unit.
(3)	If after such transfers, there has to be a further temporary reduction in staffing, the Employer shall seek volunteers to take voluntary time off (“VTO” I “VTU”). To identify volunteers, a process will be developed for employees to indicate such willingness in advance of the
59
scheduled start time for the shift. VTO/VTU will be given in the order provided below, provided that each step of the VTO/VTU process, the employees will rotate the VTO/VTU opportunities based on the applicable VTO/VTU list. If no employees have indicated a willingness to accept VTO/VTU, the supervisor will proceed directly to MTO in the order provided below. Among employees at each step of the MTO process, the Employer will—rotate the MTO/MTU based on the applicable MTO/MTU rotation list.
•	Volunteer - bargaining unit employee -working overtime, who has agreed to take on call, VTO/VTU. Voluntary time off under this bullet will not be counted in the quarterly tracking of VTO/VTU.
•	Volunteer - bargaining unit employee -working straight time, who has agreed to take on call, VTO/VTU. Voluntary time off under this bullet will not be counted in the quarterly tracking of VTO/VTU.

The list showing VTO/VTU and MTO/MTU hours will be available weekly for review.
In applying the above procedures, if there are two or more employees with an equal number of VTO hours, the senior employee(s) will be given preference, and for equal number of MTO hours, the least senior employee(s) will be given mandatory time off.
If two or more employees are on VTO with call back status, the employee with the most VTO hours will be called back first.
In applying the above procedure in sub Section 11.3(b) (VTO/MTO/VTU/MTU), the remaining employees must be qualified to perform the available work.
62
| Supplemental to the above rotation procedure, a separate similar rotation list will be maintained by unit procedure for VTO/MTO/VTU/MTU on holidays recognized under this Agreement (“holiday rotation list”). Such VTO/VTU/MTU/MTO on holidays will also be included in the quarterly VTO/VTU/MTO/MTU list, with the understanding that the holiday rotation list will be on an annual basis and not be restarted each calendar quarter as provided in this Section 11.3(b). For purposes of this paragraph, “annual” means January 2 through January 1.
An employee who accepts voluntary time off or is mandated off shall not suffer the reduction of any benefit accrual as a result of such time off.
If the situations covered by this Section 11.3(b) result in the employees in the affected classification being mandated off work for an average of thirty-six (36) hours per full time arid part time employee in a calendar quarter, or if any full time or part time employee exceeds forty-eight (48) hours of mandated time off in such calendar quarter, or if a specific full time or part time employee has forty (40) hours or more of mandated time off in any two consecutive calendar quarters, the Employer, unless a permanent layoff under Section 11.4 has already been implemented, will notify the Chairperson of the bargaining unit. Unless otherwise agreed, permanent layoffs will, thereafter, be implemented under the provision of Section 11.4 of this Article.
[ For purposes of computing the hours per quarter provided in the preceding paragraph, the following hours will not be counted: (1) hours mandated off during the period of the Sunday before Christmas and the Sunday after New Years, and (2) voluntary hours which an employee(s) does not work because of his initiative or as a result of the Employer's initiative. Nothing contained in this Section 11.3 in any way limits the Employer’s rights to temporarily
63
assign employees to work which they are qualified to perform.
For purposes of temporary layoffs under this Section, Clinical Nurse I, II, III, IV, Clinical Nurses on 24/36 or 36/54 schedule, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Clinical Nurse on a three out of four weekend schedule, Nurse Case Manager, Senior Staff Nurse, Senior Staff Nurse IV, ED Coordinator and per diem employees will be considered as one classification.
The Employer agrees that employees in orientation will not be placed on VTO/VTU or MTO/MTU, unless the unit is temporarily closed, or a Preceptor is not available for any reason, including VTO/VTU or MTO/MTU.
Section 11.4(a). Permanent Layoff. The Employer shall determine when a permanent layoff is appropriate and in which unit, and classification, such layoff shall occur. Consistent with sub Section 11.4(c), permanent layoffs shall be by seniority within the affected job classification.
Unless an employee is being displaced by another employee, an employee will be given seven (7) days notice of a permanent layoff. An employee who has an option(s) to fill a vacancy or to displace another employee(s) may not be given such seven (7) days notice. If an employee has no options exercisable under Section 11.4(c) and as a result will be unemployed due to the layoff, the Employer will give such employee at least seven (7) days notice. An employee affected by such layoff must exercise his seniority within twenty-four (24) hours of such notice.
The seven (7) day notice of permanent layoff shall not be required when layoffs occur because of acts of God or other circumstances beyond the Employer's control.
64
The Chairperson, or designee; will attend the meeting at which an employee is notified of layoff.
Section 11.4(b). Permanent Layoff - Volunteers. When the Employer notifies the Union of a permanent layoff, it will canvas employees in the affected classification and|unit to determine if there are any volunteers for such layoff. Any employee who wishes to volunteer for a permanent layoff must notify Human Resources within twelve (12) hours of the notice being posted. An employee electing a voluntary layoff will be eligible to bid for open positions, and is eligible for recall consistent with their seniority. Additionally within ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of their layoff, and to the loss of their seniority under sub Section 11.11(d), the employee may notify the Employer whether they wish to exercise their seniority to fill a vacancy which has not been filled through the job bidding procedure provided in Section 11.2, or to displace the least senior employee in their classification, and unit, and status, provided they are qualified to fill such position because they have maintained their competency, and | there is a least senior employee within their classification, unit and status to displace.
Section 11.4(c). Permanent Layoff - Involuntary Process. In initiating a permanent layoff in a unit if there are insufficient volunteers, the following procedure will be followed: I '
(1)	Probationary employees in the unit will be laid off
first, provided that the remaining employees in the unit are qualified to perform the work of the probationary employees in the unit. A probationary employee means an employee
who is in their probationary period provided in Article 11, Section 11.1(b). An employee who is in their trial period in Article 11, Section 11.2(i) is not considered a probationary employee, and their seniority shall be recognized in the unit
65
at the time of such layoff, subject to the provisions of Article 11, Section 11.2(i) allowing for return to their former position.
Next, the least senior employee(s) in the unit within the classification affected shall be laid off.
Next, nursing management shall arrange the staffing for the remaining employees in the unit, giving preference to the senior employee(s) retaining their status and shift, and the lesser senior employee(s) being assigned to a different status and/or shift.
An employee whose status and/or shift in the unit is changed as a result of this process of arranging the staff will have the option of -electing to exercise their seniority as provided below in Section 11.4(c)(2)(a) or (b). If that occurs the less senior employee(s) notified of layoff will be assigned to the position(s) declined by an employee(s) due to a status or shift change, with the senior of such employees being re-assigned to their shift or status held at the time of layoff, if available, and the lesser senior employee(s) being assigned to the remaining positions.
(2)	An employee ultimately laid off through this process will be treated in the following manner:
(a)	An employee who has one (1) year or more seniority may select an open position for which they are qualified or displace an employee with less than one (1) year of seniority if qualified to perform such employee’s work. An employee exercising their right under this provision will be given up to ninety (90) calendar days within which to demonstrate that they have the ability to perform the job requirements in a competent manner.
66
f there are no such employees with less than one (1) year of service, the employee will have the option of filling an open position, displacing the least senior employee in their classification in the same status and on the same shift, or a different status and/or shift or being laid off.
(b)	An employee who has less than one year of seniority who is displaced as provided in paragraph (a) may fill an open position, but does not have any right to displace any other employee.
For purposes of paragraph (a), the least senior employee is the least senior employee whose essential job functions such employee is qualified to perform.
In unusual cases, a less senior employee may be retained if the Employer determines that the layoff of that employee would adversely affect the Employer’s ability to provide specific services.
For purposes of options upon layoffs under this Section 11.4(c)(2), Clinical Nurse I, II, III, IV, Clinical Nurse on a 24/3(5 or a 36/54 schedule, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Clinical Nurse on a three of four weekend schedule, Nurse Case Manager, Senior Staff Nurse, Senior Staff IV, ED Coordinator and per diem employees will be considered as one classification.
I
For purposes of this Section 11.4(c), when an employee transfers to an open position, he will be treated as if he had bid for that position under Section 11.2(j) of this Article.
Section 11.4(	d). Contingent Employee Scheduling During Layoff. Employees in contingent status will continue to be scheduled during a permanent layoff in the same manner that contingent employees were scheduled before the permanent layoff.
67
Section 11.5.	Recall From Layoff. Irrespective of status, the Employer shall recall employees in a classification by seniority for available positions within their classification. An employee recalled has the option of declining a position in a status different than the status held at the time of layoff, and, in such event, will remain on layoff, subject to Section 11.11(h).
The Employer shall provide notice of recall to laid off employees by registered mail, telegram or telephone call at their last known address and/or number. Recall rights are lost if the employee fails to report to work as provided in Article 11, Section 11.11(d). Accordingly, employees must provide the Employer with their most recent address. If the employee is to be on vacation or otherwise not immediately available to receive a telephone call, telegram, or registered mail, they must notify the Employer of where they can receive the recall notice.
Once the Employer contacts an employee for recall, that employee would be required to notify the Employer of their intent to accept or reject a position within twenty four (24) hours of that notification. At the time of layoff, anyone who will be on the recall list will be asked for an alternate telephone number and will also be asked if they would like to be called for any status that becomes available in their classification, or whether they only want to be called for specific statuses. After this designation, employees on recall will only be notified of vacancies within such status until such time that the Employer is notified, in writing, of their desire to change such designation.
An employee will be placed on the recall list upon either the loss of classification and/or status in the voluntary layoff process or if lost involuntarily (i.e. an employee will be placed on recall if they accept a voluntary layoff under the applicable “voluntary layoff provisions” of the
68
applicable CBA). Consistent with Section 11.2, of the CBX’s, employees who are on the recall list may bid for positions in the unit where the layoff occurred. Employees submitting bids for unit posted positions will be given the same consideration as employees actively employed in the unit where the position is posted (applying the criteria set forth at Section 11.2.)
Employees on the recall list may bid on positions that have been posted “bargaining unit wide.” Such employees will be given the same consideration as employees actively employed in the bargaining unit in which the position is posted (applying the criteria set forth at Section 11.2.) of the CBA’s for such postings).
Employees in units where positions are posted and for which they are qualified will be given preference over employees on the recall list. Likewise, employees on the recall list will be given preference over employees being laid off and reviewing options under the layoff provision of the CBA. Finally, employees reviewing such options will be given preference over employees in the bargaining unit, who are not in the units where the vacancy exists.
The six (6) month prohibition against bidding on posted positions is waived for any employee who is laid off and exercises his/her open position and/or displacement options under Sections 11.4 of CBA. In other words, the six (6) month prohibition found in CBA will only apply to positions that are filled under Section 11.2. of the CBA.
Section 11.6(	a). Bargaining Unit Chairperson and Vice Chairperson Seniority at Time of Layoff and Recall. For purposes of layoffs and recalls, the bargaining unit Chairperson and bargaining unit Vice Chairperson shall be given top seniority within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
69
Section 11.6(b). Bargaining Committee Seniority at Time of Layoff and Recall. For purposes of layoffs and recalls, members of the Bargaining Committee for the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall be given top seniority within such bargaining unit, but shall be superceded by the employees covered by the provisions of Section 11.6(a).
Section 11.6(	c). Steward Seniority at Time of Layoff and Recall. For purposes of layoff and recall, a steward (including alternate stewards) shall be given top seniority within their classification within their area of jurisdiction as provided in Article 10, but shall be superceded by the provisions of Sections 11.6(a) and 11.6(b).
Section 11.7(	a). Transfer to Non-Bargaining Unit Position. An employee who transfers outside of the bargaining unit shall lose all seniority within the bargaining unit as soon as they complete ninety (90) days of employment outside the bargaining unit.
During the ninety (90) day period, an employee may return to an open position in their classification in their former bargaining unit with accrued seniority, including the time spent outside of the bargaining unit during such ninety (90) day period.
If after losing seniority within the bargaining unit, an employee returns to a job within the bargaining unit, they shall return with their accrued seniority at the time such seniority was terminated.
Section 11.7(	b). Seniority During Transfer to a Position in a Different Bargaining Unit Represented by the Union. If an employee transfers to a position which is outside of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, but which is within a different bargaining unit represented
70
by the Union, they shall transfer to such position with their accrued seniority and continuous service for all purposes, except for bidding for jobs within such different bargaining unit.; For purposes of bidding, the employee’s seniority shall be based on their hire date into the different bargaining unit and unit.
Upon transferring to the different bargaining unit, such employee shall be subject to the trial and return provisions under the agreement applicable to such different bargaining unit.
Section 11,8.	Bidding For Jobs While On Leave Of Absence. Employees on a leave of absence cannot bid for a vacancy unless it is determined that such employee will be available and physically qualified to perform the essential responsibilities of the job they wish to bid as of the date the Employer determines such job shall be filled.
Section 11,9.	Relationship Between Layoff-Leave of Absence Status. An employee on layoff status is not eligible for a leave of absence.
An employee on a leave of absence who returns from the leave during a layoff in their classification shall exercise their seniority consistent with the provisions of Article 11, Section 11.4.
Section IL 10(a). Seniority - Effect on Job Assignment and Supervisor Instructions. An employee shall not, because of their seniority, be able to select or to have or to retain any particular job or assignment or station or routine within their classification. Assignment of jobs, station, or routine within a classification shall be made by the supervisor of the employees. An employee must follow such assignments as directed or be subject to discipline.
71
Any such discipline shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.
In reassigning employees from an open unit to a different unit, the Employer will attempt to avoid repeatedly reassigning employees from a particular open unit disproportionately to reassigning employees from other open unit from which the reassignment could be made. The Employer will keep records indicating the unit from which temporary reassignments are made and make such records available to the bargaining unit Chairperson. If either the Employer or the Union believes that disproportionate reassignments are occurring, the subject will be placed on the agenda for the next Operational/Quality Enhancement meeting, unless resolved prior to that meeting.
r -• .. ■
In reassigning employees from one unit to another unit, non-bargaining unit employees, if available and qualified, will be reassigned before reassigning bargaining unit employees.
A Medical/Surgical Clinical Nurse II Float employee will not be assigned to a specific unit until after the final schedule is posted as provided in Section 15.9.
A Clinical Nurse II Float employee volunteering for extra hours on a specific unit may, at the time they volunteer, decline to be reassigned to another unit during such hours. In that event, the Clinical Nurse II Float employee will be paid at the Clinical Nurse II rate, rather than the Clinical Nurse II Float rate for such hours, and consistent with Section 11.3(b), will not be forced into reassignment, but will be subject to Section 11.3(b)’s provisions for VTO/VTU/MTO/MTU.
72
Section 11.11. Loss of Seniority. An employee shall lose seniority and be considered not employed by the Employer for the following reasons:
1. Employee quits for any reason, including retirement.

73
9.	Employee is employed elsewhere during a leave of absence without permission from the Employer.
10.	Employee loses any licensure or certification required for their job, except if such loss of licensure or certification merely results from a failure to timely renew such licensure or certification and the employee immediately remedies the failure.

However, if for operational reasons the pattern of weekends has to be changed, such change will be set fourth as the tentative schedule under Section 15.9. Prior to publishing the tentative schedule, volunteers for the change will be solicited first, and, thereafter, the schedule will be changed in order of seniority staring with the least senior employee in the classification.
Unless an employee has bid for, transferred to, or under the provisions covering seniority, bumped to a position requiring consecutive weekends worked, an employee will not be required to work on consecutive weekends, unless due to weekend make up or unless due to being on call as provided in this Agreement, and called in on such weekend. Nothing in this Section prohibits posting of positions which have schedules with consecutive weekends worked.
For purposes of this Section, employees working regular schedules with consecutive weekends on the effective date of this Agreement are considered to have bid for, transferred to, or bumped to such schedules, and shall, therefore, continue on such schedules unless they transfer to, bid for, or bump to another position.
Nothing in this Section will prohibit employees from switching days or volunteering for shifts with the result that they will work consecutive weekends.
Section 15.9(	a). Work Schedule Posting. Subject to the provisions of this Section, the Employer will post a work schedule at least four (4) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule.
96
। A request for days off consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the unit’s guidelines must be submitted in writing at least eight (8) weeks in advance of the first day of the|schedule. Also reference Letter of Agreement #18.
| The Employer will post a tentative schedule six (6) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule. After the advance eight (8) week period for submitting written requests for days off, a Supervisor/Manager may grant days off on a first come/first serve basis, provided that the Supervisor/Manager determines that the request can be accommodated based on patient and staffing considerations and can grant the request without having to replace the employee making the request and without paying any overtime due to such request.
Available hours on the posted tentative schedule will be filled on a rotational basis, by senior employees accepting hours on a straight time basis, then float employees on a straight time basis, then per diem employees on a straight time basis, then senior employees on an overtime basis, then float employees on an overtime basis, then per diem employees on an overtime basis, agency, or temporary employees.
■ After the final schedule is posted, available hours will be offered to volunteers, giving preference on the basis of the Iguideline in the preceding paragraph, provided that an employee is to notify the Manager/Supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the beginning of the shift for which they are volunteering.
। On the posted schedule, and in scheduling available hours, the Employer may schedule Travelers consistent with their contract irrespective of the other provisions of this Section.
97
If after an employee indicates interest in additional hours, they decline available hours twice during the applicable schedule, the Employer is not required to contact such employee for available hours during the balance of the schedule.
To be absent, an employee must notify their supervisor at least two (2) hours in advance of their shift starting time.
Section 15.9(	b). Shift Vacancy. If a vacancy exists on a shift which has to be filled, including a vacancy caused by a leave of absence, the Employer will attempt to fill such vacancy by assigning employees hired on a flexible schedule basis, agency or similar persons, or volunteers. If the vacancy remains unfilled after exhausting these options, and volunteers are not available, the employees in the applicable classification on another shift(s) will be rotated to fill the vacancy until the staffing situation is resolved. The rotation will start with the least senior employee and rotate therefrom.
Section 15.10.	Additional Work Hour Conditions. It is recognized that scheduling employees who voluntarily accept additional hours, and transferring available qualified employees, and assigning float employees, and using per diem, temporary, and agency employees should be exhausted before requiring employees to work additional hours beyond their weekly budgeted hours. However, such methods may not resolve the need for requiring additional hours or on call. The Employer recognizes that such additional hours or on call for employees who do not have such requirements as part of their regular job may impose a hardship. Except for employees who work in a closed unit, or specialty team, or in a service which is not opened on a twenty-four (24) hour basis, or employees hired or transferred into positions having specific on call and/or additional hours requirements, an employee will not be
98
required to work or be on call more than six (6) hours in a week beyond their regularly scheduled hours for more than eight (8) weeks out of twelve (12) consecutive weeks. For purposes of this limitation, the number of voluntary hours shall be credited against this limitation, except for voluntary on call hours during MTO.

When the Employer selects a seniority employee, whose job responsibilities do not include the training or leading of other employees, to act as a preceptor for at least a majority of the preceptor’s shift the Employer will pay the seniority employee selected a premium of seventy-five (750) cents per hour for all hours worked on that shift. An employee selected to be a preceptor will participate in any required training or program development necessary to act as a preceptor.
The Employer’s agreement that it may select a seniority employee covered by this Agreement to precept another employee(s) does not in any way diminish the Employer’s right to have supervisors, managers, or other persons precept or train employees.
120
| j Irrespective of any other provision of this Agreement the 'selection and assignment to job precepting shall be at the Employer’s discretion.
I
| For purposes of this preceptor program, if a person employed by an employer other than the Employer is precepted by an employee, the preceptor shall be paid the preceptor premium, provided all other requirements in this Section are met.

ATTACHMENT M CONTINUATION OF HEALTH/PRESCRIPTION/DENTAL COVERAGE
Termination or Reduction in Hours:
Mercy Health Partners (MHP) facilities have “church plan” status and, therefore, are not required to offer COBRA benefits to employees. However, MHP does allow qualified employees and their qualified dependents that lose coverage due to a qualifying event to continue on the hospital’s insurance under the Continuation of Benefits program (COB). The employee can continue the (health/prescription and dental) benefits that you have at the time of loss of coverage. The employee would be responsible for paying 102% of the cost of the insurance (subject to change based on the hospital’s cost). The following is an outline of the process and the timeframes involved:
1. The employee is responsible for notifying their supervisor of their termination. The employee is also responsible for notifying the Benefits Specialist of any change in employment status or life/family situation which would affect their (or their qualified beneficiary’s) eligibility for insurance benefits. Insurance benefits will automatically end the first of the month following the last day of work (or change in status where they would no longer be eligible for ।' insurance) unless the employee completes the needed paperwork in order to continue their benefits under COB in a timely manner.
2'.;, The Benefits Specialist will send out paperwork to the ' employee generally within 14 days of notification of the ’ ■' final date of work or loss of coverage as long as the office has received proper notification.
181 i :
3.	You have sixty (60) days from the loss of coverage or qualifying event in which to return the forms to the Human Resources Department (Benefits Area). Forms must be received and date stamped by Human Resources no later than 5:00 p.m. on the 60th calendar day in order for you or your dependent to be eligible for COB. Forms and benefit elections will not be accepted after this time frame.
4.	You then have forty-five (45) calendar days in which to make payment for the insurance retroactive back to the date your insurance would have normally stopped. Failure to make full payment on the insurance at this time will result in loss of coverage retroactive to the date insurance normally would have stopped. You (nor your dependent) would not be eligible to pick up the insurance at any time in the future.
Example: You terminate employment on 6/15/07. Your insurance would automatically be cancelled 7/1/07. You have until 5.00 p.m. on 8/14/07 to return the signed COB papers in order to continue your insurance. You have 45 days from the date Human Resource receives your form to make payment retroactive to 7/1/07.
Qualified Covered Dependents:
Qualified dependents eligible for continuation of their current benefits are covered spouses, covered dependents and a child bom to, or adopted by the covered employee.
Qualifying Events:
Covered employees and their qualified dependents can continue their insurance for up to 18 consecutive months if the following event occurs as long as they have properly notified the hospital:
182
. Voluntary termination
. Involuntary termination (except for gross misconduct such as theft, violence, etc.)
. Reduction in hours
Example: Employee terms on 7/15/07. Their insurance would end 8/1/07. They can stay on COB until 2/1/09.
The covered spouse or covered dependents can continue their insurance for up to 36 consecutive months (includes all months since the original qualifying event if this is a secondary event) in the event of the following as long as they have properly notified the hospital (within 30 days of the event):
. Death of the employee
• Employee’s Medicare Entitlement
. Divorce or Legal Separation (documentation will be required)
. Dependent child who ceases to be a dependent of the working employee (ex: child reached age 19 and is not a full time student)
Example: Employee terms on 7/15/07 and then dies on 01/01/08. The dependents could continue their insurance until 8/1/10.
Disability Extension):
If a qualified beneficiary becomes totally disabled (as defined by the Social Security Administration) within the first 60 calendar days of being on the COB benefit they can extend their benefit for an additional 11 months (total of 29) as long as they have provided proper written proof of disability to the Benefits Specialist within the 60 calendar day window. It is the Qualified Beneficiary’s responsibility to notify the Benefits Specialist. If one member of the
183
family qualifies for the 29 months, the entire family qualifies for the 29 months.
Open Enrollment:
During Open Enrollment, Qualified Beneficiaries currently covered under COB have the same opportunity to change their elections for health/prescription and dental as active employees. They must return the election forms in the same designated timeframe as active employees.
<
Payment of Premium:
The payment for the insurance coverage is due the 1st of the month for the following month. (Example: The payment for January would be due January 1.) After the initial agreement forms are processed, no additional statements will be sent. It is the Qualified Beneficiary’s responsibility to pay the premiums in a timely manner. Notices regarding any cost changes will be sent to the last known address. If payment is not received in full within 30 calendar days of the 1st of the month, the insurance will i automatically be cancelled and cannot be reinstated at any later time.
Conversion Coverage:
At the end of the COB time frame, you may have conversion privileges with the insurance company that you have coverage with. You will need to contact the insurance company directly to determine possible coverage options and cost. Generally you must make a conversion to an individual policy within 30 days of the loss of coverage.
Address or Information Changes:
It is the Qualified Beneficiaries responsibility to keep the Benefits Specialist notified of any changes in address or
184
family status. All statements and notices will be sent to the “last address” in the employment records and no time extensions will be made because the Qualified Beneficiary did not receive the statement or notice.
I
Termination of COB Benefit Eligibility:
COB eligibility for benefits will cease the first of the month following any of the following events:
. End of the coverage eligibility period (you need to keep track of the coverage time as no additional notice will be sent to notify you when coverage will end).
. Failure to make timely insurance payments
. The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes, after the date of the election, covered under another group health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of the beneficiary other than an exclusion or limitation which does not apply to, or has been satisfied under, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).
. The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary first ; becomes, after the date of the election, entitled to 1 Medicare.
1
; . The date the employer ceases to maintain any group health plan.
’ . In the case of individuals receiving the 11 month .1 disability extension due to a Qualified Beneficiary being deemed disabled by Social Security Administration, coverage may terminate the month
1	185
i mu i
that begins more than 30 days after the date of the final determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled.
Life and Disability Insurance:
Life insurance and disability insurance are not covered through the COB program. There may be conversion privileges under these programs as long as you follow the appropriate process and timeframes. Please refer to the appropriate section of this booklet or your certificate for additional information.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 4 REINSTATEMENT FOLLOWING LEAVES OF ABSENCE
St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“Employer”) and the International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and its Local 12 (“Union”) agree that the following Sections of their collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) will be applied as provided in this Letter of Agreement:
1. Section 12.1(1). Reinstatement Following Leaves of Absence. Section 12.1(1) provides that an employee on a leave of absence, other than a Scholastic Leave, will be reinstated to their classification, status, shift, unit and regular schedule provided they return within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the first day of such leave. The Employer and the Union agree that the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall be an accumulation of all leaves (except Union Leave under the collective bargaining agreement) taken during a “rolling” twelve month period commencing with the first leave, subject to the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) for an employee who takes multiple leaves during the “rolling” twelve month period, the last of which is covered by the FMLA.
Following are examples of the application of this provision:
Example 1.	An employee takes a personal medical leave for seventy (70) days commencing on March 1. On September 1 during the same “rolling” twelve (12) month period, the employee takes a forty-five (45) day leave. In this situation,
228
the employee would be reinstated after both leaves to their regular position as provided in Section 12.1(1). If such employee’s second leave during the “rolling” twelve (12) month period was for sixty (60) days, then after the second leave the employee would not be reinstated to their regular position, unless such position remained open, since they would have been on leave for one hundred and thirty (130) days during the “rolling” twelve (12) month period, but would be reinstated to an open position or displace the least senior employee in their classification unit and status as provided in Section 12.1(1).
Example 2.	An employee takes a Scholastic Leave for ninety (90) days on March 1, and thereafter within the “rolling” twelve (12) month period of March 1 takes a FMLA leave for twelve (12) weeks. Under the provisions of the FMLA, such an employee would be reinstated “to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.”
The Employer may initiate the above provision in place of the provisions in the collective bargaining agreement. If so implemented, the Union will be given thirty (30) days advance notice, and the above provision will be applied prospectively to leaves of absence taken after the provision’s implementation.

This agreement is premised on the fact that the Chairpersons do not, upon accepting their elected posts, vacate their regular position with the Employer. Therefore, throughout their term in office, Chairpersons are still employees of their respective departments (units or cost centers), subject to the same terms and conditions of employment as all other bargaining unit employees of such departments (units or cost centers). A Chairperson or Vice Chairperson will be given up to a ninety (90) days orientation upon return to their home department, cost center, or unit.
It being understood and agreed by the parties that in the event the Employer decided to fill the Chairpersons’ budgeted hours during their appointment to such elected office, that the Employer may effect a layoff, consistent with Section 11.4 of the collective bargaining agreements, to accommodate the Chairpersons’ return to their regular positions.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 6 EXTENDED SICK BANK
, [St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”) and UAW, Local 12 (“Union”) agree that any employee whose employment is terminated with SVMMC or who transfers from a full or part time position will have their accumulated extended sick bank frozen for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of such termination or transfer. If within that one (1) year period the employee is rehired into a full or part time position or if the employee transfers back into a full or part time position, then their sick bank that was frozen shall be credited back to their active extended sick leave bank; If the employee does not return to a full or part time position within one (1) year from the date of termination or transfer, then their frozen sick bank shall be eliminated as if it was never accumulated.
Upon any employee’s rehire into a full or part time position (within one (1) year of termination) or once an employee returns from a contingent, supplemental or per diem position to a full or part time position (and once the sick bank is re-credited), the employee must remain full or part time for the period of at least one (1) year from the date of re-hire or transfer back to full or part time status in order for the extended sick bank to be paid out simultaneously with retirement. In other words, such employees (those who are I eligible for retirement under SVMMC’s pension plan) mayj only receive payment of accrued extended sick leave benefits if they remain full or part time for at least one (1) year|from going back to a full or part time position.
Effective the pay period following the signing of this agreement, all active contingent and supplemental employees in the bargaining unit who had their extended sick'leave benefits eliminated from the payroll system in October of 2001, will have their extended sick leave
233
benefits restored (reflecting the number of hours accrued as the date of last year’s system elimination) and will have such extended sick leave benefits frozen for a period of one (1) year from the date of restoration before the frozen sick bank is permanently eliminated as if it were never accumulated. In order to reactivate their extended sick leave benefits, current contingent and supplemental employees would have to transfer back to a full or part time position within one (1) year from the date of restoration.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 10 ON CALL EVALUATION
During the 2006 negotiations, the UAW, Local 12 representatives expressed concern about the number of hours of on call and the number of on call hours being worked by some employees. While recognizing this concern, SVMMC expressed concern about the number of call offs in particular situations which might be impacting the need for on call. As a result of these discussions, UAW, Local 12 and SVMMC agreed that they would jointly evaluate in the Operational Improvement/Quality Enhancement Committee meeting provided in Article 9, the on call concerns on a unit basis, and jointly seek solutions for significant on call.
Additionally, in such meetings, they would evaluate call off to seek solutions for employees to meet their responsibilities for reporting to work as scheduled.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 11 TEMPORARY TRANSFER AND PRECEPTOR PAY
• )
SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agreed that Temporary Transfer (Section 21.8) and Preceptor Pay (Section 21.15) would be paid for an entire shift if the transferred employee worked in a classification with a higher maximum wage rate or as a Preceptor for a majority of the shift hours.
During negotiations, the Union’s bargaining team expressed concern that supervisors would repeatedly work employees up to the majority of shift hours in such different classification or as a Preceptor, and then re-assign the employee or remove Preceptor responsibilities to avoid paying Temporary Transfer or Preceptor pay. In these discussions, SVMMC indicated to the Union that if Union representatives believed such intentional avoidance was occurring, the Union’s Chairperson would notify Human Resources. In such event, SVMMC and the Union would jointly review the facts involved to assure that such avoidance if occurring, is remedied.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT NO. 14 SMOKE FREE ENVIRONMENT
During the negotiations of the 2006 - 2009 CBA, St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”) proposed that the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center, including the facilities in Attachment B of the CBA, (“Center”) be a “smoke free facility.”
During those negotiations, SVMMC and the Union recognized that there were two pending ballot proposals requiring “smoke free environments”. They further recognized that passage of either, or both ballot proposals, may require the Center to be a “smoke free facility.”
To facilitate the parties’ ability to reach a new CBA, SVMMC withdrew its “smoke free facility” proposal pending the outcome of the ballot proposals. If either or both of the ballot proposals passes, SVMMC and the Union agree that they will negotiate the implementation and effects of the ballot proposal(s) for the Center.
If both ballot proposals fail, the Union recognizes that SVMMC reserves the right to bargain with the Union about the implementation of a “smoke free environment” for the Center.
The Union agrees to the conditions upon which SVMMC withdrew its “smoke free facility” proposal.

।	SCHEDULING OF CTO
Article 15, Section 15.9(a) of the St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center (“SVMMC”)/UAW collective bargaining agreements provide that requests for days off (CTO) must be presented eight (8) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule. Section 15.9(a) further provides that SVMMC is to!post a tentative schedule six (6) weeks in advance of the first day of the schedule.
During the period prior to the posting of the tentative schedule, SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agree that it is the responsibility of SVMMC managers, supervisors, and schedulers to accommodate the requests for days off. During the 8 and 6 week periods provided in Section 15.9(a), an employee will not be required to find their own weekend replacement for a CTO request.
SVMMC and the UAW, Local 12 recognize, however, that all requests for days off may not be granted due to the lack of available coverage. When that occurs, SVMMC on the tentative schedule will indicate those requests which can be accommodated because there is available coverage. Accommodation for days off will be made consistent with unit/department guidelines modified to be consistent with this Letter of Agreement.

If an employee’s request is not accommodated on the tentative schedule the employee has the option to find a replacement consistent with department/unit guidelines.

249

(2)	During the term of the 2006 - 2009, SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agree that employees in the above listed classifications shall be, and are, included in the respective bargaining unit and covered by the terms of the applicable CBA, although the duties of the employees in those classifications may require the performance of supervisory duties.
(3)	SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 agree that neither party will discriminate against, or in any way penalize, the employees in the above classifications because of their performance of supervisory duties. SVMMC and UAW, Local 12 further agrees that it will not take any action aimed at in any way at discouraging employees from accepting positions in the above classifications.
