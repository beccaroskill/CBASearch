ARTICLE 9 SENIORITY
Section 9.1.	Seniority is defined as the length of an employee’s continuous employment in the bargaining unit at the Company’s Bryan, Texas, poultry processing plant since the last permanent date of employment. Seniority shall apply for purposes of layoff, recall, promotion and vacation only.
Section 9.2.	All newly hired or rehired employees shall be considered as probationary employees for a period of ninety (90) days during which period they shall not acquire seniority, and during which they may be discharged without recourse to the grievance and arbitration procedures provided herein. If retained as a regular employee upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, seniority shall be retroactive to the first day of employment.
Section 9.3 In matters of promotion, consideration will be given to an employee’s skill, ability, attendance, versatility, training, physical fitness, and seniority; and when, in the opinion of the Company, the factors other than seniority are relatively equal, seniority will be the deciding factor. In layoffs and recalls, seniority will prevail, provided the employees involved are relatively equal in ability and fitness to immediately perform the available work.
Section 9.4.	An employee's seniority shall be lost and employment considered terminated by:
(a)	discharge for just cause;
(b)	failure to return from layoff within five (5) working days after written notice by certified mail is sent by the Company to the employee's last known address on the Company's books. Actual notice to the employee of recall by any other means shall satisfy the terms of this provision;

Section 9.5.	For the purposes of this Agreement, layoffs shall be classified as (a) "short term" and (b) "long term". A short term layoff is a layoff which will not exceed ten (10) workdays in length. Short term layoffs may be made without regard to seniority. A long term layoff is a layoff which will exceed ten (10) workdays in length. Long term layoffs shall be made subject to Section 3 of this Article.
Section 9.6.	All permanent job vacancies in premium rated classifications shall be posted for two (2) consecutive working days on the plant bulletin board. Employees in lower rated classifications desiring promotion to such jobs shall sign a bid sheet posted on the bulletin board. An employee who does not sign such bid sheet shall have no right to consideration for the vacancy. However, the fact that an employee did not sign the bid sheet will not preclude that employee's selection for the job by the Company if none of the signers is determined to be qualified. If no qualified employee bids on the posted position, the Company may fill the position in its discretion. If, after a reasonable period not to exceed thirty (30) days, the employee selected for the posted position achieves an acceptable level of performance, the employee shall receive the rate of the new position. If the employee fails to perform in an acceptable manner, such employee shall return to a job in their former classification and the premium job shall be posted again. An employee who self-disqualifies shall return to the extra board at the line operator's rate of pay and shall not be eligible for bidding on a premium job for a period of six (6) months.
