ARTICLE I
APPLICABLE LAW
The Public Employees' Fair Employment Act, the other provisions of the Civil Service Law, state laws and the local laws of the County of Oneida not inconsistent with said Act, shall govern the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE II
RECOGNITION
2.1	In or about 1995, the United Public Service Employees Union ("UPSEU"), filed a petition with the New York State Public Employment Relations Board ("PERB") seeking to represent a unit of employees of the County of Oneida. Said unit was certified by PERB on January 31, 1996.
2.2	The County hereby acknowledges that UPSEU shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of establishing salaries, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment through collective negotiations and the administration of grievances arising thereunder for members of the defined bargaining unit. It is further expressly understood that the term "County" as used herein shall mean the County of Oneida.
2.3	UPSEU represents employees of the County holding a budgeted regular full-time position in a title reflected in Appendix A -- Grade Classification.
2.4	All part-time, temporary, seasonal, and casual employees shall be excluded from the bargaining unit. All employees who fill positions within the jurisdictional classifications of exempt or unclassified as defined by the Oneida County Civil Services Rules shall be excluded from the bargaining unit. All other County officers and employees not listed in Appendix A shall be excluded from the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE III	EXCLUSIVITY
UPSEU shall have the right to represent employees in the defined bargaining unit in any and all proceedings under the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act, and under any other applicable law, rule, regulation or statute, under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; to designate its representatives and to appear before appropriate officials of the County to
affect such representation, unless otherwise provided by law; to direct, manage, and govern its own affairs; to determine those matters which the membership wish to negotiate and to pursue these objectives free from any unlawful interference, restraint, coercion or discrimination by the County. UPSEU shall have the right to pursue any matter or issue in any court of competent jurisdiction, whichever is appropriate, unless it is expressly and specifically abridged, delegated or modified by this Agreement, or unless otherwise provided by law.
ARTICLE IV	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
It is agreed that the management officials of the County retain the right to direct employees, to hire, promote, transfer, discipline, subject to law and the terms of this Agreement; to maintain the efficiency of operations entrusted to them; to determine the methods, means and personnel by which said operations are to be conducted, and to take whatever action is deemed necessary to carry out the mission of the applicable department in cases of emergency; provided that such rights shall not be exercised in violation of other sections of this Agreement or in violation of any law.
ARTICLE IV-A LABOR/MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
Meetings between representatives of the County and no more than three (3) representatives of UPSEU, including any outside representatives, on employment related matters and methods of improving the relationship between the parties will be arranged upon reasonable request of either party. Arrangements for such meetings shall be made in advance and shall be held at reasonable hours as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The first such meeting shall be held on or about thirty (30) days after the execution date of this Agreement and shall continue at threemonth intervals as necessary. Employees acting on behalf of UPSEU shall suffer no loss of time or pay should such meetings fall within their regular work hours.
ARTICLE V	MEMBERSHIP DUES AND ASSOCIATION SECURITY
5.1	Following receipt by the County of a signed
(2)
authorization form from the employee, the County shall deduct from the wages of each employee the regular membership dues and union sponsored insurance and benefit program premiums for those employees authorizing such deductions of UPSEU. UPSEU shall notify the County by certified mail in advance of the amount of uniform dues to be deducted. The deductions shall be remitted to United Public Service Employees Union, 3555 Veterans Highway, Suite H, Ronkonkoma, New York 11779. No other employee organization shall be accorded such payroll deduction privilege for members of this bargaining unit to the fullest extent required by the Taylor Law.
5.2	The County shall deduct on a biweekly basis from the wages of all bargaining unit employees who are not members of UPSEU, the amount equivalent to the dues levied by UPSEU and remit the sum to UPSEU, 3555 Veterans Parkway, Suite H, Ronkonkoma, New York 11779. Provided, however, that UPSEU shall establish and maintain a procedure providing for a refund to any employee demanding the return of any part of this agency shop fee deduction which represents the employee's pro rated share of expenditures by UPSEU in aid of activities or causes of a political or ideological nature only incidentally related to terms and conditions of employment. The County shall not deduct agency shop dues from the wages of persons occupying positions listed on Appendix A who have not authorized such deductions.
5.3	UPSEU shall indemnify the County and hold it harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken by the County for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Article.
5.4	Membership in UPSEU shall be voluntary, and there shall be no unlawful discrimination, interference, restraint or coercion by the County or any of its agents, against any employee because of the employee1s membership in UPSEU, or because of any lawful activities on behalf of UPSEU, nor shall there be any discrimination, interference, restraint or coercion by UPSEU, or any of its agents, against any employee because of failure to join UPSEU.
5.5	UPSEU's business representative shall have the right to visit any County facility where employees represented by UPSEU work for the purposes of adjusting grievances and administering
(3)
the terms of this Agreement. The business representative shall be required to inform an appropriate County official in advance, or immediately upon arrival at the particular County facility, of such visits, and shall provide the County assurance that no inordinate interruption in the work of any County employee will be involved by virtue of such visits.
5.6	The above rights of UPSEU are not all inclusive but indicate the type of matters or rights which are inherent to or belong to it as bargaining agent.
5.7	With the approval of the County Executive, UPSEU shall have the right to designate a representative of UPSEU's accident and health insurance program and UPSEU's life insurance program for the purpose of visiting the employees covered under this Agreement while on the job and for the purpose of interesting them in this protection and for adjusting any claims provided, however, that the appropriate County official is notified and that total assurance is given him/her that no inordinate interruption in the work of the employee will be involved.
5.8	UPSEU will designate one (1) employee its Unit Chief Shop Steward and will authorize this employee, at its discretion and subject to the limitations it may set, to deal with the County about employment conditions and adjustment of problems arising from this Agreement. The name of the Unit Chief Shop Steward shall be certified in writing to the County Commissioner of Personnel on an annual basis and/or as changes occur. When it is necessary for the Unit Chief Shop Steward to engage in UPSEU activities which cannot be performed other than during normal working hours, the County Executive, or his/her designated representative, may give such time, without loss of pay, as is reasonably necessary to perform such activities. If the conduct of authorized UPSEU business extends beyond normal working hours, there shall be no additional pay under any circumstances.
5.9	The County agrees that it will allow an aggregate maximum of fifteen (15) days per year time off with pay at the regular straight-time hourly rate to employees who are union stewards or UPSEU Unit Chief Shop Steward to attend conferences or meetings of UPSEU1s Executive Board upon approval of the County Executive, provided that no more than two (2) employees are absent from a department at the same time. For purposes of this section, the union agrees to correspond with the Department
(4)
Head Involved and the Commissioner of Personnel thirty (30) days in advance whenever practicable and inform them of the exercise of these rights.
The Commissioner of Personnel shall have the approval, so far as record-keeping only is concerned, as to whether the UPSEU member will attend with pay or upon his or her own time such as compensatory time, vacation, personal leave, or leave without pay. Special delegates' meetings may be attended only on approval of the County Executive and not be subject to the maximum above.
5.10	The County agrees that it will permit and pay representatives of the union who are regular County employees, not to exceed five (5) in number, time while on the job to resolve union grievances and time to meet with County representatives to resolve differences and discuss or interpret the terms of this Agreement. The County also agrees to permit negotiators for the union, not to exceed five (5) in number, who are regular County employees time while on the job to negotiate future agreements.
5.11	The County agrees that any employee appointed by UPSEU's President to a Statewide UPSEU Committee, will be granted time off with pay to attend obligatory meetings, not exceeding two (2) days total time off per year for this purpose.
5.12	When night time meetings are unable to be conducted, the Unit Chief Shop Steward will be allowed time off with pay to attend meetings called by the UPSEU President. Payment shall cover not more than two (2) meetings per year nor for more than 1-1/2 hours per meeting. When a meeting is called on a day other than an employee's normal scheduled workday, no County payment of any kind will be made.
5.13	By January 31st of each calendar year, the County shall forward to the union a listing of each employee in the bargaining unit including the employee's full name, home address, social security number, job title, department, and date of hire.
The County also agrees to supply quarterly at the request of the union a list of all newly hired unit members, indicating each employee's name and date of hire, and a list of those unit members who have terminated employment during the
(5)
particular quarter, indicating the former employee's name and date of termination.
ARTICLE VI	NO STRIKES
In accordance with the Taylor Law, UPSEU, for itself and on behalf of the employees it represents, hereby affirms that it does not have the right to strike against the County, to assist or participate in any such strike, or to impose an obligation on its membership to conduct, assist or participate in any such strike.
ARTICLE VI-A NONDISCRIMINATION
6A.1 Neither the County nor UPSEU shall discriminate against any employee, or applicant for employment, in a manner which would violate any applicable federal or state employment discrimination laws.
6A.2 With respect to compliance by the County with the provisions of the American With Disabilities Act ("ADA" or "Act") and the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, UPSEU agrees that it shall have the same obligations as the County with respect to reasonable accommodations. With respect to the County's attempt to afford a reasonable accommodation in accordance with provisions of the ADA and regulations issued pursuant to the Act, UPSEU shall have an affirmative obligation to assist the County in achieving any such accommodation.
ARTICLE VII	ADMINISTRATION OF THE SALARY SCHEDULE
7.1	The salary schedules for full-time employees covered by this Agreement are set forth in Appendix B.
The salary schedule for 1996, 1997 and 1998 shall be as existed under the terms of the expired 1993-1995 Agreement (including the "off-schedule” Steps 6.5, 7 and 7.5). There shall be no additional salary expenditures for 1996, 1997 and 1998. The schedule shall continue for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, subject to the following conditions and modifications thereto:
(6)
A.	The "off-schedule" Steps 6.5, 7 and 7.5 shall be adjusted effective January 1, 1999 to reflect an additional 0.25% increase to each of these steps. The resulting increments are 3.25% each applicable year.
B.	Five (5) additional steps shall be added to the top of the 1998 schedule with the first of these new steps being 3.5% higher than the immediately preceding step, and the other four (4) new steps being 4.0% higher than the immediately preceding step. Effective January 1, 2001, three new midpoint steps will be added to the schedule between prior steps 4 and 5, 5 and 5.5 and 5.5 and 6. Such new steps shall apply only to those employees hired on or after January 1, 2001. The schedule's steps shall then be renumbered so each step is a whole number, i.e., the 1999-2003 schedule shall indicate Steps 1-18.
C.	Each employee shall be eligible for annual step movement on the 1999-2003 schedule with step movement occurring on January 1, 1999, January 1, 2000, January 1, 2001, January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003. However, new employees hired subsequent to September 30th of any calendar year will remain at Step 1 until January 1st of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which they were hired. The starting point for the January 1, 1999 step movement shall be the employee's last 1998 base salary as of December 31, 1998. It is also understood that step movement shall continue on each January 1st after the expiration date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, upon reaching Step 18 of the particular salary grade, there shall be no further step movement or base salary increases until such time as a successor agreement to this Agreement is negotiated.
7.2	Permanent, Provisional and Contingent Permanent Promotions. When an employee is promoted on a permanent, provisional or contingent permanent basis, he/she shall be placed at the lowest step of his/her new salary grade which provides a salary increase of at least $600.
7.3	Demotion and Exercise of Seniority Displacement Rights. When an employee is demoted or when an employee exercises his/her seniority to displace to a lower grade position as provided in Article XV -- Layoff and Recall, that employee will move to the step within the lower grade closest to but in no case
(7)
greater than the salary he/she is currently receiving.
7.4	Layoff and Recall. When an employee is recalled from layoff in accordance with the provisions of Article XV -- Layoff and Recall, that employee shall be paid at the same step he/she was paid immediately prior to layoff.
7.5	Reinstatement. When an employee is reinstated from an unpaid leave of absence, that employee shall be paid at the same step he/she was paid upon commencing the leave of absence.
7.6	Failure of Provisional Appointment to Mature Into Permanent Status. When an employee with permanent Civil Service status in one title is serving provisionally in a higher level title and fails to qualify for permanent appointment to the higher level title, that employee shall upon reinstatement to the lower title be paid at the same step and grade of the lower title that he/she would have occupied but for the provisional appointment.
7.7	Starting Salary. New employees shall normally be paid at the Step 1 rate of the grade. However, when a department head demonstrates severe and continued recruitment difficulty for a specific job title, the County reserves the right to increase the starting salary of that job title up to Step 3 of that grade. Such action shall occur only when authorized in advance by the County Commissioner of Personnel. Any employee in that job title whose salary falls below the new starting salary shall have his/her salary raised to the same level as that of the new starting salary.
7.8	Retroactivity.

Grievant shall mean either UPSEU, or the employee(s) it represents in the bargaining unit, filing a grievance.
Immediate Supervisor shall mean the employee or officer on the next higher level of authority above the grievant in the department wherein the grievance exists and who normally assigns and supervises the grievant's work and approves his/her time record and evaluates his/her work performance.
Department Head shall mean the principal officer and/or appointing authority of the department.
(26)
22.2	For the purpose of this procedure, workdays will exclude Saturdays, Sundays and enumerated holidays. The time limits set forth in this Article are of the essence. They may, however, be extended by advance mutual written agreement of the parties. The failure of the grievant, either UPSEU or the employee(s) it represents, to proceed within a time limit set forth herein shall terminate the grievance at that step. The failure of the County to answer within the time limits set forth will automatically advance the grievance to the immediate next step of the grievance procedure.

22.4	In recognition that there are certain issues which, by their nature, are not capable of being settled at the preliminary stages of a grievance procedure, for example where the grievance involves a significant number of employees or employees from more than one department, the County and UPSEU therefore agree that, subject to an advance mutual agreement of the parties, a grievance may be submitted at an advanced step of this grievance procedure.
22.5	Stage 1

22.8	Stage 4
A.	In the event the grievance is not resolved within Stage 3, UPSEU, and only UPSEU, may within ten (10) working days after the Stage 3 reply of the County is given or is due, by written notice request arbitration. The County and UPSEU will select the arbitrator from lists submitted to them by PERB. The
(28)
selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the then current PERB rules for voluntary grievance arbitration. If arbitration is not requested as set forth in this stage, it shall be deemed waived, and the grievance resolved on the basis of the response of the County at Stage 3.
B.	The arbitrator shall have no authority to make any decision which requires commission of an act prohibited by law nor to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the questions of fact and law as to whether there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or an inequitable application of this Agreement, or the relevant Personnel Rule, work rule, or administrative order. The arbitrator shall be empowered to determine the issue(s) raised by the grievance. The arbitrator shall have no authority to make a decision on any issue not so submitted or raised.
