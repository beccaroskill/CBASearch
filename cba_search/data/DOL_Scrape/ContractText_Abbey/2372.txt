Qualifications of Workmen.	It is the responsibility of the dispatcher to determine, in the first
place, the proper Group in which to place the registrant This normally will be based upon information or papers which the man supplies. If any doubt exists as to the registrant's proper placement tire dispatcher may call prior employers, or make other prompt investigations to get the facts needed.
Similarly the dispatcher should make an appropriate notation, where necessary, of the qualifications of the applicant or his related experience, to assist in sending men meeting the Contractor's stated requirements. Any dispute which may arise relative to which list a registrant should be placed upon, or as to competency, shall be settled as follows:
The registrant shall file with the dispatching office a written request for review of the disputed matter, within ten (10) days after the dispute arises. He shall also, at that time, deposit with the dispatching office a cash bond in the sum of Thirty Dollars ($30.00) which sum shall be used solely toward paying his share in the referee's fees.
The dispatching office will immediately refer the request to the impartial referee who shall review the dispute within ten (10) days after the written request has been filed. Time and place of an informal hearing will be fixed by the referee and notice thereof will be given to the registrant by the Union, as soon as practicable.
The referee will examine all material evidence submitted by the registrant and the Union, and will conclusively decide which Group the registrant should be placed in and as to what classifications the registrant has. The Union will then register and classify the registrant accordingly. Nothing contained herein, however, may be interpreted to permit or grant power to the referee to alter, amend, modify, or otherwise change any term or condition of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or these dispatching procedures.

Dispatching Rules. Dispatching Rules shall be posted in the Union Hall in a place conspicuous to Registrants.
Position on List If Registrants inquire, they shall be informed of their position on the out-of-work list.

"Available for Work" means that the registrant must be present at the time and place uniformly required for dispatchment and be ready, able and willing to go to the job site and perform the work for which he is being dispatched. The practice of the dispatching office shall be uniform as to all registrants with respect to physical presence in the office at given hours, or telephoning in, being available at the telephone, etc., and registrants shall be informed of the practice.
Notations. Appropriate notations shall be made opposite the registrant's name when his name is reached for dispatchment, showing the job and classification to which he is dispatched, his lack of availability, or other reason that he has been passed over. If inquiry is made by the registrant, he shall be given exactly the same information as to reasons, etc., as appears on the notation. In such cases, or any other cases which may lead to a dispute, the dispatcher should immediately make notes on the facts upon which he or she based his or her decision to dispatch or not dispatch the man.
