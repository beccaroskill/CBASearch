PRODUCER-SCREEN ACTORS GUILD CODIFIED BASIC AGREEMENT OF 2001
THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between SCREEN ACTORS GUILD, INC., a California non-profit corporation, hereinafter called the "Union" or "SAG," and the ALLIANCE OF MOTION PICTURE & TELEVISION PRODUCERS, hereinafter also referred to as the "AMPTP" or "Alliance," acting on behalf of Producers who have authorized said Alliance to act on their behalf, a list of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, all of which constitute a multi-employer bargaining unit, each hereinafter called "Producer" and collectively referred to as "Producers."
WITNESSETH:
In consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, it is agreed as follows:
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	RECOGNITION AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
A.	Recognition
The Union is recognized by Producer as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for performers in the production of motion pictures in the motion picture industry within the territorial limits of the United States of America. The term "performer" means those persons covered by the terms of this Agreement and includes performers, professional singers, stunt performers, airplane and helicopter pilots, dancers covered under Schedule J of this Agreement, stunt coordinators, puppeteers and body doubles. Background actors are not considered "performers."
The Union is also recognized by Producer as the exclusive bargaining agent for background actors covered by the terms of this Agreement and employed in the production of motion pictures in the motion picture industry in the Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento Zones, as defined in Schedule X, Part I and Schedule X, Part II.
1
The term "motion pictures," as used herein and in all prior Agreements between the parlies, means and includes, and has always meant and included, motion pictures whether made on or by film, tape or otherwise, and whether produced by means of motion picture cameras, electronic cameras or devices, tape devices or any combination of the foregoing or any other means, methods or devices now used or which may hereafter be adopted.
B.	Scope
(1)	When Producer has its base of production in the United States or any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, the Basic Contract shall apply, excluding the Union Security provisions in Alaska or any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States until the Union establishes a Branch in such area.
(2)	When Producer has its base of production as provided in (1) above and goes on location in Canada, the Basic Contract, excluding the Union Security provisions, shall apply to all performers hired by Producer at such location.
(3)	When Producer employs a performer in the United States and transports him anywhere outside of the United States for a motion picture, the terms of the Basic Contract shall apply. If a performer whose services are utilized is a permanent resident of the United States but is temporarily resident abroad and negotiations are carried out in the United States by the performer’s attorney, agent or other representative (including the Union) in the United States, such agreement for the services of the performer shall be within the scope and coverage of this Agreement. The foregoing test of coverage shall be met as long as the representative, agent or attorney of the performer is in the United States when the agreement is negotiated even if it is negotiated by telephone with, or mailed or cabled to a representative of the Producer who is not within the United States during all or any part of said negotiation.
(4)	Only the provisions of Schedule X, Part I shall apply to the employment of background actors in the Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Sacramento,* San Diego, San Francisco and Hawaii Zones. Only the provisions of Schedule X, Part II shall apply to background actors employed in the New York Zone.
-2-
2.	UNION SECURITY
A. Every performer hereafter employed by any Producer, whether by contract or otherwise, or who acts before the camera, or who makes sound track within the Union's jurisdiction, for any Producer, shall be a member of the Union in good standing. As defined and applied in this Section, the term "member of the Union in good standing" means a person who offers to pay (and, if the Union accepts the offer, pays) union initiation fees and dues as financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.
'*■ B, Each Producer shall give the Union full opportunity to check performance by such Producer of its agreement under this Section including access to sets, but the Union’s checking shall be done in such a manner as not to interfere with production. The Union agrees that it will accept as a member of the Union any performer the Producer wishes to employ, but the Union may refuse such admission or, if it sees fit, admit on terms, performers suspended or expelled by the Union or by any branch of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America or by any other performers' union. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Union to discipline, suspend or expel a member or to refuse to re-admit him. The Union agrees, however, that if it suspends or expels a member who is under contract to a Producer, or if a member resigns, the suspension, expulsion or resignation shall not affect the performer's obligation to perform any existing contract or contracts with such Producer or such Producer's right to demand performance, unless the Producer otherwise consents. Subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, the Producer agrees that in every future contract it enters into with a performer, the performer shall agree that the performer shall be a member of the Union in good standing and shall remain so for the duration of the contract. Any nommember of the Union and any suspended or expelled member whom the Producer may be lawfully entitled to employ under this Agreement shall be paid the same minimum salary and shall be given the same working conditions as are provided in this Agreement. No breach by a member of the Union of his obligation to the Union shall give such member a defense to any Producer's right to enforce an existing contract against such member.
C.	The foregoing subsections A. and B., requiring as a condition of employment membership in the Union, shall not apply until on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; the Union and the Producers interpret this sentence to mean that membership in the Union cannot be required of any
performer by a Producer as a condition of employment until thirty (30) days after his first employment as a performer in the motion picture industry; "first employment" meaning the first employment as a performer in the motion picture industry on or after August 10, 1948. The foregoing sentence shall be deemed inoperative if any of the following events shall occur: (a) if the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 is repealed; or (b) if the provision of such Act to which the foregoing sentence has reference is repealed or modified so the foregoing sentence is unnecessary to comply with such Act; or (c) if such Act or such provision is held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Producer shall not be held to have violated this paragraph if it employs a performer who is not a member of the Union in good standing, if the Producer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the Union was not available to such performer on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or if the Producer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the Union was denied to such performer or such performer's membership in the Union was terminated for reasons other than the failure of the performer to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union; provided, however, the Producer shall not be deemed to have such reasonable grounds for believing until it has made inquiry of the Union as to the facts. The preceding sentence shall be deemed inoperative if any of the following events shall occur: (a) if the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 is repealed; or (b) if the provision of such Act to which the preceding sentence has reference is repealed or modified so the preceding sentence is unnecessary to comply with such Act; or (c) if such Act or such provision is held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.
D.	The Producer agrees to report to the Union, in writing, within fifteen (15) days of the first employment of a non-member of the Union, (or within twenty-five (25) days of the first employment of a non-member of the Union on an overnight location), giving the non-member’s name, Social Security number and his first date of employment. An inquiry by any Producer to the Union as to the first date on which a performer has been employed in the industry shall be answered by the Union, and its answer shall bind the Union, and the Producer, if it acts in good faith, shall not be liable for acting on such answer, but the Producer who failed to report shall be liable to the Union for such failure to report. The inquiry provided for in the preceding sentence may be made before, on or one (1) business day after the date of employment.
-4 -
E.	The interpretation contained in the first sentence of subsection C. of this Section 2 has been approved by an advisory opinion of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. If such approval of such sentence is changed by a ruling of such General Counsel, then the new ruling of such General Counsel shall prevail, until the same is overruled by the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction shall change said ruling in a proceeding in which the Union is a party, then the new ruling or opinion shall prevail, until the same is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
F.	The Producer shall pay to the Union as liquidated damages for each employment of a performer in violation of the provisions of this Section 2 the sum of S500, it being agreed that the actual damages suffered by the Union for such breach would be incapable of ascertainment.
G.	The Union agrees that it will not impose unreasonable dues or assessments. If Producer claims a violation by the Union of the provisions of this subsection G., such question shall be handled by conciliation and, if necessary, by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 hereof. It is the intention of the parties to prevent the Union from closing its books so as to prevent any person who wishes to act in motion pictures from joining the Union. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit the right of the Union to discipline or suspend or expel a member or to refuse to re-admit him.
H.	It is agreed that children under four (4) years of age are not subject to the Union Security provisions of this Agreement.
I.	Whenever any Producer is entitled hereunder to a permit or waiver from the Union, the Union agrees to issue the same without cost.
J.	Any breach of the provisions of this Section shall be subject to arbitration between the Union and the Producer under Section 9 of these Genera) Provisions.
-5-
3.	STRIKES
A.	No-Strike Clause
The Union agrees that, during.the effective term hereof, it will not call or engage in a strike affecting motion picture production against any Producer
I	signatory hereto.
B.	Rights and Duties of Union Members and Producers
(1)	If, after the expiration or other termination of the effective term of this Agreement, the Union shall call a strike against any Producer, then each respective contract of members of the Union with such Producer shall be deemed ! automatically suspended, both as to service and compensation, while such strike is in effect, and each such member of the Union shall incur no liability for breach of his respective contract by respecting such strike call, provided such member shall promptly, upon the termination of such strike, and on the demand of the Producer, perform as hereinafter in this paragraph provided, and the member shall be deemed to have agreed as follows:
(a)	That as to any motion picture which is in production at the time any such strike is commenced, if he has a contract to do such motion	’
picture, or if he is under a contract which permits him to be assigned to act in such	j
motion picture and has been so assigned, he will, after the termination of such	I
strike and upon the request of the Producer, report to the Producer and perform his services in such photoplay at the same salary and upon the same terms and conditions as were agreed upon prior to the commencement of said strike;
(b)	That he will immediately, after the termination of such ! strike and upon the request of the Producer, execute a new contract on the same terms and conditions and at the same salary as provided in the contract which was in effect at the time the strike commenced, except that such new contract shall be for a period or periods, including options, equivalent to the unexpired term of the contract which was in effect when such strike was commenced;
(c)	That he will, in lieu of (b), after the termination of such
1	strike, at the option of the Producer, and upon its demand, execute an agreement in | writing with the Producer extending the term or period of such personal service
-6-
contract in effect when such strike was commenced for a period of time equal to the period of any suspension by such strike.
If the member shall fail to perform the foregoing, or if he shall fail actually to finish his services in the motion picture mentioned in (a), as provided in (a) (except by reason of his death, physical disability or default by the Producer), then the waiver of liability by the Producer heretofore given shall be null and void.
The member further agrees that the statute of limitations as a defense to any action by the Producer against the member for his failure to perform during such strike is extended by a period equivalent to the duration of such strike. If the member asserts any claim or defense by reason of the expiration of time during which he can be required to perform services by virtue of any statute (such as the seven (7) year statute), which claim or defense is based in whole or in part on the lapse of time during such strike, the waiver by the Producer is ineffective thereupon, and the statute of limitations as to the Producer’s rights is waived by the member automatically.
(2)	The automatic suspension provisions of this Section 3 shall not affect the Producer's right to sue any individual performer for breach of contract arising during the period of such strike, unless such performer shall have complied with his obligations under the provisions of this Section 3.
(3)	The provisions of this Section 3 shall be deemed included in all
contracts between performers and Producer which are now in effect and all such contracts which shall be entered into during the effective term of this collective bargaining Agreement.
(4)	The Union agrees that it will take such affirmative action as may be necessary and lawful in order to require its members to perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Section 3.
(5)	Notwithstanding the expiration or other termination of the effective term of this collective bargaining agreement, by termination or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 3 shall be and remain in full force and effect for a period of seven (7) years following the termination of any such strike, unless this covenant be sooner terminated by the written consent of Producer and Union.
- 7 -
C.	Limitation on Liability
The Union is a corporation. Nothing in this Section shall enlarge the liability of its officers, directors, agents and members, this Section being an additional limitation thereon. The Union will not be held liable for unauthorized acts of its officers, directors, agents or members; neither the Union, nor its officers, directors, agents or members not participating in the actions hereinafter mentioned shalhbe liable for any strike, slowdown or work stoppage, unless the same be authorized by the Union in accordance with its by-laws, but the foregoing exemption of this sentence shall not apply unless the Union, upon request from the Producer affected thereby, shall proclaim promptly and publicly that such strike, slowdown or work stoppage is unauthorized and follows such pronouncement within a reasonable time thereafter, if requested so to do by the Producer affected, with disciplinary proceedings in accordance with its by-laws against the participants in such unauthorized action.
4.	THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES, THE PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF WHICH COMMENCED BETWEEN JANUARY 31, 1960 AND JULY 21, 1980 RELEASED TO FREE
TELEVISION_______________________
Theatrical motion pictures produced under a prior Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement, the principal photography of which commenced between January 31, 1960 and July 21, 1980 and which are released to free television, shall be governed by the provisions relating to additional compensation payable to performers for exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on free television of the applicable Codified Basic Agreement under which such pictures were produced.
5. TELEVISION EXHIBITION OF THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES, THE PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF WHICH COMMENCED AFTER OCTOBER 6. 19801_______________________
A. With respect to theatrical motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after October 6, 1980 and released to free television
1 The Screen Actors Guild was on strike against the Producers during the period July 22, 1980 through and including October 5, 1980. The terms of an interim agreement maybe applicable to performers who were employed in motion pictures produced during that period.
anywhere in the world, Producer agrees to pay to SAG a deferred compensation, for rateable distribution to the performers appearing in such pictures, equal to six percent (6%) of the worldwide total gross receipts from the distribution of such pictures on free television, after deducting a flat amount of forty percent (40%) of such total gross receipts for distribution fees and expenses. Said compensation shall include pension and health contributions. Such pension and health contributions shall be at the rate provided in and subject to the ceiling and other provisions of Section 34 hereof or of the "Pension and Health Plans" provision of the Agreement under which such picture was produced, whichever is applicable.
When the Producer does not itself so distribute such picture, but effects its distribution through another distributor, the percentage paid shall be based on such distributor's gross receipts from such distribution of such picture on free television, after deducting said flat amount of forty percent (40%) from such iota! gross receipts, payable only after they are received by the Producer, and after such forty percent (40%) deduction. When Producer is paid advances by a distributor, the above percentage shall likewise be payable on the amount of such advances. When Producer sells outright the right to exhibit on free television, SAG shall be paid promptly the above percentage on the gross amounts actually received by Producer for such free television exhibition rights, after deducting a Hat amount of ten percent (10%) of such gross amounts so received by Producer from such outright sale of free television exhibition rights, for sales commission and expenses of sale.
If any such outright sale shall include both free television exhibition rights and other rights with respect to one or more pictures, the Producer shall allocate, to the free television exhibition rights covered by such sale, a fair and reasonable portion of the sale price (but only for the purpose of determining the percentage payment due hereunder) based on the sale of free television exhibition rights in comparable pictures. If SAG shall contend that the amount so allocated in any such outright sale for free television exhibition rights was not fair and reasonable as aforesaid, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration as herein provided. In the event the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair as aforesaid, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated. When the sale is of the free television exhibition rights only in a group of pictures, Producer shall likewise make an allocation of a portion of the sale price to each picture. If SAG contends that allocation is not fair and reasonable, the matter may be similarly submitted to arbitration, as above provided. In the event the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not
reasonable and fair, as aforesaid, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to r of free television exhibition rights only in a single picture.
The term "performer" means those persons covered by this Agreement and includes performers, professional singers, stunt performers, airplane and helicopter pilots, dancers,2 3 stunt coordinators3 and puppeteers, a excludes body doubles,
B.	Distribution-Formula ♦

(c)	No more than ten (10) salary units may be credited to any performer.
(3)	Computation
Each performer shall be credited with the sum of time and salary units as computed above, and each performer will receive that rateable proportion of the monies as the performer's number of units bears to the total number of units for the entire cast.
C.	With respect to such pictures made outside of the United States, when part of the cast is composed of performers subject to this Agreement and part of the cast of performers is not subject to this Agreement, then sums payable hereunder shall be prorated based on the proportion which the salaries and the time worked payable to the performers subject to this Agreement bear to the total performers' salaries and time worked for the picture. If records reflecting time worked are not reasonably available, then the aforementioned proration may be based on salaries alone.
D.	Application to Pictures Initially Released Theatrically
The provisions of this Section 5 regarding additional compensation for free television exhibition apply only to a theatrical motion picture which is exhibited on free television after it has had a bona fide theatrical release. Such molion picture exhibited on free television that has not had a bona fide theatrical release shall be governed by the Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement then

in effect, but only with respect to the provisions relating to additional compensation for reruns and foreign telecasts, or as may otherwise be agreed upon between the Producer and the Union.
The provisions of this Section 5 shall not apply to the televising of trailers or advertising a motion picture by shots, etc., substantially in the nature of a trailer, subject to the limitations provided in Section 1S hereof.

All such payments hereunder shall be made by check, payable to the order of the performer entitled thereto, and delivered to the Union for forwarding to such performer. Producer shall make all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation provided for in this Section 5. Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the performer.
(1)	Network
Except as provided in Section E.(3) below, with respect to network television exhibition, in the event Producer shall fail to pay such additional compensation when and as the same becomes due and payable, the Producer shall pay a late payment charge in the amount provided in Section 31 .B. hereof until such additional compensation is paid.
(2)	Syndication and Foreign Telecasting
Except as provided in Section E.(3) below, with respect to syndication and foreign telecasting, in the event Producer fails to pay such additional compensation within ten (10) days from the date of a notice in writing
-12 -
to Producer from the Union, a late payment penalty shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of delinquency.
(3)	The late payment charges set forth in Section E.(l) and (2) shall not apply:
(a)	To motion pictures produced by Qualified Residual Payors, Qualified Distributors and Qualified Buyers, and motion pictures, the residuals for which are guaranteed or assumed by a Qualified Residua] Payor, Qualified Distributor or Qualified Buyer. These motion pictures shall continue to be subject to the rules on payment of liquidated damages set forth in the 1995 Agreement;
(b)	To residuals payable in connection with the purchase of libraries. The Producer shall give notice to the Union in such cases. The Producer shall assist the Union in its endeavor to obtain compliance with any residual obligations which accrued prior to the date of the purchase. The Union shall cooperate with the Producer in furnishing records or verifying previous payments to enable the Producer to begin making residual payments accruing on and after the date of the purchase as expeditiously as possible;
(c)	To performers omitted from the final cast list. As to these performers, the Producer shall investigate and respond to a claim from the Guild that a performer has been omitted from the cast list with a final position within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of the claim from the Guild. If, as a result of its investigation, the Producer determines that the performer is owed the residual payment, payment shall also be made within said thirty (30) day period. If payment is due and the Producer fails to pay within the thirty (30) day period, then late payment liquidated damages shall accrue as of the date of the original notice from the Guild initiating the claim.
(d)	In the event of bona fide disputes. In such event, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute provided that the Producer pays the undisputed amount on time.
In no event shall the total late payment penalty with respect to any performer exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the amount owing to such performer.
- 13-
As used herein, the term "network exhibition" shall mean the telecasting of such picture over the network facilities in the United States of NBC, CBS or ABC and, effective July 1, 2003, Fox Broadcasting Company ("FBC"), or any other entity which qualifies as a network under Section 73.662(f) of the rules of the Federal Communications Commission, unless the FCC determines that such i	entity is not a network for purposes of such Section. A motion picture shall not be
deemed telecast over a television network when it is telecast (i) on any single regional network presently established and (ii) when it is telecast on any single regional network which may hereafter be established and which does not include New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.
(4)	The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the Producer from recovering an erroneous payment. If there is a dispute over the amount due the performer, and Producer pays the undisputed amount on time, or if there is a bona fide dispute as to the Producer’s liability therefor, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute.
F.	Effect of Performer's Individual Contract
When compensation is payable to any performer in connection with any such picture released to free television, pursuant to an individual contract between such performer and Producer, and such compensation is based, in whole or in part, upon a percentage of Producer's gross receipts, then such percentage compensation may be credited against such performer's share of the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder or, on the other hand, such performer's share of the monies payable hereunder may be credited against the percentage compensation due under the performer's personal service contract, depending upon which such payment was made first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any compensation payable to such performer under an individual contract under which such compensation is a specified sum of money commonly known as a "deferment," as distinguished from a participation in the gross of a picture, may not be credited against the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder.
G.	Reporting
Producer shall furnish to the Guild, with respect to each motion picture produced covered under this Section 5, a complete cast list of actors covered by this Agreement including the name of each actor, Social Security number, type of employment contract, length of employment and the payments for
- 14 -
free television exhibition which will become payable to or for the account of each actor with respect to such motion picture. Such cast list shall be furnished to the Guild one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of principal photography or ninety (90) days after completion of each such motion picture, whichever is sooner. Producer will thereafter furnish a revised or final list when necessary.
Producer shall furnish to SAG written reports showing the gross receipts from the sale, lease, license and distribution of such picture on free television (whether distributed by the Producer or through another distributor) with respect to which the Producer is required to make payments hereunder. Such reports shall be furnished at least quarterly during each calendar year, except in the case of an outright sale. No such report need be furnished by Producer as to any such picture until such Producer shall have first exhibited such picture on free television. Concurrently with the furnishing of such report, the Producer shall pay the percentages due. Producer shall also make available for inspection by SAG all distributors' statements delivered to Producer, insofar as they relate to such gross receipts. SAG shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer as to such gross receipts pertaining to such distribution of such pictures. Producer also agrees that any agreement entered into by it for the lease, license or distribution of any such pictures on free television shall contain a provision made expressly for the benefit of SAG and the performers involved in such pictures, by which such lessee, licensee or distributor agrees to assume and pay the percentage amounts payable hereunder to SAG when and as the same become due; and copies of all such provisions contained in such agreements, with a statement of the name and address of the Producer and the lessee, licensee or distributor and the date of execution shall be delivered to SAG promptly upon the execution thereof. In the event any lessee, licensee or distributor executes such assumption agreement and a copy thereof is delivered to SAG as above provided, Producer shall be relieved of any further obligation or liability with respect to such payment on condition that SAG has approved, in writing, the financial responsibility of such lessee, licensee or distributor.
An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Section 5 shall not constitute a default by Producer hereunder, provided said failure is c*:red promptly after notice thereof from the Screen Actors Guild is received by Producer. Producer hereby authorizes television stations to make available to representatives of the Guild their station logs to verify the station plays of theatrical motion pictures. Regarding a possible system of coding product which appears on television, a joint Producer-Guild Committee will be established
to consider any workable system when it is available, and such committee shall investigate and make recommendations, which will be given consideration by the Producers.
H.	Advances
A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "worldwide total gross receipts" when a theatrical motion picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable,"
(1)	Such theatrical motion picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(a)	. The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(b)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
(2)	Such theatrical motion picture is "identifiable" when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(3)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(a)	the advance is for one theatrical motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(b)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in the "worldwide total gross receipts" for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "worldwide total gross receipts" which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the
-16-
right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If such theatrical motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in "worldwide total gross receipts" no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
An advance received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
I.	Favored Union Clause
If, during the term of this Agreement, any union, through its collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the Producers, obtains an increase in its present percentage "participation of the gross" for television exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, then, in such event, the Union will be entitled to a comparable increase in the rates provided for in this Section.
J,	Release Without Exhibition
In the event the Producer actually receives payment for the release of a theatrical motion picture hereunder for exhibition on free television, the applicable fees provided hereunder shall be payable whether or not such motion picture is in fact exhibited on free television. This provision shall not apply in the case of a license of films when a picture is "dropped out" of such license.
K.

C.	With respect to such pictures made outside of the United States, when part of the cast is composed of performers subject to this Agreement and part of diecast of performers is not subject to this Agreement, then sums payable hereunder shall be prorated based on the proportion which the salaries and the time worked payable to the performers subject to this Agreement bear to the total performers' salaries and time worked for the picture. If records reflecting time worked are not reasonably available, then the aforementioned proration may be based on salaries alone.
D.	Definition of Supplemental Markets
The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this Agreement, means: The exhibition of theatrical motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection D.), or Pay Television, as those terns are hereafter defined in this subsection D.
(1)	Cassettes
For the purposes of this Section, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including, without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a theatrical motion picture (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) and designed for replay through a television receiver or comparable device. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes ’Supplemental Markets" for the purposes of this provision, insofar as cassettes are concerned.
(2)	Pay Television
The term "pay television," as used in this Section, shall mean exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on a television screen by means of telecast,
-21 -
cable, closed-circuit, satellite to home or CATV, for which substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests;
(a)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(b)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(c)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television sendees or systems.
The term "pay television," as used in this Section, shall also include the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures through a television receiver or comparable device by means of a telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the individual viewer or by the hotel, motel, hospital or other accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in theatres or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered pay television.
The term "Supplemental Markets" does not include the exhibition of a theatrical motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition and, for this purpose, "theatrical exhibition" includes the educational market, the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier (referred to herein as ”in-fh'ght''), such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, other
than the specific home use hereinabove defined as "Supplemental Markets" for cassettes.
Whenever reference is made in this Section to Pay Television, tach reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of theatrical motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the subscriber for the program hewed, or for which the subscriber has the option, by additional payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels. When no program charge or special channel charge is made io the subscriber in addition to the general charge, the transmission of theatrical motion pictures by the CATV or television facility, including programming originated by the CATV or television facility, is free television exhibition for the purposes of this /Agreement, and such exhibition shall not be considered Supplemental Markets exhibition.
The Producers have agreed to the inclusion of Pay Television m the "Supplemental Markets" because, under the present pattern of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, Pay Television is supplemental to the primary theatrical market. The Producers reserve the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that Pay Television is no longer a Supplemental Market but constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and that therefore no additional payment should be made with respect to the release of theatrical motion pictures (including ihose covered by this Agreement) in said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subject.
E.	Definition of Distributor's Gross Receipts
(1)	In applying the formula set forth in subsection A. of Section 5.2. Distributor's gross receipts from the Supplemental Markets (if applicable) shall be included in the formula at one hundred percent (100%) of the Distributor's gross received from Supplemental Markets after June 30, 1979.
(2)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Market fees due under this Section 5.2 arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures to 'Pay Television," as defined above," the term "Distributor's gross receipts" shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on "pay television," as defined above; provided, however, that m the case of any such picture which is produced outside of the United States, if
-23 -

such picture is subject to this Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal’') pursuant to whichi foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in "Distributor's gross receipts" except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Producer or to the distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute such picture directly in Supplemental Markets, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then the "Distributor's gross receipts" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture in Supplemental Markets. In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Distributor's gross receipts." If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Distributor's gross receipts," In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets or exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Union shall contend that the amount so allocated was no: fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Producer shall likewise allocate to each such picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Market, and if the Union contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as provided herein. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to
-24-
ach such picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale :f only Supplemental Markets distribution rights in a single such picture shall be object to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated i.e question of whether the price reported by the Producer to the Guild as having teen received by the Producer on such outright sale is less than the amount Ktually received by the Producer on such outright sale.
(3)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Markets fees due c.der this Section 5.2, arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures :n "cassettes," as defined above, the term "Distributor's gross receipts" is defined u foUpws:
(a)	If the Producer is the Distributor or the Distributor is
wied by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor's gross receipts" derived ~um the distribution of such picture by "cassettes" shall be twenty percent (20%) if the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if *e Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor is retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be 'Distributor's gross receipts." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be Kibject to arbitration and, in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices e the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies oil be relevant evidence.
(b)	If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by :r affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor’s gross receipts" shall be one tundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the r.iht to distribute such picture by cassette.
(c)	In the case of any such picture which is produced outside jf the United States, if such picture is subject to this Agreement and if such Reduction is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees r.y of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other tensideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more fcreign territories for the distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets, ten no monies from any such distribution in any foreign territory shall be .eduded in "Distributor's gross receipts" except to the extent such foreign jroducer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Producer or to the
-25-
distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
(d)	In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Distributor’s gross receipts,” If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Distributor's gross receipts.” In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets or exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
(4)	The "Distributor's gross receipts," as that term is used herein, shall not include:
(a)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
(b)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(c)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer or such other distributor, but there shall not be excluded from "Distributor's gross receipts’ any net income tax, franchise tax, or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;

-26 -
transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs.
(5)	Such gross income realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars it the prevailing market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has actually been transmitted to the United Stales, it shall be deemed converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
"A
Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first-in, first-out," unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds, as between revenue which serves is the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal iuihorities.
(6)	If any agreement for distribution on free television or (if ipplicable) in Supplemental Markets or for such foreign territorial sale includes Tore than one motion picture, the Producer shall allocate a portion of the monies payable under such agreement to each motion picture covered by such agreement. It any distribution agreement or foreign territorial sale agreement includes any two 12) or more of free television rights, Supplemental Markets rights and other rights, the Producer shall allocate a portion of the monies payable under such agreement a each of the rights covered by such agreement. Such allocations shall be for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder, shall be made in good faith and, if so made, shall be binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement. If the Union contends that such allocation has not been made in good faith, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration under Section 9 hereof.

(i)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(ii)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
Such theatrical motion picture is "identifiable" when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(b)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(i)	the advance is for one theatrical motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(ii)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in the "Distributor's gross receipts” for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "Distributor's gross receipts" which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If such theatrical motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed
-28-
includable in "Distributor's gross receipts" no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.

Producer shall make all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation provided for in this Section 5.2. Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the performer.
In the event Producer fails to pay such additional compensation within ten (10) days from the date of a notice in writing to Producer from the Union, a late payment penalty shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1 %) per month from the date of delinquency, except:
(1)	For motion pictures produced by Qualified Residual
Payors, Qualified Distributors and Qualified Buyers, and motion pictures, the residuals for which are guaranteed or assumed by a Qualified Residual Payor, Qualified Distributor or Qualified Buyer.

The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the Producer from recovering an erroneous payment. If there is a dispute over the amount due the performer, and Producer pays the undisputed amount on time, or if there is a bona fide dispute as to the Producer's liability therefor, there will he no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute.
H.	Effect of Performer's Individual Contract
When compensation is payable to any performer in connection with any such picture released in Supplemental Markets, pursuant to an individual contract between such performer and Producer, and such compensation is based, in whole or in part, upon a percentage of Producer's gross receipts, then such percentage compensation may be credited against such performer's share of the
- 30-
monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder or, on the other hand, such performer’s share of the monies payable hereunder may be credited against the percentage compensation due under the performer's personal service contract, depending upon which such payment was made first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any compensation payable to such performer under an individual contract when such compensation is a specified sum of money commonly known is a "deferment,” as distinguished from a participation in the gross of a picture, may not be credited against the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder.

By doing so, the Guild would not be violating a duty of confidentiality, if any, owed to the Producer so long as the Guild's communications are related to its obligation to review, investigate or enforce claims against the audited Producer arising under the Codified Basic Agreement or Television Agreement or applicable law, pursuant to legal process, or after obtaining the Producer's consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

Re; Employment of Minora
Dear Ken:
This letter will confirm our understanding with respect to the new provision in Section 50 of the Codified Basic Agreement, added in the 1983 negotiations, dealing with transportation, lodging and seals for a parent or guardian who is required to travel with a minor to an overnight location. The Producers' proposal on this subject was limited to minors employed under t 'minimum terms* of the Agreement, but the word “minimum' was deleted at the request of the Union. It is understood that th; change does not require a separate negotiation with a parent ;r guardian in the case where the Producer’s agreement for the minor's services includes the manner of travel expenses for tne parent or guardian in such a manner that such expenditures do operate to reduce the minor's compensation below scale.

Re: Reservation of Positions
Dear Ken:
At times during the 1986 negotiations, each party reserved its position with respect to certain issues which were not resolved in those negotiations. For example, both the Producers and the Screen Actors Guild reserved their positions with respect to the application of Sections 5 and 7 of the Television Agreement to "short orders" and of applying amounts paid in excess of scale against amounts due for meal penalties, rest period violations, overtime, etc. The Screen Actors Guild also reserved its position with respect to inclusion in 'Distributor's gross receipts" of the fair market value of all consideration provided to secure Supplemental Market exhibition rights.
The foregoing is not intended, however, to be an exclusive list of issues on which the Producers and the Screen Actors Guild reserved their respective positions. To the extent that one or both parties reserved a position on other issues, such reservations shall be deemed preserved by this letter agreement.

This will confirm that the addition of this provision to the Agreement was not Intended, nor should it be construed, to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the Screen Actors Guild over dialogue replacement work. By the same token, the provision was not intended, nor should it be construed, to expand the jurisdiction of the Screen Actors Guild over dialogue replacement work.

Dear Ken;

During the 1992 negotiations, the parties agreed that rehearsal would not trigger consecutive employment for performers employed on long-form television programs or theatrical motion pictures provided certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the performer be paid for rehearsal at the same rate as for photography.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no implication should be drawn from the parties' agreement on this subject as to the propriety of paying performers for rehearsal and photography at different rates. Both parties have expressly reserved their positions on that issue. The Guild's position is that rehearsal and photogy raphy may not, consistent with the parties' collective bargaining agreement, be paid at different rates, while the Producers' position is that the collective bargaining agreement does not require the same rate of pay for rehearsal and photography and, further, that SAG has waived its position by its past conduct.

Dear Ken; _
During the 1992 negotiations, the Screen Actors Guild and the ANPTP disagreed on the interpretation of Section 39 of the Basic Agreement. The parties agreed to retain Section 39 in the Basic Agreement of 1992 without prejudice to the position of either party as to its interpretation and as to whether that Section can be lawfully interpreted to restrict the Guild's bargaining rights and obligations.
The AHPTP agrees in concept that Section 39 will not be interpreted nor applied to preclude SAG from continuing its past practice of negotiating with independent producers as to various forms of security and liens for the payment of direct compensation, fringe benefits and residuals. The ANPTP likewise agrees in concept that Section 39 will not be interpreted to prevent SAG from refusing to enter into an agreement with an independent producer, the principal(s) of which is (are) also the principal(s) of any former or existin entity which is delinquent in its obligations under any SAG Codified Basic Agreement for wages, fringe benefits or residuals.
SAG and the ANPTP agree that precise language reflecting the foregoing understandings will be drawn up by a joint SAG-AMPTP legal Comittee, following a thorough review of the issues involved. That language will be included in a sideletter to be attached to the Basic Agreement.

Dear Ken:
Reference is made to the parties’ discussions during the 1992 negotiations with respect to puppeteers and the proposal regarding puppeteers which the Screen Actors Guild submitted to the Producers.
Based upon those discussions and that proposal, the parties have agreed as follows:
Puppeteers are covered under the SAG Agreement. The Guild proposal was intended solely to define more precisely the persons who qualify as puppeteers and does not constitute bargaining over coverage. The Guild is willing to defer to Tier 2 the negotiation of terms applicable to different types of puppeteering work, subject to the following:
If the parties fall to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on or before June 30, 1992, the term ’puppeteers* shall continue in the contract without definition. In that event, each party reserves its position with respect to the type of wort which is covered by the tern 'puppeteers.'

Dear Ken:
As part of the recent Tier 3 negotiations which established terms and conditions of employment for stunt coordinators, the Screen Actors Guild and the Producers represented by the AM PTP agreed upon certain new rules for the reuse of stunt footage. One area in which the parties were unable to reach agreement relates to the reuse of stunt footage in commercials which promote a motion picture in conjunction with i different product.
In the course of those discussions, the Producers expressed the view that the reuse of stunt footage in such comercials advertises or exploits the motion picture and, therefore, can be done without negotiation with or payment to the stunt performer(i) appearing therein.
The Screen Actors Guild took the position that such reuses may, under some circumstances, advertise or exploit the motion picture within the meaning of Section 22 of the Codified Basic Agreement or Section 36 of the Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement, but do not invariably do so. Whether or not the reuse so advertises or exploits the motion picture will depend upon all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the reuse in the context of the comercial. In the Guild's view, if the reuse does not so advertise or exploit the motion picture, the Producer is obliged to pay the applicable cooioerclal session fee and residuals.
Because the parties were unable to reach agreement on the appropriate treatment of stunt footage reused in this manner, each of us has agreed to enter into this sideletter for the purpose of reserving our respective positions on this issue. If the foregoing comports with your understanding, please so indicate by executing this sideletter in the space below reserved for your signature.

Dear Ken:
Reference is made to our agreement relating to stunt coordinators. The subject of staffing of stunt coordinators 1$ addressed in our agreement by the following language:
*. . . the addition of the stunt coordinator classification to those covered under the Agreements is not intended, nor shall it be construed, either to require the employment of stunt coordinators under the Agreements in circumstances in which persons other than stunt coordinators are presently or have heretofore performed the functions of stunt coordinators nor to diminish the employment of stunt coordinators by assigning stunt coordinating work to persons in positions in which such work has not customarily been performed."
This sideletter 1$ entered into for the purpose of setting forth the background underlying the parties’ agreement on this subject and providing a context for application of the foregoing language.
During the course of the parties’ discussions on this subject, the Producers refused to agree to a mandatory staffing provision, citing a number of situations in which duties which might be associated with stunt coordinators had been performed by others. By way of example, the Producers pointed out that athletic coaches and instructors (e.g., football and hockey coaches, fencing instructors), horse trainers, race car experts, martial arts instructors and coordinators of aerial sequences, among others, had heretofore been utilized in lieu of stunt coordinators. The Producers also indicated that stunt coordinators had not been utilized for certain stunts in which the stunt performers themselves did whatever coordination work was necessary (e.g., two stunt performers engaged in a fight; stunt performer who falls down, etc.) nor in situations in which a member of the production staff with prior experience in
Sidelettar No. 15 - Page 161
Sideletter No. 15 Page Two
coordinating stunts, such as a Director, Second Unit Director, Unit Production Manager or Assistant Director, was assigned responsibility for coordinating the stunt.
The Producers further stated that they desired to continue their practice of hiring such persons without treating them as stunt coordinators. Tn adopting the above-quoted language, the Guild and the Producers acknowledged such practices and agreed that the Producers would not be required to engage stunt coordinators in situations such as those described in the foregoing examples,

Re: Exclusion of Assistant Choreographers From Definition of "Dancer*' in Schedule J, Section 2 and Schedule X, Part I, Section 3 and Schedule X, Part LISection 1
Dear Ken;
This will confirm our understanding that assistant choreographers are not included within the scope of the following sentence in Section 2 of Schedule J, in Section 3.A.(2) of Schedule X, Part I and in Section 3.A- of Schedule X, Port II, which states:
"Persons engaged to execute the choreographer's dance directions during the development of dance routines of the nature described in the preceding paragraph are dancers within the meaning of this Schedule, whether or not such persons are photographed in the production."
However, it is understood that persons performing the functions described in the aforementioned sentence shall not be designated as "assistant choreographers" for the purpose of evading this provision.
Please signify your concurrence with the foregoing by executing the enclosed extra copy of this letter and returning same to me.

Re:	Dancers/Definition of "Hazardous Activity"
Dear Bob:
During the 2001 negotiations, the Guild proposed to include "knee work" in the definition of "hazardous activity" in Section 6.B of Schedule J of the Codified Basic Agreement. The parties agree that, under certain circumstances, knee work, including rolling, spinning, failing, balancing, hinging, walking, turning and/or performing a choreographed routine on the knees, could meet the definition of "hazardous activity."

Re:	Programs Made for tbe Internet
Dear Bob:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the Screen Actors Guild ("the Guild") and the Producers (collectively "the parties") concerning the application of the 2001 Producer - Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement and Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement to audio-visual entertainment programs made for the Internet or other similar delivery systems ("Internet"). With respect to such programs intended for initial use on the Internet, the parties agree as follows:
Part A - Letter of Adherence
Part A of this Sideletter authorizes a letter of adherence for Producers producing audio-visual entertainment programs made for the Internet of the type that have traditionally been covered under the SAG Codified Basic Agreement or Television Agreement as well as other types of programs made for the Internet.
A Producer, at its option, may execute a letter of adherence to cover any such program or multiple programs made for the Internet, provided that the Producer has first provided to SAG at least sixty (60) days notice of its intention to do so and meets with SAG to discuss terms of the letter of adherence if requested to do so by SAG. Any such letter of adherence shall be binding upon the Guild and the Producer, and shall, at a minimum, require the Producer to make contributions on behalf of performers employed on such program(s) to the Pension Plan and Health Fund at the rates set forth in Section 34 of the 2001 SAG Codified Basic Agreement or in Section 22 of the 2001 SAG Television Agreement. The provisions of Section 2 of the Codified Basic Agreement, "Union Security," also shall apply to any such letter. No other terms of the Codified Basic Agreement or Television Agreement shall apply to the employment of such performer, unless agreed in writing between the Guild and the performer, on the one hand, and the Producer, on the other hand.
Sideletter No. 21 - Page 180

Part B - Notices to SAG
Any Producer who intends to produce a program intended for initial use on the Internet shall provide to SAG at least sixty (60) days notice of its intention to do so and shall meet with SAG to discuss terms and conditions of employment of performers, if requested to do so by SAG. Any Producer who does produce any such program, whether or not the Producer has entered into a letter of adherence or other agreement with SAG, shall provide to SAG information regarding the employment of performers on such program, including, but not limited to, the compensation paid to such performers, the nature of the work performed, and the receipts generated by the exhibition or distribution of any such program.
Part C - Mutual Reservation of Rights
Nothing contained in this Sideletter shall be deemed a waiver of any party’s legal position with respect to the application of this or any prior Codified Basic Agreement or Television Agreement to programs made for the Internet. The parties reserve all of their legal positions with respect to such programs.

Re:	Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via the Internet
Dear Bob:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the Screen Actors Guild ("the Guild") and the Producers (collectively "the parties”) concerning the application of the 2001 Producer - Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement and Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement to the exhibition of covered theatrical motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or afler July I, 1971, and covered television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or afler July 20, 1952, on or by means of the Internet or other similar delivery systems (’’Internet"),
I,	License for Limited Period or Fixed Number of Exhibitions, When the subscriber pays for the program either on a subscription or per-picture basis, and when the payment is in exchange for the right to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or a fixed number of exhibitions, the Producer shall pay to the performer(s) an aggregate sum equal to three and six-tenths percent (3.6%) of the license fee paid by the licensee for the right to exhibit such picture on the Internet,'
When the Producer’s receipts from the licensing of such exhibition are received from an entity which acts as the exhibitor and in which the Producer has a financial interest, the reasonableness of the fee received by the Producer from the licensing of such exhibition
* As bargaining history, this language is based upon the following model: studio licenses to Moviefly the right to transmit the motion picture on the Internet to the viewer who pays Moviefly on a subscription or per-picture basis. Such payment would enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or limited number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Columbfa-TriStar Home Entertainment, licenses to Moviefly the nght to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals shall be based upon 100% of the license fee paid by Moviefly to Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment for such picture.
Sideletter No. 22 - Page 182
Sideletter No. 22
Page Two
shall be determined by the exhibitor’s license fee payments to unrelated entities for comparable motion pictures.
The parties agree that the residuals due to performers under this paragraph I shall be payable in the same manner and to the same extent as applicable to pay television and pay-per-view as provided in the following provisions in the Codified Basic Agreement or Television Agreement, as applicable (subject to conforming changes as necessary):
•	Sections 5.2.E.(4)(d), 5.2.E.(5) and 5.2.E.(7) of the Codified Basic Agreement and Sections 20. (b)(3)d) and 2O.(b)(5) of the Television Agreement (with respect to supplemental markets exhibition of motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after 7/1/52, but prior to 7/21/80) (foreign receipts and non-returnable advances);
•	Section 5.2.B. of the Codified Basic Agreement (allocation among performers);
•	Sections 5.2.G. and 5.2.1. of the Codified Basic Agreement (time of payment, payment requirements and reporting);
•	Section 5,2.H. of the Codified Basic Agreement (gross participation);
•	Sections 6.D., 6.E., 6.F., and 6.G. of the Codified Basic Agreement (transfer and assumption);
•	Sections 6.A., 6.B., 6.C., 6.H., and 6.1. of the Codified Basic Agreement and Section 21 of the Television Agreement (financial responsibility); and
•	Section 5.1. of the Codified Basic Agreement (supplemental markets distribution of motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after 6/30/71 but prior to 7/21/80), to the extent it refers to 5.2.E.(4)(d), 5.2.E.(5), and 5.2.E.(7) of the Codified Basic Agreement and Section 20.1 of the Television Agreement (supplemental markets distribution of programs produced on or after 10/6/80), to the extent it refers to the provisions of 5.2. of the Codified Basic Agreement set forth above.
2. Other Exhibitions, For all other Internet-transmitted exhibitions ("other exhibitions"), including a sale or license of the right to view the motion picture for an unlimited time, the parties acknowledge that the markets for such other exhibitions are evolving, and that the basis for payment of residuals shall be determined at a later time. Accordingly, in the event the AMPTP negotiates a residual formula with the DGA with respect to other exhibitions of covered motion pictures, either: (a) the Guild shall have the right to elect the entire
Sideletter No. 22 - Page 183
Sideletter No. 22
Page Three
agreement reached with the DGA with respect to the licensing of such other exhibitions, and only such entire agreement, but with appropriate equivalent adjustment for performers for provisions peculiar to directors; or (b) alternatively, the Guild may reopen this agreement as to such other exhibitions on or after December 1,2002.
The parties reserve all of their respective legal positions with respect to such other exhibitions.
With respect to theatrical and television motion pictures, the Producer has agreed to a separate payment for this use on the Internet because Internet exhibition is at this time outside the primary market. The Producer reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical or television motion pictures, and that, therefore, no additional payment pursuant hereto should be made with respect to the exhibition of theatrical or television motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) on the Internet. The Guild reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitions are or have become part of the primary market, payment provisions for performers employed on motion pictures so exhibited should be improved.
Sincerely,
ACCEPTED AND AGREED:

Weather-permitting calls are allowable for day performers subject to the ^following limitations and conditions:
A.	Weather-permitting calls to day performers receiving $750 per day or '|less shall not be issued for stages in studios. The Union has heretofore, upon ^request, issued waivers permitting the giving of weather-permitting calls for work ^on certain stages, such as the So-called "Phantom Stage” at Universal City Studios *^where rain, wind or hail rendered sound recording unusable. Similarly, waivers have been granted authorizing weather-permitting calls when caused by fog, wind, ^■rain or hail on uncovered, taipaulin-covered or open structures. It is agreed that
Schedule A
Schedule A
weather-permitting calls within the limits provided by this Agreement may be given to performers on such or similar stages and on open or uncovered structures* where the making of usable sound track is rendered impossible because of rain, J wind or hail, or where usable photography on an uncovered structure is rendered impossible by fog, wind, rain or hail. Disputes which may arise hereunder are subject to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement,
B.	A day performer receiving $750 per day or less shall be paid a half 4 (7i) check upon the cancellation of any weather-permitting call. This check shall 1 entitle the Producer to hold the day performer for not exceeding four (4) hours. •.% The day performer shall receive a half (7i) check for each additional four (4) hours, or portion thereof, during which he is held by the Producer. During this 4 waiting period, the Producer has the privilege of putting day performers into . costumes, rehearsing or making other use of their services. If, however, any . recording or photographing is done, whether still pictures or otherwise, the day fs performer shall be paid the agreed daily wage.
C.	Weather-permitting calls may not be issued to a day performer after the commencement of his photography, and the fact that a weather-permitting calf or calls have been issued before the commencement of photography shall not cause the continuous employment provisions of day performer rules to come into ’ effect. "Photography,*1 as used herein, does not refer to such photographing as is referred to in Section 28 hereof.
26.	SCRIPT LINES
A.	The Producer agrees that all script line parts shall be played by performers hired directly, and not by background actors adjusted on the set, except when a performer has been hired to play the part and for any reason is unavailable^ or unable to portray the part properly.
Except as above provided, no background actor hired as such may be^, employed for script lines on location; and no background actor hired as such be employed for script lines for work at the studio on the same day as the day on ' - which he was employed as a background actor.
Non-script lines are defined as lines which are not pre-planned or preconceived and which are not deliberately omitted for the purpose of evading provisions.
B.	A background actor hired as such may speak non-script lines, in
which case the background actor shall be signed off as a background actor and renployed as a day performer. The performer so adjusted may be closed and ^agned off as a day performer and be re-employed in the same photoplay to perform background actor work, but not in the same part for which he was ^adjusted. If such a person is again adjusted to perform day performer services in a ^different part in the same photoplay, he shall not be entitled to continuous or vconsecutive days of employment between the time when he is first signed off as a performer and the time when he is again adjusted. If a background actor has :been adjusted to perform day performer work, the Producer may retake the scene with a different day performer, without any penalty for failure to recall such background actor. A background actor adjusted for non-script lines shall not be entitled to day performer pay for any day or days before he was adjusted.
C.	The compensation due for the day to a performer hired as a und actor, whether by the day or the week, and adjusted for day performer work, including services as a background actor and as a day performer shall be ^computed as follows:
i
(1)
He shall receive his full day of pay as a background actor.
(2) In addition thereto, he shall receive his full day of pay as a day
^performer.
The Producer shall be entitled to a credit against the sum
.	(3) The Producer shall be entitled to a creon against me sum
Hpayable under (2) of that portion of the sum payable under (1) as represents the Opart of the day from and after the time the performer is signed off as a background factor, computed in units of tenths of an hour.
L	Overtime, if any, shall commence to accrue after the performer so
? ^adjusted has rendered eight (8) hours of work as a day performer.

Schedule A


ToSllustrate the application of the foregoing rule;
A background actor starts work at 9:00 a.m. and works until -10:07 a.m. At 10:07 a.m., he is signed off as a background actor and employed as| > a day performer. He thereafter works seven and one-half (714) hours as a day performer. Under subparagraph (1), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a background actor; under subparagraph (2), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a*(j day performer; under subparagraph (3), the Producer is entitled to a credit of six (6) hours and forty-eight (48) minutes pay at his background actor rate. Assume 4’ the performer's background actor rate is $105.00 per day and his day performer rate is $636.00, the performer would receive $650.75.
27.	STUNT ADJUSTMENT	g
Unless otherwise bargained for at the time of his engagement, a day performer shall receive an adjustment of an additional applicable daily stunt performer's minimum on any day on which he performs a stunt. In no event shall yj the day performer ever receive less than the stunt performer’s day minimum on the day the performer does the stunt. Overtime compensation on such day shall be 4^ based on the performer's aggregate compensation for such day.	i
28.	RETAKES, ADDED SCENES, LOOPING. ETC.
A. As an exception to the consecutive employment requirements of Section 6 hereof, compensation for services in connection with retakes, added scenes, sound track, process shots, transparencies, trick shots, trailers, changes and foreign versions shall be paid to the day performer only for the days on which the performer is actually so employed. If such services are commenced within four (4) months (six (6) months for theatrical motion pictures, pilots or long-form television motion pictures (including multi-part, closed-end series)) after the prior’?’' termination of employment, compensation therefor shall be at the daily rate .f/ < originally agreed upon, except in case of conversion to the weekly basis, in which. latter event the compensation shall be prorated on the weekly rate originally agreed upon.
•i J
Schedule A	&
I
Performer may be recalled to loop (record sound track) after completion of principal photography at one-half (14) of the performer's pro rata laity salary for a four (4) hour looping session. If the session exceeds four (4) Kjtours, a foil day of pro rata salary shall be payable.
Bg	The Producer may bargain with any day performer earning $5,000 or.
Bfaore per day to include qpe (I) prepaid looping day in his compensation. The Bjperformer's employment contract shall contain a separate provision to that effect B^aid a box must be provided next to the prepayment provision for the performer to ^initial to indicate acceptance.
EB. Close-ups
The Union will freely grant waivers of continuous employment for ^the making of close-ups made after the completion of the Director's first rough cut KVof the photoplay, so that the performer shall be paid only for the day or days upon ?which he renders such services.

P
m (2)	because of any failure of such performer to disclose his other
| ^engagements at the time of accepting any engagement, or
j(3) when, as an accommodation to such performer, such performer is ^permitted to work currently in two pictures,
it is agreed as follows: For any day or days on which such performer renders his services for the Producer of the picture in which he has first rendered his service, fhe shall receive compensation from such first Producer. For any day or days on r %
Schedule A

which such performer renders services for the Producer of the second picture in £ which he has rendered his services, he shall be compensated by the Producer of such second picture. For any day or days on which the performer does not render^
. his services either for the first Producer or for the second Producer, he shall be • compensated by the second Producer, unless the first and second Producers agree & between themselves (and notice thereof is given to the performer) that	<<
compensation for such additional day or days shall be paid by the first Producer. The compensation to be paid by the first Producer shall be paid at the rate specified in the performer's contract with the first Producer, and the compensation®-to be paid by the second Producer shall be at the rate specified in the performer's Iv, contract with the second Producer; provided, however, that if the rate paid by the first Producer is less than the rate specified in the performer's contract with the . $ second Producer, the difference shall be paid by the second Producer and, provided further, that for any day or days on which the performer does not render services either for the first or for the second Producer, he shall be compensated at^ the rate of compensation which is the higher of the two. This paragraph does not B; affect such performer’s right to receive compensation from both Producers when the performer, while employed by one Producer, makes retakes, added scenes, etc.X, for the other Producer after the expiration of his term of employment with such other Producer, in any case in which the performer is otherwise entitled thereto. Nothing in this paragraph contained shah be deemed or construed in any way to limit or prejudice any right or remedy of any Producer, either with respect to any of the contingencies hereinbefore specified or otherwise.

E number of synchronized lines for a single character, for which Producer shall pay | performer the applicable minimum compensation.
(2)	Producer shall not be obligated to engage performers employed

To illustrate the foregoing, a performer, a resident of Los Angeles, is temporarily in San Francisco.

CONTRACT PERFORMERS WHOSE WEEKLY GUARANTEED SALARY IS $4,400 OR LESS PER WEEK FOR TELEVISION MOTION ^PICTURES OR WHOSE WEEKLY GUARANTEED SALARY IS $5,500 OR J LESS PER WEEK FOR THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES


A contract performer is a performer employed under a contract for ^television motion pictures or theatrical motion pictures or both (in which latter [case such contracts are sometimes referred to as "combination term contracts"), Which contract is for a term of at least ten (10) out of thirteen (13) weeks and finch may not specify any role, picture or series, unless otherwise requested by .■the performer and approved by the Union. The Union agrees it will liberally grant waivers in the event of such request. The Producer and the performer may agree '/on any overall term of hiring in excess of ten (10) guaranteed weeks, provided that the guaranteed number of weeks is in the same proportion to the overall period as ’ten (10) out of thirteen (13)."
A CLASSIFICATIONS OF CONTRACT PERFORMERS - TERM t CONTRACT________________________________________
I
•& A. When a performer is employed for two (2) or more pictures per year tor other specified period (hereinafter referred to as the "employment period") and jhe contract is exclusive with respect to his services in the production of motion pictures, the performer shall be classified, for the purpose of this Agreement, as a /pterin contract performer" and his classification as a term contract performer with ■-respect to "hours" shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
The total guaranteed' compensation of the performer shall be divided ■ 4>y the proportionate number of weeks in the employment period that forty (40) .Shears to fifty-two (52). For example: if the employment period is one year, the ^guaranteed compensation shall be divided by forty (40) weeks; if the employment
-365 -
Schedule E
-364-
Schedulc E
period is six (6) months, the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by twenty^ (20) weeks, etc. If the resulting figure reflects a compensation of more than $4,400 per week for television motion pictures or more than $5,500 per week far| theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule F shall apply to the employment. If the resulting figure is $4,400 per week or less for television motion pictures or $5,500 per week or less for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule E shall apply to the employment.
When a performer who, under the above formula, has been classified so as to receive the provisions of Schedule E receives compensation in addition to his minimum guaranteed compensation, which additional compensation, when “j added to his total minimum guaranteed compensation and divided by the said proportionate number of weeks in the employment period, would raise the performer above the $4,400 breaking point for television motion pictures or above^ the $5,500 breaking point for theatrical motion pictures, then such performer, from that time forward, shall receive the provisions of Schedule F instead of Schedule E for the balance of the employment period in question. The so-called "breaking point" for a performer whose employment period is one (1) year shall $ $ 100,000; for an employment period of six (6) months, $50,000; for an employment period of three (3) months, $25,000, etc.
B.	The employment period of ten (10) out of thirteen (13) weeks may n6t£

DEFINITIONS
A. Contract-Performer
is
For the purpose of this Schedule F, a contract performer is a

performer employed under a contract at a salary in excess of $4,400 per week for i television motion pictures or in excess of $5,500 per week for theatrical motion pictures or both (in which latter case such contracts are sometimes referred to asj 1 "combination term contracts"), which contract is for a term of at least ten (10) out | j of thirteen (13) weeks and which may not specify any role, picture or series, unless^
otherwise requested by the performer and approved by the Union. The Union agrees it will liberally grant waivers in the event of such request. The Producer and the performer may agree on any overall term of hiring in excess of ten (10) guaranteed weeks, provided that the guaranteed number of weeks is in the same proportion to the overall period as "ten (10) out of thirteen (13)."


-415-
Schedule F
E	When a performer is employed for two (2) or more pictures per year
| or other specified period (hereinafter referred to as the "employment period") and the contract is exclusive with respect to his services in the production of motion g pictures, the performer shall be classified, for the purpose of this Agreement, as a H "contract performer" and his classification as a contract performer with respect to B "hours" shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
I’	The total guaranteed compensation of the performer shall be divided
1 by the proportionate number of weeks in the employment period that forty (40) K bears to fifty-two (52). For example: If the employment period is one (1) year, K the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by forty (40) weeks; if the B employment period is six (6) months, the guaranteed compensation shall be B divided by twenty (20) weeks, etc. If the resulting figure reflects a compensation E of more than $4,400 per week for television motion pictures or more than $5,500 per week for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule F shall apply to the employment. If the resulting figure is $4,400 or less per week for television jr motion pictures or $5,500 or less per week for theatrical motion pictures, the. K provisions of Schedule E shall apply to the employment.
[ft
ffi'.	When a performer who, under the above formula, has been classified
[■/so as to receive the provisions of Schedule E receives compensation in addition to his minimum guaranteed compensation, which additional compensation when
B added to his total minimum guaranteed compensation and divided by the said proportionate number of weeks in the employment period would raise the
H performer above the $4,400 breaking point for television motion pictures or above O the $5,500 breaking point for theatrical motion pictures, then such performer, front that time forward, shall receive the provisions of Schedule F instead of Schedule E for the balance of the employment period in question. The so-called
I "breaking point" for a performer whose employment period is one (1) year shall be h{.$100,000; for an employment period of six (6) months, $50,000; for an employment period of three (3) months, $25,000, etc.

WAIVERS
B.	Crowd Work
A. If a Producer requests a waiver affecting background actors, the Union, if it believes that the Producer is entitled thereto, will issue the waiver, . X without the imposition of any. conditions, which waiver, in the absence of | misstatement or concealment of the facts, will be final. If the Union believes that. the Producer is not entitled to such final waiver, it shall issue a reviewable waiver (which is equivalent to a refusal of a waiver), or it may issue a conditional waiver : | wherein it will designate the conditions upon which it is willing to have the a Producer proceed. Producer may either accept such conditions or refuse to accept.. f the same. If a conditional waiver be issued and the Producer rejects the conditions f thereof, or if the Union issues a reviewable waiver as aforesaid, the Producer may f nevertheless proceed as though a final waiver had been issued. If the Producer . | shall proceed without first obtaining a final waiver or without complying with the . | conditional waiver, it shall notify the Union in writing to that effect within a i reasonable time thereafter, and the Union, within twenty (20) days after receipt of i
such written notice, shall have the right to invoke the grievance procedure as provided in Section 57 herein, which determination shall be made as to whether a final waiver should have been given or whether the Union was justified in refusing the same or in imposing conditions. If it finds in favor of the Union, it shall determine the remedy to which the Union is entitled and make an award accordingly. The Producer, if it so desires, may refer to the said grievance procedure of Section 56 at any time (including prior to photographing) any question with regard to the Union's refusal to issue a waiver or with reference to any conditions imposed or sought to be imposed by the Union in connection with the issuance of any waiver, and the decision reached in such grievance procedure with respect to such matters shall be final. All waivers shall be requested as long as reasonably possible before desired and shall be acted upon promptly by the Union. If the Union shall fail to do so, the Producer may proceed in a like manner as though the Union had issued a reviewable waiver, so notifying the Union in writing and with the same effect as in the case of a reviewable waiver. The application for a waiver by any Producer shall not be deemed an admission that the Producer cannot proceed without obtaining such waiver, nor shall the issuance by the Union in any instance of a waiver be an admission that the Producer is entitled to such a waiver.

Crowd work may be performed by persons who do not possess the required skill, training and experience of registered background actors, under the j conditions and restrictions hereinafter provided. Upon specific request of the . Producer or its hiring agency, the Union will grant an automatic waiver to employ ' or use any number of such non-registered persons to perform crowd work in a » particular photoplay, production or episode of a series on a particular day, ; provided that the Producer employs at least the following required minimum r number of registered background actors for work in that photoplay, production or ; episode of a series on that day:

Re:	Policy on Counting "No Shows” Toward Number of "Covered"
E^tra Performer
Dear John:
Reference is made.to the provisions of Section I.D. of Schedule X, Part II, which limits the number of "covered" extra performers on each call.
This will confirm that the practice of the Producers has been to include those registered extra performers who accept a call for work but who fail to report (f.e., "no-shows") in the count for purposes of determining if the applicable numerical limit has been reached. This will confirm that in changing the "Scope of Agreement" provisions during the 1998 negotiations, the parties did not intend to change the practice with regard to counting "no-shows" toward the applicable numerical limit of "covered" extra performers.
