PREAMBLE
Whereas, the Executive Branch of the State of Maine (hereinafter referred to as "State" or "employer*) and the Maine State Employees Association (hereinafter referred to as "MSEA") desire to establish a constructive, cooperative and harmonious relationship; to avoid any interruption or interference with the operations of the employer; to promote effective service and quality of work life towards the accomplishment of the missions of the State; and to establish an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences;
Therefore, this Agreement by and between the parties is entered into as of July 1,1999.
1
ARTICLE 1.	UNION RECOGNITION
Pursuant to voluntary recognition on June 9, 1977, the State recognizes the Maine State Employees Association (MSEA) as the sole and exclusive representative for the purpose of representation and negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and other conditions of employment for all employees included in the Law Enforcement Bargaining Unit.
In the event of a dispute between the parties as to future inclusions or exclusions from the unit resulting from the establishment of new or changed classifications or titles, either party to this Agreement may apply to the Maine Labor Relations Board for resolution of the dispute.
Employees who are employed on a seasonal basis, i.e., for regularly recurring seasonal periods of three (3) months or more, shall be covered by the provisions of this Agreement upon the completion of six (6) months employment, subject to any special provisions relating to their employment. In order to qualify, such six (6) months must be worked in not more than three (3) consecutive years and only time in pay status during such seasons shall count. Employment time of persons outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment to a seasonal position, and employment time of persons holding a seasonal intermittent position shall not count towards the completion of such six (6) months.
Part-time employees will be covered by the provisions of this Agreement after completion of six (6) months of service except for the provision for dismissal for just cause. The just cause provision for dismissal shall apply after completion of 1,040 compensated hours exclusive of overtime hours. All benefits provided to part-time employees shall be prorated to the extent required by State law.
Temporary, seasonal and on-call employees, excluded by law from the bargaining unit, include project employees, seasonal employees not covered by the preceding paragraphs, persons from outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment, and intermittent employees. Project employees are employees appointed to a project position which is restricted to a planned work program to be completed within a specified period of time and which is not regularly recurring. Intermittent employees are employees who are appointed for a period of time on a sporadic basis and who work not more than one thousand forty
2
(1,040) hours in any consecutive twelve (12) month period beginning with the date of hire or anniversary of date of hire.
Any employee designated as intermittent, who works in excess of the limits set out above and who works more than 1,040 regularly scheduled hours during the period since appointment as an intermittent employee without a break in service due to resignation or dismissal shall be covered by the terms of this Agreement. The sporadic periods such an employee is not in pay status because of the sporadic nature of the position shall not be considered to be a break in service. Where a legislative position count permits, such employee shall be placed in a permanent or limited period full-time or part-time position as appropriate, provided that he or she is eligible for appointment. If necessary, the employee may reopen the appropriate register to establish eligibility.
Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as removing any rights or benefits of temporary, intermittent, project or seasonal employees provided under Title 5, MRSA, Sections 553-A and 559, Public Law 667,1978, or any other provision of law or rule.
ARTICLE 2.	ACCESS TO EMPLOYEES
MSEA shall have access to employees covered by this Agreement to carry out its legal responsibilities as a bargaining agent as provided for in this Article.
MSEA's representatives will be granted reasonable access to employees during employees' working hours for the purpose of investigating and processing grievances and for the purposes of administering this Agreement. Such access will be subject to the representative providing the appropriate State representative with advanced notice of the visit. Such access will not disrupt State operations or violate agency security procedures. If access needs to be temporarily delayed for special reasons, those reasons shall be explained to the MSEA representative.
Any MSEA representative may have access to employees in this unit for the purpose of explaining MSEA programs and benefits during employees’ non-working time, e.g., breaks, lunch periods and after hours, provided such access does not interfere with State operations. Such access shall be to non-work areas.
3
ARTICLE 3.	ACTING CAPACITY
1.	Temporary Assignments
When an employee is assigned temporarily by his/her appointing authority to a job for which he/she is qualified in a higher pay grade for a period of five (5) days or his/her regular workweek, whichever is less, the employee shall be paid retroactively from the initial date of the temporary transfer for the duration of the temporary assignment. The employee shall be paid as if he/she had been promoted during such assignment. In no event may an employee acquire any status in a higher classification as a result of his/her temporary assignment. Acting capacity assignments shall not be made on an arbitrary or capricious basis. Employees shall not be rotated in acting capacity in an arbitrary or capricious manner in order to avoid payment of acting capacity pay.
This Article shall not be used in lieu of the proper processing of any request for reclassification or reallocation of a position pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Reclassifications Article, or the filling of a vacancy pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Seniority Article.
2.	Seasonal Employees - Off Season Assignments
A seasonal employee who accepts a temporary or acting capacity assignment during his or her off season shall be eligible to accrue vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits upon appointment to the temporary or acting capacity assignment. Vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits accrued in an employee’s regular seasonal position shall not overlap into benefits acciued in the temporary or acting capacity assignment for the same period of time. Full-time seasonal employees shall accrue no more than eight (8) hours of sick leave in any one month, pro-rated for part-time employees.
ARTICLE 4.	APPROVAL OF LEGISLATURE
The parties hereto agree to jointly support any legislative action necessary for implementation of any provision of this Agreement. If the
4
Legislature rejects any provision submitted to it, the entire Agreement shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.
ARTICLE 5.	BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
Each employee covered by this Agreement shall be allowed up to five (5) days leave with pay, for absence resulting from the death of a spouse or significant other, as defined in the Sick Leave Article, who is living in the same household with the employee, child, stepchild, parent or stepparent and up to three (3) days of leave with full pay for absences resulting from the death of other members of the employee's immediate family, as defined in the Sick Leave Article.
ARTICLE 6.	BULLETIN BOARDS
The State shall continue to provide present bulletin board space for the use of MSEA at each work location where bulletin boards are presently provided for the purpose of posting bulletins, notices and other materials in conformance with this Article. The posting of any MSEA materials shall be restricted to such bulletin board space only except that, in each work location where bulletin board space is not provided for MSEA, the State shall designate an appropriate alternative space where such materials may be posted.
In no instance may MSEA post any material which is profane, obscene or defamatory to the State, its representatives or any individual, or which constitutes campaign material between competing employee organizations if it is determined that the posting of such material would violate any obligation of the State for neutrality. MSEA is solely responsible for the accuracy and ethical standards of any material posted pursuant to this Article. The State retains the right to remove any materials in violation of this Article.
All posted MSEA materials shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Association or stamped with an official MSEA logo.

7
B.	Salary Schedules Adjustment
1.	Salary schedules shall be modified on January 1, 2001, by eliminating the current Step 1 in each pay range in the salary schedules and renumbering the remaining steps such that the current Step 2 becomes the new Step 1, the current Step 3 becomes the new Step 2, and so forth. A new step shall be added at the end of each salary range that shall be four percent (4%) greater than the current highest step. Effective with the start of the pay week closest to January 1, 2001, employees shall be compensated at the new rates assigned their range and step in the modified salary schedules.
C.	Salary Schedule Progression
Employees shall progress from step to step in salary grade on the basis of satisfactory job performance based upon established standards of performance.

In agencies where such appeal procedures do not fit, the parties shall establish additional procedures in the manner established by the predecessor Agreement. A decision of an Agency Appeals Board shall be final and binding, subject to appeal to the Director of Human Resources on the following grounds only: that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, or that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon erroneous application of performance standards.
8
D.	Non-Standard Workweek
1.	Classifications listed in Section 3 which meet the following criteria shall be designated as non-standard:
(a)	Positions in a classification have been determined by the Bureau of Human Resources to be exempt for overtime compensation from the Fair Labor Standards Act;

(c)	Employees' workweek are irregular and work hours cannot be scheduled or determined except by the employee.
2.

E.	Call Out
When non-standard law enforcement employees are called to work on any of the scheduled days off they shall be granted one and one-half (I’/z) hours of compensating time for each hour worked. In lieu of compensating time, upon mutual agreement, employees may be paid one and one-half (1%) their base hourly rate for each hour worked. Unless the employees are to receive pay rather than compensating time, the compensatory time shall be scheduled as soon as practicable and ordinarily will be within thirty (30) days of the day worked unless on an otherwise mutually agreed upon later day, except that the thirty (30) day period may be extended because of seasonal high workload in the agency in which the 9
employee is employed. If such compensating time off is not granted within six (6) months of the date the employee was scheduled to work his/her day off, the employee shall be paid in lieu of compensating time off.
F.	Overtime

The above provisions shall apply to full-time employees working alternative compressed workweeks but shall not include other alternative work schedules such as flextime schedules, etc., or part-time employees who shall be eligible for overtime after forty (40) hours of actual work in any week. In lieu of premium pay employees may, upon mutual agreement, take compensating time at the rate of one and one-half (1 '/?) hours of compensating time for each hour of overtime worked.
2.	Employees in pay ranges 21 and above who, on September 3, 1984 were receiving some form of overtime compensation, shall continue to do so until they vacate their present positions. This shall not apply to employees in the Office of Energy Resources and Community Services. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the State's policy with respect to special exceptions which have been made or which are made in the future under that policy, will continue.
3.	Employees in pay ranges 22 and above who do not receive any form of overtime compensation shall receive two (2) personal leave days per year with pay, as of January 1 of each year. Employees who first become eligible for personal leave days under this Article on or after July 1 of a calendar year shall receive only one (1) day for the year, instead of two (2). Except where operational needs require otherwise, these employees shall be entitled to take these personal leave days at times of their choice. These personal leave days shall not be carried forward or accrued from year to year unless the employee is denied his/her personal leave day because of operational needs.
10
4.	Time during which an employee is excused from work with pay under the Holidays Article, shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.

H.	Double Shift Premium
An employee required to work two (2) shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period will be paid an additional four dollars ($4.00) for the week. This provision does not apply to employees who voluntarily work such shifts for their own convenience. The State retains the right to establish schedules which minimize the payment of the premiums provided under this provision.
I.	Divers'Stipend

A.	Definition and General
1.	Seniority for the purposes described herein is defined as continuous employment, since the last date of hire into a status-granting position. Employees shall attain seniority upon completion of their initial probationary period retroactive to the date of initial hire.
2.	Seniority shall be broken only as provided in paragraph 4 of this Section. An employee shall continue to accrue seniority during any period while he/she is on layoff and subject to the recall provisions of this Article, during military leave, leaves occasioned by incapacity for work and during any period of an authorized leave of absence except those pursuant to the Unpaid Personal Leaves of Absence Article and voluntary cost savings.
51
3.	Lists of employees by seniority in their current classifications within an organizational unit shall be posted on the appropriate State bulletin boards as soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement and shall be provided to MSEA simultaneously. These lists shall be updated from time to time as necessary.
4.	An employee shall lose his/her seniority if he/she:
(a)	voluntarily resigns;
(b)	is discharged for just cause;
(c)	is laid off and not recalled for work within three (3) years from the date of layoff;
(d)	fails to return to work or supply a satisfactory reason for not reporting within five (5) workdays of being recalled to work from layoff. Written notice of recall shall be sent by regular mail to the employee's last known address.
5.	Layoffs and recalls to work for a period of three (3) working days or less are temporary and not subject to the provisions of this Article.
B.	Layoffs
When an appointing authority determines that a reduction in force is necessary, implementation of that reduction in force will proceed as follows:
(1)	The appointing authority determines which positions, in each organizational unit and unit division, are to be abolished or funding eliminated.
(2)	The least senior employee(s) in the affected classification and unit division will be laid off. More senior employees who occupy positions that are abolished or for which funding is eliminated will be reassigned to vacancies created by these layoffs or to other available vacancies in the class and unit division. These employees will be offered their choice of vacancies into which they may be reassigned in order of seniority, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the position they select.
(3)	If no option exists in (2), in lieu of layoff a displaced employee may accept, in order of seniority, reassignment to an available vacant position in his or her last previously held classification, regardless
52
of changes to range, title, and/or bargaining unit of the classification since the employee left the classification, in the same unit division, provided the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the position.
(4)	If no option exists in (3) above, in lieu of layoff a displaced employee may displace, in order of seniority, the least senior employee in his or her last previously held classification, regardless of changes to range, title, and/or bargaining unit of the classification, since the employee left the classification, in the same unit division, provided he or she has greater seniority than the employee being displaced and is qualified to perform the duties of the position. The employee may also accept reassignment, in order of seniority, to an available vacancy in classifications that are lower related to the employee's current classification in the same unit division, provided the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the position.
Any employee displaced pursuant to this provision shall have like reassignment and displacement rights.
No classified employee may displace any unclassified employee. No unclassified employee may displace any classified employee except to the classification in the other service that was the last previously held.
The State and MSEA shall negotiate to establish appropriate organizational units and unit divisions. Within three (3) months of the implementation of this agreement all organizational units and unit divisions shall be reviewed on a departmental basis. Thereafter, either party may request a review of an organizational unit or unit division on a departmental basis. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to appropriate organizational units and unit divisions either party may submit the dispute at any time thereafter for a binding determination to a qualified arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties or selected through the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and procedures of that Association.
No employee other than a permanent employee, including permanent seasonal employees, shall be used to perform work in a class in the unit division while a permanent employee who is qualified to do the work is on layoff unless the laid off employee refuses the work.
53
C.	Notice of Layoff/Reassignment/Displacement
Employees to be affected by pending layoff, reassignment, or displacement shall be given written notice as soon as practicable but at least five (5) workdays before the effective date of the layoff/reassignment, or displacement. Employees affected by layoff/reassignment/displacement shall be required to reply in writing within three (3) workdays of notice of layoff as to their decisions on layoff and displacement rights. Employees subject to actual layoff and not displacing other employees shall be entitled to notice of at least ten (10) workdays before layoff. Copies of any notices from the State to employees under this provision shall be given simultaneously to MSEA.
D.	Recalls
A recall register shall be established for each class by organizational unit or unit division, as appropriate, from which any employee has been laid off, transferred or demoted in lieu of layoff. An employee who is notified of layoff will be placed on the recall register, immediately upon receipt of written notice to the Bureau of Human Resources from the employee in the manner prescribed by the Bureau, for the class from which he or she was laid off and, when applicable, his or her last previously held classification. Any vacancy occurring in that class, or the class last previously held shall be offered first to the employee on the recall register. Recalls to work shall be made as follows:
(1)	To the most senior employee in the unit division who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(2)	To the most senior employee in the organizational unit who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(3)	To the most senior employee statewide who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position.

E.	Other Vacancies
An employee laid off or about to be laid off may open any employment register for which he/she is eligible for the purpose of establishing qualifications for any State position.

Such probationary period may be extended for just cause for an additional six (6) months. During such period the employee may be removed from the position promoted to for failure to fulfill the duties of the position. In such case he/she shall be returned to his/her former position if the employee so desires.

Employees accepting a job offer must do so within five (5) business days from that job offer. An employee shall be entitled to refuse four (4) appointments from a register before being removed from the register.
Employees in a department or agency who are in the same classification or on a register for that classification who bid for transfer into a vacancy in the department or agency shall be offered the opportunity to interview for such vacancy.

Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated in weekly increments. Any time worked within a given week shall be recognized as a full week.
57
J.	Part-Time Employees
Separate track seniority systems for layoff, reassignment, displacement and recall purposes shall be implemented for full-time and part-time employees. Full-time employees will only be given options in full-time positions. Part-time employees will only be given options in part-time positions.
Full-time positions shall be defined as any position regularly scheduled for forty (40) or more hours per week.

parties agree to use their best efforts to contest any such loss of federal funds which may be threatened.
ARTICLE 56.	SHIFT ASSIGNMENTS
When an opening occurs in a shift assignment in an appropriate work group at a location, preference shall be given to employees within the classification who possess the training, ability and any required special qualifications to perform the work required, on the basis of seniority.
