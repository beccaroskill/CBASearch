(a)	all employees who have been registered with and dispatched by the employment office of the Union and employed by a Contractor party to this Agreement as a Joumeyperson.
(b)	all employees who qualify as Joumeyperson through participation in the Joint Apprenticeship Training Program, or who pass the basic qualification examination for Joumeyperson as hereinafter provided, and
(c)	all persons employed or seeking employment upon the work covered by this Agreement who have qualified as Joumeyperson by reason of employment elsewhere in the trades covered hereby.

B.	All employees and applicants for employment who as of the date of execution of this Agreement have previously been registered and dispatched by the Union and employed by a Contractor party to this Agreement shall be assigned to the classifications in which they were last so dispatched and employed. New applicants for employment who have not previously been so registered, dispatched, and employed shall be required to make out applications for employment showing their qualifications and experience before being permitted to register. They shall be assigned classifications based strictly upon the basis of the information disclosed in their applications, and they shall be permitted to register only in such classifications.
C.	All classifications shall be determined in the first instance by the Union Dispatcher as provided in Paragraph A. hereof. Any employee or applicant for employment who is dissatisfied with the classification so assigned to him/her may apply to the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee in writing for examination and review of his/her classification at its next regular meeting. Said employee or applicant shall remain in the previously-determined classification until such time he has been reclassified by the Committee.
D.	Upon written request of the Union, any Contractor party to this Agreement or of the Association, an employee or applicant for employment must submit to an examination to be scheduled by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee. The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall be empowered upon the basis of such examination to reclassify the employee or applicant for employment or to certify him/her as being unqualified for employment upon phase or phases of the work of his/her particular craft. The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall also be empowered to require any employee whose name has been referred to it under this Exhibit to enroll in the training program for training in any or all phases of the trade in which he/she is found and certified as being unqualified.
E.	Whenever any employee whose name has been referred to the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee under this Exhibit, fails to report for examination, or fails to obey any order of the Committee to submit to training in any phase or phases of the work of his/her particular craft in which it has found and certified him/her to be unqualified for employment, the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee may notify the employment office of the Union and upon receipt of such notice the employment office shall bar the employee from registering for employment until such time it has been notified that he/she has complied. Similarly, whenever the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee has found that any employee or applicant for employment is unqualified in any phase or phases of the trades covered hereunder, it may certify him/her to the employment office of the Union as being so unqualified and the employee or applicant for employment shall not be entitled to be dispatched for employment to any Contractor in such phase or phases of work.

All proceedings of the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall be conducted fairly and impartially and without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical handicap, or for being a disabled veteran or a veteran of the Vietnam Era, or to membership or non-membership in the Union or any other labor organization.
G.	The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall formulate and adopt uniform Standards for selection, examination, and classification of all employees and applicants for employment referred to it. Said Standards shall comply with all requirements of Hawaii and Federal laws.
H.	Any employee or applicant for employment who is aggrieved by the application of any of the provisions of this Exhibit may submit his/her grievance to the Union Executive Board.

3.	Place applicants determined to be qualified into any apprenticeship openings then available.

5.	Time spent in the supplementary program must count the same as time in the regular apprenticeship program for attaining craft status.

7.	Women who never transfer from the supplementary program will attain craft status upon completion of the same time period as required under the regular program, and
8.	Apprentice wages increased based upon total time spent, regardless of whether it is in the regular or supplementary program or a combination of both.

C.	Efforts should be made to recruit supplementary apprentices from work orientation, preparatory training, and/or CETA programs.

2.	Any employee who is lawfully using a controlled substance at the workplace, i.e., taking prescription drugs in accordance with a doctor’s order, while not subject to disciplinary action, may nevertheless be required to leave the workplace, if consumption of that medication presents a safety hazard or prevents him from being able to properly perform his work.

(2)	Employee Option 2 - A first-offense employee who does not choose to enroll in a substance abuse assistance or rehabilitation program shall be suspended for the length of time it takes to obtain a negative reading from a subsequent drug or alcohol test but in any case, no less than a two [2)-week suspension. The employee must make arrangements with his or her Company prior to undergoing drug or alcohol retesting.
