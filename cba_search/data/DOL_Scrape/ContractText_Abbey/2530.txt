It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its effective date shall, on the sixtieth (60th) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.

For the purpose of this Article 1, Section 1.2, the execution date of this Agreement shall be considered its effective date.
1.3.1	The Employer agrees to deduct Union dues and initiation fees from the wages of employees in the bargaining unit who voluntarily provide the Employer with a written authorization for such deductions.

ARTICLE 4	- HOURS OF WORK
4.1	.1 Work schedules shall be posted at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of a work period. The employee may voluntarily agree to changes in work schedules.

Employer shall not change the shift of any employee in an arbitrary and capricious manner without the consent of any such employee.
4.1	.2 Any open shift/hours known in advance are posted near the schedules for seven (7) days. The available shift/hours will be awarded to the qualified staff person with the most seniority responding to the posting within the seven (7) days time frame, providing the added shift/hours do not create overtime obligations. If no qualified staff is interested in picking up the shifts/hours without involving overtime, the shift/hours will be awarded to the qualified person with the most seniority, knowing that overtime will be paid.

4.1	.4 In emergency situations or situations where the employer has little or no advanced notice of the shift vacancy the employer may first offer the hours to on premise employees, by seniority.
4.2	Employees shall normally be scheduled so that they shall not be required to work more than two (2) weekends out of four (4), except in cases of emergency or unavoidable situations where the application of this principle would have the effect of depriving the patients or residents of needed care or by mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, or when the employee is scheduled as a weekend only employee.
Employees who miss their regularly scheduled weekend due to a work related injury (uncontested) will not be required to make up the weekend missed.
4.3	The standard shift shall be eight and one quarter (8 1/4) hours in length, to allow for overlap between shifts, and the giving of report. The standard shift will consist of seven hours and forty five minutes (7:45) of paid work time and a 30 minute unpaid meal period. Schedules shall provide employees with a minimum of eight (8) hours between scheduled shifts, except in cases of emergency, or by mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, or where such break time cannot be given as a result of the use of rotating schedules.
4.4	Employees shall not be scheduled to work more than seven (7) consecutive days unless overtime is paid for work in excess of such seven (7) consecutive days. If an employee

3

4.5	An employee reporting for work at his regular scheduled starting time who has not been previously notified not to report for work shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours work that day or four (4) hours straight time pay in lieu thereof.

4.6	Employees who are called in for work outside their scheduled shifts shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours’ pay or actual hours worked, whichever is greater, at the rate of their regular position or the rate of the position they are called in to fill, whichever is greater. Meetings and training shall be paid at the actual hours of time utilized or one (1) hour, whichever is greater.
4.7	Overtime pay shall be one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay. All employees shall be paid overtime for all hours worked over eight (8) hours per day, or forty eight (48) hours in a work week, or eighty (80) hours in a two (2) week pay period. Overtime payments shall not be pyramided. A two (2) week pay period shall begin with the start of a shift on a specified day and time and end with the close of the shift commencing at a specified day and time two (2) weeks or fourteen (14) days later.
Overtime worked on any one day shall be computed based on the hourly rate of pay the employee received on that day.
4.8	Employees working the day shift shall be required whenever reasonably possible to give Employer two (2) hours’ notice if they are unable to report for work.

If no employee in the department bids, all employees in the bargaining unit, if qualified, shall have first opportunity to bid for the position, with seniority prevailing. Bids shall be made in writing to the Employer before the expiration of the seven (7) day posting period. Such employee who exercises their option and is selected shall be granted a reasonable length of time to achieve proficiency in the position. Employees may take on additional hours provided that: 1) Such employees are not regularly scheduled so as to create over-time payment obligations under Article 4, Section G of this Agreement and 2) Such employees must take all available hours or arrangements must be made so that all available hours are taken.
On call employees shall have the right to apply for a full-time, part-time or weekend only, opening and shall be considered for the job ahead of a non-employee, but not a part-time or weekend only employee.

ARTICLE 11	- PAID DISABILITY LEAVE - PPL (EXTENDED SICK)
11.1	Definition: Paid Disability Leave (PDL) is intended to function as a short term disability plan. PDL may be used after the employee has missed three (3) consecutive days of work as the result of an employee illness/disability or the illness/disability of the employee’s dependent children.
11.2	Accrual: PDL may be accrued up to forty-eight (48) hours per year and is based upon hours worked. PDL will accrue at the rate of .023077 for each hour worked.

11.3	PDL Use: The first three (3) days of an illness/disability must be paid from the employee’s PTO account (if available) prior to accessing PDL. Should an employee be absent from work for more than three (3) consecutive work days due to an illness/disability or the illness/disability of the employee’s dependent child or spouse, a Time Off Request form needs to be completed by the employee or the employee’s manager. Should an employee exhaust their PDL account, he/she must return to the use of PTO for the illness/disability to make them whole. The Employer may request a physician certification for the payout of PDL. The Employer may request a physician return to work certification following an employee illness/disability when the use of PDL is involved.
11.4	Cash Out: No cash out of PDL.
