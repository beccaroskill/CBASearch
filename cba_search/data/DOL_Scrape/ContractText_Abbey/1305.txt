ARTICLE III UNION SECURITY
The Association hereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all employees of the Employer performing any type of work which has historically and traditionally been performed by members of the Union in the geographical area of this Agreement.
It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement, who are members of the Union in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement, shall remain members in good standing and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on or after the eighth day following the effective date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
