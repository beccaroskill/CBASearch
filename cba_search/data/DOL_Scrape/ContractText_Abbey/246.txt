Grievanceprocedure
(5.1)	A grievance is a claim of an employee or the Union that his or their rights including interpretation, application or alleged violation of any provisions ofthis Agreement, working conditions not covered by this Agreement, appended Letters or Memorandums of Agreement or appropriate Local Agreement, have been violated.
(5.2)	It is mutually desired that grievances be satisfactorily settled as quickly as possible. The parties agree that frivolous and/or repetitive grievances shall not be filed. Information concerning repetitive grievances provided to supervisors will also be provided to appropriate Union representatives.
If (he Company refuses to accept a grievance which il deems to be frivolous and/or repetitive, the appropriate Committeeman may request an explanation from the business unit Labor Relations Manager concerning the
I
13
reason(s) for such determination. If, following such explanation, the Committeeman still believes that such grievance is not frivolous or repetitive, the grievance -	may be presented, in writing, directly to theF inal Step of
the local grievance procedure.
The filingand processing of multiple grievances on the same issue or incident by employees or Uni on Representatives does not facilitate the resolution of grievances nor fulfill the intent ofSection4.2or Section 16.5 ofthis Agreement. In order to minimize duplication of effortby Union Representatives, and to expedite the processing of grievances when more than one employee is aggrieved over the same issue or incident, a single group grievance on behalfof these employees will bepresented to the appropriate step of the local grievance procedure.
When a grievance arises, the employee shall identify the issue by indicating the specific action ornon-action on the part of the Company which prompts the grievance whereupon the Supervisor shall, without undue delay, send for the Union‘s First Step Grievance Representative and an earnest effort will be made to settle the grievance in accordance with procedures provided in the Local Agreements.
The parties jointly recognize that it is desirable to resolve, if possible, any question of fact relevant to any grievance at as early a Grievance Step as is reasonably possible and will cooperate with each other in an effort to do so; such cooperation shall extend, in appropriate cases, to joint investigation to establish the relevant facts,
(5.3)	Termination of any grievance in the First Step or, in locations having a Three Step grievance procedure,
14
the Second Step of the local grievance procedure, either by the Company granting relief in whole or in part or by the Union withdrawing or dropping the grievance, shall not constitute a precedent for the settlement of any 1	future grievanc 3 in any Step of the grievance procedure
or in support of either party’s position in arbitration; ' however, any such “no precedent" termination shall not J constitute an eradication of the events which led to the i Company action or non-action of which the grievance complained.
'	(5.4) No claim s against the Company, including claims
for back pay, by an employee covered by this Agree-
1	meat, or by the Union, shall be retroactive to any period
| morethan 12monthspriortothedatethegrievancewas first filed in writing.
j	In the case of a discharged employee or other cases of
accruing liability1 (as defined in Sect ion 6.3 of this Agree-;	ment), ail claim; for back pay shall be limited co the
i	amount of wage; the employee would otherwise have
I	earned from his employment with the Company, lessee
I	following:
1.	Any Unemployment Compensation which the employee is not obligated to repay or which he is !	obligated <0 repay but has not repaid nor autho-
, rizedthe Company to repay on his behalf.
2.	Compensation for personal services other than the amount of compensation he was receiving .	from any other employment which he had at the
।	time he last worked forthe Company and which he
!	would hav 3 continued to receive had he contin-
I	ued to work for the Company during the period
covered by the claim.
15
Wages for total hours worked each week in other employment in excess of the total number of houts the employee would have worked for the Company during each corresponding week of the period covered by the claim shall not be deducted.
(5.5) Employees shall be given disciplinary layoff, suspended from employment, or discharged only forjust cause. In imposing disciplinary layoff, suspension or discharge on a current charge, the Company will not take into account any prior infractions (including falsification of employment application) which occurred more than three years previously nor, in the case of attendance infractions, any days of absencepaid under Section 15.1 for which prior approval had been granted by the Company for such absence. In the event an employee has been given disciplinary Layoff, suspended from employment, or discharged, his Supervisor will send for the employee’s Committeeman to discuss, for such time as may reasonably be necessary, the case with the employee. In the event the employee’s Committeeman is not available, the appropriate Union representative will be called.
Within a reasonable time (not to exceed 5 working days) after disciplinary layoff, suspension from employment or discharge has been imposed, either party may request that a disciplinary hearing be conducted by the appropriate Final Step Company representative. At the disciplinary hearing, the employee shall have the right to be present and the appropriate Committeeman shall have the right to represent him. If the parties mutually agree, witnesses may be jointly interviewed so the relevant factscan be ascertained. Employees at work who partici -
16
pate in a disciplinary hearing will not lose pay for regularly scheduled hours spent in such hearing.
Grievances involving disciplinary layoff, suspension or discharge may be presented, in writing, directly to the Final Step of the local grievance procedure.
The Company must be notified of a claim of wrongful disciplinary layoff, suspension or discharge within fifteen calendar days after same occurs, and the case shall be taken up promptly and diligent efforts made to dispose of it.
'	(5.6) An employee who receives a warning will, where
I	the act resulting in the warning would constitute cause
i for disciplinary action if continued, be given a written ।	notice setting forth his name, badge number, date of the
! warning, and the reason for the warning.
[	(5.7) I f, in the Final Step of the local grievance proce-
1 dure, the Union considers as unsatisfactory the j Company’s decision on a grievance which has as its ।	basic issue a medical disagreement wherein the findings
ofthe Company’s physician or physicians are in conflict । with the findings ofthe employee’s personal physician, ! the medical question shall be submitted to a third phy-|	sician mutually agreed to by the parties within five
i	working days following the Company’s decision on
I	such grievance. The medical opinion of the third physi-
I	cian after examination ofthe employee and consultation
j	with the other two physicians shall resolve such conflict.
! A copy of the third physician’s findings shall be sup-j	plied to I >oth the Company and the Union. The expense
( of the tliird physician shall be paid one-half by the [	Company and one-half by the Union, each of whom will
17
)
be billed separately by the third physician for their share
of such expense.	,
Each Local Union may, at its option, develop with the	i
Company a li st ofmutually agreeable physicians including specialists, and/or medical facilities to which such medical disputes may be referred.

(6.5)
a.
A tentative docket of those cases to be considered at a given hearing shall be furnished to the Corporate Labor Relations Office and the Permanent Arbitrator in the numerical order for scheduling at least eighty calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. This tentative docket may list more cases than the number to be scheduled for the hearing.
At I east sixty-five calendar days prior toaparticu-lar hearing, representatives torn the UAW-Agricultural Implement Department and the Corporate Labor Relations Office will meet to attempt to resolve any grievance referred to it by determining whether or not the facts of the case have resulted in a violation of the provisions cited.

22
for simultaneous exchange by the Union, then all other grievances listed in such Notice shall be deemed closed. If in the simultaneous exchange of statements, any grievances listed in tbe Notice ar: bypassed by the Union, then all such bypassed grievances shall be deemed closed. The “Union Statement of Unresolved Grievance” shall contain (i) the specific action or non-action chimed to constitute a violation of this Agreement, appended Letters of Agreement or appro-pt iate Local Agreement and all ofthe facts relied upon in support of such claim, (ii) the specific section(s) of such Agreement or Agreements chimed to be v iolated, together with a statement ofthe reason(s) why such action ornon-action is cl limed to consti tute a violation of such sections), and (iii) the specific relief requested.

Within fifteen calendar days prior to a hearing, substitutions in the docket may only be made by mutual agreement of the parties.
(6.6)	Not later than the day prior to the arbitration hearing, the parties will meet forthe purpose ofpreparing and signing a submission to arbitration, which will include a statement of the issue or issues and the Arbitrator shall decide only the issue or issues set forth in such submission. However, ifthe parties fail to agree upon and sign such submission by the hearing date, and if the Union Statement of Unresolved Grievance sets forth (i) the specific action or non-action claimed to constitute a violation of this Agreement, appended Letters o f Agreement or appropriate Local Agreement, (ii) the specific Section or Sections of such Agreement or Agreements claimed to be violated together with a statement of the reason or reasons why the action or non-action specified in (i) is claimed to constitute a violation of such Section or Sections, and (iii) the relief requested, tiie grievance shall be presented to arbitration notwithstanding the failure to agree upon a submiss ion, Insuch latter event, the Arbitratorshal! determine whether the Union Statement of Unresolved Grievance reasonably complies with the requirements of the foregoing sentence. I f it does not comply, he shall refer the matter back to the appropriate Local Union. In such event, the Local Union will prepare and deliver a new Statement of Unresolved Grievance. The grievance shall then be processed in the same manner as though such were the fust Union Statement written and delivered. Ifthe Union Statement of Unresolved Grievance does comply, he shall proceed to a decision on the merits, but shall
25
determine only whether or not the action or non-action specified in the Union Statement of Unresolved Grievance violates the Section or Sections of the Agreement or Agreements so specified and, if such violation has occurred, the relief to be granted, which shall not be broader than the relief so requested.
(6.7)	The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute. However, the Arbitrator shall have no power to change, alter, detract from, or add to the provisions of this Agreement, the appended Letters of Agreement, and/or the appropriate Local Agreement but shall have the power only co apply and interpret the provisions of such Agreements or Letters in reaching his decision; the Arbitrator shall have no power to rale on any dispute arising under Section 11.2 of the Aurora, Section 16.2of(he Decatur, Section 6.7 of the Peoria, Section 6.6 of the Pontiac Local Agreements, or Section 18.4 hereof.
It shall be incumbent upon the Arbitrator to recognize that he has been engaged by the parties for the sole purpose of adjudicating disputes that are properly before him and that his conduct of the hearing should be governed accordingly. The parties have agreed chat the Arbitrator should conduct an orderly hearing and that the Arbitrator should not intrude into either party’s presentation so as to prevent that party from putting forward its case in the manner and sequence determined by that party, subject, of course, to reasonable rules of arbitration procedure and evidence.
The parties assume the sole responsibility for developing the theory, arguments and proof of their respective positions in the arbitration procedure. The Arbitrator
26
shall respect their judgment as to the content of their presentation and shall not engage in developing additional or alternative theories, arguments or proof supportive of either party’s position. The Arbitrator shall neither accept as fact, nor require the other party to refute, either party’s charges, allegations or statements that are not supported by proper evidence.
The provisions of this Article 6 do not authorize the Arbitrator to serve as a mediator, conciliator or conduct an independent investigation of facts unless the parties so mutually agree. It is the desire ofboth parties that the Arbitrator serve the parties in the adjudication role described above and for the purpose for which the arbitration process was originally developed - a means by which a truly impartial third party could adjudicate disputes between two parties to a labor agreement over the interpretation, application or violation of thatagree-ment.
(6.8)	Expense of the arbitration, including the Arbitrator's feesand expensesand stenographic or tape recording expenses, shall be bome equally by both parties subj ect to the spec ial provisions appl icable in the event one of the parties terminates the Arbitrator’s authority.
(6.9)	The foregoing provisions of this Central Agreement are amended only to the extent necessary to provide an expedited arbitration procedure for grievances wherein the parties mutually agree in the Final Step ofthe grievance procedure that the sole issue is whether there was “just cause" for either discharging an employee, or giving an employee a disciplinary layoff.
27
If the appropriate Local of the Union is of the opinion that such a "just cause" grievance merits consideration for possible expedited arbitration, the appropriate Local of the Union shall within, but not beyond, 30 calendar days of the Company’s answer in the Final Step ofthe gr i e vance p roc cd ure, pre pare and de I i ver a writcerT'N o-tice of Appeal to Expedited Arbitration" to the appropriate plant Labor Relations Manager with copies to the UAW-Agricultural Implement Department and the Company’s Corporate Labor Relations Office. If such notice is not given within such time, the grievance shall be deemed closed.
Such grievances shall be heard in the chronological order of their referral, provided, however, that grievances involving discharges shall be heard in the chronological order of their referral prior to the hearing of any other grievance in expedited arbitration.
Grievances referred under this Section 6.9 may be heard by either the Permanent Arbitrator or an Alternate Arbitrator (from a permanent panel of five Alternate Arbitrators to be agreed upon by the parties).
The parties agree to waive the right to file a posthearing brief in such expedited arbitration. The Arbitrator shall render an award within 10 calendar days of receipt of the transcript or in the alternative, within 10 days of the hearing provided the Arbitrator and the parties agree at the time the hearing is scheduled that a tape recorder will be used to record the proceedings of suchhearing. In either event, the Arbitratorwill limithis opinion to that which is necessary to briefly explain his award.
28
In the event a grievance scheduled for expedited arbitration is resolved at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing, another such just cause grievance may be substituted by mutual agreement of the parties.

Local developments or proposals in these three areas will be channeled specifically to the Joint Central Committee by means of the minutes of Business Unit Committee meetings.
As stated in the opening paragraph of this letter, Caterpillar Inc, and the International Union UAW recognize the several aspects of responsibility inherent in their respective obligations to avoid di; crimination. In particular, the legal responsibilities, which of course cannot be delegated, require that the activities of the Central Committee and the several Business Unit Committees shall be advisory, consultative and cooperative only. The Company and the Union will give due consideration to the recommendations of the Committees bitt the Committees may not commit either the Company or the Union to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will discourage its members from bypassing the grievance procedure with respect to any allegations against the Company which may be made the subject of a grievance under the Labor Agreement.

Letter of Agreement N o. 9
During our ! 976 negotiations, the parties again discussed the application ofSection 16,10 of the Central Agreement to Maintenance and Construction work, fool Room work andTechnical Services Division work.
The Company reaffirmed its intention to make deci-rions as to whether such work shall be performed by Company forces, or by others, consistent with the intentions set forth in such Section 16.10. However, in the event any such decision toperform such work by other than Company forces will result in the downgrade or layoff of employees who would otherwise perform such work if the Company had decided to perform such work with Company forces, the Company will promptly notify the Union and, within but not beyond 5 days of such notification, meet with the Union to discuss the reasons for such decision, ['□ring such 5-day period, the work involved in Sitch decision will not be performed by other than Company forces unless a compelling emergency requires that such work be performed immediately.
Each month thcCompany will provide the Union with a list of all decisions that have been made the previous month as to Maintenance and Construction work, Tool Room work and Research work that has been or will be
16S
performed by other than Company forces. Such list will include;
I.	Identification ofthe work.
2.	Name of subcontractor.
3.	Reason(s) for subcontracting such work.
If the Union has questions on the above information, the Company will di scuss the matter with the appropriate ra Final Step Committee.
During 1979 negotiations the parties discussed the h lists provided by the Company. The Union maintained sa that in some instances the “Reasons for subcontracting b such work” were inaccurate. The Company assured the ra Union that the Company will make a sincere effort to accurately reflect the reasons for subcontracting such 1 work.

The parties acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt,fairandfmalresolutionofemployeegrievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance ofa stable, effective and dependable grievanceprocedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed ofas contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative ofthe fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public
166
Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee, has reviewed the disposition ofa grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the Union’s Vice President and Director ofthe Agricultural Implement Department may inform the Company's Vice President - Human Services in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred. For the purposes of this Letter ofAgreement No. 10, an improper disposition shall include only those instances wherein a grievance:
a,	isspecifically settled or specifically withdrawn in one ofthe steps of the Local grievance procedure Or in an arbitration docketing session; or
b.	is not referred by the Regional Director or his designated representative to the UAW Agricul-tural-lmpleirient Department orappealed toarbi-tratiotiby theUAW AgriculturaUmptementDe-partment as provided inSection6.1 ofthe Central Agreement and is therefore deemed closed.
It is agreed, however, that the Company will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are already bailed under the provisions ofthe Central Agreement or appropriate Local Agreement at the timeofthereinstate-me nt of t he grieva nc e or th at re late to the period be tween the time of the original disposition and the time of the rehistatementas provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will
167
i
(
I
thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Company in the grievance procedure, or in any court or before any federal, state or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Permanent Arbitrator or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Company and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the aforementioned Central Agreement or appropriate Local Agreements, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect Sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any decisions by the Permanent Arbitrator or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter and the parties’ obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
It is agreed that none of the above provisions will be applicable to any case settled, withdrawn, or deemed closed prior to the effective date of this letter.

During our negotiations, the parties discussed various aspects ofCaterpillar safety programs. It was recognized that, to be effective, these programs require training of employees in theirproper use and further requires appropriate enforcement measures. In addition, to maintain effectiveness, it is necessary to periodically review and reemphasize these programs.
Lockout Procedure
The Company will continue to provide training on the safety lockout procedure to all employees and apprentices who are required toobserve such procedure. Locks and other necessary equipment will also continue to be provided to such employees.
The Company will instruct its management at each business unit to review the procedure with its Local Health and Safety Committee during one of its scheduled meetings. The Health and Safety Committee wi 11 also be informed ofany subsequent significant changes made to the procedure.

Hazardous Material Program	J
The Hazardous Material Program will be a joint pro- i gram.	j
ThcCompany will provide each employee who comes	i
in contact with hazardous materials with training on the safe Use of such materials. The Company agrees to provide employees exposed to hazardous materials with the Material Safety Data Sheets for those materials during the shift that the request was made, provided j sufficient time is available.
The Company is committed to purchase only those hazardous materials that have adequate Material Safety Data Sheets and labels. Also the Company will request that suppliers of hazardous materials provide it with al! identifiable chemical names and composition of such products on their Material Safety Data Sheets. The Company will confirm through toxicology references that supplier-provided health warnings are appropriate.

During 1979 negotiations, the parties discussed the Company’s creation of training stations for apprentices and trainees. The Union agrees that a variety of training stations must be established in order to provide the different types of work assignments that are necessary to train apprentices and trainees.
As apprentices and trainees progress through the 1 various programs, it becomes necessary to change the number and type of training stations. However, the Company will, ona semiannual basis, give the Union an updated listing of the training stations (including those stations where apprentices and trainees are assigned on an intermittent basis) within each bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
The Company further agrees that, to the greatest extent practical, no employee will be involuntarily displaced to create a new training station. In addition, the Company will create training stations on more than one shift when warranted by the number of apprentices and/or trainees.

ft is the objective of the parties to folly utilize die scheduled days of arbitration.
Notwithstanding the above arbitration scheduling, the parties recognize the undesirable effects caused by having a buildup in the number of grievances pending arbitration. Quarterly during the life of the Agreement, representatives from the UAW-Agricultural Implement Department and Corporate Labor Relations Office will consider whether such an undesirable buildup exists at any facility. If they agree that it does, the representatives from the U A W-Agri cultural Implement Department and Corporate Labor Relations Office will meet in an attempt to resolve any grievances pending arbitration by determining whether or no t the facts of the case have resulted in a violation of the provisions cited.
The Regional Director of the UAW (or his designated representatives), the BargainingChairrnariJn the caseof Local 974 the appropriate Third Step Grievance Chairman, and the plant Labor Relations Manager (or his designated representatives) may attend such meetings.
During 1979 negotiations the parties discussed the Company’s use of contractors to perform work within our Plant Engineering Departments which the Union claimed should have been performed by UAW bargain' ing unit employees.
The Company, while noting that during the life ofthe 19 76 Agreement skilled trades employment grew at a fetter rate than total employment, appreciates the concerns expressed by individual members of the Bargaining Committee.
It is neither practical nor feasible for the Company to p irfonn at 1 o fits plant engineering work with its own work force. The Company shall continue to take into consideration ail the factors it has agreed to consider, under Section 16,10, when making those decisions.
The parties also discussed the matter of factory servicemen working on production, Tool Room orTechni-cal Center machines that have been accepted and are operating within the various Caterpillar plants. The parties recognized that in many cases the appropriate craft employee, including a machine repairman, might gain necessary knowledge and experience by working with the factory representative servicing the production machine.
Therefore, insofar as is practical, the appropriate craft employee will be assigned to work with factory representatives on those production, Tool Room or Technical Center machines which the Company intends to regularly repair and maintain with bargaining unit employees.

decisions which make such coverage improper for cer- : tain Union positions.
It is die intent of the parties to abide by the N LRB rulings. Therefore, the parties agree to administer all UAW-Catetpillar Labor Agreements so as to provide “super seniority” or “top seniority” coverage only for a Union member who is involved in either grievance han-dling or the administration or negotiation of bargaining agreements on the business unit level.
However, should the NLRB rulings be overturned or roodifiedonappeal.itistheunderatandingofthepanies ; that, to the extent permitted by such appeal decision, “superseniority” or “top seniority” coverage willrevwt ' to the provisions currently contained in the respective 1 UAW-CaterpillarLabor Agreements.
During 1982 negotiations, the parties expressed the need for new approaches to the ways they conduct their business with each other. To provide assistance in improving their business relationships, Caterpillar and the UAW have agreed to establish a National Joint Executive Committee on Union-Management Relation* ships (NJEC).
The NJEC will be composed of six members—three from the Union and three from theCompany. Two ofthe Unionmetnbers andtwoofthe Company membersshall be permanent members and will, at any point in time, be the individuals then holding the following positions:


I
For the Union:	Vice President, Director ofthe
National Caterpillar Department
Administrative Assistant to the above Vice President, Assistant Directorofthe National Caterpillar Department
For the Company: Vice President, Human Services Division
Director, Corporate Labor Relations
Whi le otberUnion members and other Company members will be as designated by the respective parties, no meeting of the NJEC will be held unless at least one permanent member from each party is present
The NJEC does not replace collective bargaining, nor does it interfere in any way with the parties’ grievance and arbitration procedure. Rather, it provides a new forum designed to promote better Union-Management relations through better communicatioiis, systematic fact finding, and advance discussion of certain business developments that are of mutual interest and significance to the Union, the Company and employees. It is understood that the composition, organization, procedures and functions of the NJEC are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedureoftheparties* Labor Agreements.
The NJEC will meet at such times, frequency and locations as the permanent members may mutu-allvaeree. The VW1c, -----------------------------

The above list of items is illustrative and topics, including those listed, are always subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.
As appropriate, the NJEC may establish ad hoc subcommittees or working groups to explore or resolve selected issues. Where there are appropriate issues of mutual interest and concern, the NJEC, upon approval of the Company’s Director of Corporate Labor Relations and the Director of the UAW National Caterpil lar Depart-

Letter of Agreement No. 18
During negotiations the parties reaffirmed their commitment to seeking new approaches to the ways they conduct their business with each other. Among the subjects discussed in this regard was a mutual concern about the ability to effectively resolve grievances which were already pending arbitration at some locations and problems which may arise during the life of the current Centra) Agreement. As a result ofthese discussions, the Union and the Company have agreed that Union and management officials from a facility may by mutual agreement selectively introduce the following jointly-developed alternative concept for grievance prevention and resolution.
The parties have agreed that the following principles shall guide the implementation and functioning of this Grievance Prevention and Resolution program:
179

Commitment ofthe International Union and Cor-' porate Labor Relations to develop aconstructive relationship based on trust and respect.
Commitment of Plant Management and Local Union leadership to develop a constructive relationship based on trust and respect.
Agreement by both parties that neither party should give up contractual rights and obligations to resolve grievances.
Recognition by both parties of the rights and roles of the other party.
Effort by both parties to resolve grievances at the earliest possible step.
Commitment of Union representatives not toen -courage and to actively discourage the filing of frivolous and/or repetitive grievances.
Commitment ofCompany representatives to approach grievance settlement with flexibility and willingness to resolve underlying causes.
Direction from upper management to supervision . to attempt to resolve grievances at the earliest step.
Direction from Union leadership to shop-floor union representatives to attempt to resolve grievances at the earliest step.
Commitment by both parties that their representatives have the right, the obligation, and the responsibility to resolve grievances at their respective levels,
5 80
Recognition by Company and Union representatives at ait icvets that the parties will not always agree, but that they can disagree without being disagreeable,
Commitment by both parties to steady improvement in their ability to work with each other to resolve problems and recognition that neither party should expect an instant turnaround as this approach is implemented.
-	Recognition by both parties that their primary purpose is toprovidequality products or services to customers and not to win arguments.
-	Commitmentbyboth parties to approach problem resolution on the basis of seeking the right solution — “What's right rather than who’s right.” An initial explanation of the basic principles will be made to Union and management officials who participate tn the grievance procedure at the facility. Once the participants understand their responsibilities under this approach, Union and management officials from that facility shall begin implementation of the process by initiating the grievance prevention program and attempting to resolve any current grievances at their existing level. In order to permit a full and objective evaluation of these grievances by both parties, it may be necessary to suspend the normal grievancc/arbitration procedure.
Top Union and management officials at a facility implementing this procedure shall meet periodically to evaluate the progress of this approach and to reinforce both parties’ commitment to its principles.

Let ter of Agreement No. 2 J
During the 1988 negotiations the parties discussed the dilemma faced by la id-off employees who have medical res a ictions. In the past there have been instances where an employee was on layoff status and could not be recalled in tine with his seniority and qualifications because of medical restrictions. In such cases the employee, upon subsequent recovery (full or partial), then was required to wait for another opening before being recalled on the basis of qualifications and then current medical condition. Employees tn such circumstances were confronted with the possibility of having their seniority broken prior to jobs becoming available which fit theinnedical restrictions.
Jn order to address this situation the parties agreed co ntovidesuchemolovceswitha1' ?dri't'n~:»tnr'Hnrr>.r^r
toberetumedtoworkinthefollowingcircumstanccs. In the event an employee’s medical restrictions are removed or modified to the extent such employee could perform a job tn an (OorNIO, the laid-off employee shall displace the employee with the least seniority who is assigned to such job provided:
(i)	in the case of a job in the 10, such employee has more seniority than an employee who is performing such job and possesses all basic qualifications and abilities necessary to perform the job within a reasonable period as defined in Section 13.5 (0 ofthe Central Agreement, or
(ii)	i n th e case 0 f a job in an N IO, s uch employee has more seniority than an employee who is performing such job and has previously performed such job.
The employee who is displaced asa result ofthis Leder of Agreement shall thereafter be placed in accordance with the provisions of Section J 3,5 of the Centra) Agreement.
Letterof Agreement No.23
This will confirm our understanding that a former employee who has broken his/her seniority under the pro visions of Sec I ion 11.2 (4)ofa Central Agreement prior to the effective date ofthe 1998 Central Agreement may file an application for employment in his/her former bargaining unit and will (subject to the succeeding provisions of this Letter of Agreement) be granted a preferential hiring right to a job opening in such bargain-
188
ing unit provided such employee possesses the necessary qualifications for employment in such bargaining unit and further provided that another applicant for employment in such bargaining unit does not possess measurably better qualifications for a specificjob opening than such former employee.
An application for employment submitted by such former employee must be filed, either in person orby mail, with the employment office for the bargaining unit where the former employee is seeking employment. Such application shall be retained in the active file for two (2) years from the date the application was filed. A former employee may file another application following the expiration of such two-year period if the individual wishes additional consideration under the provisions of this Letter of Agreement. In noevent will any application which has been filed under the provisions of this Letter of Agreement remain active after September 30,2000.

Supplemental Employees
A. The parties to the Central Agreement recognize that the Company’s Business Units encounter fluctuations in employment needs due to the cyclical nature of their business. Therefore, within each Business Unit, in order to provide stable employment and job security to our regular employees, the Company may, as the need arises, in addition to sourcing of work in accordance with the provisions of Sectionl6J0, employ the services of supplemental employees to perform bargaining unit work.

As an aggregate within each business unit, the total number of supplemental employees may not exceed the higher of twenty-five employees (five employees when there are fewer than fifty regular bargaining unit employees) or fifteen percent (15%) of the numberofregularbargaining unit employees within the Business Unit.
The Company will not be obligated to separate supplemental employees to maintain the limits outlined in paragraph B (2) above, except in conjunction with a reduction in fOTceresultingina fey off of regular employees.
C The Company will not use supplementalemploy-ees in Beu of recalling laid-offemployees to their business units unless there are either (1)rare and unusual circumstances where qualified, laid-off employees are not available or (2) anticipated short-term needs where the recall of a laid-off employee is not warranted. If either of these situations arises, the Company will review the matter with the Union and will give consideration to the Union’s position before using supplemental employees.
195
D. In the event of a reduction in force, a tegular employee will displace a supplemental employee who is on a job that the regular employee is qualified to perform and to which the regular employee is contractually entitled.
E Contractual rights, seniority rights, and benefits, except those required by statute or those which the Company, at its discretion, may provide, shall not accrue to supplemental employees.
