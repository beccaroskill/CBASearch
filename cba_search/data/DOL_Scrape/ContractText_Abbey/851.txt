In appropriate cases, i.e., where there is no legitimate basis for the work assignments in question, the Hospital will take appropriate steps to ensure equitable distribution. The Hospital shall have no obligation to investigate a claim of inequitable distribution where the per diems on whose behalf a claim has been made did not timely submit a schedule for availability for the time period that is the subject of the claim.
In preparing schedules, the Hospital will generally give regular employees a scheduling preference. Where, however, the verified scheduling limitation of a per diem makes it impractical to adhere to this general practice, the Hospital may accommodate the per diem’s scheduling restriction.

11
informed at the time of employment or at the time of transfer, that her/his employment is for a special non-budgeting or research project and subject to this paragraph, such employee shall, for the purpose of layoff, be considered to have title seniority which may be exercised only within the project or grant to which assigned. Such employee shall be considered to have bargaining unit seniority for the purpose of transfer or recall to a vacant position outside of the special project, provided that on each recall the Employer determines that the employees retained or recalled have the ability to do the work. Such determination by the Employer shall not be arbitrary. Employees, fifty percent (50%) or more of whose regular compensation rate is charged to the Hospital's budget, shall be considered as having seniority on that basis and not under a grant.
4.72 Seniority: Lists
Employer will, on execution of this Agreement and at least semi-annually thereafter, post and furnish to the Association seniority lists.

The employee must also be willing to return to active payroll status in the new title upon appointment to the position.
Postings will include unit or areas, title and specific shift hours and variable hours wherever possible. Where it is not feasible to post specific shift hours, the Hospital will consult with the Association prior to posting the position in order to achieve the most meaningful posting.
If a successful bidder is not transferred within twenty-eight (28) days of notifying her/his current supervisor that she/he has accepted a new position, the successful bidder shall receive the difference in pay, if any, between the current
12
and new job. A conference with the former and new Director or designee will be arranged to accomplish transfer as soon as possible.

Where a promotional vacancy in the bargaining unit occurs and twc (2) or more employees are under consideration for such vacancy, the Employer shall promote the most competent employee as determined by the Director or designee. Disputes under the provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure only if the question involves an unfair application of the cromotional criteria by the Director or designee.
4.M Promotional Committee
For NYSNA promotional positions, the respective Director cr designee convene(s) an interview panel comprised of an equal number of ba gaining unit members and Nursing management at different managerial and staff levels appropriate to the classification of the promotional position(s).

If the Hospital experiences a temporary partial or temporary total closure in a unit, the Hospital shall either treat the matter under Section 5.07 or shall treat the matter pursuant to the following procedure after giving the Ass ociation and the affected employees seven (7) days’ written notice, except in an emergency. Any closure of three (3) months or less is temporary. In these instances, the employee shall voluntarily select either of the following options for i:he duration of the temporary closure, provided however, that the Employer shall not unreasonably deny selection of option 1 below.
1.	The employee may elect to utilize paid benefit time, which shall :>e limited to accrued vacation/personal days and/or the employee may elec : to take an unpaid leave of absence.
A nurse who lacks enough accrued paid benefit time for the duration of the temporary closure, may return to work after the paid benefit time is exhausted. The nurse shall select from any remaining vacancies pursuant to this Article 5.13.
2.	The employee, in order of bargaining unit seniority, may select a vacancy for which she/he is presently qualified as determined by the Employer. Vacancies will consist of budgeted positions that are posted :ir approved and about to be posted, plus new temporary vacancies. Consideration will be given to transferring the nurse to the same shift and schedule that she/he currently works.
3.	If an affected nurse does not choose option 1 above and option 2 above does not include an opportunity to remain on the same shift arid schedule, then the nurse shall receive a total of twenty-one (21) days’ notice before going into a different shift and/or schedule. The twenty-one (21) days are comprised of the original seven (7) days’ notice (referenced in the first paragraph of this clause) plus fourteen (14) days’ additional notice.
23
If the partial or total unit closure exceeds three (3) months, each affected employee shall have all rights afforded under Section 5.07. Any permanent positions which these employees temporarily occupied shall be placed on the vacancy list as described under Section 5.07. It is the parties’ understanding that this section is for temporary purposes only. It is also agreed and understood that any affected employee accepting a vacant position will have the necessary orientation and her/his approved time off honored. Furthermore, it is mutually agreed that bargaining unit seniority shall apply in any and all circumstances applicable under this section. If the unit is reopened at the end of the units’ temporary closure pursuant to this section, the employees will return to their previous position shift and schedule.
It is the parties’ express interpretation of the foregoing that if a nurse either has no paid time or chooses not to take paid time and the Hospital does not have a vacancy pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, then Section 5.07 will be implemented.
5.13	Unit Relocation
When a unit is relocated within the Hospital, all nurses shall move to the relocated unit in the Hospital, except where employees are laid off as a result of such relocation then Section 5.07 shall apply.

Thereby, the parties agree to work together to resolve issues concerning the skill-mix or changes in care delivery in the interest of quality patierr: care.
A. If the Employer desires to convert a filled or unfilled RN position to a non-RN position, the following steps will be taken:
1.	Employer will notify the Association if it intends to convert a vacant or occupied RN position to a non-RN position. Thirty (30) calendar days written notice will be given to NYSNA and affected employees, if any, before the conversion occurs. During the thirty (30) dn.y period the following shall take place:

4.	Within ten (10) days after 3 above, the Employer holds meetings with the nurses impacted by the plan and the Association to receive additional input regarding the plan and to review recommendations.
5.	After following the above steps, if the Association and the Employer can agree to a conversion plan, said agreed upon conversion may be implemented by the Employer. If the above steps do not result in
25
agreement with the Association, the Employer may go forward with the conversion subject to section 7 below. The Hospital agrees that no RN shall be laid off as a result of the conversion. If a proposed conversion involves the position of an incumbent nurse, the position occupied by the unit RN(s) with the least bargaining unit seniority in the title shall be the one(s) converted. The Employer shall also inform nurses in the affected unit of the responsibilities of the non-RN being introduced by the conversion.
6.	The Hospital shall have the right to convert up to thirty (30) positions in 2002, thirty (30) positions in 2003 and thirty (30) positions in 2004. Any unused part of the conversion limit shall carry over to the subsequent contract years. However, the total number of conversions shall not exceed ninety (90) during the term of the contract. The submission date of the proposed conversion by the Hospital to the Association will determine timeliness.
7.	Conversion of filled or vacated positions is arbitrable. If the Association and the Employer cannot agree to a conversion plan, the parties shall proceed to arbitration. The Association will file for said arbitration within fifteen (15) days after the thirty (30) days notice period. If the Association does not file for said arbitration within fifteen (15) days after the thirty (30) days notice period, the Hospital shall be free to convert a filled or unfilled position. In rendering its decision, the panel shall consider in all cases, only the following two standards: 1) is the Hospital’s proposal cost efficient and 2) does it maintain safe quality care. Thus, the Hospital’s proposed conversion of filled positions shall be sustained if a panel majority finds that the conversion meets the foregoing standards. However, if the Hospital’s proposed conversion of filled positions does not meet with the standards, then the panel majority may deny in full or modify the Hospital’s proposal according to the standards. With respect to conversion of unfilled positions, the arbitrator is only authorized to choose between the Hospital’s and the Association’s last/best offer.
The arbitration will be heard by a three (3) member panel, one member from the Association, one member from the Employer and John Sands. The panel shall issue a majority decision that shall be binding on the parties provided it does not exceed the numerical caps listed in section 6.
The Hospital agrees not to implement any RN to non-RN conversion (vacant or filled positions) unless the Association consents or unless and until the arbitration panel’s decision allows such conversion.
8.	If the Association wishes to convert a filled or unfilled non-RN position to a RN position, the following steps shall be taken:
a.	The Association shall provide to the Employer a conversion proposal rationale. The Employer will only be required upon request to provide the following information about non-RN positions: job descriptions, compensation, number of employees in each classification.
26
b.	Within ten (10) calendar days of notice, a task force of Employer and Association representatives shall meet to discuss such conversion plan.
c.	If the Association and the Employer can agree to a conversion plan, said agreed upon conversion may be implemented by ti e Employer. If the proposed conversion is not mutually agreed upon, il shall not be subject to arbitration but the proposed conversion subject to section 9 below.
9.	The provisions and procedures contained in this Section 6.C7 are in lieu of the parties' obligations to bargain under the National Labor Relations Act.
10.	In a mutual effort to accurately track vacant RN positions, the Hospital shall within thirty (30) days of ratification provide a written list to the Association of all current RN vacancies. Said list will consist of position number, title and location. Thereafter, as any RN position becomes vacant (i.e., due to resignation, transfer, retirement) the Hospital shall forward such information as provided above to the Association’s general representative. At monthly labor/management meetings, a standing agenda item will be vacancy update.
It is clearly understood that all provisions of this section supersede management’s rights to convert any RN position vacant or filled to non-RN positions.

APPENDIX A
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION
AND
NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER
This Memorandum of Agreement supplements the collective bargaining agreement between the New York State Nurses Association and the Hospital.
Alternative Work Schedules (AWS)
I,	Alternative Work Schedules (AWS) offer employees the opportunity to change their contractual normal workday (5.01) and normal work week (5.02) by working fewer days per week, but more hours per day. There will be no change in the employee's base compensation rate under any option selected.
II.	Nursing units and/or individual nurses may request to work AWS or remain on traditional schedules. These requests will not be unreasonably denied.
1.	The number of individual positions per cost center will be established by the Director of each department in coordination with the Nursing Care Clinician/Clinical Manager. The AWS (flextime positions}) will first be posted to the employees presently working within each cost center
2.	The initiation of, or changes to, AWS as described in this Memorandum of Agreement will be discussed at a meeting with recorded minutes between nursing administration and the nurses on the unit prior to implementation. Any proposed change to AWS that is not covered by this agreement must be negotiated between the Association and the Employer.
The Employer will make its best efforts to convert the following units to AWS by November 1, 1999: ORs, PACUs, ASU, Stepdown, Hemodialysis, Plasma Phoreses, Endoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Cardiac Catheterization, ER, URGI Care, Obstetrics Service, Interventional Radiology and Oncology. The Employer will make best efforts to convert all other units by March 1,2000.
Conversion will be done by bargaining unit seniority. RNs will be given a choice of shifts by bargaining unit seniority. If the conversion to flex involves a redistribution of nurses among shifts within each title, all nurses will choose their shift by bargaining unit seniority. The Hospital agrees that no RN shall be laid off as a result of the conversion. If the conversion to a standard schedule involves a redistribution of nurses among shifts within each title, all nurses will select their shift on the converted unit according to bargaining unit seniority. If conversion to a standard schedule involves reduction in the number of unit nurses within a higher title, the affected nurses shall have a choice of same title position in another unit for which she/he is qualified or staying on the same unit in a lower titled position according to bargaining unit seniority.
Nurses who choose to remain on standard shift will submit their request by August 15, 1999 to their nurse manager and every effort shall be made to grant such requests.
The Hospital will make best efforts to honor all previously approved vacation.
60
III.	Employees who work an AWS are entitled to all of the same rights and benefits as set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the parties except as amended below:
1.	Employees on AWS will be considered "salaried professionals" as described in the Federal Regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Title 29, Fart 54, Section 54.118 and New York State definition.
2.	Full-time employees will accrue salary and benefits on the equivalent basis of one hundred and fifty (150) hours in each four (4) week period a iring the year.

3.	It is agreed that employees may be disciplined for failure to meet th eir professional responsibilities to the Hospital which shall include the regular and limely reporting to work as scheduled; i.e., poor attendance, continued lateness, and leaving work early.
4.	Both parties recognize that sick calls that occur by the employee s who work an AWS are more difficult to cover than normal schedule sick calls. Therefore, nurses who work an AWS will continue to assist the Administration in an effort to reduce the number of sick calls and provide coverage when they occur.
5.	For payroll purposes including the computing of overtime, the work year will be divided into thirteen (13) four (4) week periods (starting with the firsl day of the first pay period in January). During each four (4) week period, employee's work schedule will be one hundred and fifty (150) hours.
6.	Employees who work in excess of one hundred and fifty (150) huurs during that period will be paid at the premium compensation rate. Employees working in excess of their normally scheduled workday will receive the premium compensation rate for that time, however, there shall be no pyramided overtime in any case. Where overtime is necessary, an employee on a flextime schedule will work no more than sixteen (16) hours at one time. Overtime checks will be issued in a separate check for seven and one-half (71/z) hours or more.
IV.	Employees on AWS will accrue, earn, and be entitled to an equal amount of time in hours as an employee working a normal schedule, except as amended below:
1.	Holiday time and Personal Days will be combined and will be called Elective Days.
2.	Elective Days will be as follows:
121/2 = 7 days (5 Holidays + 2 Personal)
111/2 = 8 days (6 Holidays + 2 Personal)
10 =9 days (6 Holidays + 3 Personal) (10 hour days) (For OR anci Ancillary Only)
3.	The Elective Days will be given up-front, i.e., all holiday hours ar; of January of each year, and personal hours as of each employee's anniversary date.
4.	Upon working an AWS, the employee will sign an agreement which will enable, upon resignation, New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center to deduct the hours of elective time taken but not accrued from the last paycheck.
5.	Elective days will be distributed equitably; will not be carried from me year to the next; and may not be accumulated and taken all at one time.

BETWEEN
THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION
AND
NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER
This Side Letter of Agreement supplements the Contract between the Hospi :al and the New York State Nurses Association as follows:
This is to confirm that the following from Donald Canfield of the Hartforc Life Insurance Company fully reflects our understanding of the administration of the "any occupation" stage of the "2 year own occupation, any thereafter" definition of disability.
Following is an explanation of our administration of the "any occupation" stage of the "2 year own occupation, any thereafter" definition of disability.
The formal definition of the occupation stage is as follows:
"...you must be so prevented from performing the essential dut es of any occupation for which you are qualified by education, training or experience."
You will note that under this definition, the claimant would not be expected to pursue positions for which she or he had not had prior training or experience in. In addition, there is an implied earnings test on the any occupation definition. For example, a cla mant would not be expected to pursue any position in which she or he could not earn an income reasonably comparable with that preceding the disability. Reasonably comparable wouk: typically mean equal to or exceeding the percentage of prior earnings the disability benefit was replacing (e.g. 60% or 70% in the benefits you are considering).
The intent is certainly not to make a claimant pursue an unfamiliar or substantially lower paid position than that held prior to disability.
