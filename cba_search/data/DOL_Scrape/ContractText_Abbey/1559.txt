2.	Section 29 of the Contract shall be amended to provide as follows:
Where an employer acting as construction manager enters into a contract with an owner or developer to manage, facilitate or coordinate construction activities in connections with a building project that is governed by either state of municipal prevailing wage laws, the Employer shall not be required to employ an OSS where its contract with the owner or developer does not require them to sign contracts with prime contractors or subcontractors also working on the project or does not assign them responsibility for “general conditions”.
Where an employer holds or is responsible for contracts with other prime contractors or subcontractors working at a prevailing wage project, the employer shall be obligated to employ and OSS in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
On those prevailing wage projects where the employer does not sign contracts with the prime contractors also working on the project but is responsible for the “general conditions” and the value of the employer’s individual contract or the responsibilities it has assumed for “general conditions” (which excludes monies received for pre-construction services, payroll costs associated with management supervision and management staffing, post-construction service, professional services, and management fees) is in excess of $6.5 million, that employer shall be responsible to employ and OSS.
