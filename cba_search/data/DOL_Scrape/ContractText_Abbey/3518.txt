ARTICLE 6
NO LAYOFFS OR REDUCTION IN FORCE
(1)	Each employee who is employed in the regular work force as of the date of the Award of Arbitrator James J. Healy, September 15,1978, shall be protected henceforth against any involuntary layoff or force reduction.
It is the intent of this provision to provide security to each such employee during his or her work lifetime.
Members of the regular work force, as defined in Article 7 of the Agreement, include full-time regulars, part-time employees assigned to regular schedules and part-time employees assigned to flexible schedules.
(2)	Employees who become members of the regular work force after the date of this Award, September 15, 1978, shall be provided the same protection afforded under (1) above on completion of six years of continuous service and having worked in at least 20 pay periods during each of the six years.
9
Article 6.A.1
(3)	With respect to employees hired into the regular work force after the date of this Award and who have not acquired the protection provided under (2) above, the Employer shall have the right to effect layoffs for lack of work or for other legitimate reasons. This right may be exercised in lieu of reassigning employees under the provisions of Article 12, except as such right may be modified by agreement. Should the exercise of the Employer’s right to lay off employees require the application of the provisions of Chapter 35 of Title 5, United States Code, employees covered by that Chapter with less than three years of continuous civilian federal service will be treated as “career conditional” employees.
The Employer’s right as established in this Section shall be effective July 20, 1979.
The following terms as to the employees’ and Employer’s rights and the rules and procedures to be followed in the implementation of Article 6 are a part of the September 15, 1978 Final Resolution and shall be final and binding upon the parties:
(See Memo, page 307)
A.	Coverage
1.	Employees protected against any involuntary layoff or force reduction.
Those employees who occupy full-time, part-time regular or part-time flexible positions in the regular work force (as defined in Article 7) on September 15,1978, are protected against layoff and reduction in force during any period of employment in the regular work force with the United States Postal Service or successor organization in his or her lifetime. Such employees are referred to as “protected employees.”
10
Article 6.A.3.a.(1)
Other employees achieve protected status under the provisions of A.3 below.
2.	Employees subject to involuntary layoff or force reduction.
Except as provided in A.1 and A.3, all employees who enter the regular work force, whether, by hire, transfer, demotion, reassignment, reinstatement and reemployment on or after September 16,1978, are subject to layoff or force reduction and are referred to as “non-protected employees.”
3.	Non-protected employees achieving protected status.
a.	A non-protected employee achieves protected status upon completion of six years of continuous service in their regular work force. The service requirement is computed from the first day of the pay period in which the employee enters the regular work force. To receive credit for the year, the employee must work at least one hour or receive a call-in guarantee in lieu of work in at least 20 of the 26 pay periods during that anniversary year.
Absence from actual duty for any of the following reasons will be considered as “work” solely for the purposes of this requirement.
(1)	To the extent required by law, court leave, time spent in military service covered by Chapter 43 of Title 38, or time spent on continuation of pay, leave without pay on OWCP rolls because of compensable injury on duty.
11
Article 6.A.3.a.(2)
(2)	Time spent on paid annual leave or sick leave, as provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement.
(3)	Leave without pay for performing Union business as provided for in Article 24 of the Agreement.
All other unpaid leave and periods of suspension or time spent in layoff or RIF status will not be considered work. Failure to meet the 20 pay period requirement in any given anniversary year means the employee must begin a new six year continuous service period to achieve protected status.
b.	Temporary details outside of the regular work force in which the employee’s position of record remains in the regular work force count toward fulfilling the 20 pay periods of work requirement per year.
c.	If a non-protected employee leaves the regular work force for a position outside the Postal Service and remains there more than 30 calendar days, upon return the employee begins a new service period for purposes of attaining six years continuous service.
d.	If a non-protected employee leaves the regular work force and returns within two years from a position within the Postal Service the employee will receive credit for previously completed full anniversary years, for purposes of attaining the six years continuous service.
12
Article 6.B.4
B.	Preconditions for Implementation of Layoff and Reduction in Force.
1.	The affected Union(s) shall be notified at the Regional level no less than 90 days in advance of any layoff or reduction in force that an excess of employees exists or will exist at an installation and that a layoff and reduction in force may be necessary. The Employer will explain to the Union(s) the basis for its conclusion that legitimate business reasons require the excessing and possible separation of employees.
2.	No employee shall be reassigned under this Article or laid off or reduced in force unless and until that employee has been notified at least 60 days in advance that he or she may be affected by one or the other of these actions.
3.	The maximum number of excess employees within an installation shall be determined by seniority unit within each category of employees (full-time, part-time regular, part-time flexible). This number determined by the Employer will be given to the Union(s) at the time of the 90-day notice.
4.	Before implementation of reassignment under this Article or, if necessary, layoff and reduction in force of excess employees within the installation, the Employer will, to the fullest extent possible, separate all PSEs within the craft and minimize the amount of overtime work and part-time flexible hours in the positions or group of positions covered by the seniority unit as defined in this Agreement or as agreed to by the parties. In addition, the Employer shall solicit volunteers from among employees in the same craft within the installation
13
Article 6.B.5
to terminate their employment with the Employer. Employees who elect to terminate their employment will receive a lump sum severance a payment in the amount provided by Part 435 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual, will receive benefit coverage to the extent provided by such Manual, and, if eligible, will be given the early retirement benefits provided by Section 8336(d)(2) of Title 5, United States Code and the regulations implementing that statute.
5.	No less than 20 days prior to effecting a layoff, the Employer will post a list of all vacancies in other seniority units and crafts at the same or lower level which exist within the installation and within the commuting area of the losing installation. Employees in an affected seniority unit may, within 10 days after the posting, request a reassignment under this Article to a posted vacancy. Qualified employees will be assigned to such vacancies on the basis of seniority. If a senior non-preference eligible employee within the seniority unit indicates no interest in available reassignment, then such employee becomes exposed to layoff. A preference eligible employee within the seniority unit shall be required to accept such a reassignment to a vacancy in the same level at the installation, or, if none exists at the installation, to a vacancy in the same level at an installation within the commuting area of the losing installation.
If the reassignment is to a different craft, the employee’s seniority in the new craft shall be established in accordance with the applicable seniority provisions of the new craft.
14
Article 6.C.4
C.	Layoff and Reduction in Force
1.	Definition. The term “layoff" as used herein refers to the separation of non-protected, non-preference eligible employees in the regular work force because of lack of work or other legitimate, non-disciplinary reasons. The term “reduction in force” as used herein refers to the separation or reduction in the grade of a non-protected veterans’ preference eligible in the regular work force because of lack of work or other legitimate non-disciplinary reasons.
2.	Order of layoff. If an excess of employees exists at an installation after satisfaction of the preconditions set forth in (B) above, the Employer may lay off employees within their respective seniority units as defined in the Agreement.
3.	Seniority units for purposes of layoff. Seniority units within the categories of full-time regular, part-time regular, and part-time flexible, will consist of all non-protected persons at a given level within an established craft at an installation unless the parties agree otherwise. It is the intent to provide the broadest possible unit consistent with the equities of senior non-protected employees and with the efficient operation of the installation.
4.	Union representation. Chief stewards and union stewards whose responsibilities bear a direct relationship to the effective and efficient representation of bargaining unit employees shall be placed at the top of the seniority unit roster in the order of their relative craft seniority for the purposes of layoff, reduction in force, and recall.
15
Article 6.C.5
5.	Reduction in force. If an excess of employees exists at an installation after satisfaction of the preconditions set forth in (B) above and after the layoff procedure has been applied, the Employer may implement a reduction in force as defined above. Such reduction will be conducted in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements that prevail at the time the force reduction is effected. Should applicable law and regulations require that other non-protected, nonpreference eligible employees from other seniority units be laid off prior to reduction in force, such employees will be laid off in inverse order of their craft seniority in the seniority unit.
In determining competitive levels and competitive areas applicable in a force reduction, the Employer will submit its proposal to the Union(s) at least 30 days prior to the reduction. The Union(s) will be afforded a full opportunity to make suggested revisions in the proposal. However, the Employer, having the primary responsibility for compliance with the statute and regulations, reserves the right to make the final decision with respect to competitive levels and competitive areas. In making its decision with respect to competitive levels and competitive areas the Employer shall give no greater retention security to preference eligibles than to non-preference eligibles except as may be required by law.
D.	Recall Rights
1.	Employees who are laid off or reduced in force shall be placed on recall lists within their seniority units and shall be entitled to remain on such lists for two years. Such employees shall keep the Employer
16
Article 6.D.2

4.	Following Regional notification, the parties will meet at the Regional/Area level to discuss the excessing event. At this meeting, the Employer will provide a listing of the residual vacancies for the excessing event.
If the radius of the event exceeds 50 miles, the parties will agree on a timeframe for the offering and awarding of the residual vacancies. This agreed-upon process is to provide the impacted employee(s) at least 60 days written notice of the awarded duty assignment prior to the reporting date, unless the parties agree to a lesser period.
If the radius is within 50 miles, the parties will agree on a timeframe for the offering and awarding of residual vacancies. This agreed-upon process is to provide the impacted employee(s) at least 30 days written notice of the awarded duty assignment prior to the reporting date, unless the parties agree to a lesser period.
51
Article 12.5.B.5
5.

6.	Any employee volunteering to accept reassignment to another craft or occupational group, another branch of the Postal Service, or another installation shall start a new period of seniority beginning with such assignment, except as provided herein.
7.	Whenever changes in mail handling patterns are undertaken in an area including one or more postal installations with resultant successive reassignments of clerks from those installations to one or more central installations, the reassignment of clerks shall be treated as details for the first 180 days in order to prevent inequities in the seniority lists at the gaining installations. The 180 days is computed from the date of the first detail of a clerk to the central, consolidated or new installation in that specific planning program. If a tie develops in establishing the merged seniority roster at the gaining installation, it shall be broken by total continuous service in the regular work force in the same craft.
8.	Whenever in this Agreement provision is made for reassignments, it is understood that any full-time or part-time flexible employee reassigned must meet the qualification requirements of the position to which reassigned.

1.	Discontinuance of an Independent Installation
a.	When an independent installation is discontinued, all full-time and part-time flexible employees shall, to the maximum extent possible, be involuntarily reassigned to continuing postal positions in accordance with the following:
53
Article 12.5.C.1 .b
b.	Involuntary reassignment of full-time employees with their seniority for duty assignments to vacancies in the same or lower level in the same craft or occupational group in installations within 100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with the Union, it is determined that it is necessary. The Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees. When two or more such vacancies are simultaneously available, first choice of duty assignment shall go to the senior employee entitled by displacement from a discontinued installation to such placement.
c.	Involuntary reassignment of full-time employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under C.1.b above in other crafts or occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualifications at the same or lower level with permanent seniority for duty assignments under (1) and (2) below, whichever is lesser:
(1)	One day junior to the seniority of the junior full-time employee in the same level and craft or occupation in the installation to which assigned, or
(2)	The seniority the employee had in the craft from which reassigned.
d.	Involuntary reassignment of part-time flexible employees with seniority in any vacancy in the part-time flexible quota in the same craft or occupational group at any installation within

Article 12.5.C.1.g
100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with the Union it is determined that it is necessary, the Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of the part-time flexible employees.
e.	Involuntary reassignment of part-time flexible employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under C.1.d above in other crafts or occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualification at the same or lower level at the foot of the existing part-time flexible roster at the receiving installation and begin a new period of seniority.
f.	Full-time employees for whom no full-time vacancies are available by the time the installation is discontinued shall be changed to part-time flexible employees in the same craft and placed as such, but shall for six months retain placement rights to full-time vacancies developing within that time within any installation within 100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with the Union it is necessary, U.S. Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees on the same basis as if they had remained full-time.
g.	Employees, full-time or part-time flexible, involuntarily reassigned as above provided shall upon the reestablishment of the discontinued installation be entitled to reassignment with full seniority to the first
55
Article 12.5.C.2
vacancy in the reestablished installation in the level, craft or occupational group from which reassigned.
(See Memo, page 342)
2.	Consolidation of an Independent Installation
a.	When an independent postal installation is consolidated with another postal installation, each full-time or part-time flexible employee shall be involuntarily reassigned to the continuing installation without loss of seniority in the employee’s craft or occupational group.
b.	Where reassignments under 2.a, preceding, result in an excess of employees in any craft or occupational group in the continuing installation, identification and placement of excess employees shall be accomplished by the continuing installation in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering such situations.
c.	If the consolidated installation again becomes an independent installation, each full-time and part-time flexible employee whose reassignment was necessitated by the previous consolidation shall be entitled to the first vacancy in the reestablished installation in the level and craft or occupational group held at the time the installation was discontinued.
3.	Transfer of a Classified Station or Classified Branch to the Jurisdiction of Another Installation or Made an Independent Installation
a.	When a classified station or classified branch is transferred to the jurisdiction of another
56
Article 12.5.C.4.a
installation or made an independent installation, all full-time employees shall at their option remain with the classified station or classified branch without loss of seniority, or remain with the installation from which the classified station or classified branch is being transferred.
b.	A realistic appraisal shall be made of the number of employees by crafts or occupations who will be needed in the station after transfer, and potential vacancies within these requirements created by the unwillingness of employees to follow the station to the new jurisdiction shall be posted for bid on an office-wide basis in the losing installation.
c.	If the postings provided in paragraph 3.b, preceding, do not result in sufficient employees to staff the transferred classified station or classified branch, junior employees, by craft or occupational group on an installation-wide seniority basis in the losing installation, shall be involuntarily reassigned to the classified station or classified branch and each employee thus involuntarily reassigned shall be entitled to the first vacancy in such employee’s level and craft or occupational group in the installation from which transferred.
4.	Reassignment	Within an Installation of
Employees Excess to the Needs of a Section
a.	The identification of assignments comprising for this purpose a section shall be determined locally by local negotiations. If no sections are
57
Article 12.5.C.4.b
established immediately by local negotiations, the entire installation shall comprise the section.
b.	Full-time employees, excess to the needs of a section, starting with that employee who is junior in the same craft or occupational group and in the same level assigned in that section, shall be reassigned outside the section but within the same craft or occupational group. They shall retain their seniority and may bid on any existing vacancies for which they are eligible to bid. If they do not bid, they may be assigned in any vacant duty assignment for which there was no senior bidder in the same craft and installation. Their preference is to be considered if more than one such assignment is available.
c.	Such reassigned full-time employee retains the right to retreat to the section from which withdrawn only upon the occurrence of the first residual vacancy in the salary level after employees in the section have completed bidding. Such bidding in the section is limited to employees in the same salary level as the vacancy. Failure to bid for the first available vacancy will end such retreat right. The right to retreat to the section is optional with the employee who has retreat rights with respect to a vacancy in a lower salary level. Failure to exercise the option does not terminate the retreat rights in the salary level in which the employee was reassigned away from the section. In the Clerk Craft, an employee may exercise the option to retreat to a vacancy in a lower salary level only to an assignment for
58
Article 12.5.C.5.a.(4)
which the employee would have been otherwise eligible to bid.
d.	The duty assignment vacated by the reassignment of the junior full-time employee from the section shall be posted for bid of the full-time employees in the section. If there are no bids, the junior remaining unassigned full-time employee in the section shall be assigned to the vacancy.
5.	Reduction in the Number of Employees in an Installation Other Than by Attrition
a.	Reassignments within installation. When for any reason an installation must reduce the number of employees more rapidly than is possible by normal attrition, that installation:
(1)	Shall determine by craft and occupational group the number of excess employees;
(2)	Shall, to the extent possible, minimize the impact on regular work force employees by separation of all PSEs;
(3)	Shall, to the extent possible, minimize the impact on full-time positions by reducing part-time flexible hours;
(4)	Shall identify as excess the necessary number of junior full-time employees in the salary level, craft, and occupational group affected on an installation-wide basis within the installation; make reassignments of excess full-time employees who meet the minimum qualifications for vacant assignments in
59
Article 12.5.C.5.a.(5)
other crafts in the same installation; involuntarily reassign them (except as provided for letter carriers and vehicle service employees in Section C.5.b below) in the same or lower level.
(5)	The employee shall be returned at the first opportunity to the craft from which reassigned. If an employee is reassigned to an APWU represented craft, when the installation notifies the employee in writing that he or she will be returned to the craft from which reassigned, and before the employee is returned, the employee may waive return to the former craft by written notification to the installation head or designee within five (5) calendar days of the notification.
(6)	When returned, the employee retains seniority previously attained in the craft augmented by intervening employment in the other craft.
(7)	The right of election by a senior employee provided in paragraph b(3), below is not available for this cross-craft reassignment within the installation except for reassignments solely between APWU represented crafts. A senior volunteer as provided in paragraph b(3) below shall be allowed between APWU represented crafts. Seniority for employees is established in the respective gaining craft article.
60
Article 12.5.C.5.b.(1).(a)
b.	Reassignments to other installations after making reassignments within the installation:
(1)	Involuntarily reassign such excess full-time employees starting with the junior with their seniority for duty assignments to vacancies in the same or lower level in the APWU crafts in installations within 100 miles of the losing installation, or in more distant installations if after consultation with the Union it is determined that it is necessary, the Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees. Employees who meet the minimum qualifications will be afforded their option of available vacancies by seniority. However:
(a) Whenever full-time or part-time motor vehicle craft assignments are discontinued in an installation and there is an excess in a position designation and salary level, the excess shall be adjusted to the maximum extent possible by making voluntary reassignments to vacant motor vehicle craft positions in installations within 100 miles unless the employee applies for a vacancy in	a more distant
installation.	Senior qualified
applicants for such vacant positions shall be reassigned. When reassignment	is in the same
61
Article 12.5.C.5.b.(2)
designation and salary level, the reassigned employee retains his/her seniority.
(2)	Involuntarily reassign full-time employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under b(1) above in other crafts or occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualifications at the same or lower level.
(See Memos, pages 336 and 338)
(3)	Any senior employee in the same craft or occupational group in the same installation may elect to be reassigned to the gaining craft/installation. Seniority for employees is established in the respective gaining craft article. Such senior employees who accept reassignment to the gaining installation do not have retreat rights.
(4)	When two or more such vacancies are simultaneously available, first choice of duty assignment shall go to the senior employee entitled by displacement from a discontinued installation to such placement.
(5)	In the Clerk Craft, in offices Level 20 and below, a full-time employee shall have the option of changing to a part-time flexible in lieu of involuntary reassignment.
(6)	Employees involuntarily reassigned under b(1) and (2) above, other than senior employees who elect to be reassigned in
62
Article 12.5.C.5.b.(6)
place of junior employees, shall be entitled at the time of such reassignment to file a written request to be returned to the first vacancy in the level, in the craft or occupational group in the installation from which reassigned, and such request shall be honored so long as the employee does not withdraw it or decline to accept an opportunity to return in accordance with such request.
In the Clerk Craft, an employee(s) involuntarily reassigned shall be entitled at the time of such reassignment to file a written request to return to the first vacancy in the craft and installation from which reassigned. Such request for retreat rights must indicate whether the employee(s) desires to retreat to the same, lower, and/or higher salary level assignment and, if so, what salary level(s). The employee(s) shall have the right to bid for vacancies within the former installation and the written request for retreat rights shall serve as a bid for all vacancies in the level from which the employee was reassigned and for all residual vacancies in other levels for which the employee has expressed a desire to retreat. The employee(s) may retreat to only those assignments for which the employee(s) would have been otherwise eligible to bid. If vacancies are available in a specified lower, higher or same salary level, the employee will be given the option. Failure to exercise
63
Article 12.5.C.6
retreat rights to the first available vacancy terminates such rights. Furthermore, employee(s) electing to retreat to a lower level assignment are not entitled to salary protection.
(See Memos, pages 337, 338, 342, and 411)
6.	Centralized Mail, Processing and/or Delivery Installation (Clerk Craft Only)
a.	When the operations at a centralized installation or other mail processing and/or delivery installation result in an excess of full-time clerks at another installation®, full-time clerks who are excess in a losing installation® by reason of the change, shall be reassigned as provided in Section C.5.b. Reassignments of clerks shall be treated as details for the first 180 days to avoid inequities in the selection of preferred duty assignments by full-time clerks in the gaining installation.
b.	Previously established preferred duty assignments which become vacant before expiration of the detail period must be posted for bid and awarded to eligible full-time clerks then permanently assigned in the gaining installation. Excess part-time flexible clerks may be reassigned as provided for in Section C.8.
c.	All new duty assignments created in the gaining installation and all other vacant duty assignments in the centralized installation shall be posted for bid. One hundred eighty (180) days is computed from the date of the first detail of an employee. Bidding shall be
64
Article 12.5.C.7.b
open to all full-time clerks of the craft involved at the gaining installation. This includes full-time clerks assigned to the gaining installation.
d.	When the centralized installation is a new one:
(1)	Full-time clerks who apply for reassignment from the losing installation, shall be reassigned with their seniority.
(2)	Reassignments shall be in the order of seniority and shall not exceed the number of excess full-time clerks in the losing installation.
(3)	The provisions of 5.a, above, apply to reassign junior full-time excess clerks, with their seniority, when there are excess full-time clerks after the reassignment of senior full-time clerks who apply for reassignment.
7.	Reassignments — Motor Vehicle
a.	When a vehicle maintenance facility is established to replace an auxiliary garage, full-time craft positions in the gaining installation are to be posted in the losing installation for applications by full-time employees, respectively. Senior qualified applicants shall be reassigned without loss of seniority, but not to exceed the number of excess employees in the losing installation.
b.	When a vehicle maintenance facility is established to replace vehicle maintenance in a perimeter office, full-time craft positions in the new maintenance facility shall be posted in the losing installation for applications by full

d.	After all reassignments have been made to the gaining installation, pursuant to Subsections a, b and c, the new full-time assignments in the gaining installation shall be posted for bid.
e.	If, after establishment of a new installation, operations result in further excess at losing installation(s), the procedures in Subsections a, b, c and d, above, apply to reassign senior applicants from the losing installation(s) to positions in the new installation.
8.	Reassignment — Part-Time Flexible Employees in Excess of Quota
Where there are part-time flexible employees in excess of the part-time flexible quota for the craft for whom work is not available, part-time flexibles lowest on the part-time flexible roll equal in number to such excess may at their option be reassigned to the foot of the part-time flexible roll in the same or another craft in another installation.
66
Article 12.5.C.8.d
a.	An excess employee reassigned to another craft in the same or another installation shall be assigned to the foot of the part-time flexible roll and begin a new period of seniority.
b.	An excess part-time flexible employee reassigned to the same craft in another installation shall be placed at the foot of the part-time flexible roll.

c.	A senior part-time flexible in the same craft or occupational group in the same installation may elect to be reassigned in another installation in the same or another craft and take the seniority, if any, of the senior excess part-time flexible being reassigned, as set forth in a and b, above.
d.	The Postal Service will designate, after consultation with the Union, vacancies at installations in which excess part-time flexibles may request to be reassigned beginning with vacancies in other crafts in the same installation; then vacancies in the same craft in other installations; and finally vacancies in other crafts in other installations making the designations to minimize relocation hardships to the extent practicable.

Article 13.2.A
ARTICLE 13
ASSIGNMENT OF ILL OR INJURED REGULAR WORKFORCE EMPLOYEES
Section 1.	Introduction
A.	Part-time fixed schedule employees assigned in the craft unit shall be considered to be in a separate category. All provisions of this Article apply to part-time fixed schedule employees within their own category.
B.	The U.S. Postal Service and the Union recognizing their responsibility to aid and assist deserving full-time regular or part-time flexible employees who through illness or injury are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties, agree to the following provisions and conditions for reassignment to temporary or permanent light duty or other assignments. It will be the responsibility of each installation head to implement the provisions of this Agreement within the installation, after local negotiations.
Section 2.	Employee’s Request for Reassignment
A.	Temporary Reassignment
Any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee recuperating from a serious illness or injury and temporarily unable to perform the assigned duties may voluntarily submit a written request to the installation head for temporary assignment to a light duty or other assignment. The request shall be supported by a medical statement from a licensed physician or by a written statement from a licensed chiropractor stating, when possible, the anticipated duration of the convalescence period. Such employee agrees to submit to a further examination by a Public Health Service doctor or physician designated by the installation head, if that official so requests.
69
Article 13.2.B
B.	Permanent Reassignment
1.	Any ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee having a minimum of five years of postal service, or any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee who sustained injury on duty, regardless of years of service, while performing the assigned duties can submit a voluntary request for permanent reassignment to light duty or other assignment to the installation head if the employee is permanently unable to perform all or part of the assigned duties. The request shall be accompanied by a medical certificate from the United States Public Health Service or a physician designated by the installation head giving full evidence of the physical condition of the employee, the need for reassignment, and the ability of the employee to perform other duties. A certificate from the employee’s personal physician will not be acceptable.
2.	The following procedures are the exclusive procedures for resolving a disagreement between the employee’s physician and the physician designated by the USPS concerning the medical condition of an employee who has requested a permanent light duty assignment. These procedures shall not apply to cases where the employee’s medical condition arose out of an occupational illness or injury. On request of the Union, a third physician will be selected from a list of five Board Certified Specialists in the medical field for the condition in question, the list to be supplied by the local Medical Society. The physician will be selected by the alternate striking of names from the list by the Union and the Employer. The Employer will supply the selected physician with all relevant
70
Article 13.3.B
facts including job description and occupational physical requirements. The decision of the third physician will be final as to the employee’s medical condition and occupational limitations, if any. Any other issues relating to the employee’s entitlement to a light duty assignment shall be resolved through the grievance-arbitration procedure. The costs of the services of the third physician shall be shared by the Union and the Employer.
C.	Installation heads shall show the greatest consideration for full-time regular or part-time flexible employees requiring light duty or other assignments, giving each request careful attention, and reassign such employees to the extent possible in the employee’s office. When a request is refused, the installation head shall notify the concerned employee in writing, stating the reasons for the inability to reassign the employee.
Section 3.	Local Implementation
Due to varied size installations and conditions within installations, the following important items having a direct bearing on these reassignment procedures (establishment of light duty assignments) should be determined by local negotiations.
A.	Through local negotiations, each office will establish the assignments that are to be considered light duty within each craft represented in the office. These negotiations should explore ways and means to make adjustments in normal assignments, to convert them to light duty assignments without seriously affecting the production of the assignment.
B.	Light duty assignments may be established from part-time hours, to consist of 8 hours or less in a service day and 40 hours or less in a service week. The establishment of such assignment does not guarantee any hours to a part-time flexible employee.
71
Article 13.3.C
C.	Number of Light Duty Assignments. The number of assignments within each craft that may be reserved for temporary or permanent light duty assignments, consistent with good business practices, shall be determined by past experience as to the number of reassignments that can be expected during each year, and the method used in reserving these assignments to insure that no assigned full-time regular employee will be adversely affected, will be defined through local negotiations. The light duty employee’s tour hours, work location and basic work week shall be those of the light duty assignment and the needs of the service, whether or not the same as for the employee’s previous duty assignment.
Section 4.	General Policy Procedures
A.	Every effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee’s present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the PSEs. After all efforts are exhausted in this area, consideration will be given to reassignment to another craft or occupational group within the same installation.
B.	The full-time regular or part-time flexible employee must be able to meet the qualifications of the position to which the employee is reassigned on a permanent basis. On a temporary reassignment, qualifications can be modified provided excessive hours are not used in the operation.
C.	The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee to a temporary or permanent light duty or other assignment shall not be made to the detriment of any full-time regular on a scheduled assignment or give a reassigned part-time flexible preference over other part-time flexible employees.
D.	The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee under the provisions of this Article to an agreed-upon light duty temporary or permanent or other
72
Article 13.4.G
assignment within the office, such as type of assignment, area of assignment, hours of duty, etc., will be the decision of the installation head who will be guided by the examining physician’s report, employee’s ability to reach the place of employment and ability to perform the duties involved.
E.	An additional full-time regular position can be authorized within the craft or occupational group to which the employee is being reassigned, if the additional position can be established out of the part-time hours being used in that operation without increasing the overall hour usage. If this cannot be accomplished, then consideration will be given to reassignment to an existing vacancy.
F.	The installation head shall review each light duty reassignment at least once each year, or at any time the installation head has reason to believe the incumbent is able to perform satisfactorily in other than the light duty assignment the employee occupies. This review is to determine the need for continuation of the employee in the light duty assignment. Such employee may be requested to submit to a medical review by the United States Public Health Service or by a physician designated by the installation head if the installation head believes such examination to be necessary.
G.	The following procedures are the exclusive procedures for resolving a disagreement between the employee’s physician and the physician designated by the USPS concerning the medical condition of an employee who is on a light duty assignment. These procedures shall not apply to cases where the employee's medical condition arose out of an occupational illness or injury. On request of the Union, a third physician will be selected from a list of five Board Certified Specialists in the medical field for the condition in question, the list to be supplied by the local Medical Society. The physician will be selected by the alternate striking of names from the list by the Union and the Employer. The Employer will supply the
73
Article 13.4.H
selected physician with all relevant facts including job description and occupational physical requirements. The decision of the third physician will be final as to the employee’s medical condition and occupational limitations, if any. Any other issues relating to the employee’s entitlement to a light duty assignment shall be resolved through the grievancearbitration procedure. The costs of the services of the third physician shall be shared by the Union and the Employer.
H.	When a full-time regular employee in a temporary light duty assignment is declared recovered on medical review, the employee shall be returned to the employee’s former duty assignment, if it has not been discontinued. If such former regular assignment has been discontinued the employee becomes an unassigned full-time regular employee.
I.	If a full-time regular employee is reassigned in another craft for permanent light duty and later is declared recovered, on medical review, the employee shall be returned to the first available full-time regular vacancy in complement in the employee’s former craft. Pending return to such former craft, the employee shall be an unassigned full-time regular employee. The employee’s seniority shall be restored to include service in the light duty assignment.
J.	When a full-time regular employee who has been awarded a permanent light duty assignment within the employee's own craft is declared recovered, on medical review, the employee shall become an unassigned full-time regular employee.
K.	When a part-time flexible on temporary light duty is declared recovered, the employee’s detail to light duty shall be terminated.
L.	When a part-time flexible who has been reassigned in another craft on permanent light duty is declared recovered, such assignment to light duty shall be terminated. Section 4.1,
74
Article 13.5.G
above, does not apply even- though the employee has advanced to full-time regular while on light duty;
M.	Management will give the local union president advance written notification when it is proposed to reassign an ill or injured light or limited duty employee to a cross-craft assignment into an APWU represented craft.
Section 5.	Filling Vacancies Due to Reassignment of an Employee to Another Craft
When it is necessary to permanently reassign an ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee who is unable to perform the regularly assigned duties, from one craft to another craft within the office,-the following procedures will be followed:
A.	When the reassigned-' employee is’ a full-time regular employee, the resulting full-time regular vacancy in the complement, not necessarily in the particular duty assignment of the losing craft from which the employee is being reassigned, shall be posted to give the senior of the full-time regular employees in the gaining craft the opportunity, to be reassigned to the vacancy, if desired.	,
B:	If no full-time regular employee accepts the opportunity to be assigned to the vacancy in the complement,' not necessarily in the particular duty assignment in the other craft, the senior of the part-time flexibles on the opposite roll who wishes to accept the vacancy shall be assigned to the full-time regular vacancy in the complement of the craft of the reassigned employee.
C.	When the reassigned employee is a part-time flexible, the resulting vacancy in the losing craft shall be posted to give the senior of the full-time regular or part-time flexible employees in the gaining craft the opportunity to be assigned to the part-time flexible vacancy, if desired, to begin a new period of seniority at the foot of the part-time flexible roll.
75
Article 13.5.D
D.	The rule in A and B, above, applies when a full-time regular employee on permanent light duty is declared recovered and is returned to the employee’s former craft, to give the senior of the full-time regular or part-time flexible employees in the gaining craft the opportunity, if desired, to be assigned in the resulting full-time regular vacancy in the complement, not necessarily in the particular duty assignment of the losing craft.
Section 6.	Seniority of an Employee Assigned to Another Craft
A.	Except as provided for in Section 4.1, above, a full-time regular employee assigned to another craft or occupational group in the same or lower level in the same installation shall take the seniority for preferred tours and assignments, whichever is the lesser of (a) one day junior to the junior full-time regular employee in the craft or occupational group, (b) retain the seniority the employee had in the employee’s former craft.
B.	A part-time flexible employee who is permanently assigned to a full-time regular or part-time flexible assignment in another craft, under the provisions of this Article, shall begin a new period of seniority. If assigned as a part-time flexible, it shall be at the foot of the part-time flexible roll.

ARTICLE 15 GRIEVANCE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Definition
A grievance is defined as a dispute, difference, disagreement or complaint between the parties related to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. A grievance shall include, but is not limited to, the complaint of an employee or of the Union which involves the interpretation, application of, or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or any local Memorandum of Understanding not in conflict with this Agreement.
Section 2.	Grievance Procedure Steps
Step 1:
(a)	Any employee who feels aggrieved must discuss the grievance with the employee’s immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the employee or the Union first learned or may reasonably have been expected to have learned of its cause. The employee, if he or she so desires, may be accompanied and represented by the employee's steward or a Union representative. The Union also may initiate a grievance at Step 1 within 14 days of the date the Union first became aware of (or reasonably should have become aware of) the facts giving rise to the grievance. In such case the participation of an individual grievant is not required. A Step 1 Union grievance may involve a complaint affecting more than one employee in the office. When the Union files a class action grievance, Management will designate the appropriate employer representative responsible for handling such complaint.
(b)	In any such discussion the supervisor shall have authority to settle the grievance. The steward or other Union representative likewise shall have authority to settle or
87
Article 15.2.Step 1 -(c)
withdraw the grievance in whole or in part. No resolution reached as a result of such discussion shall be a precedent for any purpose.
(c)	If no resolution is reached as a result of such discussion, the supervisor shall render a decision orally stating the reasons for the decision. The supervisor’s decision should be stated during the discussion, if possible, but in no event shall it be given to the Union representative (or the grievant, if no Union representative was requested) later than five (5) days thereafter unless the parties agree to extend the five (5) day period. Within five (5) days after the supervisor’s decision, the supervisor shall, at the request of the Union representative, initial the standard grievance form that is used at Step 2 confirming the date upon which the decision was rendered.
(d)	The Union shall be entitled to appeal an adverse decision to Step 2 of the grievance procedure within ten (10) days after receipt of the supervisor’s decision. Such appeal shall be made by completing a standard grievance form developed by agreement of the parties, which shall include appropriate space for at least the following:
1.	Detailed statement of facts;
2.	Contentions of the grievant;
3.	Particular contractual provisions involved; and
4.	Remedy sought.
Step 2:
(a)	The standard grievance form appealing to Step 2 shall be filed with the installation head or designee. In any associate post office of twenty (20) or less employees, the Employer shall designate an official outside of the installation as the Step 2 official, and shall so notify the Union Step 1 representative.
88
Article 15.2.Step 2.(e)
(b)	Any grievance initiated at Step 2, pursuant to Article 2 or 14 of this Agreement must be filed within 14 days of the date on which the Union or the employee first learned or may reasonably have been expected to have learned of its cause.
(c)	The installation head or designee will meet with the steward or a Union representative as expeditiously as possible, but no later than seven (7) days following receipt of the Step 2 appeal unless the parties agree upon a later date. In all grievances appealed from Step 1 or filed at Step 2, the grievant shall be represented in Step 2 for all purposes by a steward or a Union representative who shall have authority to settle or withdraw the grievance as a result of discussions or compromise in this Step. The installation head or designee in Step 2 also shall have authority to grant or settle the grievance in whole or in part.
(d)	At the meeting the Union representative shall make a full and detailed statement of facts relied upon, contractual provisions involved, and remedy sought.

The parties’ representatives shall cooperate fully in the effort to develop all necessary facts, including the exchange of copies of all relevant papers or documents in accordance with Article 31. The parties’ representatives may mutually agree to jointly interview witnesses where desirable to assure full development of all facts and contentions. In addition, in cases involving discharge either party shall have the right to present no more than two witnesses. Such right shall not preclude the parties from jointly agreeing to interview additional witnesses as provided above.
(e)	Any settlement or withdrawal of a grievance in Step 2 shall be in writing or shall be noted on the standard grievance form, but shall not be a precedent for any purpose, unless the
89
Article 15.2.Step 2.(f)
parties specifically so agree or develop an agreement to dispose of future similar or related problems.
(f)	Where agreement is not reached the Employer’s decision shall be furnished to the Union representative in writing, within ten (10) days after the Step 2 meeting unless the parties agree to extend the ten (10) day period.

(g)	If the Union representative believes that the facts or contentions set forth in the decision are incomplete or inaccurate, such representative should, within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step 2 decision, transmit to the Employer’s representative a written statement setting forth corrections or additions deemed necessary by the Union. Any such statement must be included in the file as part of the grievance record in the case. The filing of such corrections or additions shall not affect the time limits for appeal to Step 3 or arbitration.
(h)	The Union may appeal an adverse Step 2 decision to Step 3. Any such appeal must be made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Employer’s decision unless the parties’ representatives agree to extend the time for appeal. However, the Union may appeal an adverse Step 2 decision directly to arbitration for disciplinary grievances or contract grievances which involve the interpretation, application of, or compliance with the provisions of any local Memorandum of Understanding not in conflict with this Agreement, and those issues the parties have agreed are appealed to Expedited Arbitration. These grievances will be appealed to the appropriate Grievance/Arbitration Processing Center within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Employer’s Step 2 decision. Any appeal must include copies of (1) the standard grievance form, (2) the Employer’s written Step 2 decision, and, if filed, (3) the Union corrections or additions to the Step 2 decision.

Each party's- Step 3 representative shall be responsible for making certain that all' relevant facts and contentions have been developed and considered. The Union representative shall have'authority to settle or withdraw the grievance in whole or in part. The Employer’s representative likewise shall have authority to grant the'grievance in whole or in part. Where either party believes the facts and contentions were not adequately addressed or documented at Step 2, the party’s representatives shall clearly identify those additional facts and/or contentions for consideration and provide any additional , relevant documentation to facilitate' discussion and possible resolution at Step 3. In addition, where the parties’ representatives mutually agree that relevant facts or contentions were not adequately developed at Step 2, they may jointly remand the grievance'to Step 2 level for full development of the facts and further consideration. In such event, the parties' representatives at Step 2 shall meet within seven (7) days after the grievance is returned to Step 2. Thereafter, the time limits and procedures applicable to Step 2 grievances shall apply.
(c)	The Employer's written Step 3 decision on the grievance shall be provided to the Union’s Step 3 representative within fifteen (15) days after the parties have met in Step 3, unless the
91
Article 15.2.Step 3.(d)
parties agree to extend the fifteen (15) day period. Such decision shall state the reasons for the decision in detail and shall include a statement of any additional facts and contentions not previously set forth in the record of the grievance as appealed from Step 2. If the Union representative believes that the facts or contentions set forth in the decision are incomplete or inaccurate, such representative must, within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step 3 decision, transmit to the Employer’s representative a written statement setting forth corrections or additions deemed necessary by the Union. Any such statement must be included in the file as part of the grievance record in the case. The filing of such corrections or additions shall not affect the time limits for appeal to arbitration. The parties reserve the right to supplement the grievance file with correspondence up to and including arbitration. If either party’s Step 3 representative believes that an interpretive issue under the National Agreement or some supplement thereto which may be of general application is involved in the case, the issue will be discussed with the appropriate National Union/ Management Representatives at the Headquarters Level. If either party’s National Representative determines the issue to be interpretive, a written notice will be sent to the other party specifying in detail the facts giving rise to the dispute, the precise interpretive issues to be decided and the initiating party’s contention. The grievance(s) shall be held at the Area and/or District Level pending discussion at the national level or the outcome of a National Arbitration award.
(d)	The Union may appeal an adverse decision directly to arbitration at the appropriate Grievance/Arbitration Processing Center within twenty-one (21) days after the receipt of the Employer's Step 3 decision in accordance with the procedure hereinafter set forth.

92
Article 15.2.Step 3.(f)
be selected by the Union representative shall be designated the “representative” grievance. If not resolved at Step 3, the “representative” grievance may be appealed to arbitration in accordance with the above and placed at the head of the appropriate arbitration.docket,' or the issue will be referred to the; parties’, national representatives at; the Headquarters level pursuant to (c) above. All other grievances which have been mutually agreed to as involving the same, or substantially similar issues or facts as those involved in the “representative” grievance shall be held; at Step 3 pending resolution of the “representative” grievance, provided they were timely.filed at Step 1 and properly appealed to Steps 2 and 3-ini accordance with the grievance procedure.
Following resolution of the “representative” grievance, the parties involved in that grievance shall meet at Step 3 to apply the resolution to the.other pending grievances involving the same or substantially similar issues or facts. Disputes over the applicability of the resolution of the “representative” grievance shall be resolved through the grievance-arbitration procedures contained in this Article; in the event it is decided that, the resolution of the “representative” grievance is not.applicable to a particular grievance, the merits of that grievance shall also be considered.
(f)	In order to discourage the filing of multiple local grievances involving any new or changed District or Area-wide policy, instructions,' or guidelines, the APWU Regional Coordinator or National Business Agent may file one grievance concerning such policy, instructions, or guidelines, directly at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. The grievance may be filed within fourteen (14) days of. the date on which such union representative first learned or may reasonably have been expected to have learned of the implementation of such policy, instructions, or guidelines. Timely local grievances, which had already been filed concerning such policy, instructions,, or guidelines, will be held at or returned to Step 2 of the grievance
93
Article 15.2.Step 4
procedure, as applicable, pending the resolution of the grievance filed directly at Step 3. Thereafter, local grievances will be finally adjudicated in accordance with the resolution of the grievance filed directly at Step 3. If not resolved, the grievance filed directly at Step 3 may be appealed to arbitration within twenty-one (21) days and placed at the head of the appropriate arbitration docket.
Step 4:

The Union representative shall have authority to settle or withdraw the dispute in whole or in part. The Employer’s representative shall have authority to grant or settle the dispute in whole or in part. The parties’ Step 4 representatives may, by mutual agreement, return any dispute to Step 3 where (a) the parties agree that no national interpretive issue is fairly presented or (b) it appears that all relevant facts have not been developed adequately. In such event, the parties shall meet at Step 3 within fifteen (15) days after the dispute is returned to Step 3. Thereafter the procedures and time limits applicable to Step 3 grievances shall apply. Should the parties at the National level fail to reach agreement, then within fifteen (15) days of such meeting each party shall provide the other with a statement in writing of its understanding of the issues involved, and the facts giving rise to the interpretive dispute. In the event the parties have failed to reach agreement within sixty (60) days of the initiation of the dispute, the Union then may appeal it to national arbitration within thirty (30) days thereafter. Any local grievances filed on the specific interpretive issue shall be held in abeyance at the appropriate level pending resolution of the national interpretive dispute.
94
Article 15.3.D
Section 3. Mediation
Where the local parties identify the need for either assistance in the grievance/arbitration procedure or the need to improve the labor/management relationship, the following mediation process may be invoked:
A. The local installation head and the local Union president (local parties) may jointly initiate a request for mediation where they identify, such a need in a particular installation. Such joint request must be in writing and submitted to the parties’ designated.Area/Regional level representatives.
• B.. . Such Area/Regional level representatives may also recommend mediation for a particular installation. However, when a recommendation for mediation is made by the Area/ Regional level representatives, such recommendation must be discussed with and agreed to by the local parties before the mediation process can be invoked at the local site.
C.	The mediation will be conducted jointly by the Union official designated by the President of the Union and management official designated by the Vice President/Labor Relations (USPS). The designated officials will have been trained, and/or certified in the dispute resolution process. Such designated union/management mediation representatives will be utilized to assist the.local parties in an effort to resolve timely grievances, as defined in Article 15, Sections 1 and 2, as well as any identified local issues or problems. .
D.	The designated union/management mediation representatives will meet at the local installation within thirty (30) days of the. joint mediation request, which is described in Section 3.A or B above. At least seven (7) days prior to the onsite meeting, the local parties will jointly provide the mediation representatives with an agenda and .all,-available relevant .information: In the event the local parties cannot agree.on an agenda, for mediation', each, party will submit their respective
95
Article 15.3.E
agendas to the mediation representatives seven (7) days prior to the on-site meeting, as well as all available relevant information.
E.	The mediation will be held with the local parties to explore ways of resolving the previously submitted agenda items, as well as to seek ways of improving the labor/ management climate within the installation. The mediation process, including all meetings connected with mediation, is considered to be off-the-record. However, all resolutions will be on the record, in writing and jointly signed by the local parties. Where the local parties agree, a particular mediation resolution(s) will serve as precedent for that installation, provided such resolution does not violate the National Agreement.
If the local parties are unable to reach a resolution on pending grievances of those local issues for which they have jointly requested mediation, then the mediation representatives may jointly resolve any of the above referenced issues or grievances.
F.	The Employer’s mediation representative will provide to the appropriate Union official a statement of position for each grievance(s) listed on the agenda, which is not resolved through mediation, within fifteen (15) days of the final mediation meeting. Within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the statement of position, the Union may appeal such grievance(s) to District level arbitration.
Section 4.	Grievance Procedure — General
A.	The parties expect that good faith observance, by their respective representatives, of the principles and procedures set forth above will result in settlement or withdrawal of substantially all grievances initiated hereunder at the lowest possible step and recognize their obligation to achieve that end. Every effort shall be made to ensure timely compliance
96
Article 15.4.C
and payment of monetary grievance settlements and arbitration awards. The Employer agrees that upon receipt of necessary paperwork from the grievant and/or union, concerning a grievance settlement or arbitration award, monetary remuneration will be made. The necessary paperwork, is the documents and statements specified in Subchapter. 436.4'of the ELM. The .Employer will provide the union copies of appropriate pay adjustment forms, including confirmation that , such. forms .were submitted to. the appropriate.postal officials for compliance and that action has been taken ,'to: ensure, that affected 'employee(s) receives payment and/or other benefits. In the event that an employee is not paid . within sixty'(60) days after1 submission of all-the necessary paperwork, such employee, upon request, will be granted authorization from management to receive a pay advance equal to the net amount due, or seventy (70) percent of the payment owed the employee, whichever is less. In the event of a dispute between the parties concerning the correct amount to be paid, the advance required by this section will be the amount that is not in dispute.
B.	The failure of the employee or the Union in Step 1, or the Union thereafter to meet the prescribed time limits of the Steps of this procedure, including arbitration, shall be considered as a. waiver of the grievance. However, if the Employer fails to raise the issue of timeliness at' Step 2, or at the step at which the. employee or Union failed to meet the prescribed time limits, whichever is later, such objection to the processing of .the grievance is waived.
C.	Failure by the Employer to schedule a meeting or render a decision in'any of the Steps of this procedure within the time herein provided (including mutually agreed to extension periods) shall be deemed to move the grievance to the next Step of the grievance-arbitration procedure.
97
Article 15.4.D
D.	It is agreed that in the event of a dispute between the Union and the Employer as to the interpretation of this Agreement, such dispute may be initiated at the Step 4 level by either party. Such a dispute shall be initiated in writing and must specify in detail the facts giving rise to the dispute, the precise interpretive issues to be decided and the contention of either party. Thereafter the parties shall meet in Step 4 within thirty (30) days in an effort to define the precise issues involved, develop all necessary facts, and reach agreement. Should they fail to agree, then, within fifteen (15) days of such meeting, each party shall provide the other with a statement in writing of its understanding of the issues involved, and the facts giving rise to such issues. In the event the parties have failed to reach agreement within sixty (60) days of the initiation of the dispute in Step 4, the Union then may appeal it to arbitration, within thirty (30) days thereafter. Any local grievances filed on the specific interpretive issue shall be held in abeyance at the appropriate level pending resolution of the national interpretive dispute.

If either party’s representative at the Headquarters level determines the case is interpretive, a notice will be sent to the other party. The case will be held pending the outcome of the National interpretive dispute. If both parties’
102
Article 15.5.B.a.
representatives determine the case does not involve an interpretive issue, the case if already scheduled for arbitration will be heard before the same arbitrator who was originally scheduled to hear the case. Further, if the hearing had convened, the case will continue at the same stage of arbitration.
(See Memo, page 353)
6.	The arbitrators on each Regular District Panel shall be scheduled to hear cases on a rotating system basis, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The hearing time available for arbitration will be distributed among offices and crafts.

(See Memo, page 349)
(The preceding Article, Article 15, shall apply to PSEs)
106
Article 16.2
ARTICLE 16 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Principles
In the administration of this Article, a basic principle shall be that discipline should be corrective in nature, rather than punitive. No employee may be disciplined or discharged except for just cause such as, but not limited to, insubordination, pilferage, intoxication (drugs or alcohol), incompetence, failure to perform work as requested, violation of the terms of this Agreement, or failure to observe safety rules and regulations. Any such discipline or discharge shall be subject to the grievance-arbitration procedure provided for in this Agreement, which could result in reinstatement and restitution, including back pay.
Section 2.	Discussion
For minor offenses by an employee, management has a responsibility to discuss such matters with the employee. Discussions of this type shall be held in private between the employee and the supervisor. Such discussions are not considered discipline and are not grievable. Following such discussions, there is no prohibition against the supervisor and/ or the employee making a personal notation of the date and subject matter for their own personal record(s). However, no notation or other information pertaining to such discussion shall be included in the employee's personnel folder. While such discussions may not be cited as an element of prior adverse record in any subsequent disciplinary action against an employee, they may be, where relevant and timely, relied upon to establish that employees have been made aware of their obligations and responsibilities.
107
Article 16.3
Section 3.	Letter of Warning
A letter of warning is a disciplinary notice in writing, identified as an official disciplinary letter of warning, which shall include an explanation of a deficiency or misconduct to be corrected.
(See Memo, page 358)
Section 4.	Suspensions of 14 Days or Less
In the case of discipline involving suspensions of fourteen (14) days or less, the employee against whom disciplinary action is sought to be initiated shall be served with a written notice of the charges against the employee and shall be further informed that he/she will be suspended after ten (10) calendar days during which ten-day period the employee shall remain on the job or on the clock (in pay status) at the option of the Employer. However, if a timely grievance is initiated, the effective date of the suspension will be delayed until disposition of the grievance, either by settlement or an arbitrator’s final and binding decision. The employee shall remain on the job or on the clock (in pay status) at the option of the Employer.
Section 5.	Suspensions of More Than 14 Days or Discharge
In the case of suspensions of more than fourteen (14) days, or of discharge, any employee shall, unless otherwise provided herein, be entitled to an advance written notice of the charges against him/her and shall remain either on the job or on the clock at the option of the Employer for a period of thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the employee shall remain on the rolls (nonpay status) until disposition of the case has been had either by settlement with the Union or through exhaustion of the grievance-arbitration procedure. A preference eligible who chooses to appeal a suspension of more than fourteen (14) days or his/her discharge to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) rather than through the grievance-arbitration
108
Article 16.6.C
procedure, shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of. the. case has been had either-by settlement or through-exhaustion of his/her MSPB appeal. When there is reasonable cause to believe an employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of . imprisonment can be imposed, the Employer is not required to give the employee the full thirty (30) days advance written notice in a discharge action, but shall give such lesser number of days advance written notice as under the circumstances is reasonable and can be justified. The employee is immediately removed from a pay status at the end of the notice period.
Section 6.	Indefinite Suspension Crime Situation
-A. The Employer may indefinitely suspend an employee in those cases where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe an employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed. In such cases, the Employer is not required to give the employee , the full thirty (30) days advance notice of indefinite suspension, but shall give such lesser number of days of advance written notice as under the circumstances is reasonable and can be justified. The employee is immediately removed from a pay status at the end of the notice period.
B.	The just cause of an indefinite suspension is grievable. The arbitrator shall have the authority to reinstate and make the employee whole for the entire?-period of the indefinite suspension.
C: If after further investigation or after resolution of the criminal charges against the employee, the Employer determines to return-the employee to a pay status, the emplpyee shall be entitled to back pay for the period that the indefinite suspension exceeded seventy,? (70) days,, if the employee was otherwise available for duty, and without prejudice to any grievance filed under B. above.
•109
Article 16.6.D
D. The Employer may take action to discharge an employee during the period of an indefinite suspension whether or not the criminal charges have been resolved, and whether or not such charges have been resolved in favor of the employee. Such action must be for just cause, and is subject to the requirements of Section 5 of this Article.
Section 7.	Emergency Procedure
An employee may be immediately placed on an off-duty status (without pay) by the Employer, but remain on the rolls where the allegation involves intoxication (use of drugs or alcohol), pilferage, or failure to observe safety rules and regulations, or in cases where retaining the employee on duty may result in damage to U.S. Postal Service property, loss of mail or funds, or where the employee may be injurious to self or others. The employee shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of the case has been had. If it is proposed to suspend such an employee for more than thirty (30) days or discharge the employee, the emergency action taken under this Section may be made the subject of a separate grievance.
Section 8.	Review of Discipline
In no case may a supervisor impose suspension or discharge upon an employee unless the proposed disciplinary action by the supervisor has first been reviewed and concurred in by the installation head or designee.

158
Article 37.2.D.1
standing, it is the responsibility of the requesting employee to identify and restate the specific instructions, rule or practice in support of the request.
B:	Coverage
These rules apply to. all employees in the regular work force when a guide is necessary for filling vacant assignments and for other purposes. No employee, solely by reason of this Article, shall be displaced from an assignment the employee gained in accord with former rules.
C.	Responsibility

D.	Application of Seniority
1.	Seniority for full-time employees for bidding and other purposes shall be applied in accordance with the National Agreement. This seniority determines the relative standing among full-time employees.

3.	Relative Standing on the Part-Time Flexible Roll
a.	Part-time flexible employees are placed on the part-time flexible roll in the order of the date of career appointment as a part-time flexible from a competitive Postal Service eligible register or other means. In cases of appointment of more than one employee to the part-time flexible roll on the same day from the same competitive register, their positions on the part-time flexible roll will be in accord with their standing on the Postal Service eligible register.
In cases of appointment of more than one employee to the part-time flexible roll on the same day from different registers, their positions on the part-time flexible roll will be determined in accordance with their scores on the entrance examination applicable to the position for which hired.
If a tie still exists, standing on the part-time flexible roll will be determined by the application of Section 2.D.4 below.
b.	A reinstated, reassigned, or transferred employee shall be placed on the part-time
160
Article 37.2.D.4.h
flexible roll ahead of one appointed from the register on the same day.
c.	Continuous time in the Clerk Craft in the same installation shall be used for vacation scheduling.
4.	Seniority Tie Breaker

The date of recovery in the case of disability retirement must be supported by notice of recovery from The Compensation Group, Office of Personnel Management, and in the case of resignation due to illness, by a statement from the applicant’s attending physician or practitioner. When reinstatement is to the part-time flexible roll, standing on the roll shall be the same as if employment had not been interrupted by the separation.

a.	In installations where 105 or more hours of training are required for position qualification and a full-time duty assignment in any of the above position designations requires scheme qualification, the deferment period for scheme(s) and position qualification will not be concurrent.
b.	An employee who is designated the senior bidder for any of the positions listed in F.7. above and who subsequently fails to satisfactorily complete the training or withdraws from the bid will be restricted from bidding on posted duty assignments in that position designation for a period of 180 days, except as provided for in (1) and (2) below. The 180 day restriction begins on the effective date of the withdrawal, or, if an examination is required, on the date the employee took the examination.
This bidding restriction does not apply if:
184
Article 37.3.F.8.c.(2)
(1)	The employee’s bid duty assignment is abolished or reposted during the 180-day bidding restriction.
(2)	The employee withdraws prior to completion of 25% of the position qualification training hours.
8.	a. When an employee is designated as successful bidder and remains a live bidder on other bids, the employee shall notify management in writing within ten days of his/ her election to remain a bidder on one or more of those assignments. The notice shall identify the assignment(s) by job and posting number. Failure to notify within ten days will cancel such other bids.
b.	When an employee is in a deferment period and would be designated a senior or successful bidder on a previous bid, the employee will be given a choice to remain in training or become the senior or successful bidder on the previous bid.
c.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in 3.F.3, 3.F.4, and 3.F.7, any of the following shall end the deferment period, and the duty assignment shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Article:
(1)	The senior bidder withdraws prior to the end of the deferment period;
(2)	The senior bidder is designated the senior or successful bidder on a subsequent posting during the deferment period. Eligibility to demonstrate a skill

Article 37.3.F.8.c.(3)
per 3.F.5 does not end a deferment period.
(3)	The senior bidder otherwise relinquishes the employee’s rights (voluntarily or involuntarily) to the assignment.
d.	Any withdrawal, to be official, shall be date stamped or if done by telephone or computer, must have confirmation.
9.	Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding concerning use of full-time employees on Relief and Pool duty assignments, such assignments in the Clerk Craft shall normally be used to cover:
a.	Vacancies and absences (in their own installation or other installations as designated in the employee’s bid) of employees holding full-time bid assignments or Postmasters in:
(1)	Stations or Branches;
(2)	Window Service;
(3)	Customer Service, Finance or E&LR.
b.	Functions which predictably occur at the end of the accounting period (Timekeeper, Examination Specialist, etc.)
(See Memo, page 380)
10.	Normally, the successful bidder shall work the duty assignment as posted and shall not be displaced by a junior employee. This does not prohibit the Employer from assigning other employees to work the assignment for training purposes.
186
Article 37.4.C.3
Section 4.	Unencumbered Employees
A.	Coverage. Full-time flexible employees and unassigned regular employees are considered unencumbered employees.
B.	An employee who becomes an unassigned regular will continue to work the same hours and scheduled days the employee worked immediately prior to becoming unassigned unless notified of a change in work schedule before expiration of the first 28 days after the date on which the employee became unassigned. Additional work schedule changes may be made, provided that such change cannot be made effective until 180 days after the effective date of any previous change.
C.	Assignment of Unencumbered Employees
Assignment of unencumbered employee(s) will be made within 21 days of the duty assignment becoming residual (Article37.1) in accordance with the following:
1.	Any unencumbered employee® who becomes unencumbered for any reason will receive saved grade (Article 37.4.C.6.a) if he/she voluntarily bids to a lower level duty assignment(s) prior to or during the involuntary assignments. Once an employee is assigned to a same or higher level duty assignment (Article 37.4.C.5) and notified in writing of an assignment this option of bidding a lower level duty assignment will no longer be available.
2.	If there are sufficient same or higher level vacancies, unencumbered employees shall be involuntarily assigned to same or higher level vacancies in accordance with Article 37, Section 4.C.5.
3.	If there are insufficient same or higher level vacancies to accommodate assignment of all unencumbered employees, preference eligible
187
Article 37.4.C.4
employees will be placed first into the same or higher level vacancies in accordance with Article 37, Section 4.C.5.
4.	After placement of the unencumbered preference eligible employees, non-preference eligible unencumbered employees will be placed in accordance with Article 37, Section 4.C.5.
5.	To the Same or Higher Level
a.	Employees not encumbered in bid duty assignments shall bid on duty assignments posted for bid. These employees shall be assigned to residual full-time duty assignments in the same or higher salary level for which the employees meet the minimum qualifications. The assignments will be made in the following order:
(1)	Currently Qualified Employees.
Offer residual assignments by seniority to employees who are currently qualified on all of the requirements of a residual assignment. If an employee is qualified on two or more residual duty assignments, the employee will be given an option and be awarded their choice based on seniority. If assignments remain unfilled for which there are currently qualified unencumbered employees, involuntarily assign these employees by seniority.
(2)	Partially Qualified Employees.
Offer residual assignments by seniority to employees who are qualified on at least
188
Article 37.4.C.6.a
one, but not all, of the requirements of a residual assignment. If an employee is partially qualified on two or more residual duty assignments, the employee will be given an option and be awarded their choice based on seniority. If assignments remain unfilled for which there are partially qualified unencumbered employees, involuntarily assign these employees by seniority.
(3)	Employees Not Currently or Partially Qualified.
Involuntarily assign employees, starting with the senior employee. When there is more than one residual vacancy, the employees will be given an option and be awarded their choice based on seniority.
b.	Unencumbered clerks who are detailed to nonbargaining positions are considered to be unavailable for assignment in accordance with a. above.
6.	To a Lower Level
a.	Lower-level residual vacancies that still exist after application of 4.C.5 above will be offered to unencumbered employees and their preference shall be honored by seniority. Then assign unencumbered employees by inverse seniority to lower-level residual full-time assignments. If an unencumbered preference eligible employee is reached when assigning employees to lower level duty assignments in accordance with this Section (4.C.6):
189
Article 37.4.C.6.a.(1)
(1)	The most junior non-preference eligible same level Clerk Craft employee in the installation shall be reassigned to the lower level vacancy.
(2)	The unencumbered preference eligible employee will then be assigned to the duty assignment previously occupied by that junior non-preference eligible employee.
(3)	Any employee reassigned to a lower level duty assignment shall receive saved grade.
b.	An employee who receives saved grade under this Section (4.C.6.a) will receive saved grade as follows:
(1)	Employees who receive saved grade under this Section (4.C.6.a) will not be required to bid or apply for vacancies in their former wage level for a period of two years from the time they occupy the lower level duty assignment.
(2)	After the two year period, employees will be expected to bid or apply to former level duty assignments for which they are qualified or may become qualified by entering a scheme deferment period.
(3)	If no employee in the saved grade status bids or applies to the former level duty assignments, the junior employee(s) in the saved grade status will have their saved grade taken away.
190
Article 37.4.D
(4)	An employee in saved grade status who bids or applies for a former wage level duty assignment and is declared the senior bidder but fails to qualify, will lose saved grade protection. No more than one employee in the saved grade status group will have saved grade taken away for each former level duty assignment posted.
7.	a. An employee who was not hired from a machine register and who has not subsequently passed machine training may not be involuntarily assigned to a machine duty assignment regardless of salary level. This provision does not prohibit the Employer from making a job offer to an unencumbered employee in the same level.
b. An employee hired from a machine register who has not qualified on a particular machine skill (e.g., letter sorting machine, flat sorting machine) may not be involuntarily assigned to a duty assignment requiring that machine skill until all unencumbered employees who have qualified on that machine skill have been assigned.
8.	Full-time employees are assigned only to full-time residual vacancies.
D.	Identification of Newly Established Duty Assignments
When the number of full-time regular Clerk Craft duty assignments in an installation is less than the number of full-time Clerks, a full-time employee remaining unencumbered for a period of 120 calendar days shall demonstrate the need
191
Article 37.5
to post the newly established full-time regular duty assignment in accordance with Article 37.3.A. 1 .a.
This process shall continue until all unencumbered Clerks eligible to be assigned have successfully bid or been assigned to duty assignments.
Exceptions: Any full work or paid leave weeks (40 hours) during which unencumbered Clerks are: 1) detailed to non-bargaining positions; 2) identified as impacted under the provisions of Article 12.5.C (excluding 12.5.C.4); or 3) medically unsuitable for assignment, shall not be included when establishing this 120 day period.
Section 5.	Conversion/Part-Time Flexible Preference
A.	General Principles
1.	The Employer will maintain a single merged part-time flexible roll.
2.	Part-time flexible employees shall be converted to full-time in the manner set forth in this section.
3.	When an opportunity exists for conversion to a vacant full-time Clerk Craft duty assignment, employees shall, in accordance with this section, exercise a preference(s) as to the duty assignment(s) they desire to be converted into based on their standing on the part-time flexible roll.
4.	Part-time flexible employees who have exercised a preference and fail to qualify shall not be discharged or disciplined as a result of such failure.
5.	Part-time flexible preferencing under Section 5 will occur within 28 days after the application of Section 4.C, Assignment of Unencumbered
192
Article 37.5.A.10
Employees, unless such vacancies are being withheld pursuant to Article 12.
6.	Normally, the senior part-time flexible stating a preference will be placed into training within 10 calendar days.
7.	When a part-time flexible employee is identified as currently qualified or successfully completes the training for a stated preference, the employee should be converted to full-time and placed in the duty assignment within 28 days except in the month of December. Management should release a part-time flexible Mark-up Clerk, Automated as soon as possible, but for replacement training purposes may delay the employee’s release to that duty assignment for up to 180 days after being identified as senior for conversion or training. This delay in placement does not alter the employee’s normal conversion at the appropriate time.
8.	If an opportunity for conversion is to a best qualified full-time Clerk Craft duty assignment, the successful applicant shall be converted. Applications from part-time flexible employees shall not be considered if sufficient (equal or greater in number than available duty assignments) full-time employees meeting the minimum qualifications apply.
9.	Part-time flexible employees who express a preference may not withdraw from the assignment or from training except as specifically provided for in 10. below.
10.	A part-time flexible employee in training for a stated preference who is converted to full-time, either pursuant to Article 7, Section 3.A or due to being
193
Article 37.5.B
currently qualified on another assignment, shall have the option of either remaining in training for the stated preference or withdrawing from training.
B.	Preference Requirements/Eligibilities
1.	Employees are required to state a preference for duty assignments for which they are currently qualified at the same or higher level, even if they are in training for another stated preference. A Mark-up Clerk, Automated is not required to state a preference for non-Markup Clerk, Automated duty assignments.
2.	Employees are not required to state a preference for duty assignments for which they are not currently qualified or are at a lower level.
3.	When stating preferences, employees must list all duty assignments for which they received training and are currently qualified ahead of any duty assignment for which there is no qualifying training.
4.	While in training for a stated preference, employees may not state a preference for any other duty assignment for which they are not currently qualified.
C.	Procedures. When there are one or more full-time duty assignment(s) to be filled by conversion, the conversions shall be made by the following procedures, in the following order:
1.	Match the number of duty assignments to be filled with the identical number of senior part-time flexibles on the roll who are eligible to state a preference on the duty assignment(s).
2.	Convert and place any currently qualified part-time flexibles on the above list. Any part-time flexibles
194
Article 37.5.C.7
who are currently qualified on two or more of the available duty assignments shall be given a choice, in order of their standing on the part-time flexible roll, provided their choice would not reduce the number of currently qualified employees who could be matched and converted to full time.
3.	If any duty assignments remain unfilled, take preferences from all part-time flexibles who passed the required entrance examination, in order of their standing on the part-time flexible roll.
4.	For each duty assignment, place the senior part-time flexible who stated a preference for that assignment into the assignment if currently qualified. If not currently qualified, place that employee into training for that assignment. Upon successful completion of the training, convert and place the employee into the assignment.
5.	If the senior part-time flexible fails to qualify or withdraws pursuant to A. 10 above, convert and place the next currently qualified part-time flexible.
6.	If there are no remaining currently qualified part-time flexibles for a duty assignment, the senior part-time flexible hired from the appropriate register and who is not in training for another opportunity will be assigned and placed into training.
7.	RTF’s may not be involuntarily assigned to a lower level or to a duty assignment requiring a skill (such as typing, shorthand, etc.) for which they are not currently qualified.
195
Article 37.6
Section 6.	Anti-Fatigue Measures
A.	The subject of fatigue as it relates to the safety and health of an employee is a proper subject for the consideration of the Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee as provided in Article 14 of the National Agreement. The Employer will continue to furnish adjustable platform stools for periods of sustained distribution as heretofore.
B.	The feasibility of a study of seating devices, including seats with back supports, for the purpose of improving upon and eventually replacing the equipment termed “adjustable platform stools” heretofore supplied, as “sit-stand” devices is a proper subject for determination by the National Labor-Management Committee.
Section 7.	Scheme Committee
A.	The Employer agrees to having as part of the National Labor-Management Committee, a labor-management subcommittee on schemes for the consideration of appropriate matters relating to schemes.
B.	Subject to any criteria established in the future by the National Labor-Management Committee, local level scheme committees will continue operation as presently constituted.
C.	There shall be no annual or periodic scheme examinations.
Section 8.	Computerized Forwarding System
The application of a rotation system for the Computerized Forwarding System and the subject of fatigue as it pertains to the Computerized Forwarding System will be consistent with the requirements of the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

C.	Duty Assignment. A set of duties and responsibilities within a recognized occupational group and level regularly scheduled during specific hours of duty.
D.	Preferred Duty Assignment. A duty assignment preferred over the present duty assignment by an employee eligible to bid for such duty assignment when it is posted for bid. This bidding is done among qualified employees in the same level and occupational group as the vacant duty assignment.
E.	Service Seniority. Service Seniority is based on total part-time or full-time service in the Maintenance Craft, regardless of occupational group and level. It begins with an appointment to the regular part-time or full-time work force in the Maintenance Craft. An exception is a part-time regular employee who is converted to a full-time regular position begins a new period of service seniority. Employees who were on the rolls before May 1, 1958, who had temporary or indefinite appointments, which continued to career appointments, retain seniority credit for combined temporary, indefinite and career employment which was continuous in the same position designation and installation.
F.	Installation Seniority. This seniority is computed from entry into the maintenance craft in the installation. It continues to accrue so long as service in the maintenance craft and installation is uninterrupted.
G.	Seniority for Preferred Assignments. This seniority determines relative standing among regular work force employees eligible to bid for preferred assignments.
1.	Employees who enter into a regular work force position in a particular occupational group and level
198
Article 38.3.A
prior to June 25, 1992, shall have seniority for preferred assignments computed from entry into regular work force position in a particular occupational group and level.

See section 5.A.3. of this Article for order of placement on preferred assignment registers.
2.	Employees who enter into a regular work force position in a particular occupational group and level on or after June 25, 1992, shall use installation seniority for preferred assignments. See section 5.A.3. of this Article for order of placement on preferred assignments registers.
H.	Occupational Group. In the Maintenance Craft, occupational group shall be determined by position designation and level.
I.	Arbitrary. The word arbitrary, when used in Article 38, shall mean a management initiated, non-disciplinary reassignment of an employee.
Section 3.	Seniority
A.	Introduction
The U.S. Postal Service and the Maintenance Craft Division, APWU, AFL-CIO, agree to the following seniority principles which replace all former rules, instructions and practices. This Section of this Article will continue relative seniority standings properly established under past instructions, rules, and regulations. Provisions of this Section of this Article shall be so applied in determining those relative seniority standings.
199
Article 38.3.B
B.	Coverage
This Seniority Section applies to all regular work force Maintenance Craft employees when it is necessary for filling vacant assignments and for other purposes. No employee solely by reason of this Article shall be displaced from an assignment he/she gained in accordance with former rules.
C.	Responsibility
The installation head is responsible for day-to-day administration of seniority. The application of this Article shall be open to negotiations at the installation level with the designated agent of the Union.

2.	Seniority for preferred assignments.
3.	Installation Seniority.
E.	Loss of Seniority
1.	Employees who change from one craft to another shall begin a new period of seniority for preferred assignment.
2.	Change from one postal installation to another; except as specified under F and I below, will require the start of a new period of seniority for preferred assignment.
200
Article 38.3.G
G.	Reduction of Seniority for Preferred Assignments
1.	If, prior to June 25, 1992, an employee was voluntarily or for disciplinary reasons changed to a lower salary level in the same installation and the salary level was in the same occupational group and level from which promoted, seniority is established as the employee’s former period of seniority without credit for employment in any other higher level or levels.
2.	If the change was to a lower salary level in the same installation and the level was other than the occupational group from which promoted, whether the change was for voluntary, arbitrary or disciplinary reasons, seniority is established as one day less than the junior regular work force employee in that level and occupational group or the employee’s own seniority, whichever is lesser, if the employee was changed to a lower salary level prior to June 25,1992.
3.	If the change to a lower salary level occurs on or after June 25, 1992, seniority for preferred assignments shall be determined in accordance with section 2.G.2 of this Article. See section 5.A.3 of this Article for order of placement on preferred assignment registers.
H.	Seniority Granted by Law
Employees who are restored to postal duty in compliance with law or regulation after military training or extended military duty lose no seniority.
I.	Change in Which Seniority is Modified
The seniority for Maintenance Craft employees who are reassigned between installations as the result of a mutual
202
Article 38.3.F.5
F. Restoration of Service Seniority, Seniority for Preferred Assignments, and Installation Seniority
Except as provided in Article 12, Section 2.B, seniority is restored as if service had been continuous upon:
1.	Reemployment after Disability Separation. On reinstatement or reemployment after separation caused by disability, retirement, or resignation because of personal illness and the employee so stated this reason in the resignation and furnished satisfactory evidence for inclusion in the employee’s personnel folder, the employee receives seniority credit for past service for time on the disability retirement or for illness if reinstated or reemployed in the same installation and in the same salary level from which separated; provided application for reinstatement or reemployment is made within six months from the date of recovery. The date of recovery in the case of disability retirement must be supported by notice of recovery from the Compensation Group, Office of Personnel Management, and in the case of resignation due to illness by statement from the applicant’s attending physician or practitioner.
2.	Restoration in the same installation after military duty.
3.	Restoration to the employee’s former position in the same installation after unwarranted or unjustified separation.
4.	Involuntary reassignment to another installation.
5.	Arbitrary change in the same installation to a lower PS level to the position designation and level from which promoted.
201
Article 38.3.K.2
exchange in accordance with applicable provisions of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual will be established for both employees as that of the junior employee involved.
J.	Seniority for Breaking Ties
When it is necessary to determine the seniority ranking for two or-more employees in the Maintenance Craft, the following shall be used to break any tie that might exist:
. 1. Maintenance Craft Installation Seniority
.2	. Maintenance.Craft Service Seniority
3.	Total Maintenance. Craft Service
4.	Total'Postal Career Service
5.	Total Postal Service
6.	Total Federal Career Civilian Service
7.	Numerical by the last 3 or more numbers (using enough numbers to break the tie, but not fewer than 3 numbers) of the employee’s social security number, from the lowest to highest.
Tie breakers are applied in order until the tie is broken.
Employees excessed into the Maintenance Craft under the provisions of Article 12 shall begin a new period of seniority.
K.	Excess Employees
1.	Installation Seniority governs in identifying excess employees within an occupational group and level.
2.	Employees excessed to lower level under Article 12 into or remaining in the Maintenance Craft shall receive saved grade. Employees receiving saved grade are required to request placement on
203
Article 38.3.K.3
promotion eligibility registers in their former higher level.
3.	When applying Article 12.5.C.5.a.(5), the first opportunity to return to the Maintenance Craft shall be to the first same or lower level duty assignment which remains vacant after the in-craft process for posting and filling duty assignments and for which the excessed employee is qualified.
4.	When applying Article 12.5.C.5.b.(6), a Maintenance Craft employee can exercise their retreat right to any same or lower level duty assignment which remains vacant after the in-craft process for posting and filling duty assignments in their former installation and for which the excessed employee is qualified. Failure to exercise such retreat right results in the employee forfeiting future retreat rights to the occupational group and level for which the retreat was declined.
5.	If return or retreat to the craft, under 3 or 4 above, is to a lower level duty assignment, the employee shall receive saved grade.
(See Memo, page 411)
Section 4.	Posting
A.	In the Maintenance Craft all vacant duty assignments shall be filled as follows:
1.	a. When a vacant or newly established duty assignment is to be filled, the Employer shall post for a period of seven calendar days, a notice of intent that the duty assignment will be filled using the appropriate preferred assignment selection register and/or promotion eligibility register, except for newly

If a vacant assignment is reverted, a notice shall be posted within 10 days advising of the date of the reversion and the reasons therefore.
3.	If the current approved staffing package no longer supports continuation of a vacant duty assignment(s) that duty assignment may be reverted, provided it is not being withheld. The union will be notified within 10 days advising of the date of the reversion(s) and the reasons therefore.
4.	When it is necessary that fixed scheduled day(s) of work in the basic work week for a craft assignment be permanently changed, or that the starting time for such an assignment be changed by 2 or more hours, the affected assignment(s) shall be reposted, by notice of intent. An exception to the requirement to repost an assignment where the change in starting time is 2 or more hours may be negotiated locally.

5.	The determination of what constitutes a sufficient change of duties or principal assignment areas, to cause the duty assignment to be reposted shall be a subject of negotiations at the local level.
206

Section 1.	Seniority
A.	Introduction
1.	The U.S. Postal Service and the Motor Vehicle Craft Division, APWU, AFL-CIO, agree to the following seniority principles which replace all former rules, instructions and practices.
2.	This Article continues relative seniority standings properly established under past instructions, rules, practices and agreements and this Article shall be so applied. Seniority standings so established shall not be changed except to correct an error. If an employee requests a correction of seniority standing, it is the responsibility of the requesting employee to identify and restate the specific instructions, rule or practice in support of the request.
3.	Service seniority is based on total part-time or full-time service in the Motor Vehicle Craft regardless of occupational codes and levels. It begins with an appointment to the regular work force in the Motor Vehicle Craft.
B.	Seniority for Preferred Assignments
1.	This seniority determines relative standing among full-time regular and full-time flexible employees eligible to bid for preferred assignments. It is
220
Article 39.1.B.4.b
computed from entry into a regular work force position in a particular occupational group and level. It continues to accrue as long as service in the same occupational group, level, and installation continues. See B.5 and B.6.below.
2.	Employees who change, or have changed, from one designation to another and who during continuous employment in the Motor Vehicle Service and in the same installation return to the former position designation and salary, level regain the seniority they had in that position, without seniority credit for intervening employment in other position designations, except as provided for in paragraphs 4, 5 & 6 below.
3.	Except as specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, full-time regulars, upon entering the Motor Vehicle Craft' from another craft or installation, begin a new period of seniority.
4.	When two or more employees in the same installation, salary level, and position designation have seniority for preferred assignments from the same date, the tie will be broken as follows:
a.	By standing on the part-time flexible roll when both were appointed as a part-time flexible in the same installation, position designation, and salary level.
b.	By total length of full-time regular or part-time flexible Motor Vehicle Service in the installation if the tie is not broken by the preceding rule.
.221
Article 39.1.B.4.C
c.	By total career Motor Vehicle Service time in the USPS if the tie is not broken by the preceding rule.
d.	When a Motor Vehicle Service employee’s PSE appointment is converted to a career appointment the same day there is a new career appointment, reinstatement, reassignment, transfer or promotion to the same salary level and position designation, the converted employee is senior and precedes the other on the full-time regular roll.
e.	When two or more employees from other crafts enter the Motor Vehicle Craft on the same date, their seniority will be determined by their total continuous postal service.
f.	If the provisions of a. through d. above do not break the tie, then the tie will be broken by using the last three or more numbers (using only enough numbers to break the tie, but not fewer than three numbers) of the employees’ social security numbers, from lowest to highest.
5.	Seniority is restored under the following conditions:
a.	Reemployment After Disability Separation.
On reinstatement or reemployment after separation caused by disability, retirement or resignation because of personal illness and the employee so stated in his resignation and furnished satisfactory evidence for inclusion in his personnel folder, the employee receives seniority credit for past service for the time on the disability retirement or for illness if
222
Article 39.1.B.5.c
reinstated or reemployed in the same postal installation and craft and in the same or lower PS salary level from which originally separated; provided application for reinstatement or reemployment is made within six months from the date of recovery. The date of recovery in the case of disability retirement must be supported by notice of recovery from the Bureau of Retirement Insurance and Occupational Health, Office of Personnel Management, and in the case of resignation due to illness, by a statement from the applicant’s attending physician or practitioner. Where the reinstatement would have been to the part-time flexible roll, standing on the full-time regular roll shall be the same as if employment had not been interrupted by the separation.
b.	Restoration. On restoration in the same craft in the same installation after return from military service, transfer under letter of authority or unjust removal, an employee shall regain the same seniority rights such employee would have if not separated.
c.	Reassignment and Return in 90 Days.

Leave Without Pay
Time Limitations Concerning Bone Marrow, Stem Cell, Blood Platelet, and Organ Donations
Removal of Social Security Number References
3.	Other Provisions
A.	Light Duty
Article 13 does not apply to PSEs. However, Article 13 does not prohibit the assignment of PSEs to light duty.
B.	Article 15
1.	The parties recognize that PSEs will have access to the grievance procedure for those provisions which the parties have agreed apply to PSEs.
2.	Nothing herein will be construed as a waiver of the employer’s obligation under the National Labor Relations Act. PSEs will not be discharged for exercising their rights under the grievance-arbitration procedure.
3.	The separation of PSEs upon completion of their 360-day term and the decision to not reappoint PSEs to a new term are not grievable. PSEs may be separated for lack of work at any time. Such separation is not
289
grievable except where it is alleged that the separation is pretextual. PSEs separated for lack of work before the end of their term will be given preference for reappointment ahead of other applicants who have not served as PSEs if the need for hiring arises within one (1) year of their separation.
PSEs may be disciplined or removed within the term of their appointment for just cause and any such discipline or removal will be subject to the grievance arbitration procedure, provided that within the immediately preceding six months, the employee has completed ninety (90) work days, or has been employed for 120 calendar days, whichever comes first.
In the case of removal for cause within the term of an appointment, a PSE shall be entitled to advance written notice of the charges against him/her in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the National Agreement.
C.	Article 25, Higher Level Pay
In the event a PSE is temporarily assigned to a higher level position, such employee will be paid at the higher level only for the time actually spent on such job. This language should not be construed to encourage the Postal Service to temporarily assign such employees to higher level positions. When the opportunity exists for higher level assignment, the principle of preference for career employees over PSEs should be utilized. PSEs will not be assigned to
290
higher level assignments within function four (e.g., LSSA, Bulk Mail Tech, Special Postal Clerk, Lead Clerk), except when no career employee is available.
D.	Health Insurance
After an initial appointment for a 360-day term and upon reappointment to another 360-day term, any eligible non-career PSE who wants to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program on a pretax basis will be required to make an election to do so in accordance with procedures to be published as soon as administratively practicable. A previous appointment as a transitional employee will count toward qualifying for participation in FEHB, in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. The total cost of health insurance is the responsibility of the PSE, except as provided below.
The Postal Service will make a contribution in the amount of 75% of the total premium for any eligible PSE who selects the APWU Consumer Driven Health Plan.
E.	PSE Career Opportunity
When the Postal Service determines in accordance with contractual provisions that it has needs to fill vacancies with new career employees, available and qualified PSEs will be converted to fill such vacancies on a seniority basis.
291
F. Opting
A PSE may only occupy full-time (traditional or nontraditional) duty assignments in accordance with these rules. This does not prohibit PSEs from working assignments that do not constitute a duty assignment.
In the Clerk and Motor Vehicle Crafts, where practicable, PSEs will be allowed to opt on a seniority basis for fulltime (traditional and nontraditional) vacant, residual assignments in the installation for which they are qualified and which are not assigned to career employees. Such opting does not create any work hour or assignment guarantees.
Hours worked by PSEs in opted non-traditional full-time assignments of more than eight hours in a work day or forty hours in a work week will be an exception, for the portion of their assignment which exceeds eight hours in a day and forty hours in a week, to the contractual obligation pursuant to Article 8.4.G to utilize the Overtime Desired List.
In the Clerk Craft, existing provisions of Article 37.3.F.5 and 37.3.F.7 apply prior to a PSE opting for the assignment. In addition, Article 37.3.F.3 and 37.3.F.4 will be modified so as to permit all bidders to train and attempt to qualify before the duty assignment becomes residual and available for assignment of unencumbered employees, PTF preferencing (unless being withheld), and finally for PSE opting. However, qualified PSEs may be utilized to backfill vacancies while full-time or part-time
292
employees are in training pending qualification. In addition, any such assignment will be posted for bid as a vacant duty assignment or reverted pursuant to Article 37.3 on the occasion of the PSE’s break in service.
In, the Motor Vehicle Craft, any assignment opted by . a PSE will be posted for bid as a vacant duty, assignment or reverted on the occasion of the PSE’s break in service.
G. Retirement Savings Plan
The parties will explore the steps necessary for the establishment of 401(k)-type retirement savings plans and/or payroll allotments for Individual Retirement Accounts for PSEs. The Postal Service will not be required to make any matching contributions as part of such plans.
293

Mr. Cliff Guffey President
American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO 1300 L Street NW
Washington, DC 20005-4128
Dear Cliff:
As discussed during negotiations, the Postal Service will apply its non-discrimination policies to the hiring processes for the new category of employee, [Postal Support Employee (PSE)], in the same manner as those policies apply to career employees and the same avenues of enforcement will be available with respect to the hiring of [PSEs] as are available with respect to the hiring of career employees. The non-discrimination policies include the commitment in Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), Section 311.12, to not discriminate in personnel decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability as provided by law.
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 governs our hiring processes and prohibits discrimination against qualified employees and career and non-career job applicants with disabilities, including those disabled employees who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Rehabilitation Act imposes an obligation on the Postal Service to find reasonable ways to accommodate a qualified individual with a disability. In the case of deaf and hard of hearing employees and applicants, Management has an obligation to reasonably accommodate requests for assistance in communicating with or understanding others in work-related situations. (See, e.g., EL-312, Employment and Placement, Section 235.23 and EL-307, Reasonable Accommodation, an Interactive Process).
301
It is Postal Service policy to provide equal employment opportunities to qualified applicants with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. This continues to be accomplished through our hiring processes for both career and non-career employees. (EL-312, Section 235.1, and EL-307, Section 41). This letter does not affect the Postal Service’s right to modify its nondiscrimination policies pursuant to Article 19 or otherwise.
Sincerely,
Doug A. Tulino

304
may provide a way for a deaf or hard of hearing employee to conduct postal business by telephone with other employees and customers.
h.	When possible, interpretive services as described in (a) through (f) above should be scheduled as far in advance as possible.
' i. In' the event of an emergency situation, the Postal Service will strive to communicate the nature of the emergency as soon as possible.
Management will provide the following assistance for deaf and/ or hard of hearing employees with a disability under the Act:
"a. All films or videotapes designed for the training or instruction of regular work force employees developed on or after October i, 1987, shall be opened or closed captioned. To the extent’practicable, existing films or videotapes developed nationally that will continue to be used by deaf or hard of hearing employees with some frequency, will be opened or closed captioned.
b.	Special communications devices for the deaf will be installed in all postal installations employing deaf employees in the regular work force. '.Special communications devices, or telephone volume control devices will be installed for hard of hearing employees whenever a hard of hearing employee needs a reasonable accommodation in order to communicate by phone. These devices will be available to deaf and/or hard of hearing employees for official business and in the case of personal emergencies. As appropriate, Management will provide training to staff on the use of these special communication devices.
c.	A visual alarm will be installed on all moving powered industrial equipment in all postal installations employing
305
deaf employees in the regular work force or in any installation where such a reasonable accommodation is necessary for a hard of hearing employee.
d.	Visual fire alarms will be installed in all new postal installations (installations for which the U.S. Postal Service, as of June 12, 1991, had not awarded a contract for the design of the building) where the Postal Service installs audible fire alarms. The parties will discuss and seek to agree at the local level about the installation in such other facilities as may be appropriate.
JOINT LABOR-MANGEMENT MEETINGS
Discussion of problem areas with regard to the use of certified sign interpreters, enhancement of job opportunities for the deaf and hard of hearing, including recruitment and hiring efforts, type of special communications devices or volume control devices to be installed, installation of visual alarms or other systems such as tactile devices at other than new postal installations, and the availability of new technologies which may help deaf and hard of hearing employees perform a variety of tasks are appropriate matters for consideration at Joint Labor-Management meetings. Discussion of such matters at Labor-Management meetings is not a prerequisite to the filing or processing of a grievance.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND JOINT BARGAINING COMMITTEE (American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, and National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO)
Re: Article 8
Recognizing that excessive use of overtime is inconsistent with the best interests of postal employees and the Postal Service, it is the intent of the parties in adopting changes to Article 8 to limit overtime, to avoid excessive mandatory overtime, and to protect the interests of employees who do not wish to work overtime, while recognizing that bona fide operational requirements do exist that necessitate the use of overtime from
318
time to time. The parties have agreed to certain additional restrictions on overtime work, while agreeing to continue the use of overtime desired lists to protect the interests of those employees who do not want to work overtime, and the interests of those who seek to work limited overtime. The parties agree this memorandum does not give rise to any contractual commitment beyond the provisions of Article 8, but is intended to set forth the underlying principles which brought the parties to agreement.
The new provisions of Article 8 contain different restrictions than the old language. However, the new language is riot intended to change existing practices relating to use of employees not .on the overtime desired list when there are insufficient employees on the list available to meet the overtime needs. For example, if there are five available employees on the overtime desired list and five.not on it, and if 10 work hours are needed to get the mail out within the next hour,:all ten employees may be required to work overtime. But if there are 2 hours within which to get the maiLout, then only the five bn the overtime desired list may be required to work.
The parties agree that Article 8, Section 5.G.1, does not permit the Employer to require employees bn the overtime desired list to work overtime on more than 4 of the employee’s 5 scheduled days in a service week, over 8 hours on a nonscheduled day, or over 6 days in a service week.
Normally, employees on the overtime desired list who don’t want to work more than 10 hours a day or 56 hours a week shall not be required to do so as long as employees who do want to work more than 10 hours a day or 56 hours a week are available to do the needed work without exceeding the 12-hoiir and 60-hour limitations.
In the Letter Carrier Craft, where management determines that overtime or auxiliary assistance is needed on an employee’s route on one of the employee’s regularly scheduled days and
319
the employee is not on the overtime desired list, the employer will seek to utilize auxiliary assistance, when available, rather than requiring the employee to work mandatory overtime.
In the event these principles are contravened, the appropriate correction shall not obligate the Employer to any monetary obligation, but instead will be reflected in a correction to the opportunities available within the list. In order to achieve the objectives of this memorandum, the method of implementation of these principles shall be to provide, during the 2-week period prior to the start of each calendar quarter, an opportunity for employees placing their name on the list to indicate their availability for the duration of the quarter to work in excess of 10 hours in a day. During the quarter the Employer may require employees on the overtime desired list to work these extra hours if there is an insufficient number of employees available who have indicated such availability at the beginning of the quarter.
The penalty overtime provisions of Article 8.4 are not intended to encourage or result in the use of any overtime in excess of the restrictions contained in Article 8.5.F.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION, AFL-CIO
Re: Modified Work Week (10/4) Guidelines
The following rules apply to full-time employees in the APWU bargaining unit.
1.	Overtime
Participants will receive postal overtime pay for work performed only after 10 hours in a pay status on a regularly scheduled day, or after 40 hours in a pay status in a service week, and for the first 8 hours in a pay status on the first nonscheduled day worked in a service week. Non-scheduled day guarantees remain at 8 hours.
Excluding December, participants will receive penalty overtime for all hours:
■	over 10 hours in a pay status on a regularly scheduled day;
■	over 8 hours in a pay status on the first non-scheduled day worked in a service week;
■	and/or in a pay status on the second and third nonscheduled day worked in a service week, if in a pay status for any part of each of the other 5 days in the same service week.
The 56 and 60 hour limitations still apply.
2.	Sunday premium will be paid for all eligible straight time hours worked (i.e., 10 per workday) but shall be limited to 16 hours per week.
322
(10) hours within twelve (12) consecutive hours, except that it shall be ten (10) hours within eleven (11) consecutive hours in all offices with more than 100 full-time employees in the bargaining units. Modified work weeks can be applied only to full-time regular duty assignments.
Any such program establishing and implementing a modified work week is subject to the following conditions:
1.	Either management or the union at the local level may choose to negotiate or not negotiate a modified work week. A decision by management or the union not to participate in a modified work week program will not be subject to the Article 30 impasse process, the grievance/arbitration procedure, or appealable in any other forum.
2.	Cancellation of either local party’s involvement in a modified work week program will be automatic upon 30 days written notice. Cancellation by either party will not be subject to the grievance/arbitration procedure or appealable in any other forum.
3.	Rules established by the parties at the national level in the “Modified Work Week (10/4) Guidelines” or its amendments must be followed.
4.	Alleged violations of this memorandum of understanding or any program implemented in accordance with this memorandum are subject to the Article 15 grievance procedure.
5.	Except as provided for in this MOL) or the Modified Work Week Guidelines, no modified work week program can be inconsistent or in conflict with the National Agreement.
Dated: December 18, 2001
321
3.	Leave will be charged up to 10 hours per day, therefore it will be necessary to use ten hours leave to cover a full day.
4.	Court leave will be charged the same (i.e., up to 10 hours per day), however, the local parties have the option to determine if the employee’s schedule may be changed back to 8/5 for those weeks during which court service is performed.
5.	Military leave will be charged at 10 hours per day but may not exceed 120 hours per year. The local parties have the option to determine if the employee’s schedule may be changed back to 8/5 for those weeks in which the employee will be on military leave for five or more days.
6.	When appropriate, Administrative leave may be granted up to 10 hours per day.
7.	Employees are currently provided 80 hours of holiday leave per year (10 holidays at 8 hours per holiday). To maintain this level of holiday leave while assigned to an alternate work schedule, the local parties must elect one of the following options prior to implementing alternate work schedules.
Participants will receive 80 hours of holiday leave per year regardless of which option is chosen.
Option 1
During the weeks in which a holiday or designated holiday falls, the employees revert back to an 8/5 schedule. Holiday leave and holiday worked premium policies remain the same as for the current 8/5 schedule.
323
Option 2
Washington’s Birthday and Columbus Day are considered regular workdays and are not treated as holidays for purposes of scheduling or compensating employees in 10/4. In effect, these two holidays are spread out among the remaining 8 holidays.
Ten hours of holiday leave will be charged and holiday worked premium will be limited to 10 hours on each of the 8 holidays.
If a participant, in this option, enters or leaves the 10/4 work week during the calendar year he/she will use Annual Leave or LWOP, to the extent necessary, on the remaining holidays to ensure that the total holiday leave for the calendar year does not exceed 80 hours.
Payroll and budget systems only recognize holidays within certain weeks within certain pay periods. As such, it is necessary to establish designated holidays somewhat differently from current policy. When a holiday falls on an employee’s non-scheduled day, the employee’s first scheduled workday preceding the holiday becomes the employee’s designated holiday. An 8/5 employee who has Monday as a nonscheduled day would have either the preceding Saturday or Sunday as their designated holiday because one of those two days would have to be a regularly scheduled workday. Under 10/4, an employee may have Saturday, Sunday and Monday as their non-scheduled days, which would mean establishing the previous Friday as their designated holiday. This may fall outside of the week of the pay period in which the holiday has been provided for in the payroll and budget systems.
324
Accordingly, designated holidays for 10/4 employees with these scheduled days off (SDOs) should be established as follows:
	ACTUAL	DESIGNATED
SDOs	HOLIDAY	HOLIDAY
.1,2,3	Saturday	Friday (prior)
	Sunday	Tuesday
	Monday	Tuesday
The following schedule is to keep the employee’s designated holiday as close to the actual holiday as possible:
SDOs
2,3,4
ACTUAL	DESIGNATED
HOLIDAY	HOLIDAY
Sunday	Saturday
Monday .	Saturday
Tuesday	Wednesday
8.	Employees assigned to a 10/4 schedule and who are scheduled for training programs of five or more days may be returned to an 8/5 schedule until the training is completed. For training of less than five days, employees will remain on a 10/4 schedule but will complete their 10 hour day as assigned by management. Such assignment should be as close to the employee’s regular assignment as practicable.
9.	Any and all compensation policies other than those set forth in 1 through 7 above, which are based on 8 hour days and/or 5 day weeks for non-10/4 nonparticipants, will be based on 10 hour days and/or 4 day weeks for participants.

Donated leave may be carried over from one leave year to the next without limitation. Donated leave not actually used remains in the recipient’s account (i.e., is not restored to donors). Such residual donated leave at any time may be applied against negative leave balances caused by a medical exigency. At separation, any remaining donated leave balance will be paid in a lump sum.

Such request for retreat rights must indicate whether the employee(s) desires to retreat to the same, lower, and/or higher salary level assignment and, if so, what salary level(s). The employee(s) shall have the right to bid for vacancies within the former installation and the written request for retreat rights shall serve as a bid for vacancies in the level from which the employee was reassigned and for all residual vacancies in other levels for which the employee has expressed a desire to retreat. The employee(s) may retreat to only those [lower level] assignments for which the employee(s) would have been eligible to bid.

Re: Transfers
The parties agree that the following procedures will be followed when career Postal employees request reassignment from one Postal installation to another.
Reassignments (Transfers)
A.	Installation heads may continue to fill authorized vacancies first through promotion, internal reassignment and change to lower level, transfer from other agencies,
338
reinstatements, etc., consistent with existing regulations and applicable provisions of the National Agreement.
B.	Installation heads will afford full consideration to all reassignment requests from employees in other geographical areas. within the Postal : Service. ; The requests will be considered in the order received consistent with the vacancies being,.filled and type of positions requested. Such requests from qualified employees, consistent with the provisions of this memorandum, - will not be unreasonably denied. Local economic and unemployment conditions, as well as EEO factors, :are, valid concerns. When hiring from entrance registers is justified based on these local conditions, an attempt should be made to fill vacancies from both sources. Except in the most unusual of circumstances, if there are sufficient qualified applicants for reassignment at least one out of every four vacancies will be; filled by granting requests for reassignment in all offices of 100 or more man-years if sufficient requests from qualified applicants . have been received. In offices of less than 100 man-years a cumulative ratio of 1 out of 6 for the duration of the National Agreement will apply.
C.	Districts will maintain a record of the requests for reassignment received in the offices within their area of responsibility. This record may be reviewed by the Union on an annual basis upon request. Additionally, on a semiannual basis local Unions may request information necessary to determine if a 1 out of 4 ratio is being met between reassignments and hires from the entrance registers in all offices of 100 or more man-years.
D.	Managers will give full consideration to the work, attendance, and safety records of all employees who are considered for reassignment. An employee must have an acceptable work, attendance, and safety record and meet the minimum qualifications for all positions to which they request
339
reassignment. Both the gaining and losing installation head must be fair in their evaluations. Evaluations must be valid and to the point, with unsatisfactory work records accurately documented.
1.	For reassignments within the geographical area covered by a District or to the geographical area covered by adjacent Districts, the following applies: An employee must have at least eighteen months of service in their present installation prior to requesting reassignment to another installation. Employees reassigned to installations under the provisions of this memorandum must remain in the new installation for a period of eighteen months, unless released by the installation head earlier, before being eligible to be considered for reassignment again, with the following exceptions: 1.) in the case of an employee who requests to return to the installation where he/she previously worked; 2.) where an employee can substantially increase the number of hours (8 or more hours per week) by transferring to another installation and the employee meets the other criteria, in which case the lock-in period will be 12 months. Employees serving under craft lock-in periods per the provisions of the National Agreement must satisfy those lock-ins prior to being reassigned to other installations. These transfers are included in the 1 out of 4 ratio.
2.	For all other reassignments, the following applies: An employee must have at least one year of service in their present installation prior to requesting reassignment to another installation. Employees reassigned to installations under the provisions of this memorandum must remain in the new installation for a period of one year, unless released
340
by the installation head earlier, before being eligible to be considered for reassignment again, except in the case of an .employee who .requests to return to the installation where he/she previously worked. Employees serving under craft lock-in periods per
.	the provisions of the National'"Agreement must
satisfy those lock-ins prior to being reassigned to other installations.
E.	Installation heads in the gaining installation will contact the installation head of the losing installation and arrange for mutually agreeable reassignment and reporting dates. A minimum of thirty days notice to the losing office.will be. afforded.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION, AFL-CIO
Re: Minimizing Excessing
In order to minimize the impact on the employees and the operation, the parties agree to the following provisions to curtail or minimize the involuntary excessing and reassignment of employees outside their installation or craft for the term of the 2010 National Agreement.
342
Employees will have the opportunity to voluntarily transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding Re: Transfer Opportunities to Minimize Excessing. For purposes of this identified opportunity, the restriction in item 7 of that MOU is lifted so that withheld vacancies are available.
The Postal Service will review its operations 1) to create new and/or more efficient assignments within the installation that might lessen the excessing need and 2) to look for scheduling opportunities to offer assignments which are consistent with'local operational needs and reduce/eliminate the need to excess.
When employees are not able to be placed within their installation and craft, the parties will meet to discuss options to avoid or minimize involuntary excessing, such as modifying work schedules, and will determine what options will be implemented. If there remains a need to place employees after exhaustion of any agreed-to actions, excessing outside the installation or craft must be to an assignment within forty (40) miles from the losing installation, or fifty (50) miles if reassignment within forty (40) miles is not feasible. If in unusual situations there are insufficient residual vacancies available for placement within fifty (50) miles, the parties will determine what steps may be taken.
f'
Withheld jobs not filled under the above procedure will remain vacant until it is determined that they no longer need to be withheld.
If a need still exists to reassign employees who have been notified of pending excessing after the steps above have been taken, such'employees given notice of reassignment pursuant to Article . 12 prior to the. effective date of this Agreement may be reassigned.
343
Anyone currently scheduled to be excessed who wishes to go will be allowed to do so.
Any disputes arising out of this memorandum will be handled in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding Re: Administrative Dispute Resolution Procedures.

The parties recognize the role of the Postal Inspection Service in the operation of the Postal Service and its responsibility to provide protection to our employees, security to the mail and service to our customers.

Re: Administrative Dispute Resolution Procedures
The U.S. Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO (APWU) agree to continue Administrative Dispute Resolution Procedures (ADRP) to help resolve complex disputes as they arise during the course of the collective bargaining agreement. The ADRP will be used to resolve those disputes identified by the parties without the filing of any grievances. A listing of subjects for consideration in the ADRP will be submitted by the parties at the national level within 30 days following the effective date of this Memorandum of Understanding. By mutual agreement, the parties at the national level may continue to add subjects to the original listing.
For each subject(s), the Employer and the Union will designate individuals at the national level who will be responsible for discussing and, where possible, for resolving any disputes concerning the referenced subject(s). When a specific subject is under consideration in the ADRP, any grievance(s) concerning that identified subject will be removed from the Grievance/Arbitration Procedure and forwarded to the ADRP. Where a grievance(s) has been filed and the subject of that grievance subsequently comes under consideration by the ADRP, such grievance(s) will be removed and forwarded to the ADRP.
The national level designees will be responsible for meeting regularly to resolve pending disputes. No special forms, appeals or paper work will be necessary to utilize the ADRP. When the designees cannot agree upon a resolution, either
352
party may declare an impasse. Each party will identify the issue in dispute in writing within 30 days after the declared impasse on the subject. The identified dispute will then be placed on the appropriate arbitration docket.

Re: Timeliness Regarding Step 2(h) Appeals
When the Union incorrectly appeals a grievance under Article 15.2 Step 2(h) to Step 3 rather than to arbitration, and can show the appeal was made timely, Management will not consider timeliness as a waiver of the grievance. If no timely appeal to Step 3 can be established by the Union then Management retains the right to raise the timeliness issue.
This memorandum includes the scenario where the union incorrectly appeals a grievance under Article 15.2 Step 2(h) directly to arbitration that should have been appealed to Step 3. The grievance will not be waived as untimely provided the union can show a timely appeal to arbitration. If no timely appeal can be established by the union, then management retains the right to raise the timeliness issue.

Re: Reinstatement of Driving Privilege
It is hereby agreed by the United States Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO that:
1.	The safety and health of employees is of significant concern to the parties signatory to this Memorandum of Understanding. Accordingly, the parties further agree that the following is not intended to provide driving privileges to an employee when such privilege would place the safety of the public or the employee at risk.
2.	The mere fact that an employee was involved in a vehicle accident is not sufficient to warrant automatic suspension or revocation of driving privileges or the automatic application of discipline.
3.	When an employee’s driving privilege is temporarily suspended as a result of a vehicle accident, a full review of the accident will be made as soon as possible, but not later than fourteen (14) days, and the employee’s driving privileges must either be reinstated, suspended for a specified period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days, or revoked as warranted. If the decision is to suspend or revoke the employee’s driving privilege, the employee will be provided, in writing, the reason(s) for such action.
4.	If an employee requests that a revoked or suspended driving privilege be reinstated, Management will review the request and make a decision as soon as possible but not later than 45 days from the date of the employee’s request. If the decision is to deny the
362
request, the employee will be provided with a written decision stating the reasons for the decision.
The Management review must give careful consideration to:
the nature, severity and recency of the incident(s) which led to the revocation or suspension;
- any driver’s training or retraining courses completed from private schools, state sponsored courses, or Postal Service training programs, especially when directly relevant to the incident(s) that led to the revocation;
successful participation in an EAP program, when ■ relevant to the reasons for revocation;
the employee’s state driving record consistent with the criteria for initial certification of driving privilege as stated in the applicable Handbook. The Employer may waive these criteria if warranted in light of the other factors listed above.
5.	This Memorandum of Understanding is not intended to define the conditions or circumstances for which an employee’s driving privilege may be suspended or revoked.

Re: Consideration of National Outsourcing Initiatives
The parties agree that it is in their best interest to meet and discuss national outsourcing initiatives at an early stage of the process.
369
Once the Strategic Initiatives Action Group (SIAG) has determined that a proposed concept will involve significant impact on bargaining unit work and preparation begins on a memo detailing consideration of the five Article 32 factors, the Union will be provided notification. Union involvement at this early stage of the process is without prejudice to either party’s position regarding the determination as to whether there is a potential significant impact on bargaining unit work.
Following receipt of notice, the Union will be afforded opportunities for briefings, meetings and information sharing as the concept is developed, costing models prepared, and a Comparative Analysis document drafted.
The above process also will be utilized when an existing contract for a national outsourcing initiative is expiring and consideration is being given to rebid the outsourcing of the work.
The parties understand that the purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to allow the Union an opportunity to compete for the work internally at a point in time contemporaneous with the outsourcing process and early enough to influence any management decision. The Union may suggest less restrictive work rules, mixes of employee categories, lower wage rates that may improve the efficiency and lower the costs of an in-house operation.

Re: Training Committee
The Postal Service reaffirms its commitment to provide employees with training consistent with organizational needs. Additionally, the Postal 'Service recognizes the desirability of affording employees opportunities for self-development and will make training programs available to meet such needs.
The Postal'Service will afford the Union, at the national level, the opportunity to discuss concerns about,specific training opportunities or programs. A Joint Committee on Training is hereby established at' the national level which will consist of representatives of both parties. The Committee shall meet to discuss matters of mutual interest and benefit relating to training programs and opportunities. The appropriate USPS management official shall be the Employer’s chief representative on such Committee. The Committee may consider and develop pilot programs, improved training methods and strategies, and other matters related to employee training and educational opportunities, including exploring the potential for developing job related training and noncompensable non-job related programs through the use' of advanced computer technology. Issues concerning local training and educational opportunities including the use of postal, facilities for non-compensable training in college accredited courses, publicity of" self-development training opportunities, and-other training and educational matters of mutual interest and benefit are appropriate subjects for resolution at local labor-management committee meetings.
373
Consistent with established regulations and operational needs, the Postal Service will make every effort to grant requests for leave without pay by employees for training and educational opportunities. Customer Service District offices will maintain a record of employee requests for LWOP under these provisions and the resulting action taken (approved/disapproved). If the request is denied, supporting rationale must accompany all such denials. This documentation will be forwarded to the National Training Committee, with a copy to the area manager of Human Resources on a biannual basis for review. The Committee, through joint agreement, will take appropriate action if it deems necessary.
The parties agree to consult at the national level to define whether specific training courses and/or programs are job-related, self-developmental, or can be considered both. The National Joint Training Committee will review all training programs for the purpose of compiling a listing of training opportunities for postal employees. Further, the National Joint Training Committee will discuss the establishment of training programs to promote local joint labor-management cooperation.

When an employee begins his/her work day at one postal unit and is provided transportation to another unit to complete his/her tour of duty, that employee will be provided transportation back to the unit where his/her tour began if transportation is needed. If the employee ends tour at the new location the return trip will not be on the clock, but transportation will be provided promptly, by management upon request.

At the end of year 2, the parties will meet to apply the review procedure with the expectation that the number of work hours utilized for 204-B activities will be reduced or eliminated in those work units with a Lead Clerk position. Additional reviews will be conducted by the parties at the end of years 3 and 4 of this agreement. Not later than June 1, 2012, the Employer will eliminate the usage of 204-B’s except in the absence or vacancy of a supervisor for 14 days or more.

Re: Relief and Pool
Relief and pool assignments, sometimes called “flexible relief work cycle” assignments are utilized to cover absences and vacancies of employees holding regular bid assignments and other situations where the assignment is uncovered.
Such relief and pool assignments also enable management to accommodate employee requests for unscheduled leave. It is recognized that the concept of a relief or pool assignment necessarily entails a degree of uncertainty in scheduling employees filling such assignments.
In order to minimize this uncertainty, the parties have agreed to the following principles to be applied to the establishment and operation of relief and pool assignments.
1.	The Postal Service may establish new or additional relief and pool assignments in any installation. The Postal Service shall consult with the Union before management makes a final decision with respect to the establishment of such assignments in any installations where they do not presently exist.
380
2.	Relief and pool assignment postings will specify the nature of the assignment by enumerating the type and location of assignments to be relieved; (e.g.) the pool employee will cover absences and vacancies of window/distribution employees assigned to specified classified stations and branches in their installation, or other installations.
a. In addition to covering absences and vacancies of window/distribution employees in their installation, or other installations, the Relief Employee may also be assigned to other installations to relieve a Postmaster, Supervisors and/or their Replacements at the appropriate bargaining unit rate.
The degree of specificity included may vary with the size of the coverage area in that in some areas with a large relief pool a particular relief assignment should be limited to a relatively small area of coverage, whereas in other offices the nature of the assignment may have to be broader.
3.	Relief and pool assignments will have fixed hours, however, hours of duty may vary from day to day; for example:
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Saturday	6:00 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. 12:00 noon - 8:30 p.m. 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. 6:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.
4.	An employee holding a relief or pool assignment, as described above, will be paid at the overtime rate for those hours worked which are outside his normal,
381
regularly scheduled work week except under the following circumstances:
a.	When management informs the employee by Wednesday of the preceding service week that he/she is to cover an assignment having a schedule different from the relief or pool employee’s regular schedule for a period of one week (five working days) or longer, the relief or pool employee will assume the new schedule and will not receive overtime pay for those hours worked in such new schedule which are outside of his normal regular schedule. However, the relief or pool employee will be entitled to overtime pay for those hours worked outside of his normal, regularly scheduled work week (i) unless and until management informs him/her in writing that he/she is to work a new schedule for a week or longer, or (ii) if the relief or pool employee in fact works the new schedule for less than a week after he is so informed by management; or
(b	) When management tells him to perform functions which predictably occur at the end of an accounting period; e.g., those of Timekeeper or Examination Specialist.

3.	A time frame has been, provided in Section 5.A;6 when an employee, should be converted to full-time and placed in the duty assignment upon successfully completing the'required training or being identified as the senior currently qualified part-time flexible.

Re: Bids With Required Computer Skills
The following procedure will be followed when senior bidders, meeting the minimum qualifications (qualification standard), are assigned to administrative clerk craft assignments, PS-5, which require running of or interaction with computer programs:
1.	The senior bidder will assume the hours and days of the assignment and be provided with on-the-job training (OJT) for a period of five working days. No out-ofschedule premium will be paid as a result of this action.
2.	By no later than the end of the five-day period the bidder must demonstrate the ability to successfully run those programs/procedures for which he/she will be responsible in the performance of the duties of the assignment. The specific programs/procedures will be identified at the beginning of the period, and instruction will be provided for each during the five days of OJT.
3.	If the bidder is unable to successfully demonstrate the ability to run the programs, the employee will be returned to his/her previous assignment and the assignment will be awarded to the next senior currently qualified bidder who can immediately demonstrate the ability to run the programs.
384
4.	In the event that the senior bidder is not successful, the employee may request a schedule change to attain a reasonable amount of time between the end of the temporary assignment and the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled reporting time. This request is subject to the prior approval of the employee’s supervisor, and Union steward. When an employee does not request-a schedule,change.,and the end of the assignment period provided for in item i above' is within ten ihours of the employee’s regular scheduled tour, managers will (prior to the qualification period) identify the schedule of the qualification period as extending through the employee’s first • non^ scheduled day following, the end of the qualification period. This provision will riot serve to extend the time allowed for qualification as provided for in item 2. The emjoloyee will ’ not be eligible ' for out-of-schedule premium as a result of these.schedule changes.
5.	The parties recognize that the ^Employer may develop computer aptitude tests or other measures for use in determining minimum qualifications.
6.	The provisions of this memorandum do not apply to operations assignments.

Re: COMPUTER FORWARDING SYSTEM - CFS CLERK REASSIGNMENT
The parties agree that whenever the Postal Service decides to reassign CFS clerks from a CFS unit, the appropriate provisions of Article 12 of the collective bargaining agreement will apply, with the following additional provisions:
A.	CFS Reassignments:
1.	If a determination is made to reassign CFS Clerks out of a section, to other crafts, and/or installations, the Area will begin withholding residual vacancies or PTF vacancies, as appropriate, in the same and lower levels within an Area, as determined by management, up to the number of career impacted CFS employees. In addition, the Area will also begin withholding residual vacancies or PTF vacancies in higher levels in APWU represented crafts, as appropriate, up to the number of career impacted CFS employees.
393
2.	For the purposes of this agreement, the Test 470 (Battery Exam) requirement is waived for CFS clerks for reassignments or bidding/opting. Employees opting for an assignment must meet the other minimum requirements of the duty assignment.
3.	Veteran’s preference eligible CFS employees will be given priority placement into same and higher level duty assignments and will not be reassigned to a lower level. If there is no same or higher level duty assignment(s) available, the veteran’s preference eligible employee® will be bypassed and the next senior non-preference eligible employee will be excessed in lieu of the preference eligible.
4.	Beginning with local notification that CFS employees will be excessed, if a non-preference eligible CFS employee opts or bids to a lower level duty assignment, he/she will receive saved grade protection in accordance with the following:
a.	Employees who receive saved grade under this MOU will not be required to bid or apply for vacancies in their former wage level for a period of two years from the time they occupy the lower level duty assignment.
b.	After the two-year period, employees will be expected to bid or apply to former level duty assignments for which they are qualified or may become qualified by entering a scheme deferment period.
394
c.	If no employee in the saved grade status bids or applies to the former level duty assignments, the junior employee(s) in the saved grade status will have their saved grade taken away.
d.	An employee in saved grade status who bids or applies for a former wage level duty assignment and is declared the senior bidder but fails to qualify will lose saved grade protection. No more than one employee in the saved grade status group will have saved grade taken away for each former level duty assignment posted.
B.	CFS EMPLOYEE UPGRADE

During the term of the 2010 National Agreement, the parties intend to explore alternative methods to provide staffing and scheduling efficiency in function four operations. Such methods may include flexibility in full time and part time schedules, utilization of hub clerks, lead clerks, crew chiefs, etc.
To further this effort, the parties agree to establish a national joint task force to explore and consider these opportunities.
At the discretion of the task force, pilots or trial programs may be authorized to test these concepts at facilities and in operations designated by the parties. These programs should be initiated no later than June, 2011.
At the conclusion of these trial programs and tests, but no later than August 2012, the parties will meet to decide whether such tests should be continued, expanded, or implemented in whole or in part, or terminated at the request of either party.

Re: EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES
The parties recognize that internal recruitment and development of current bargaining unit career employees for skilled positions is in the best interest of postal employees and the Postal Service. The. parties, agree to the establishment of a process and program to allow for development opportunities for placement of current APWU bargaining unit career employees in the Maintenance department.
In order to improve the opportunity for career APWU bargaining unit employees to' qualify for and establish themselves on the appropriate in-craft and/or in-service register(s), the Postal Service will develop and implement a program in those locations where a need is identified. The program will include a process whereby APWU career employees will have an opportunity to express interest in entering a developmental program for future opportunities in the Maintenance Craft.
Once created and implemented, APWU bargaining unit career employees who express an interest will be given an opportunity to qualify for placement in the program and subsequent placement in a position in the Maintenance Craft. Placement into the Maintenance Craft will follow the provisions of Article 38 of the current APWU-USPS collective bargaining agreement.
:	If the initial placement resulting from successful completion of
' the training program is to an Electronic Technician (ET) duty i assignment, upon placement into the craft duty assignment, employees will commit to a three year lock-in for that craft from
403
the date placed in the assignment. The employees will not be able to request transfer, in-craft downgrade or bid to a nonskilled position during the lock-in period, but same position designation transfers and in-craft promotions in the installation are permitted. If an employee leaves before the end of the lock-in period, the employee will be responsible for reimbursing the Postal Service for all training costs.
As skilled Maintenance and Motor Vehicle craft positions are identified, developmental programs will be established where needed. Non-skilled employees already assigned to the craft for which the developmental training opportunity assignment is intended will have first priority to qualify for the available training.

b.	The Employer will develop career position descriptions, or assign work to current positions, based on the bargaining unit duties derived from the audit of these positions. The
408
bargaining unit duty assignments created as a result of the audits will be filled in accordance with the Agreement.

SUBJECT: Maintenance Craft Discussions Per
Article 38.3.K (Excessing)
When the Postal Service proposes to involuntarily reassign APWU Maintenance Craft employees in accordance with Article 12.5.C.5.b (out of the installation) of the National Agreement, the Postal Service and the Maintenance Craft of the APWU agree to meet at the national headquarters level to address certain issues related to and arising from the excessing. These meetings will occur only when a proposed excessing event in an impacted installation involves multiple occupational groups within the APWU Maintenance Craft or when more than half of any existing occupational group within the APWU Maintenance Craft is proposed to be involuntarily reassigned.
Such discussions, when mutually agreed, will occur prior to the Regional level meeting identified in Article 12.4. Additional discussions may occur by mutual agreement. The purpose and intent of these discussions is to identify and apply Article 12 and Article 38 provisions to the proposed event in order to instruct the field how to properly implement the excessing. This may result in a mutual determination by the parties, for example, regarding the assignment of employees to their same occupational group within a small local commuting area. The parties will be guided in their discussions and mutual determinations by the basic principle that dislocation and inconvenience to employees shall be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of the service.
411
In the event the parties have not met or mutual agreement is not reached within 14 days from the notification, the matter will be returned to the regional level and the event will continue to be addressed in accordance with Article 12 and Article 38. The time limits contained in Article 12 will be adhered to and the 14 day period for meeting under this MOU runs concurrently with the Article 12 time limits.
This Memorandum is intended to address the specific circumstances described above and does not alter in any way other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

Reasonable efforts will continue to be made at the appropriate management level to reconcile vehicle requirements to existing postal vehicle sizes. In those situations where it is determined that the vehicle needed substantially differs from that which is available in the U.S. Postal Service fleet, justification will be provided the responsible USPS management office for those routes that otherwise meet the criteria of Article 32.
3.	The responsible USPS management office will continue to encourage all contractors to display clearly and conspicuously on all vehicles, while engaged in the transport of mail, their company name, address and the fact that they are contract vehicles.
4.	When the National Union is advised of the decision to award and/or renew a highway contract(s), the U.S. Postal Service will provide a reasonable explanation of its decision.

Re: Job Audits
The parties understand and agree that if the Postal Service concludes under EAS job audits that any non-managerial or non-supervisory duties did not “seep out” of the bargaining unit, this shall not affect the Postal Service’s obligations under Article 1.5, stating in part that “the Employer shall identify all new non-managerial and non-supervisory work and assign such work at the national level to the national craft unit most appropriate for the performance of such work within thirty (30) days of having done so.” If the Postal Service later assigns nonmanagerial and non-supervisory duties otherwise not excluded pursuant to Article 1.2, which the Postal Service
418
concludes did not “seep out” of the bargaining unit to employees in another position description, they may not be assigned to a new or revised EAS position but rather must be assigned “to the national craft unit most appropriate for such position” in accordance with the procedure in Article 1.5.
By entering into this memoranda of understanding providing for EAS job audits, the parties understand that the union is not agreeing that the Postal Service may in the future assign non-managerial and non-supervisory work outside the bargaining unit.

The losing installation will coordinate between the employee and the gaining installation.
D.	The Postal Service will not provide affected employees copies of vacancies at postal facilities in advance of transfer requests. Installations with hard-to-fill vacancies post them in eReassign as Reassignment Opportunities. The Postal Service will notify employees in the impacted installation(s) of the availability of the eReassign transfer alternative.
Employees can request reassignment to these specific positions. It is the responsibility of the affected employee to check on a regular basis in eReassign for Reassignment Opportunities. Employees may also request transfers to offices that do not have reassignment opportunities listed on eReassign.
424
2.	Selections by installations accepting transfer requests will be on a seniority basis using craft installation seniority from the losing installation.
A.	In the event of a seniority tie, the tie breaker method will be as follows: a), total career postal time, and b). entered on duty date.
B.	An employee’s seniority in the gaining installation is established by the respective gaining craft article in the collective bargaining agreement based on the employee being a voluntary transfer (not excessed) employee.
3.	An employee accepting a transfer under the priority consideration will have their name removed from the priority eReassign pending request list at all locations. Affected employees requesting transfer can change their mind and decline a transfer opportunity. By doing so, the affected employee’s name will be removed from the priority eReassign pending request list at the declined location and the affected employee becomes immediately available for involuntary Article 12 reassignment.
4.	Employees may transfer across APWU craft lines. Transfers outside craft lines will be processed in accordance with applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreements and postal regulations. Affected employees requesting transfer must meet the minimum qualifications for the position being considered. The first selection will come from same craft to same craft prior to making cross craft selections. There is no priority consideration to non-APWU craft positions.
5.	Simultaneous (duplicate) requests for transfer by the same employee to the same craft and installation in eReassign are not permitted.
425
6.	Employee may receive a printed confirmation of their request through eReassign.
7.	With the exception of the Clerk Craft, impacted crafts or occupational groups in installations under Article 12 withholding are not available for transfer requests. In the Clerk Craft only, excluding installations concurrently experiencing excessing from the Clerk Craft, the following vacancies will be made available through eReassign for transfer requests by full-time regular clerks in impacted offices under this procedure for a minimum of twenty-one (21) days before they may be withheld under Article 12 and Article 37.3.A.3:
a.	Posted Clerk vacancies within the District which are determined to be residual after completion of the bidding/assignment process in 37.3 and 37.4.
b.	Posted Clerk vacancies in installations outside the District but within a one hundred (100) mile geographic radius of the impacted installation, which are determined to be residual after completion of the bidding/assignment process in Article 37.3, and 37.4. The parties may mutually agree to expand the area of consideration beyond 100 miles if they determine it is necessary to provide sufficient vacancies for offices with excess Clerks.
c.	When the excessing involves part-time flexibles, PTF vacancies within the same areas identified in a and b above, will be made available for transfer requests by part-time flexibles in the impacted office.
426
8.	As a result of the MOU, there are no changes to the Article 12 time frames for notification to the union.
9.	Disputes arising from the application of Transfer Opportunities to Minimize Excessing MOU will be processed at the Area level. If unable to resolve at Area level the dispute will be forwarded to the Headquarters level.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION, AFL-CIO
The parties agree that when in small post offices there are two hours or less of contracted out custodial duties in a day that cannot be combined with other maintenance duties to create a duty assignment, those duties will be assigned to an existing APWU bargaining unit duty assignment in the facility.

CLERK CRAFT
Re: Excessing by Seniority Task Force
Concerns have been raised with regard to the application of seniority when excessing out of the craft or installation. The parties have further agreed to explore how the excessing of Clerk Craft employees solely by seniority may resolve these potential issues. As a result, during the term of the 2010 National Agreement, the parties intend to explore how Clerk Craft employees may be excessed out of the craft or installation consistent with Article 12 in order of seniority.
To further this effort, the parties agree to establish a national joint task force to develop a process for excessing out of the craft or installation by seniority for Clerk Craft employees. This joint task force shall discuss contractual issues, legal requirements, and operational needs, as they relate to excessing by seniority. This joint task force shall begin meeting no later than 30 days from the signing of this Agreement. At the discretion of the task force, language and/or Questions and Answers (Q & A’s) may be developed to further the implementation of any agreed-upon process of excessing from the craft or installation by Clerk Craft seniority. This language or these Q & A’s shall be developed no later than by August 30, 2011.
428
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION, AFL-CIO
Re: Human Resources Shared Services Center (HRSSC)
The parties agree that it is in their mutual best interest to resolve continuing issues with posting and bidding which have developed through the implementation of computerized bidding through the Human Resources Shared Services Center (HRSSC).
To further this effort, the parties agree to meet at the headquarters level within ninety (90) days after the signing of this, agreement to discuss these matters and explore opportunities for resolution.
The parties will continue to meet as necessary to discuss issues and to improve communication.
