207 It is recognized that during the term of this Agreement, an employee does not have the right to have a local working condition established in any given situation where such condition has not existed, or to have an existing local working condition changed or eliminated, except to the extent necessary to require the application of a specific provision of this Agreement.

Mr. Wayne Clary
Sub District Director
United Steelworkers of America, Local 7600
927 S. Village Oaks Drive, Suite 100
Covina, California 91724
Dear Mr. Clary:
The purpose of this letter is to set forth the understandings reached during the recently concluded contract negotiations which are to run concurrently with the present Labor Agreement, effective October 1 2000, and are as follows:
1)	Cafeteria Food Prices
The Employer will continue a food pricing policy for employees' food prices consistent with the Regional policy.
2)	Distribution of Agreement
The Employer agrees to have the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) printed and distributed to the employees no later than December 28, 2001.
In the interim, the Employer agrees to have a supplement to the current CBA, containing all changes and modifications resulting from the 2000 negotiations, printed and distributed to the employees within sixty (60) days after the date of ratification.
3)	Operating Room Technicians' Sleeping Room
The Employer agrees to provide a sleeping room, for use by the Operating Room Technicians, upon completion of Phase IV construction at the Medical Center.
no
Mr. Wayne Clary

4)	Hospital Nursing Payroll Office
To allow greater accessibility to the staff, the Hospital nursing payroll office hours on Friday paydays will be extended to 4:30 p.m. The normal employee weekday office hours will be available to employees working any shift.
5)	Confidentiality of Medical Records
The contents of an employee's/patient's medical record are of a highly private nature. The use of this record is thus restricted to the relationship between the physician and his/her patient.
It is the organization's policy, therefore, that access to the contents of all patient records be restricted to this use. All other uses are unauthorized.
Employees who believe the confidentiality of their medical record has been violated may bring this issue to the attention of the facility Administrator in writing. The Administrator will provide a response to the employee in writing within thirty (30) days,
6)	The Employer agrees that if any other Union with a collective bargaining agreement with the Employer is granted, as a contractual change, any increase in health plan coverage for laid off employees, the same increase will be provided to employees represented by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA). The Employer agrees to meet with the Union in any future layoffs, and will give consideration to providing health plan coverage to affected employees.
7)	An employee with seven (7) or more years of service with the Employer who is unable to continue in a full-time status due to a work related disability as certified by a physician, must submit to the Human Resources Office within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this determination, a request to be considered for an alternative job at the Medical Center. This matter will be referred to the seniority committee for evaluation. The committee will, in their best judgment, make a recommendation within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of
in
Mr. Wayne Clary
October 1,2000
Page 3
referral, of a maximum of two (2) job classifications in which the employee is capable and qualified to perform. Should the committee be unable to agree on a classificationfs), the matter shall be closed and not subject to further review. The Employer will evaluate the medical/physical capabilities ofthe employee to perform in the recommended classification(s). Should the determination be made that the employee is medically/physically unable to perform in the recommended classification(s), the matter shall be closed and not subject to further review. Should the determination be made that the employee is medically/physically capable to perform in the recommended classification(s), said employee shall have a ninety (90) calendar day period in which to be considered for job placement into an open vacancy within the classification(s) in question. The employee must accept the first position offered. Failure to do so shall constitute a waiver of further consideration under the terms of this paragraph. Should the vacancy offered be a full-time job, the employee will be placed in the job only if all full-time employees currently in the pertinent classlficatlon(s) have exercised seniority rights and the job is open for on-call consideration. Should this process result in the employee being placed in an on-call position, said employee shall be placed at the top of the on-call list within the job classification only for the purpose of obtaining the next available full-time position within such job classification. Should the employee refuse to accept the next available full-time position, preferential consideration for this purpose shall cease. Seniority for purposes of being offered available on-call work will be most recent date in the employee's previous classification. Should any of the time limits outlined be exceeded, the matter shall be considered closed and not subject to further review. Furthermore, an employee may exercise the provisions of this paragraph only once for any given injury/occurrence. Employees who, prior to November 1,1986, are being offered consideration under Paragraph 1068 of the 1983-1986 Collective Bargaining Agreement will be grandfathered under those provisions. Any Workers' Compensation claims subsequent to November 1,1986 will be considered under the provisions of this paragraph. If the terms of this paragraph are disapproved by the Division of Industrial Acddents/Workers' Compensation Appeals Board pursuant to the administration ofthe California Labor Code, this paragraph and all provisions therein, shall become null and void and such employee shall be offered vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to the provisions of the California Labor Code. If the terms of this paragraph are altered in any
112
Mr. Wayne Clary
October 1,2000
Page 4
way by the Division of Industrial Accidents/Workers' Compensation Appeals Board pursuant to the administration of the California Labor Code, the parties will meet in an attempt to reach agreement on modifications to this paragraph and the provisions therein. Absent agreement, this paragraph and all provisions therein shall become null and void and subject to the grievance procedure.
8)	In the event an on-call employee works forty (40) hours a week for twenty-six (26) consecutive weeks on the same shift in the same department/unit, a Step II Grievance may be initiated. Should it then be determined that all of the hours worked were non-replacement hours, a full-time position will be posted and filled under the terms and provisions of Article X.
9)	It is agreed that when an employee requests a review of his/her job for possiblereclassiftcation,.the following processshall occur.
A.	The Union shall submit a “Request for Reclassification” form, completed by the requesting employee, to the Chairperson of Job Evaluation Committee. The Chairperson, or designee will review the form for completeness and, if complete, will date stamp the form.
B.	The Job Evaluations Committee will meet once a month to review all “Requests for Reclassification”. The committee will determine whether or not the request should be submitted for the Job Evaluation process. If the request is determined inappropriate by the Committee, then the affected employee will be notified by the Union, and no further action will occur. If the request is submitted to the Committee, then the review must occur within sixty days (60) calendar days of the date stamped submission. If the Committee can not agree on the appropriate disposition of the submission, then the issue will be submitted by the Union to a Step III of the grievance process, and such submission must occur (in writing) within ten (10) working days of the Job Evaluation Committee meeting.
C.	The Job Evaluation Committee will complete a review of said job, and such review will be conducted in the following manner:
113
Mr. Wayne Clary
October 1,2000
Page 5
•	The Employer will audit the job and revise or prepare a new job description.
•	The Employer and Union will collaboratively evaluate the job, utilizing the Job Evaluation Manual.
•	The Employer and Union will submit the evaluation to the monthly Job Evaluation Committee for review.
If the parties agree on the evaluation, then any warranted upgrade will be retroactive to the date stamped on the Request for Reclassification form.
if the parties can not agree on the evaluation findings, then such dispute must be submitted by the Union to Step III of the grievance process and such submission must occur (in writing) within ten (10) work days of the Committee meeting date.
Should such dispute occur, the Employer reserves the right to implement any reclassification indicated by its study.
The parties also agree that neither the Union nor the Employer will have the basis for resubmitting a reclassification request under this provision more than once in a twelve (12) month period from the date the evaluation occurred. The notwithstanding, the parlies may agree to waive the twelve (12) month limitation if a classification has undergone a significant change in job content.
Finally, the parties agree that all time limits for review by the Job Evaluation Committee may be extended by mutual agreement. However, for such extension to be binding they must be submitted and approved in writing by both parties.
114
Mr Wayne Clary

12)	The Parties agree that the Employee may post part-time positions, Part-time positions are those scheduled less that full-time on a pre-determined/fixed basis.
•	It is the Employer's intent to maintain as many full time positions as possible. It is not the Employer's intent to reduce the number of full-time positions in favor of on-call or part-time positions.
•	All Part-time positions will be posted and will be fixed schedules
•	The expectation Is that part-time positions will create more hours for variable on-call employees.
•	Acceptance of all geographic assignments beyond posted positions will be voluntary. Mileage will be paid in accordance with current policy.
•	Item #8 of this letter only applies to on-call employees; it does not apply to part-time employees.
•	All positions, unless mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Employer, will be posted a minimum of 20 hours per week.
•	Employees who volunteer for additional hours outside their posted position will be given as much advance notice as possible of available hours.
1)5
•	It is not the employer's intent to allow on-call employees to work outside their home departments thereby disadvantaging employees within that department.
13)	The parties agree that current Letters of Agreement will run concurrently with the term of the Local Collective Bargaining Agreement.
If the above reflects your understanding, please sign in the space provided.

NATIONAL AGREEMENT: INTRODUCTION
n 1997, the Unions of the AFL-CIO Coaution of Kaiser Permanente Unions and Kaiser Permanente entered Into a National Labor Management Partnership Agreement By involving employees and unions in organizational decision-making at every level, our partnership is designed to improve the quality of health care, make Kaiser Permanente a better place to work, enhance Kaiser Permanente's competitive performance, provide employees with employment and income security, and expand Kaiser Permanente’s membership. The cornerstone of the Partnership is an innovative
labor management relationship. In that spirit, the parties decided to embark on a voyage—one that had never been attempted—to collectively and simultaneously bargain 33 Partnership union contracts.
The Common Issues Committee, made up of union and management representatives from across the country, was responsible for drafting this Agreement. To inform their work, they chartered seven Bargaining Task Groups (BTGs) in April of 2000. These seven groups were made up of approximately 300 management and union representatives from across the program.
The BTGs were charged with making comprehensive, long-term recommendations in the areas of Quality and Service, Health and Safety, Performance and Workforce Development, Wages, Benefits, Balancing Personal Life and Work Life, and Workplace Innovations to make Kaiser Permanente the best place to work. Over the course of several months, the Bargaining Task Groups developed comprehensive solutions for transforming our work environment. They reported their solutions to the members of the Common Issues Committee tn a two-day session in eariy July.	_
Overthenext three months, the Common Issues Committee then undertook the exhaustive challenge of reviewing the detailed and visionary work of the BTGs. Their charge was to determine how best to distill the work of the groups into a National Agreement and at the same time, ensure that the work of the groups is carried forward Into our future.
Each of the Bargaining Task Groups gave more definition and specificity to the partnership path. Each expressed a high degree of confidence in the Labor Management Partnership and the potential found within the vision of the Partnership. They clearly saw local Labor Management Partnership Teams as the means of providing oversight of implementation processes for their recommendations.
The Pathways to Partnership was developed in 1997 to provide a roadmap for making a transition to an environment characterized by collaboration, Inclusion and mutual trust Within the framework of the Pathways to Partnership, this National Agreement provides for a new way to work and a new way to provide care. We will continually improve service, patient care and performance by enabling each person to engage her/his full range of skills, experiences, and abilities. The National Agreement describes an organization in which unions and employees are integrated into planning and dedsion-making forums at all levels including budget, operations, strategic initiatives, quality processes, and staffing. In our vision, decisions are jointly made by self-directed work teams—giving people who provide the care and service the ability to decide how the work will best get done. We look forward to a time when ail eligible employees participate in the Partnership and are covered by this National Agreement.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT ( 3
This National Agreement Is designed to support two goals: implementation of the Partnership on a national and local level and movement toward nationwide consistency. Partnership implementation is supported through the reinforcement of regional and local partnership teams. And in some instances, the document provides specific timeframes required to assure progress toward implementation. The National Agreement also takes steps toward nationwide consistency in determining wages, benefits, and certain other terms and conditions of employment. It is our blueprint for making Kaser Permanente the employer and care provider of choice.
Section 1 of this Agreement covers the privileges and obligations of partnership, reflects our continued commitment to the Partnership, and integrates the work of the Bargaining Task Groups into partnership implementation. It provides mechanisms for spreading partnership, collaboration, and organizational transformation throughout our organization. It begins to define how workers and managers engage in areas such as quality and service, training and education, health and safety, and life balance programs. Section 1 also covers areas such as union security, partnership governance, and problem-solving processes and elaborates on other privileges of Partnership. Recognizing that different areas and facilities are starting at different points, this section must be used in conjunction with the Pathways to Partnership. Some timeframes are included, but where not specifically noted, the foundation for transition, as outlined in the Pathways to Partnership, must be built for organizational transformation to be successful and enduring.
Section 2	identities the specific provisions of the National Agreement which pertain to compensation, benefits and disputes procedures.
Section 3	describes the scope, application, and term of the Agreement
This National Agreement was created through an extraordinary collaboration with the input of hundreds of Kaiser Permanente employees at every level. We created this document the way we will work in the future - jointly. The Agreement embodies our collective vision for Kaiser Permanente. The language of this National Agreement cannot begin to fully capture the energy and collective insights of the hundreds of people working long hours to establish this framework. But as work units apply these principles, we trust that their commitment and expertise will make our vision a reality.
4 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
SECTION 1: PRIVILEGES AND OBLIGATIONS OF PARTNERSHIP
> A. COMMITMENT TO PARTNERSHIP
The essence of our Labor Management Partnership is involvement and influence, pursuit of excellence, and accountability by all. We believe people take pride in their contributions, care about their jobs and each other, want to be involved in decisions about their work, and want to share in the success of their efforts. Market-leading organizational performance can only be achieved when everyone places an emphasis on benefiting all of Kaiser Permanente, There is an indisputable correlation between business success and success for people. Employees throughout the organization must have the opportunity to make decisions and take actions to improve performance and better address patient needs. This means that together we must ensure employees have the skills, knowledge, information, opportunity, and authority to make sound decisions and perform effectively. Engaged and involved employees will be highly committed to their work and contribute fully.
By creating an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, recognizing each person’s expertise and knowledge, and providing training and education to expand those capabilities, we can achieve our common goals of achieving organizational success and creating a secure, challenging, and personally rewarding work environment. With this Agreement, the parties jointly initiate a wide array of activities designed to increase employee skills training, learning opportunities, and growth and development.	_______
Section 1 presents our integrated approach to quality md service,-performance'and workforce development education and training,jind creating an environment responsive to employee and union interests.
if is our intention to solve problems as dose to the patient and the problem as possible, respecting the interests of aB parties. The Partnership Review Process, which is applicable only to matters arising out of Section 1, is meant to be used as a last resort.
With this Agreement, the Unions and Kaiser Permanente assume a set of privileges and obligations. These Indude, but are not limited to, employment and income security, union security, access to information including the responsibility to maintain confidentiality concerning sensitive information, participation in the governance structure, and partidpation in performance sharing plans. They also include a joint commitment to continue to improve quality and service.
In addition, we have a joint commitment to identify, and by mutual agreement, incorporate our own best practices and the best practices of high performance organizations into each fadlity. We will work diligently to increase and enhance flexibility in work scheduling and work assignments to enhance service, qualify and financial performance, while meeting the interests of employees and their unions. We share a willingness to work in good faith to resolve jurisdictional issues in order to increase work team flexibility and performance. And we share a commitment to marketing Kaiser Permanente as the employer and care provider of choice.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT I 5
> B. PARTNERSHIP GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
The National Labor Management Partnership Agreement describes the vision of a work place environment where diversity of opinions is valued and all stakeholders share a voice in decisions that affect them and their work. The vision of this Partnership is an integrated structure, where the unions and their members are part of the decision making forums, (t is recognized, however, that prior to reaching this vision, parallel structures must be implemented to organize, plan and implement the partnership principles. These structures are meant to be steps toward integration and could, indeed should, change as the Partnership evolves.
1. GOVERNING BODIES
The governing body for the Labor Management Partnership is the Labor Management Partnership Strategy Croup (the Strategy Croup) and shall comprise a small group (totalling approximately 10-12) representatives from the Kaiser Permanente Partnership Group (KPPG) and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions in approximately equal numbers. The KPPG represents the highest level decision-making body within Kaiser Permanente. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions coordinates joint activity for the partner unions. Membership for the Strategy Group will be determined by October 2000, and the first meeting should be held by November 30,2000.
The Strategy Group will be advised by a newly constituted National Labor Management Partnership Council (Partnership Council). This Partnership Council will effectively replace the previous Senior Partnership Committee. It will meet periodically, approximately quarterly, to be briefed on all pertinent matters pertaining to the Partnership, to share learnings and regional best practices, and to plan implementation and provide policy recommendations to the Strategy Group.
The Office of Labor Management Partnership will provide administrative and operational support to the Strategy Croup and to the Partnership Council and support the implementation of the Partnership at all levels.
8. PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURES
Each of the Bargaining Task Groups expressed a high degree of confidence in the Labor Management Partnership and in local and national partnership teams as a means of providing oversight. Each recommended separate national and local oversight structures. As a result, a Structure Subcommittee will be appointed to assess each recommendation and develop a comprehensive plan integrating the requirements from each group. The Structure Subcommittee should complete its recommendations by December 31, 2000 and submit same to the Strategy Group for approval and implementation. The recommendations will include the assignment of responsibility for national, regional and/or local teams in the areas of: Quality and Service Health and Safety Life Balance
Performance and Workforce Development
Training and Education
6 | national agreement
Local teams will be governed by Regional Partnership Teams. It is recommended that Partnership teams include key stakeholders and key decision makers and yet remain small enough to problem solve and reach quick resolution while ensuring appropriate representation. Guidelines for Partnership Team composition are available through the Office of Labor Management Partnership. Union representation on each team will be decided by the unions. As identified below, Regional Partnership Teams are the nucleus of partnership activity within a local area. With the exception of the the Strategy Group, and any committees or structures chartered or established by it, all oversight structures will be established as subcommittees of the Regional Partnership or Local Partnership Team.
Regional Partnership Teams will be constituted in each Region no later than March 31,2001. The Regional Partnership Team will advance the Partnership in a timely manner throughout the Region, implementing national partnership goals and objectives plus Regional/Local program and policy initiatives. The teams will receive direction from and be accountable to the Strategy Group.
The Regional Partnership Team may charter other partnership teams responsive to the organizational structure and will assure accountability for implementing the Partnership. The Regional Partnership Team is encouraged to review the BTG reports in order to determine how to advance performance improvement employee satisfaction, and involvement at regional and local levels. The Regional Partnership Team should assess and prioritize all BTG recommendations within budgeted, allocated resources and determine appropriate priorities and funding.
During the term of this Agreement, the Strategy Group will continue to review and prioritize BTG recommendations for possible Implementation.	____
It is expected that these Regional and Local PartnershipJeams will quickly mature and evolve Into operational leadership teams in which union leadership will be fully integrated and no longer in a parallel _________structurtTapart from the ongoing management function.
5. JOINT PARTNERSHIP TRUST
A joint Labor Management Partnership Trust will be established for the purpose of funding Labor Management administration and Partnership activities. Kaiser Permanente will contribute at its current rate adjusted annually in accordance with general budget inflationary factors. Changes in the Employer's overall funding of partnership expenses, including Partnership Trust contributions, training and education development, administration, technical and consulting support expenses necessary to implement/advance the Partnership shall be at least proportional to employee contribution escalation as described below. An amount equal to five cents per hour per employee will be contributed to the Partnership Trust In the first contract year. For subsequent years, the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions will be responsible for developing a methodology for continuing the payment of five cents per hour per employee and a one cent per hour annual escalator. The purpose of the employee contribution is employee ownership of the partnership, sponsorship of increased union capacity and shared ownership of outcomes and performance gains.
The Partnership Trust wiil be overseen by the Strategy Group and will be jointly administered, its four trustees, two union and two management, will consist of the partnership labor and management co-chairs of the Strategy Group and one other union and management representative. The trustees will serve under the direction of the Strategy Group and accept fiduciary responsibility for the Partnership Trust.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT |	7
> C. BARGAINING TASK GROUP SOLUTIONS
The BTGs, comprising 300 employees, managers, supervisors and union leaders, worked diligently to propose solutions in a range of areas of great interest to the Employer, employees and their Unions. This section is based on their vision and solutions in the areas of Quality and Service, Performance and Workforce Development, Employee Health and Safety, and Work-Life Balance and Work Life Innovations. While not intended to represent all of the ideas, goals and direction indicated by representatives in these Task Groups, it captures the fundamental elements necessary for making Kaiser Permanente the best place to work and receive care.
We are ail dedicated to working together to make Kaiser Permanente the recognized market leader in providing quality health care and service. This can be accomplished through creating a service culture, achieving performance goals, developing our workforce, increasing employee satisfaction, promoting patient safety programs and focusing our attention on employee health and work-life personal-rife balance. Our goal is to continually improve performance by investing in people and Infrastructure, improving communication skills, fostering leadership, and supporting involvement in the community.
1.	QUALITY AND SERVICE
Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions are dedicated to working together to make Kaiser Permanente the recognized market leader In providing quality health care and service. This will be achieved with a comprehensive organizational transformation that can only be established within the context of all of the programs in Section 1 of this Agreement
' Under the guidance of the Regional Partnership Team, the local partnership teams must address the following critical components of quality health care and service; a service culture, a joint staffing process, and a work environment conducive to reducing errors and improving patient/member safety.
a.	A SERVICE CULTURE
A service culture can best be achieved through self-directed work teams responsible for entire, discrete processes. The creation of such teams should be the ultimate goal for those planning the Partnership implementation process. The guidance provided by the KP Promise and the Pathways to Partnership should be followed in developing these teams.
Partnership teams will be responsible for creating our service culture at the facility, department or work unit level. It is our intent that partner union employees in all departments/areas be included in the planning, development, and implementation of an improved service culture. Union partners should be integrated into any ongoing service initiatives, and subsequently be involved in the planning, design and implementation of any new Initiatives from the onset
B | national agreement
Creating a service culture requires that certain organizational components be in place. We agree that these components include: knowledge of what constitutes an excellent care experience, modeling of excellent service behaviors, employee satisfaction and empowerment, skills and competencies, systems to support service quality, and a strategy for becoming an organization known for service excellence. We will create an organizational environment that encompasses these elements.
We also recognize that high employee, physician, and patient satisfaction are achieved through an involved, multi-disciplinary, self-directed, trained team that focuses on meeting or exceeding the service expectations of our patients.
Essential components for creating high performance work teams include involvement and participation, information systems to share data with the team, a sense of team and community, training and education, authority and accountability, and an organizational orientation to quality. Ultimately these work teams are self-directed, responsible for entire, discrete processes, and in the best position to continuously improve their service to internal and external customers.
b.	A JOINT STAFFING PROCESS
We understand that staffing is often a controversial issue between management and labor which can greatly impact staff satisfaction. Therefore, we recommit to support the vision of the Partnership outlined in the original Pathways to Partnership document, which is intended to continue to move the organization toward joint decision making.
We recognize that the ability to provide quality health care and service to our patients^and^a quality work---
environment for our employees, is influenced by a number of variables, including fiow we staff. Thus, we agree to implement a joint process for staffing to be applied throughout the organization In all departments where partner union members work. We also recognize that this process must be initiated at the ' regional/service area level with the involvement of partner unions in business planning and resource allocation decisions that ultimately shape a staffing plan, as well as in decisions to adjust resource allocations during the budget cycle.
The process will be sponsored by the Regional Partnership Coundl/Team and will be implemented by local Partnership Teams. The sponsors will ensure the development and implementation of local partnership staffing processes at the facility, department or work unit level, or across multiple facilities depending on the region. The process should be applied across the program in all areas where employees represented by partner unions work.
We agree that after appropriate partnership educatlon/training, joint partnership staffing teams will be involved in determining, within allocated organizational resources, how departments will be staffed. Partnership staffing teams will be expected to recommend annually a staffing design (plan) that encompasses mutually acceptable numbers, mix and qualifications of staff in each work unit. This plan should lead to the development of staffing methodologies (e.g. ratios, hours per patient day, or other tools) to improve measures of quality health care and service and employee satisfaction. Developing staffing plans in this manner will result in less variability in staffing (numbers, mix and qualifications) across a region or service area. Partnership staffing teams are encouraged to demonstrate creativity and flexibility and the agreements reached will be non-precedent setting. We encourage and desire sharing and adaptation of the best practices in order to promote functioning as a superior health care system.
NATIONAL ACAfEMfNT |	9
At the regional/local level, the staffing plan features should indude:
The ability to track quality outcomes to determine the impact of various staffing plans on quality The identification of system and process problems that undermine quality health care and service The use of an interest*based model tor modifying the staffing plan in the future Full sharing of all information and review of best practices, internally and externally Consideration of the following factors:
Replacement needs
Patient needs and acuity
Technology
Inpatient and outpatient volume
Department/unit size
Geography
Standards of professional practice
Experience and qualification of staff Staff mix
Regulatory requirements
Nature of services provided
Availability of support resources
Model of care
Needs and acuity of the entire medical facility as well as specific department/unit
Consideration and support for meats and breaks
Departmental/area budgets
Adherence to any and all guidelines promulgated by any reviewing or regiilatory agency and any other applicable laws and regulations is mandatory.
C. PATIENT SAFETY
We agree that improving the quality of care delivered to our members/patients requires significantly increasing the reporting of actual errors and "near misses’1, it is recognized that the reporting of such errors can only Improve if employees are assured that punitive discipline is not seen as the appropriate choice to handle most errors. We must jointly create a learning environment which views errors as an opportunity for continued, systematic improvement This environment must encourage all employees to openly report errors or “near misses" and participate in analyzing the reason for the error and the determination of the resolution and corrective action needed to prevent reoccurrence.
Regionally, there will be joint labor management development, administration, promotion, and evaluation of the reporting system.
The reporting system will include the following components:
Reporting of errors, with systematic, standardized analysis of errors and near misses Communication of learnings to help make needed policy and procedure changes Confidentiality of Involved employees unless prohibited by statute or law Involvement of staff in error analysis and/or resolution
Making reporting a positive experience
10 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
Training and education programs that enhance skins and competency to help prevent future errors Maintenance of the integrity of privileged Information
Ability to collect and trend data across the organization
Information regarding errors reported through this system will be handled through the Labor Management Partnership approved issue resolution/corrective action process and will not be used as the basis for discipline except in rare cases when punitive discipline is indicated such as the employee:
Was under the influence of drugs or alcohol
Deliberately violated rules or regulations
Specifically Intended to cause harm
Engaged in particularly egregious negligence
Reporting through this system does not relieve the employee of the responsibility to complete an Incident report when indcated by policy.
2.	PERFORMANCE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
Workforce development and performance improvement—together with our quality programs and training and education—are key pillars in the organizational transformation we envision.
a.	PERFORMANCE
Kaiser Permanente and the AFL-CIO Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions are compefingin a challenging market that is characterized by a limited workforce, changes in technology, changes in dinical practice, ^cultural diversity, changing demographics, and high demand for qualify service. We can enhance performance by:
Investing in people and infrastructure
Developing a formal approach to improve communication skills throughout the organization
Fostering leadership at work
Supporting involvement in community services
Investing in People and Infrastructure
We must make a significant new investment in people in order to build a high performance organization rooted in the Partnership and the KP Promise. This will be done through a focus on education, development, and opportunity.
Developing a Formal Approach to Improve Communication Skills
Throughout the Organisation
We will work to develop, implement and maintain communication standards and practices that
will support our vision.
national agreement ] 11
At the facility level, this will be supported through leadership accountability for ongoing face-to-face communication with employees. Reports should include:
Performance goals and targets shared at the beginning of each year
Work group and local organizational performance reported quarterly
In addition, union and management leadership have joint accountability for quarterly performance reports to all employees, addressing issues around key business initiatives, customer feedback, and financial and membership information, in accomplishing this, local parties will explore distribution of information via the KP Intranet connection and employee mailboxes.
Fortering Leadership at Wort
We will fester leadership competencies and behaviors that include creating trust, promoting employee engagement in decision making, building relationships, sharing information, encouraging growth and development of self and others, and modeling the Labor Management Partnership. These competencies will be developed in employees, managers, and union leadership.
in their performance appraisals, managers and employees will be held accountable for demonstration of leadership competencies and behaviors, and a commitment to the principles and progress of the Labor Management Partnership. Recognition should be based on these competencies as well as work group and organizational performance.
Front-line managers have historically served a vital role in leading the workforce. When the partnership evolves to the point that self-directed work teams are functional, front-line managers will continue to play a crucial role in providing leadership and support to front-line workers, but the role wll change in style, scope, and content The role will evolve from directing the workforce to coaching, facilitating, and supporting a large self-directed workforce.
Supporting Involvement in Community Services
Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions will support involvement in sponsored and unsponsored community service. This will further serve our communities and make them a better place for our members and staff to live and work, while providing learning opportunities for employees.
b.	FLEXIBILITY
Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions are committed to enhancement of organizational performance by developing and investing in people and aligning the systems and processes that support the achievement of organizational and partnership goals. Further, we are committed to becoming a high performance organization and to the KP Promise and the Labor Management Partnership as a foundation for reaching this goal.
We recognize that market-driven change has created a challenging competitive situation that is characterized by a limited number of skilled workers and new entrants into the workforce, changes in technology, changes in clinical practice, cultural diversity, changing demographics and high demand for quality service. To become a high performance organization in this environment requires organizational change.
12 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
Becoming a high performance organization also requires a pledge from Partner unions and Kaiser Permanente to modify traditional approaches, to work diligently to enhance flexibility in labor contracts, to willingly explore alternative ways to apply seniority and to address jurisdictional issues In order to achieve organizational performance goals. It is expected that the parties will undertake this in a way that is consistent with the Partnership, while at the same time preserving the principles of seniority and union jurisdiction.
The following is minimally required to create an environment that balances Kaiser Permanente's need for flexibility in removing barriers to enhanced performance with Partner unions' need to honor seniority and jurisdiction. The goal is to create a climate based on trust that promotes achievement of Partnership outcomes and fosters an environment in which Kaiser Permanente, Partner unions, and employees effectively respond to and address issues at the local level. It is not the intent of the parties to undermine the principles of seniority and union jurisdiction or to reduce the overall level of union membership. Management is not looking for the right to make changes unilaterally to achieve greater flexibility, but expects the unions to work with them to address flexibility needs. The need for and desirability of joint decision making is acknowledged.
Management recognizes the union's interest in a balanced approach which will not disadvantage one union relative to another and acknowledges that a broad, long-term perspective be adopted.
Commitment to performance improvement through joint, continuing efforts to redesign business systems and work processes. This includes simplifying workflow, eliminating redundant or unnecessary tasks and coordinating workflow across boundaries. It also requires alignment with and Implementation of the bu sr n ess. strategy, and .t h e. pri nciples. of .the Labor. Manageme nt Partne rship. ■
incorporation of iabor management partnership principles in redesign efforts. These include:
Involving affected employees and their unions in the process
Assessing impact on employees
Minimizing impact on other units due to bumping and other dislocation Providing fair opportunity for current employees to perform new work Re-training or re-deploying affected employees
Applying the principles of employment and income security
Creation of mutually agreeable local work design processes to address local conditions white ensuring high levels of quality, service, and financial performance. RexibQity will enhance management's ability to meet its employment security obligations, just as flexibility will be enhanced by joint labor management influence over workplace practices. Principles to be observed include:
Respect for seniority and union jurisdiction
Flexibility for employees' personal needs
Flexibility in work scheduling, work assignments, and other workplace practices
Commitment of local labor management partners to exhibit creativity and trust to resolve difficult issues such as:
Contractual and jurisdictional issues that are inconsistent with partnership principles and/or that are barriers to achievement of partnership goals
national agreement | 13
Considering reciprocity of seniority between bargaining units to facilitate employee development and performance improvement
Enhancing employee mobility across regions and partner unions and into promotional opportunities Cross training staff across job classifications and union jurisdictional lines where it makes operational or business sense or where union and employee's interests are accommodated
Enabling team members to perform operational functions across boundaries (job classification, department and/or union jurisdiction) within their scope of practice and licensure to serve members/patients
Utilizing a joint process to resolve issues of skill mix, classification, and the application of the provisions of the National Employment and Income Security Agreement.
Mechanisms for flexibility include, but are not limited to:
Expanding skills of staff
Developing innovative and flexible scheduling and work assignments to balance staffing and workload Alternative work assignments and schedules to accommodate variations in staff workload Shifting tasks to accommodate periods of peak demand
Temporary assignments to other work
Using supply-demand management tools to anticipate staffing needs
Other innovative employment options such as seasonal employment and job sharing.
In applying the principles of the Partnership, local labor management partners may make a variety of joint agreements or practices to enhance organizational performance and to accommodate employee interests. In order to encourage creativity and joint risk taking, such agreements will be non-precedent setting and not apply to other units, departments, medical centers, or service areas. However, sharing and adoption of best practices is highly encouraged.
C- EDUCATION AND TRAINING
We recognize that in order to achieve the KP Promise, the vision of the Pathways to Partnership, and enhanced organizational performance, a significant commitment must be made to invest in the training and education of the workforce. Furthermore, most of the policies, commitments and plans described in this Agreement cannot be successfully accomplished without the committed efforts of Kaiser Permanente employees. Meaningful participation requires a high level of knowledge and understanding of the business of health care, the operations of Kaiser Permanente and the principles of the Labor Management Partnership. Therefore, we share the god of a comprehensive, jointly-administered education and training effort with joint design and oversight teams.
National Support
The BTGs identified a variety of educational requirements necessary to advance the partnership and transition into high performing, committed work teams. To address these recommendations, the Strategy Group will establish a national education task force to evaluate the BTC educational recommendations and develop a plan tor integrating the recommendations into the organizational structure.
14 j NATIONAL AGREEMENT
The committee will consider
Development of a uniform and consistent tracking mechanism for all National Labor Management Partnership and regional employee education and training
Methods to secure and coordinate funds from external sources
Jointly administered educational funds for partnership training integrating education into current processes and funding mechanisms National templates for employee education
Providing national guidance and coordination to Regions including the collection and dissemination of best practices in training design and content
National support for the development of Partnership activities.
Support for the educational requirements of Partnership teams including:
Partnership orientation
Business education (root learning maps)
Interest-based problem solving
Consensus decision making
Union education
Issue resolution and corrective action and
Understanding institutional unions.
Support includes program development, train-the-trainer programs, partnership team orientation and consultation.
Joint Emoloveo Education Design and Team*
Joint oversight of local Partnership and other joint training will be provided under the guidance of the Regional Partnership Teams. The national education committee will provide guidance for local/regional teams concerning:	■
National and Regional ovcrsight/administration
Processes to inventory current employee education activities
Audit current spending (total and percentage of payroll)
Create/implement a funding tracking system
Determine feasibility of a National Education Resource Center
3.	EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY
Creating an environment that respects and supports the health and safety of employees as well as patients is key to achieving performance results. Therefore, Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions commit to the guiding principles that best insure employee health and safety: protect yourself, protect our employees and protect our members, and protect Kaiser Permanente assets. By adopting these principles we are initiating and identifying specific areas through which these principles can be promoted and institutionalized.
Health and Safety programs should provide integrated services, benefits, and programs. The collective goal is to integrate current health and safety teams into partnership teams.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT |	15
Health and safety teams, integrated as partnership teams will assist in prioritizing and implementing funding, determining accountability and developing measurements, and may assist in or oversee the implementation of consistent Health and Safety and prevention programs. These teams may be linked to and will coordinate with the Regional Partnership Teams or National Teams as appropriate.
The existing California Draft Integrated Disability Management policy and the guidelines for temporary placement of bargaining unit employees will be reviewed and considered for national adoption. As areas adopt the plan, local Labor Management Partnership Teams will work with local health and safety teams/departments to coordinate and assist in implementation. A communication plan will then be developed and timetables established to implement the program. The priority guidelines for temporary placement of bargaining unit employees will be followed.
Priorities at the national and local levels may include reporting and performance measurement systems, with accountability measures to determine the return on investment and continuation of the program, injury and illness prevention, and other jointly developed outcomes.
A Consistent Set of Prevention Programs
An Environmental Health and Safety partnership effort will determine a set of prevention programs that include the following tasks:
Patient handling: develop a Code of Safe Practice, conduct Team Patient Handling training, purchase equipment, establish lift teams
Bloodborne pathogens: form National Labor Management Partnership Sharps Safety Committee; pursue the goal of obtaining, maintaining, and utilizing the safest sharps safety devices that ensure the most passive features; develop sharps injury log; monitor sharps disposal; implement training
Workplace violence: collect and review incident data; implement training; determine cellular phone needs/allowances; establish uniform policies for a) visitor access, b) communication with family on patient status, c) staffing, training, equipment, and procedures for cash handling, d) immediate employee access to emergency services, e) confidentiality of employee information, and 0 other related topics deemed necessary; recommend engineering and administrative controls; provide debriefing and counseling for impacted employees; develop a uniform system for recording workplace violence incidents.
Chemical exposure: review current chemical hazards training efforts and develop new training; ensure chemical information is available and accessible; set dear policies and procedures.
Facility cleanliness: improve orientation and training of environmental service employees and involve employees in efforts to improve the cleanliness of facilities.
1fi | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
4.	WORK-LIFE BALANCE
As a health care organization, Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition are committed to the health and wellbeing of employees and to work-life practices, programs and services that balance work and life cycle challenges. Employees who are supported in balancing their work and personal lives are more effective in their work, more productive as team members, and better able to deliver quality health care and service to members/patients. The organization's responsiveness to individuals' needs, both on and off the job, is a powerful predictor of productivity, job satisfaction, commitment and retention.
The Labor Management Regional Teams should provide leadership on work-life balance issues. They should develop operational policies, oversee implementation of work-life balance programs, and coordinate ongoing training and communication about life balance.
There are two key components that together enable us to improve work-life balance: time away from work, and services that support health and well-being.
Time Off
Partnership unions and management believe that time away from work is essential to achieve work-life balance. It is important for employees to take time for leisure as well as time to manage the demands of their personal lives.
Attendance education: Education about the appropriate use of sick leave, coupled with monitoring and corrective action when needed, can help managers and employees balance the obligation to be at work "with the'need to'take care of health and'well-beingrFor those bargaining units'with traditionalsick leave time off benefits, the "Labor Management Education Program: Attendance'' currently used in the North Valley Service Area, may be a model for attendance education.
Donating days: The Partnership should create a mechanism for employees to voluntarily donate some earned time off, vacation, or life balance days to employees in need.
Work-Life Balance Services
To achieve work-life balance goals. Partner unions and Kaiser Permanente should evaluate a continuum of available services—health promotion, employee assistance services, and referral services.
There are three parts to work-life balance services:
Health promotion focuses on keeping people healthy. Health promotion services and programs may include, but are not limited to, self-help classes, support groups, stress management, conflict management, and cultural sensitivlty/awareness training.
Employee assistance services are intended to maximize employees’ ability to cope and remain , productive during stressful events and life crises. Such services should be sponsored nationally and implemented locally. They include work-life problem assistance, such as drug and alcohol assistance
national agreement [ 17
assessment and referral, short-term family counseling, and manager/union consultation services. Life crisis services include emergency financial aid and grief counseling.
Referral services provide a caring environment that is sensitive to the variety of employee needs. Company sponsored, arranged or subsidized services may be provided. We should utilize Kaiser’s size to obtain discounts in contracts for goods and services. This should benefit employees with minimal added cost. Examples indude mass transit incentives, finandal counseling services, conderge services, and computer discounts. Some of these services are provided currently through the California Division Employee Activity Program. Expansion of these services nationally may be evaluated by the Strategy Group during future years of the contract
Regional, service area, or facility partnership teams will be responsible for overseeing and insuring implementation of work-life balance programs as mutually agreed. Some of the responsibilities include:
Inventory of existing services
Assess high priority new or expanded services to include health promotion services and programs, employee assistance services and referral services
Work with local employee assistance personnel to ensure implementation of recommended new or expanded services
Ensure communication to all employees regarding access to available services
Periodically evaluate utilization, cost savings and satisfaction with services
18 | national agreement
► D. UNION SECURITY
1.	UNION LEAVES OF ABSENCE
In support of the Partnership relationship, upon request, the Employer will grant time off to employees for official Union business so long as the number of employees absent for union business does not impose an unreasonable burden on the Employer and the Employer receives reasonable notice.
Union leaves will be defined according to the following:
Short Term Leaves are defined as leaves up to thirty days. Employees will continue to accrue seniority, service credit and benefits during the time of the absence, at the expense of the Employer. The impact of multiple short term leaves on the operations must be considered.
Long Term Leaves are defined as leaves of absence for more than 30 days and up to a maximum of one year. Such leaves will be granted by the Employer In increments of three months and shall be reviewed periodically by the Regional Partnership Teams. Seniority, service credit, credited service and health, dental, and life insurance benefits will continue during the leave so long as the union reimburses Kaiser Permanente for the cost of such.
Elected Official Leave. Any employee elected to a union office will be automatically granted a leave of absence for the duration of the term or three years, whichever is less. Employees must return to work after the completion of one term. Seniority, health, dental, and life insurance benefits will continue during-this time, so long as the Union reimburses Kaiser Permanente for the costs of such;-Service credit and credited service will be applied for a maximum of two years, so long as the union reimburses the Employer for such costs. Per local agreement, leaves beyond one term may be granted, but will not include service credit.
Kaiser Permanente will pay employees for absences in order to participate in grievances, issue resolution meetings, Kaiser Permanente Work Committees and interest-based negotiations under the Living Agreement Section. Paying employees for participation in panel arbitrations will be the decision of the Regional Partnership Team.
The Employer and the leaders of the Partnership Unions will work together to ensure reasonable notice and to minimize impact on service and care delivery associated with this provision.
2.	CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS
The parties recognize that unions and employers do not stand still. Unions merge with each other, or in some cases, split into smaller parts. Employers buy and sell operations, spin off business units, merge with other entities, or otherwise restructure their operations.
Through implementation of the Partnership principles embedded in this National Agreement, the parties expect to establish open communication concerning business and organizational issues affecting their respective operations. The parties anticipate that in most instances through such communication and the Partner Unions' ongoing involvement in Kaiser Permanente's business matters, the Unions will be aware of
NATIONAL AGREEMENT | 19
business issues that may cause Kaiser Permanente to consider transactions such as those described above, in such circumstances, the parties contemplate that they will move to more formal discussions concerning such contemplated transactions as Kaiser Permanente's consideration of options proceeds. The parties intend that the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions and the affected Partner Unions will be invoked in such consideration in a manner consistent with Partnership principles end that the legal and contractual rights of the affected employees will be honored in any resultant transaction.
3.	VOLUNTARY COPE CHECK-OFF
The Employer agrees to administer a voluntary check-off of employee contributions to the Union's political education and action fund. The program shall include the following provisions:
Contributions to the political education and action fund are voluntary for employees
The Union is responsible for obtaining check-off authorization from each employee who wishes to have a voluntary payroll deduction
The Union will reimburse Kaiser Permanente for the costs of administering the payroll deduction
Kaiser Permanente will implement this program if its attorneys advise, or if the IRS offers either an informal opinion or a controlling letter or decision, that this proposed program does not jeopardize Kaiser Permanente's non-profit status. In the latter case, the parties commit to seek the IRS opinion before the implementation of the National Agreement on October 1,2000. Under no circumstances will the check-off be Implemented before ratification of the Agreement.
4.	SUB-CONTRACTING
[AJ Consistent with current practice, Management reserves the right to meet Immediate day-to-day operational needs by contracting for services, for example, through registry, temporary services, etc,
[Bl The Parties reaffirm a Partnership presumption against the future sub-contracting of bargaining unit work.
[Cl The parties further affirm their commitments to address any regional or national issues concerning future subcontracting of bargaining unit work through a process of joint problem solving at the Regional Partnership Council and at the National Labor Management Partnership Strategy Croup level respectively.
20 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
[D] Coincident with paragraph [C] above, the parties agree that the newly formed Strategy Group will be charged, at its first meeting, with the responsibility for (1) reviewing subcontracting in view of current and future business realities as well as the employment and income security needs of the workforce; (2) developing a national policy which will address policy and practice guidelines with respect to past, current and future contracting; and (3) establishing appropriate decision making and issue resolution processes for issues arising under the national or any local or regional subcontracting policy.
In developing these polities, the Strategy Group will solicit and consider input and recommendations from the Local and Regional Partnership Teams, in making these recommendations, the Local and Regional Partnership Teams will collect and analyze data regarding the nature and scope of regional and local subcontracting.
[F] Nothing In this section is intended to supplant or replace more restrictive subcontracting provisions contained in existing local contracts or issues currently being processed within those provisions or negotiated subcontracting polities made at the local level.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT | II
> E. PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESSES
1.	ISSUE RESOLUTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCEDURES
An effective means of resolving issues is fundamental to the long-term success of the Labor Management Partnership. Solving workplace concerns quickly and by those most directly involved Is essential to reducing conflicts, grievances, and patient/member complaints, it Will also contribute to better relations and a more constructive work environment. Issue Resolution and Corrective Action procedures work In tandem to achieve these outcomes. To that end, the procedure has two components:
A system for raising and quickly resolving workplace issues using interest-based problem solving by those directly involved with toe issue and
A method of resolving performance and behavior issues in a non-punitive fashion in which employee, supervisor and Union representatives work together to identify the problem and craft the solution.
The Issue Resolution and Corrective Action Plan
Summary of Issue Resolution:
Issues are raised at the work unit level and the stakeholders within the work unit will meet to attempt to resolve the concern. Issues unresolved at the work unit level are reviewed by the local Partnership Team. If the concern continues to remain unresolved, the issue can be referred to the Regional Partnership Team for resolution, issue Resolution is an alternative to, but does not replace the Grievance Procedure.
Summary of Corrective Action:
The Corrective Action Plan has five levels: Oral Reminder, Individual Action Plan, Corrective Action Plan, Day of Decision and Termination. The first two steps are informal with no documentation in the personnel file. There are no warning letters or suspensions. The goal is to jointly correct the performance or conduct, rather than punish the employee. An employee who disputes any action at any level under this procedure, shall have the right to file a grievance.
Implementation of the Procedure:
By no later than April 1,2002, Regional/Service Area Partnership Teams should have in place the following, which will replace any existing procedures:
A jointly developed and adopted Issue Resolution and Corrective Action Procedure which, although It can be locally customized, is consistent with toe National Issues Resolution and Corrective Action Plan. The Plan should be obtained from the Office of Labor Management Partnership.
Managers, stewards, and Partnership Team members trained in interest-based problem solving and corrective action procedure.
A thorough orientation in how to access and utilize the procedures for all covered employees.
The procedure must be implemented simultaneously throughout an entire Service Area or Region after all the required training and orientation has been accomplished.
32 ] NATIONAL AGREEMENT
To address matters pertaining to the National "Responsible Reporting” initiative, interim measures may be necessary while the above-mentioned Issue Resolution and Corrective Action Procedures are jointly crafted and employees, stewards, and managers trained in their use. Patient care errors should be separated from other performance issues and be processed in accordance with the Responsible Reporting guidelines and not by utilizing traditional disciplinary procedures.
2.	PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REVIEW PROCESS
[AppKcibls bo Stttkxi 1 wd Section 3 u noted]
After sharing information and fully discussing and exchanging ideas and fully considering aO views about issues of interest and concern to the parties, decisions should be reached that are satisfactory to all.
However, it is understood that the parties may not always agree. Disagreement at the facility level which arises out of the interpretation and/or implementation of Section 1, should be referred to the local level Partnership Team for discussion in an attempt to reach a consensus decision. If it is unresohrable at the local level, the Regional Partnership Team must address and attempt to resolve the issue at its next scheduled meeting but no later than 30 calendar days following its referral. The Regional Partnership Team will, after careful review of all facts and interests, craft a consensus decision designed to resolve the issue.
If consensus proves impossible, the matter may then be referred to a national panel comprised of two union and two management members of the labor Management Partnership StrategyjGroup, along with a._______________
predetermined neutral designee selected by the Strategy Group. The panel will be designated immediately upon receiving a request The panel will meet confer and ultimately craft a solution within 30 days unless the time is extended by mutual agreement It is the responsibility of the neutral designee to ensure that a final resolution to the issue is crafted. The resolution will be final and binding on all parties. The Strategy Group members selected should be from among those least vested in the substance of the disagreement. Questions involving interpretation of the National Agreement may also be submitted to this Review Process by national parties.
NATIONAL AGREEMENT | 33
> F. TERM OF THE PARTNERSHIP
In recognition that the substance, as well as the spirit and intent, of this Agreement is largely dependent upon the existence of the Labor Management Partnership, the labor and management signatories commit to continue participation in and support of the Partnership throughout the term of this Agreement.
While the Labor Management Partnership Agreement, inclusive of clarifying addenda of Employment and Income Security and Recognition and Campaign Rules, provides for a sixty-day notification period for either of the parties to disengage from the partnership relationship, the Review Process in Section 1 of this Agreement substitutes said notification with an alternative process of reviewing and resolving issues that could otherwise individually or collectively result in the dissolution of this partnership.
Notwithstanding the parties' commitment to this ongoing relationship, there may be instances where either side may engage in such egregious non-partnering behavior that the corresponding partner takes unilateral action and may also withdraw some or all of the partnership privileges extended to the other party. Such conduct, unilateral action or withdrawal could likewise be submitted to the Review Process for determination and resolution.
Until the partnership relationship matures, the parties recognize that, on occasion, either party may engage in behavior that conflicts with partnership principles and elicits corresponding behavior from the other party. It is expected that this Review Process could also be instrumental in providing guidance to the parties for the future.
Although the commitment to use the Review Process as the alternative to serving a sixty-day notice of termination of the partnership agreement runs concurrently with the National Agreement, the Labor Management Partnership Agreement continues in effect and does not terminate with the expiration of this Agreement
34 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
SECTION 2: WAGES AND BENEFITS
[Ongoing Obligations]
> A. COMPENSATION
To promote Partnership principles and support our guiding principle that Kaiser Permanente become the “employer of choice” in the health care industry, Partnership employees should receive excellent wages. We recognize, however, that wages alone will not support our "employer of choice" strategy. In addition to wages, we are committed to Investing in benefits, workforce engagement, training and development opportunities, and leadership development as critical elements in pursuing this goal.
In valuing and rewarding employees for length of service with Kaiser Permanente, the parties agree that wages should be tenure based. In addition to length of service, the parties agree to consider these factors in developing and adjusting compensation levels: labor market conditions, changes In cost of living, internal alignment, recognition of the value of the Labor Management Partnership, and ability to recruit new employees.
Compensation changes during the term of this contract include three components:
Annual across-the-board (ATB) wage increases
Equity adjustments in the first two years of the contract and
Potential for performance sharing bonuses in the last three ye ars of the contract.

2. EQUITY ADJUSTMENTS
Equity dollars are available for a broad range of issues and will be distributed by mutual agreement of the parties at local negotiations. Examples of possible uses of Equity adjustment are two-tier systems (geographic, date of hire), differentials (senior, lead, charge, shift, bilingual), overtime or premium pay, reclassifications, internail or external equity, internal job classification alignment, market-sensitive and hard-to-recruit situations, longevity pay, specialty pay, across-the-board wage increase enhancements, benefits not covered by the National Agreement, and implementation of Bargaining Task Group recommendations, as appropriate.
Year	Northern California	Southern California	Regions Outside California
1	1.5%	.75%	1%	I
2	0.6%	1.75%	0.5%
The equity percentages listed above are percentages of each local labor union’s total payroll, defined as all compensated hours times the weighted average wage rate. Distribution of equity monies is to be negotiated in local negotiations within the guidelines stated above.
5. PERFORMANCE SHARING
Performance Sharing is intended to recognize that, through the Labor Management Partnership, employees and their Unions have a greater opportunity to impact organizational performance and employees should, therefore, have a greater opportunity to share in any performance gains. Performance Sharing is over and above base wage rates and will be based on mutually-agreed-to performance factors and targets.
Performance targets will be set by Region and may be based on quality, service, financial performance or other mutually acceptable factors.
if targets are met, Performance Sharing opportunities will be as shown below. All amounts will be based on total payroll for employees covered	by the Partnership in each Region:
Year 3-1 % payout at target to	be paid	out in First Quarter 2003, based	on 2002	performance
Year 4-2% payout at target to	be paid	out in First Quarter 2004, based	on 2003	performance
Year 5-3 % payout at target to	be paid	out in First Quarter 2005, based	on 2004	performance
The National Performance Sharing Program is dependent and based on the implementation of Partnership structures and processes that empower employees to have an impact on the program's targeted factors. To afford employees a reasonable opportunity to earn the above Years 3, 4 or 5 payouts, Partnership structures and processes must reach critical thresholds to support the program. Further, the factors used must be measurable against mutually agreed upon predetermined targets. The resources for the National Performance Sharing Program will be achieved through enhanced organizational performance.
24 | NATIONAL AGREEMENT
As the Labor Management Partnership continues to grow and evolve, an Important element is to ensure that employees share in the success of the organization as enhanced performance is achieved through the Partnership. Specifically, all Partnership employees will participate in a National Performance Sharing Program, which provides an annual cash bonus based upon Regional performance in the areas of quality, service, financial health and other mutually acceptable factors. To that end, during the first quarter of 2001, the Strategy Group shall appoint a joint Labor Management Partnership Work Group to develop a National Performance Sharing Program. The jointly designed Program will reward partnership employees for reaching mutually agreed upon Regional targets.
In developing the new National Performance Sharing Program, the design Work Group will adhere to the following agreements reached during Common Issues Bargaining:
All Kaiser Permanente employees covered under the Labor Management Partnership Labor Agreement shall participate in the Program. This includes full-time, part-time, short-hour, casual, on-call and per diem employees.
Other incentive, gain sharing or reward programs may currently cover some Labor Management Partnership employees, in such cases, employees may not receive a payment from the National Program in addition to a payment from a current program. Instead, employees shall receive the higher of either the new National Program or their current program.
At any time during the term of this Agreement additional sub-regional plans may be mutually developed. In these instances, the covered employees will not receive a payment from both programs, but will receive a payment from the program that provides the highest payment.
The Program year shall be the calendar year, with mutually agreed upon Regional targets set at the beginning of each year. The Program shaB run for the calendar year with final results determined and payments issued during the first quarter of the year following the end of the Program year.
The Performance Sharing Program will establish mutually agreed upon Regional targets with a bottom threshold (minimum payment) and an upper limit stretch target (maximum payment) In the areas of quality, service, financial health and other mutually acceptable factors. Each Region will establish a process to develop mutually agreed upon targets with thresholds and maximums. To the extent appropriate and if mutually agreeable, Regional targets should be aligned with, and may be identical to, physician and managerial incentive targets. The percentage payouts listed above will be paid for achieving performance at targeted levels. Proportional payouts (i.e., higher or lower than listed above at target level) will be made for performance achieved that is either above or below targeted levels.
Employees must be In job classifications covered by the Labor Management Partnership Labor Agreement during the Program year and be an active employee on December 31st to receive a payment under the National Program for that year. However, employees who retire during tire Program year or prior to the payment date or transfer to another Kaiser Permanente job classification not covered under the Partnership Labor Agreement shall receive a pro-rated payment based upon compensated hours attained during the Program year in a job classification covered under the Partnership.

An important consideration in attracting and retaining a changing workforce is the benefit package and our mutual need to ensure that the high financial commitment toward benefits are structured in a manner which delivers high value to both current and prospective employees. Kaiser Permanente and the Partnership Unions have a mutual interest in maximizing employee satisfaction and supporting successful recruitment and retention of employees by examining creative options for the delivery of employee benefits.
The parties have committed to a Labor Management Partnership study to evaluate best practices and recommend an approach that will increase employee satisfaction in the benefits, which constitute an important and costly portion of total compensation.

Explore benefit options that neither add nor decrease current costs to the organization Ensure that as benefit costs escalate, the Employer will bear the costs as in prior plans Develop options that give employees the opportunity to select high, medium and low medical and dental plan options
Develop options that give employees the opportunity to enhance existing benefits (eg, vision, life insurance, income protection, etc.)	r
Develop options that give employees the opportunity to select increased income protection (short-term disability, long-term disability, life insurance, etc.)
Develop options that give employees the opportunity to select new benefits not previously provided (long-term care, chiropractic, orthodontia, etc.).
