There shall be no restriction on delegation of duties ordinarily performed by UPMs when a UPM and a First Assistant Director both are assigned to the production.

are next in order on the list immediately following the name of the Arbitrator last selected.

2-305	Situs of Arbitration
All arbitrations shall be in Los Angeles, absent agreement by the parties, except that they shall be in New York if the personal service agreement out of which the dispute arose was negotiated, entered into and production was based in New York and a majority of the witnesses required for the arbitration hearing reside regularly in and around the New York area. Any dispute as to where the arbitration should be held shall be determined by an Arbitrator in Los Angeles selected according to the method set forth herein. If the Arbitrator determines that Los Angeles is the proper situs for the arbitration, he or she shall hear the merits thereof, provided he or she is available.
Arbitrations held in Los Angeles will alternate on an Employer-by-Employer basis between the Guild's offices and, at the election of the Employer, the AMPTP's offices, if available, or the Employer's offices, if in Los Angeles. The party providing the hearing room shall do so at no cost to the other.
2-306	Notification to Arbitrator
The claimant(s) shall notify the Arbitrator of his or her selection in writing with a copy to each respondent and at the same time furnish the Arbitrator with a copy of the BA, a copy of the demand for arbitration and the name, address and telephone number of the person who will represent the claimant(s) in the arbitration hearing.

The Arbitrator shall notify the parties of the time and place of the arbitration hearing.

2-308	Exchange of Information
The parties will cooperate in the exchange of information reasonably in advance of the hearing date regarding the expected utilization of documents and physical evidence. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the arbitration hearing, either party may make a written request to the other to produce, on a date not earlier than seven (7) days before the hearing, documentary evidence of the type producible pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum. The documents must be
2-307
- 32 -
produced on the date requested, but the other party may object to the production of the documents to the same extent as though the documents were subpoenaed. Any such objection shall be considered by the Arbitrator at the hearing.
The introduction of documents or physical evidence shall not be precluded because they were not exchanged in advance of the hearing.
2-309	Award
The award of the Arbitrator shall be promptly furnished to the parties in writing and shall be final and binding on the Guild, the Employee and the Employer. An arbitration award interpreting any of the terms of this BA thereafter shall be binding upon the Guild and the Employer; provided, however, that in any subsequent arbitration between the Guild and the Employer involving an interpretation of the same term or terms of the BA, the Arbitrator may determine whether or not, as a result of the different combination of facts, the prior arbitration award is relevant or determinative of the issue in such subsequent arbitration.
Section 2-400 EXPEDITED ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
2-401	Notwithstanding any other provision of the BA, any personal service
contract or any deal memo, the following Expedited Arbitration Procedure shall be followed if, in the opinion of a party, a grievance will become moot or damages will be increased by reason of delay if processed through the above Grievance and Arbitration Procedure.
(a)	A Notice of Expedited Arbitration (so labeled by the claimant) shall be reduced to writing and given to the respondent and the first available Arbitrator listed in subparagraph 2-304(a) who can hear the matter within two (2) business days following the filing of the Notice of Expedited Arbitration. The Notice of Expedited Arbitration shall include the name, address and telephone number of the claimant's representative(s) and the name of the person who represents the respondent. A copy of the BA and any applicable available personal service contract
- 33 -
2-401
and/or deal memo shall be given to the Arbitrator along with the Notice of Expedited Arbitration.
(b)	Upon receipt of the Notice of Expedited Arbitration, the Arbitrator shall, by telephone or facsimile, notify the parties of the time and place of the Expedited Arbitration hearing.
(c)	An Expedited Arbitration hearing shall not be continued, absent agreement of the parties, except upon proof of good cause by the party requesting such continuance. The unavailability of any witness shall not constitute good cause unless the witness' testimony is relevant to the issues in the arbitration and could not be received by means consistent with fundamental fairness which do not require the witness' presence at the hearing.
(d)	Paragraphs 2-101, 2-102, 2-103, 2-201, 2-301, 2-304(a) (last paragraph) and (b), 2-305, 2-307(b) through (e) and 2-309 of this Article 2 shall be applicable to this Expedited Arbitration Procedure, except that:
(1)	the Expedited Arbitration hearing shall be commenced not later than on the second business day next following receipt of the Notice of Expedited Arbitration;
(2)	the Arbitrator's written award shall be issued within two (2) business days from the end of the Expedited Arbitration hearing, but failure to meet the deadline shall not oust the Arbitrator of jurisdiction;
(3)	the award shall be served on the parties by messenger or facsimile; and
(4)	the same list of Arbitrators for non-expedited arbitrations shall apply to Expedited Arbitrations, but the rotation shall be separate.
(e)	Nothing contained in this Expedited Arbitration Procedure shall preclude the parties from discussing the settlement of the
2-401
- 34 -
Expedited Arbitration, except that such discussion shall not delay the Expedited Arbitration Procedure.
(f)	The failure of the claimant to serve the Notice of Expedited Arbitration within ten (10) business days following the date on which the facts upon which the claim is based were discovered by the party bringing the Expedited Arbitration shall constitute a waiver of the right to this Expedited Arbitration Procedure. If two or more claims are submitted to Expedited Arbitration and the Expedited Arbitration Procedure has been waived or is inapplicable to one or more claims, the same Arbitrator may determine the claims not subject to Expedited Arbitration, provided that such non-Expedited Arbitration claim or claims shall be determined in accordance with the regular Arbitration Procedure set forth in Section 2-300, unless the parties agree otherwise.
(g)	Any party to an arbitration hereunder may, if the circumstances hereinabove set forth exist, require that the arbitration be conducted as an expedited arbitration by serving appropriate notice to that effect.
(h)	If the Expedited Arbitration involves multiple disputes or controversies, the Arbitrator may, upon the request of a party, bifurcate or separate such disputes or controversies and render separate awards, each of which shall be deemed final.

2-502	Consideration for Determining Remedies
In determining the appropriate remedy, the Arbitrator shall take into account such evidence as may be adduced by the claimant of similar prior violations by the respondent.

2-503	Compliance with Arbitrator's Award
Should the Arbitrator issue an award which in whole or part is not self-executing, and a party fails to comply with such award, the party aggrieved thereby may, but need not, submit the matter to the Arbitrator who issued the award.
Section 2-600 COURT PROCEEDINGS
2-601	Arbitration Exclusive Remedy

cease to apply to such dispute. The Guild shall have the right, but not the obligation, to be party in any such action in court.
(b)	The Guild shall have the right to take to grievance and arbitration any claim by the Guild of an Employer's breach of the BA, including a failure to pay minimum compensation, regardless of whether or not such claimed breach may also involve a breach by the Employer of its contract with the Employee. Such proceeding shall not affect the right of the Employee to pursue remedies at law or in equity, except as limited by the provisions of the BA.
(c)	If the Employee and the Guild make a claim for unpaid compensation in an arbitration proceeding, then to the extent of any unpaid non-contingent compensation in excess of $550,000, collection of such excess from the Employer shall be deemed waived.

2-603	Petition to Confirm, Vacate or Modify Award

Section 2-700	WITHDRAWAL OF SERVICES
2-701	Notwithstanding any provision of any personal service contract, deal memo or of the BA to the contrary, it shall not be a violation thereof for the Guild or any Employee (at the direction of the Guild) to withhold services from the Employer

$3,158.00 figure above shall be increased to $3,253.00 during the period July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 and to $3,351.00 during the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.)
(2)	If a Director works six (6) days in his/her workweek at the request of Employer in the studio, the Director will be paid for such sixth day worked, in addition to guaranteed weekly compensation, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Director's actual pro rata daily salary or an additional two hundred percent (200%) of scale, whichever is lower.
(3)	For Directors employed on a "flat" deal, the additional compensation shall be $3,158.00f per day for the seventh day worked in his/her workweek and holidays (which shall be increased to $3,253.00 for the period July 1, 2015 to and including June 30, 2016 and to $3,351.00 for the period July 1, 2016 to and including June 30, 2017) and one-fifth (1/5) of applicable weekly minimum for the sixth day worked in the Director's workweek in the studio.
The days so worked may be credited against minimum days guaranteed, but the compensation in excess of pro rata for the seventh day worked in the workweek and holidays and the sixth day worked in a studio workweek will not be credited against guaranteed compensation. If the sixth day worked in a studio workweek is a holiday, the holiday rate shall be paid.
(d)	Travel or scouting on the seventh day worked in the workweek or holidays or the sixth day worked in a studio workweek at Employer's request shall be compensated by payment only of pro rata daily compensation.
" See text of footnote 3 on page 39.
- 49 -
4-107
(e)	Employees receiving more than three hundred percent (300%) of minimum compensation may agree to waive additional pay for travel.
(f)	If the Employer in its collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild, Writers Guild, or I.A.T.S.E. hereafter grants any new holiday, the same provision shall be deemed included hereunder.
4-108	Deal Memorandum
Following the oral confirmation between Employer and a Freelance Director (or the Director's agent) of the rate of compensation and the starting date for a proposed employment of the Director, the Employer will deliver a "deal memorandum" to the Guild and to the Director (or the Director's agent) prior to his or her employment.
Such "deal memorandum" shall set forth at least the information contained in Exhibit "C-1" or "C-2," as applicable, attached hereto. The "deal memorandum" submitted may contain further terms in addition to those specified in such Exhibits, including part or all of the terms of the employment contract.
With respect to any motion picture, including a multi-part closed-end series but excluding an episode of a television series or serial, Employer shall submit to the Director the then available top sheet of the budget at the same time it delivers the Director's Deal Memorandum.
In no event is any Director to commence services before delivery of the "deal memorandum" to the Guild, except in cases of bona fide emergency. If such services commence prior to delivery of the "deal memorandum" to the Guild, the Guild may notify Employer to forthwith deliver such "deal memorandum" to the Guild. If Employer fails to deliver the "deal memorandum" within twenty-four (24) hours after such notice, the Guild may order the Director to withhold services until a "deal memorandum" is delivered to the Guild. The Employer may require Director to sign a copy of the "deal memorandum" prior to permitting the Director to commence services.
4-107
- 50 -
Upon commencement of principal photography of a theatrical motion picture, or of a television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or longer, Employer shall furnish to the Director and to the Guild an addendum to the Director's deal memorandum containing the following information as set forth in Exhibit "C-3" attached hereto, to the extent that such information is then known to the Employer: the dates scheduled for start and finish of the Director's cut; the dates for special photography and processes, if any; the date for delivery of the answer print; and date of release (for theatrical films) or date of network broadcast (if applicable). Employer shall notify the Director and the Guild as soon as practicable in the event of a change in the post-production schedule. The Creative Rights Standing Committee shall continue to examine the utility of these obligations.
4-109	Personal Services Agreement
Following the "deal memorandum," the Employer will, as soon as practicable, deliver to the Director a proposed written contract of employment of the Director. Such contract shall clearly set forth the Director's weekly salary rate.
4-110	Prohibition Against Credits and Offsets
Overscale cannot be used to credit or offset in any manner any payments required to be made to the Director.
The only exception to the prohibition against crediting or offsetting of monies in excess of scale is the right of Employer to negotiate with the Director to credit or offset residuals against monies in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of scale.
No prepayment of residuals will be permitted unless set forth in the "deal memorandum" in the specific amounts which are to be prepaid. Residual compensation shall not otherwise be prepaid. Any prepayment of residual compensation shall be sent to the Director in care of the Guild and not combined with the other payments for his or her services.
The provisions of this Paragraph 4-110 do not apply to Directors of theatrical motion pictures. Thus, crediting or offsetting against
- 51 -
4-110
residual payments for theatrical motion pictures may be done only under the terms of Paragraph 18-109 or Paragraph 19-109, as applicable.
The provisions of Paragraph 20-101 apply to Directors of programs covered under Article 20 of this Agreement in lieu of the provisions of Paragraph 4-110.
4-111	Development Services
(a)	If a Director, at the request of Employer, renders services in supervising development of a screenplay (as distinguished from reviewing or commenting upon a completed or substantially-completed screenplay) with the option to direct and if such option is not exercised or if the Director is replaced or the motion picture is abandoned, the Director shall receive a minimum of $49,512! ($50,997 effective July 1, 2015 and $52,527 effective July 1, 2016) at the time a picture based on such screenplay is produced, if at all, so long as one or more of the writers supervised by such Director in development is accorded writing credit. Payments made to the Director in connection with development shall apply towards the minimum of $49,512f ($50,997 effective July 1, 2015 and $52,527 effective July 1, 2016).
(b)	If a Director, at the request of an Employer, renders services in supervising development of a teleplay (as distinguished from reviewing or commenting upon a completed or substantially-completed teleplay) for a prime time dramatic program of ninety (90) minutes or longer with the option to direct and if such option is not exercised or if he or she is replaced or the production is abandoned, he or she shall receive a minimum of $37,133t ($38,247 effective July 1, 2015 and $39,394 effective July 1, 2016) at the time a television program based on such teleplay is produced, if at all, provided one or more of the writers supervised by such Director in development is accorded writing credit and, provided further, the Company realizes
" See text of footnote 3 on page 39.
4-110
- 52 -
revenues from the production. Payments made to the Director in connection with development shall apply towards the minimum of $37,133t ($38,247 effective July 1, 2015 and $39,394 effective July 1, 2016).

ARTICLE 5
Directors' Term Contracts
5-101	Term Contract Defined
The words "term contract," as herein used, shall be deemed to mean a contract for the exclusive employment of a Director for a basic or original term of not less than twenty-six (26) weeks, with or without layoffs. If any such term contract shall include one or more option periods of employment, no such option period shall be for less than twenty-six (26) weeks, with or without layoffs, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 10-111 herein, providing for "Options-Notice to Director." Whenever the Employer exercises an option for an additional term, the Director shall be given at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice.
5-102	Application of Minimum Salary to Term Contracts
The obligation of the Employer, upon entering into a term contract for the employment of a minimum salary term contract Director, shall be wholly satisfied by the payment of such applicable minimum salary, for the applicable periods, subject to the provisions of Article 6.
5-103	Layoff
(a)	In any exclusive term contract of employment granting the Employer the right to lay off without pay, if the Employer exercises the right of layoff, any installment of layoff shall be for a minimum of one (1) full week, except that if the remainder of the allowable layoff is less than one (1) full week, the Employer may lay the Director off for such remaining balance, and, except further, if any installment of allowable layoff is given at the end of a contract period, it may be given for the remainder of such contract period even though such remainder is less than one (1) full week.
5-101
- 54 -
(b)	If the contract period of twenty (20) out of twenty-six (26) weeks has an option for renewal and such option is exercised, one (1) layoff must be for three (3) weeks (herein referred to as the "special layoff period"); three (3) layoffs must be for two (2) weeks each; and three (3) layoffs must be for one (1) week each. If the twenty (20) out of twenty-six (26) week contract does not have an option for renewal, or if it has such an option and the option is not exercised, one (1) of the layoffs must be not less than two (2) weeks (herein referred to as the "special layoff period") and the other layoffs must be not less than one (1) week. Such layoffs may be consecutive or cumulative. In every instance of layoff, or consecutive layoffs, minimum notice of not less than one (1) week must be given. If the layoff is for only a week, then such notice need be only three (3) calendar days. Except when the Director receives at least double minimum, in every instance of layoffs of eight (8) continuous weeks or more, the Director shall have the right to accept assignments from others during the layoff period, but such assignment shall not extend beyond such layoff period.
(c)	If, during a layoff period other than the special layoff period, the Employer recalls the Director for a new picture, and the Director has been on layoff for less than one (1) full week at the time the Director is so recalled, the Employer shall pay for the intervening time which will then not be considered layoff for any purpose.
(d)	During any layoff period, the Employer shall have the right to recall the Director to render services on a picture in connection with the principal photography of which the Director has previously rendered his or her services. Services for which the Director is so recalled shall be paid for on a daily basis for each day on which they are rendered, or the Employer may, at its option, pay the Director for the entire intervening time, and in the latter case, such intervening time will not be considered layoff for any purpose.
(e)	If the Employer recalls the Director for retakes, added scenes, or other services of the nature mentioned in Paragraph 4-105, during any layoff period, then the Employer shall be required to
- 55 -
5-103
give the Director another equivalent layoff period if there remains sufficient time in that contract period for another such layoff period. If the Employer elects to pay the Director for the intervening time, however, such equivalent layoff is not mandatory.
(f)	If, at any time during any special layoff period, the Employer recalls the Director for a new picture, the Employer shall pay the Director for the full intervening time which shall then not be considered layoff.
(g)	It is understood that if, during any contract period above mentioned, the Employer has failed to exercise its right to place the Director on layoff until such time as the unexpired portion of such contract period is less than the required minimum layoff period, then the Employer may place the Director on layoff for the remainder of such contract period.
(h)	A layoff period shall not be deemed broken and the Employer shall not be required to pay the Director compensation for delivery or submission of a script or other literary or dramatic material when the Director has right of script approval or for any services the Director voluntarily chooses to perform during any layoff period.
(i)	The provisions governing layoffs contained above shall apply to television motion pictures.
5-103

ARTICLE 6
Suspension and Termination of Directors
6-101	Except as expressly provided in this Article, the provisions of this BA
with reference to the obligation of the Employer to furnish employment for the respective "guarantee" periods specified, or to provide for payment of salary in aggregate amounts herein specified, shall, of course, be subject to any and all rights of suspension and/or termination which the Employer may have by contract or otherwise in the event of any incapacity or default of the Director or, in the case of any interference, suspension or postponement of production by reason of strikes, acts of God, governmental action, regulations or decrees, casualties, or any other causes provided for in the so-called "force majeure" clause of such Director's contract of employment or the force majeure provisions of this BA. No suspension or termination of Director's services shall be permitted or effected by Employer under such force majeure clause or provisions unless the entire cast and the Director of Photography of the picture are likewise suspended or terminated, as the case may be. Subject to such rights of suspension and/or termination, the obligation of the Employer upon entering into a contract for the employment of a Freelance Director to furnish employment during any of the foregoing "guarantee" periods of employment shall be wholly satisfied by the payment of the agreed salary for the applicable minimum period. With respect to only theatrical motion pictures, or television films sixty-one (61) minutes or more in length, the illness or incapacity for one (1) week or less of a member of the cast or any other person in connection with the picture shall not be considered "force majeure." With respect to television motion pictures: If the Director is employed on a film under sixty-one (61) minutes in length, and he is suspended by reason of illness or incapacity of a member of the cast or any other person connected with the picture, then the Director may forthwith terminate the employment, but if such termination occurs, the Employer may thereafter employ the same or another Director to fulfill the remaining portion of the guaranteed period of employment. The Employer further agrees that if, despite such suspension, the star of the picture or the Director of Photography is paid in whole or in part with respect
- 57 -
6-101
	to such picture, then the Director will be paid in the same pro rata amount as the star or the Director of Photography is paid. If there is a difference in the proportionate amount paid to the star and the Director of Photography, then the higher proportionate amount shall be paid to the Director. The foregoing provision shall not apply to the continuation of payments to a term player or Director of Photography who is carried by the Employer under the provisions of a term contract.
6-102	After the expiration of the period of limitation above mentioned, the Employer may not again suspend the Director for the same cause during the further continuance of the same cause of suspension, but if, after the termination of such cause, there is a new occurrence of the same or any other cause of suspension, the Employer may again exercise its rights under said "force majeure" clause.
6-103	If the production of the motion picture is cancelled and the Director is terminated due to such a "force majeure," then in the event the production of such television motion picture is recommenced within six (6) months, or in the case of a theatrical motion picture it is recommenced within twelve (12) months, the Director, subject to his or her availability, shall be offered reinstatement of the balance of his previous employment agreement to direct the motion picture in accordance with the terms of such previous employment agreement, and such offer shall immediately be accepted in writing by the Director, within forty-eight (48) hours after the offer is received and, if not, the offer shall be deemed to be rejected.
6-104	Replacement of Director Who Furnishes Material If a Director is employed under a contract concurrently entered into with another contract in which a screenplay or other literary or underlying material for the motion picture, written or controlled by the Director is acquired by the Employer and, if under such directing contract, the Employer reserves the right in a "pay-or-play" provision not actually to utilize the Director's services on the motion picture in whole or in part, then the Employer will expressly refer to such right in the deal memorandum it delivers under Paragraph 4-108 prior to commencement of the Director's services and further will provide in
6-101
- 58 -
said memorandum for an additional negotiated sum to be paid to the Director in the event that the Employer does exercise its pay-or-play right.
6-105	Payment To and Mitigation By Discharged Employees
If a Director is removed from a motion picture, the Employer shall forthwith deliver to the Guild for the Director all remaining unpaid non-deferred, non-contingent compensation as provided by the personal services agreement or deal memo.
If Employer disputes its obligation to pay said compensation to the Director, the amount in dispute shall be deposited with a mutually acceptable bank or other third party designated by an Arbitrator. Such escrow agent shall distribute the amount deposited, together with interest accumulated, if any, according to the provisions of any settlement agreement or, if the dispute is not settled, according to the award of an Arbitrator or judgment of a court of law.
If the Director is employed by third parties during the remaining period during which the Director was guaranteed employment in the motion picture, Employer shall be entitled to an offset of the compensation arising from such new employment for such remaining portion of the guaranteed period against the compensation remaining unpaid under the earlier agreement. Under the described circumstances, the Guild guarantees repayment from the Director to the extent herein provided. Employer agrees that the Director shall have no obligation to mitigate damages arising from his or her removal and that the only obligation of the Director in such event will be to repay or offset sums as herein set forth if the Director, in his or her sole discretion, actually accepts employment during the remaining guaranteed period of the motion picture.
- 59 -
6-105
ARTICLE 7
Directors' Minimum Conditions - Preparation, Production and Post-Production
Section 7-100 PREAMBLE
7-101	The Director's professional function is unique, and requires his or her
participation in all creative phases of the film-making process, including but not limited to all creative aspects of sound and picture.
The Director works directly with all of the elements which constitute the variegated texture of a unit of film entertainment or information.
The Director's function is to contribute to all of the creative elements of a film and to participate in molding and integrating them into one cohesive dramatic and aesthetic whole.
No one may direct, as the term direct is generally known in the motion picture industry, except the Director assigned to the picture.
The following provisions of this Article 7 are therefore agreed upon:
Section 7-200 DISCLOSURE AND CONSULTATION WITH RESPECT TO COMMITMENTS
7-201	Disclosure Before Assignment
Prior to the employment of the Director, or in the case of a Director employed under a term contract or multiple picture contract or under option, prior to his assignment to a picture, Employer shall inform him or her of the following in relation to the picture in question:
(a)	the names of artistic and creative personnel already employed;
(b)	all existing film contemplated to be used;
7-101
- 60 -
(c)	any rights of script approval or cast approval contractually reserved to any person other than the Employer and the individual Producer;
(d)	the top sheet (summary) of any Theatrical Budget or a Television Pattern Budget (as the case may be) which has been established and any limitations thereof, if any. The Director shall use his or her best efforts to conform with such budget. The Director shall have the responsibility and opportunity to express his or her opinion with respect to the practicability of the budget; and
(e)	the story on which the motion picture is based and the script, if any exists, shall be made available to the Director.
It is the intention hereof that Employer shall make full and complete disclosure to the Director of all of the existing artistic and creative commitments with respect to the picture for which the Director is to be employed prior to his or her actual employment, or prior to his or her assignment to the picture if previously employed or optioned without such an assignment.
It is recognized that Directors frequently accept an assignment based upon the Employer's representation as to the budget and shooting schedule of a motion picture. It is therefore agreed that after the Director's assignment to a theatrical motion picture or a television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or longer, the Employer shall not in bad faith or capriciously reduce the budget or the shooting schedule.
In addition to the foregoing, Employer shall give full and complete disclosure of the below-the-line budget to the Director of a theatrical motion picture or a long-form television motion picture at the time the Director is employed or assigned, and provide all subsequent revisions to said budget.
The individuals responsible for approving the budget of a theatrical motion picture shall, prior to the budget being set, consult with the Director with respect to its practicality.
- 61 -
7-201
If the Director of a long-form television motion picture is hired before the budget is approved, the individuals responsible for approving the budget shall, prior to the budget being set, consult with the Director with respect to its practicality.
7-202	Consultation After Assignment
Subject to other specific provisions hereof, between the time the Director is employed (or in the case of a Director employed under a term contract or multiple picture contract or under option, after his or her assignment to the picture), and until the time he or she delivers the Director's Cut, he or she shall be informed as soon as practicable of any proposal concerning and, if reasonably available, shall participate in all decisions with respect to: (a) any changes in the elements of which he or she has been previously notified, or proposed casting and the employment of other artistic or creative personnel, and of any rights or approval thereafter granted to third parties; (b) all creative elements in the production of the film, including but not restricted to the script and any revision thereof, casting, employment of artistic and creative personnel, location selection, set design and construction; pre-production, shooting and post-production scheduling; (c) in no case will any creative decision be made regarding the preparation, production, and post-production of a motion picture without the consultation of the Director. The Director's advice and suggestions shall be considered in good faith.
7-203	Consultation Regarding UPM
With respect to theatrical motion pictures and non-episodic television programs, Director will have the right of consultation with respect to assignment of a UPM assigned after the Director is assigned. The final decision with respect to assignment of the UPM shall remain with the Employer.
7-204	Selection of First Assistant Director
The Director shall have the right, subject to the terms of Articles 14 and 15, to select the First Assistant Director on any theatrical motion picture and any non-series television motion picture (90) minutes or
7-201
- 62 -
longer, provided that such selection must be consistent with the budget of the motion picture and the First Assistant Director selected is not guilty of any criminal conduct. The Director may replace the First Assistant Director provided that such action does not adversely affect the budget of the motion picture. The Employer shall have the right for just cause to discharge a First Assistant Director selected in accordance with this Paragraph 7-204 and a substitute First Assistant Director shall be selected pursuant to this Paragraph.
7-205
Second Unit Director
In the event second unit work shall be contemplated, the Director shall be given an opportunity to consult with the individual Producer and participate in considerations as to the person to be engaged to direct such second unit work. In the event of disagreement between the Employer and the Director as to the choice of the person to be engaged as Second Unit Director, the Employer shall submit to the Director a list of three (3) qualified individuals any one (1) of whom would be approved as Second Unit Director and the Director shall be obligated to approve one (1) of such three (3) persons.
The Director shall be given the opportunity to consult with the Second Unit Director with respect to the manner in which the second unit work is to be performed and may delegate the supervision of the assemblage of second unit photography to the Second Unit Director.
7-206
Individual With Final Cutting Authority
The individual having final cutting authority over the motion picture shall be designated in the Director's Deal Memorandum. In the event such individual ceases to be employed by Employer, the individual named by the Employer to succeed the designated individual shall be a person of equivalent rank. The successor's name shall be deemed incorporated into the Director's Deal Memorandum. If the Employer has not named any such person, then the Employer shall submit to the Director the names of three (3) individuals, any of whom would be acceptable to the Employer as the person to have the final cutting authority over the motion picture. The Director shall select one (1) individual from the three (3) proposed names, and the name of the individual selected shall be deemed to have been incorporated into
- 63 -
7-206
the Director's Deal Memorandum. Employer shall not be deemed to have breached this provision for a reasonable time following the end of employment of the individual originally designated in the Deal Memorandum. During this period, Employer may designate any individual who may temporarily perform all or some of the former employee's functions in exercising final cutting authority.
7-207
Production Executives
Employer recognizes that if the Director has a dispute with the individual in charge of the specific project, the Director has the right to contact the executive in charge of television or theatrical production, as the case may be. The executive will listen to the Director, but may delegate to another person the determination of the dispute. This right is limited to theatrical motion pictures, television long-form productions and multi-part closed-end series. This right may not be exercised to delay production or post-production or to otherwise increase costs.
7-208
One Director To A Film
There will be only one Director assigned to direct a motion picture at any given time.
However, such limitations shall not be construed as precluding assignment of bona fide teams or of more than one (1) Director to direct pick-ups, added scenes or different segments of a multi-storied or multilingual motion picture (e.g., "Tales of Manhattan," "Love Boat" and "Tora-Tora-Tora") or different segments of a multi-part closed-end television series (e.g., "Roots") or the assignment of more than one Director when required by foreign laws, regulations or subsidies, or assignment of a Second Unit Director or any specially skilled Director (e.g., underwater work or aerial work) to work under the supervision of the Director or a similar customary practice not inconsistent with the general intent of this Paragraph 7-208.
The Directors' Council of the Guild shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to a waiver of the above provisions when two (2) Directors apply for the same based on professional necessity.
7-206
- 64 -
At the Employer's request, the Guild agrees to the following exception to this Paragraph 7-208. This exception shall be effective from July 1, 2008 to January 1, 2010 and thereafter unless either the Guild or the AMPTP terminates this exception after giving thirty (30) days written notice.
On an episodic television motion picture which is thirty (30) to sixty (60) minutes in length, the Employer may assign another Director to function as a consultant (herein called "Consulting Director"), subject to the following:
(a)	the Director has not previously directed a motion picture under this or any preceding BA;
(b)	the Consulting Director has been employed no more than two (2) times under this exception;
(c)	all the Employer's instructions in connection with the production must be communicated to the Director;
(d)	the Consulting Director may only counsel and advise the Director, and may not instruct or give suggestions to the actors or crew; and
(e)	the Consulting Director shall be paid not less than the applicable minimum but is not entitled to any additional compensation pursuant to Articles 11, 18 and 20 and is not entitled to credit under Article 8 or any creative rights under Article 7.
The Consulting Director may not replace the Director, subject to the emergency provision in Paragraph 7-1401.
The Employer shall state on the Director's deal memorandum submitted pursuant to Paragraph 4-108 that a Consulting Director has been assigned pursuant to this exception. The Employer shall also state on the Consulting Director's deal memorandum that he or she is assigned as a Consulting Director.
- 65 -
7-208
7-209
Consultation Regarding Editor
If the Employer intends to terminate the motion picture editor’s employment on a theatrical motion picture, the Employer shall notify the Director at least two (2) business days before the termination. During that two (2) day period, the Director shall have the right to consult with the Employer regarding the decision to terminate the editor and the selection of a replacement editor. Upon the Director’s request, the Employer agrees that the president of production, or an individual with an equivalent rank if the Employer does not employ an individual with that title, shall consult with the Director with regard to the aforementioned matters. The final decision with respect to the termination of the editor and the selection of any replacement editor shall remain with the Employer, unless the Director has rights of approval regarding the termination of the editor or selection of any replacement editor.
Section 7-300 PREPARATION
7-301	Literary Material
When the Director is assigned, at his or her request, any existing script or outline in whatever form intended for the production of the motion picture shall be immediately delivered to him or her. Any changes or additions in such script shall be submitted to the Director promptly and before such changes or additions are made available for general distribution. The individual Producer or other appropriate person will confer with the Director to discuss and consider the Director's suggestions and opinions with respect to such changes or additions and will confer with the Director to discuss and consider any script changes or revisions which the Director recommends.
7-302	Delivery of Shooting Script
(a)	In episodic television, the Employer shall deliver the completed shooting script to the Director not later than one day prior to the commencement of the Director's preparation period. For each day the delivery of the completed shooting script is
7-209
- 66 -
delayed, an additional day shall be added to the Director's preparation period.
A "completed shooting script" is defined as that script (not necessarily the final shooting script) which the Employer intends to use for photography of a motion picture, subject to changes such as acting, technical and/or staging problems or those with respect to weather or other emergencies.
The Guild shall grant an automatic and unconditional waiver on an episodic basis for each episode for which the Employer sends the Guild a written request therefor, before it fails to deliver the script as required, only for those series in their first year of production and those series in the second year of production whose first year of production consisted of thirteen (13) or fewer episodes.
(b)	The Employer shall fax a copy of the script “cover sheet” to a Guild employee designated by the DGA on the same day that the script is provided to that episode’s director. The cover sheet shall be accompanied by a statement signed and completed by an employee employed in the production office of the series as follows:
“This will confirm that ________________________(insert name of
production company) furnished a copy of the completed shooting script for episode __________(insert episode number
or title) of the series entitled ________________________ (insert
title of series) to the director of that episode, _____________
___________________ (insert name of director), on ___________________ (insert date).
“By__________________________________ (signature of production
office employee to appear here)
“________________________________ (print name)”
- 67 -
7-302
(c)	None of the provisions set forth above shall apply to series in their first year of production nor to series in the second year of production when the first year of production consisted of thirteen (13) or fewer episodes.
(d)	See Sideletter No. 25 which memorializes the parties' agreement on terms to effectuate the provisions of this Paragraph 7-203.
7-303	Stunts
Any stunt sequence mentioned in the shooting script delivered to the Director (whether or not a waiver of Paragraph 7-302 was granted) may not be increased in magnitude or in degree of difficulty, nor may a stunt sequence be added to such script or later increased in magnitude or degree of difficulty, without the Director's consent to the change. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Employer may diminish the magnitude of a stunt sequence in the shooting script or eliminate it entirely without the consent of the Director.
7-304	Television Preparation Time
With respect to a motion picture (excluding pilots) which is produced for Network Prime Time or is governed by Article 20 and of a type generally produced for Network Prime Time, the Director shall be afforded actual preparation time of no less than three (3) days for a one-half hour program, seven (7) days for an hour program and fifteen (15) days for a two-hour or longer program.
7-305	Inclusion of Director's Name on Episodic Television Scripts
With respect to episodic television motion pictures, the Director's name shall appear on the title page of each script distributed after he/she is assigned. The omission of the Director's name shall not, however, be subject to grievance and arbitration under Article 2 of this Agreement.

The Editor assigned to the picture shall be present at all such screenings at the studio.
Dailies for a television film may be in the form of videocassettes.
While the Director is on distant location, and when it is required that the Director be provided with distant location viewing facilities pursuant to Paragraph 7-402 below, the Employer will ship the dailies of each day's photography within twenty-four (24) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after synchronization of picture and track by the Editor or someone else under his or her supervision.

7-402	Distant Location Viewing Facilities
With respect to theatrical motion pictures, anthology television motion pictures and pilot films, when the company and the Director are scheduled for distant location of four (4) or more consecutive days of shooting, if requested by the Director not less than five (5) days, if practicable, prior to the departure for the distant location, the Director will be provided with interlocking sound and picture projection facilities or their equivalent (for example, kemtable type of viewing device or cassette viewing equipment) for viewing dailies on such distant location.

7-403
- 70 -
Any disagreement relating to the provisions of this Paragraph 7-404 may be submitted to arbitration, but the Employer shall not be prevented from completing the work in question. In determining said dispute, the Arbitrator shall be guided by the fact that the parties hereto have agreed that the following is a list of examples of circumstances which may not be reasonably anticipated prior to the start of principal photography and which may be the basis of the enlargement of second unit work during principal photography. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive of such circumstances.
1.	Weather conditions.
2.	A change in actor availability.
3.	Force majeure.
4.	Special effects shooting problems.
5.	Problems or time pressures arising from the scheduling,
availability or accessibility of locations.
6.	Problems arising from restrictions in permits.
7.	Process plates needed during principal photography.

- 71 -
7-405
stock film
glass and matte shots
optical devices
After principal photography, the Director shall be consulted and participate in considerations with respect to the foregoing, subject to his or her availability.
7-406
Use of Video Assist
The parties agree that on theatrical motion pictures and on television motion pictures ninety (90) minutes or longer, video assist may not be used without the Director's permission.
When the Director of a theatrical motion picture elects to use video assist, he/she shall determine the number and placement of monitors to be used.
7-407
Videotape of Performance
When a camera block rehearsal of a multi-camera television motion picture is videotaped so that all cameras are recorded (i.e., a “quad split”), no one shall have access to a copy of the videotape prior to the completion of the Director’s Cut without the knowledge of the Director.
7-408
Audience Switchers
The audience switcher function is to be performed under the direction of the Director.
Section 7-500 EDITING AND POST-PRODUCTION
7-501
Responsibility of Director
The Director shall be responsible for the presentation of his or her cut of the motion picture (herein referred to as the "Director's Cut") and it is understood that his or her assignment is not complete until he or she has presented the Director's Cut to the Employer, subject to the
7-405
- 72 -
terms and conditions of this BA, as soon as possible within the time period hereinafter provided for.
Subject to Paragraph 7-505(g)(2), no one other than the Director may supervise the editing of the first cut of the film following completion of the editor's assembly, but if the Director refuses to, or due to incapacity, cannot supervise the first cut, the Employer may assign another person to edit the film. Within one (1) day following such an assignment, the Employer shall send the Guild written notice thereof.
7-502	"Hotline"
Any Director who has completed ninety percent (90%) but less than one hundred percent (100%) of the scheduled principal photography of a theatrical motion picture or television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or more in length cannot be replaced, except for cause, until the following procedure (herein referred to as "hotline") has taken place: (a) The Employer shall give the Director and the Guild prompt notice of its intention to so replace the Director; and (b) the available parties shall immediately jointly discuss the matter (the Employer is to be represented in such discussion by the person designated in the deal memo, or a higher ranking executive); and (c) if the parties are unable to resolve the matter, the decision of the Employer shall be final.
7-503	Vesting of Post-Production Rights
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 7-502, a Director who is replaced after directing ninety percent (90%) but less than one hundred percent (100%) of the scheduled principal photography of any motion picture shall be the Director of the film entitled to all the post-production creative rights set forth in this Article 7, unless (a) the Director was primarily responsible for causing the motion picture to be "over budget" or (b) the substituting Director was required to direct more than ten percent (10%) of all principal photography for the picture. Reshooting initial photography due to faulty negative caused by technical problems shall not be included in the computation of the ten percent (10%). The Employer may not schedule additional photography to avoid the express intent of this
- 73 -
7-503
provision and has the burden of proving the necessity of such additional photography.
A Director who has directed one hundred percent (100%) of the scheduled principal photography of a motion picture may not be replaced except for gross willful misconduct.
7-504	No Interference with Director's Cut
No one shall be allowed to interfere with the Director of the film during the period of the Director's Cut. There shall be no "cutting behind" the Director as that term is commonly understood in the motion picture industry. The term "cutting behind" means any editing prohibited by the terms of this BA, including editing by electronic means. When a release date must be met in an emergency, the Director's cutting time may be reduced to an amount of time equal to one-half the actual time period available for cutting.
7-505	Preparation of Director's Cut
The Director shall prepare the Director's Cut of the film for presentation to the individual Producer and to the person designated in the Director's deal memo as having final cutting authority, in the ordinary course of business, over the motion picture. The Director shall diligently and continuously render his or her services in connection with the preparation of the Director's Cut and shall remain reasonably available on the premises during such period.
In pursuance thereof, the following procedure shall be followed:
(a)	The Director shall see the assembled sequences as soon as the Editor has assembled them in accordance with the Director's instructions during the photography of the picture, provided this will not delay the time and preparation of the assemblage of the sequences. If the Director does not give such directions, the Editor may proceed with the assemblage of the sequences without them. The Director shall then make whatever changes he or she deems necessary. As to television, such changes shall be made by the Director working with the Editor and in consultation with the individual Producer. The Editor will
7-503
- 74 -
make no further changes except under the Director's instructions until the completion of the Director's Cut.
With respect to television, the Employer shall cause the sequences to be assembled and made available for viewing by the Director promptly after the close of principal photography so that the Director's Cut can be commenced immediately.
(b)	The Director's Cut shall be accomplished within the following time periods:
Theatrical Motion Pictures
(1)	Within ten (10) weeks after the close of principal photography or within a period of time after the close of principal photography equal to one (1) day of editing time for each two (2) days of originally scheduled photography (as such schedule may have been increased or decreased by mutual agreement between the Director and the Employer), whichever is greater.
(2)	With respect to a low budget film (as defined in Paragraph 3-101), within six (6) weeks after the close of principal photography or within a period of time after the close of principal photography equal to one (1) day of editing time for each one (1) day of originally scheduled photography (as such schedule may have been increased or decreased by mutual agreement between the Director and the Employer), whichever is greater.
Television Motion Pictures
(3)	As to television motion pictures having a running time of thirty (30) minutes or less, within one (1) day plus time and the opportunity to make changes, if necessary, but not to exceed one (1) more day.
(4)	As to television motion pictures having a running time of sixty (60) minutes or less, but more than thirty (30) minutes, within four (4) days.
- 75 -
7-505
(5)	As to television motion pictures having a running time of ninety (90) minutes or less, but more than sixty (60) minutes, within fifteen (15) days.
(6)	As to television motion pictures having a running time of one hundred twenty (120) minutes or less, but more than ninety (90) minutes, within twenty (20) days.
(7)	As to television motion pictures having a running time of more than two (2) hours, twenty (20) days, plus five (5) days for each additional hour in excess of two (2) hours.
(c)	If the assemblage of the film is not completed at the close of principal photography, the above time periods shall not commence to run until such assemblage is completed, unless delay in the completion of the assembly of the film beyond the close of principal photography is caused by the Director.
For the purpose of this Paragraph 7-505, the word "promptly" shall be defined as four (4) business days after close of principal photography in the case of a half-hour television program and six (6) business days after close of principal photography in the case of a one-hour television program. Employer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the assembly to be delivered as soon as possible following close of principal photography and before the fourth or sixth business day, whichever is applicable. If the assembly is not promptly completed and made available, then, when it is completed, Employer shall hold it available for Director's first availability up to two (2) calendar weeks to permit the Director to prepare the Director's Cut.
No one (other than the Editor and the Editor's immediate staff) shall view the completed assembly before the Director or, if the Director so requests, for twenty-four (24) hours after the Director's initial viewing. The Director may not exhibit the film to anyone else without approval of the Employer.
(d)	When the Director's Cut is ready, the Director shall screen such cut for the individual Producer and for the person, if any,
7-505
- 76 -
designated in the Director's deal memo as having final cutting authority over the motion picture. During the screenings of the Director's Cut for the individual Producer and the person, if any, so designated in the deal memorandum, the Director shall be entitled to make recommendations for further changes in following cuts.
(e)	At the Director's request, the Director's Cut of a theatrical motion picture shall, at Employer's election, be previewed before a public audience or be screened before a private audience which shall consist of no fewer than one hundred (100) persons, exclusive of relatives or employees of the Employer. For the purpose of such preview or screening, the Director shall have the right to include tracked music and effects in the Director's Cut. Employer shall grant the Director access to the music and effects, if any, in its library and shall provide the Director no less than one (1) day of dubbing to incorporate music and effects into the Director's Cut. In the event the Director requests such a showing, such preview or screening shall be deemed to be the delivery of the Director's Cut.
(f)	The following procedures are intended to implement the provisions of Paragraphs 7-505 and 7-507 relating to cutting time for Directors of television films and represent no substantive change in the Director's rights and obligations as contained in said Paragraphs.
The Director and the Editor will view the Editor's assembly in a projection room and on a moviola or other similar device and the Editor will note all the Director's instructions. The Editor will then implement all the instructions. The Director and Editor will again view the material in a projection room, and the Editor will note and implement any further instructions.
(g)	The following rules apply to television films sixty (60) minutes or less:
(1)	The Director's Cut may be no more than approximately one (1) minute over or under the planned broadcast time.
- 77 -
7-505
Upon Employer's request, photography in the editor's assembly not used in the Director's Cut shall be maintained separately.
(2)	If the Director does not start the Director's Cut within twenty-four (24) hours after he or she receives notice that the editor's assembly is or will be complete, Employer may assign any other person to supervise editing of the first cut of the film following completion of the editor's assembly. Any time the Employer assigns a person other than the Director to supervise editing of such first cut, Employer shall send the Guild written notice thereof not later than one (1) day following the assignment.
(3)	If Employers' costs increase because of the provisions of this subparagraph (g), the AMPTP may terminate such provisions not earlier than January 1, 2016, provided the AMPTP sends the Guild sixty (60) days written notice advising the Guild that this subparagraph (g) is terminated and provided representatives of the AMPTP and the Guild meet within the sixty (60) days in a good faith attempt to resolve the Employers' problems.
(h)	(1) On theatrical motion pictures incorporating substantial
effects - such as a CGI character or effects which determine plot points - the Director shall be given an opportunity to incorporate reasonable temp effects, which may necessitate additional cutting time, for the preview of the Director’s Cut, unless the release date does not permit the additional time required. The parties acknowledge that cost is an element of determining “reasonableness.”
(2)	The Director of a long-form television motion picture which incorporates substantial effects - such as a CGI character or effects which determine plot points - shall be given an opportunity to incorporate reasonable temp effects for the preview, if any, of the Director’s Cut, which may necessitate additional cutting time. The
7-505
- 78 -
foregoing shall not apply when the delivery date does not permit the additional time required. The parties acknowledge that cost is an element of determining “reasonableness.”
(i)	(1) If the Director of a theatrical motion picture has not been
given the cutting time prescribed by Paragraph 7-505, and the original release date is postponed while the motion picture is still in the editing process, the Director shall be provided with additional editing time to the extent available for cutting in order to meet the new release date. In no event shall the Employer be required to provide the Director with an aggregate cutting period (i.e., the period consisting of the original cutting period plus the added editing time) that exceeds the period prescribed by Paragraph 7-505.
(2)	If the Director of a long-form television motion picture has not been given the cutting time prescribed by this Paragraph 7-505, and the original delivery date is postponed while the motion picture is still in the editing process, the Director shall be provided with additional editing time to the extent available for cutting in order to meet the new delivery date. In no event shall the Employer be required to provide the Director with an aggregate cutting period (i.e., the period consisting of the original cutting period plus the added editing time) that exceeds the period prescribed by this Paragraph 7-505.
7-506	Right to Be Present and to Consult
The Director shall have the right, subject only to his or her availability, to be present at all times and to consult with the Employer throughout the entire post-production period in connection with the picture. The Director must be notified of the date, time and place of each post-production operation. The Director shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity, subject to his or her availability, to screen and discuss the last version of the film before negative cutting or dubbing, whichever occurs first.
- 79 -
7-506
A post-production locale will not be selected for the purpose of depriving the Director of his or her post-production rights. The Director shall be informed of the intended post-production locale in his or her deal memo. When the post-production locale is at a distant location (i.e., when the Director is required to remain away from home and be lodged overnight), the Employer will pay for the Director's transportation, meals and accommodations while the Director is rendering post-production services.
7-507	Delivery Date for Television Film
(a)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 7, it is understood and agreed that with respect to television motion pictures, the Director's editing privileges herein set forth may not be exercised when the preparation of any television film for a projected delivery date does not permit the expenditure of any or all of the time which would be required by the exercise of the Director's cutting rights.
(b)	Nothing in this Paragraph 7-507 permits reduction of the period of the Director's cut resulting from the practice of "warehousing," as this term was used by the negotiators.
7-508	Right to Director's Cut
It is understood and agreed that the Director's right to prepare his or her Director's Cut is an absolute right subject to the terms and conditions of this BA.
The use of CMX or other technological changes whether now known or not, which involve the physical editing of film or tape or other recording devices, whether now known or not, shall in no way limit or abridge the Director's right to prepare his Director's Cut, within such technology.
7-509	Editing Theatrical Motion Pictures
(a)	Except as is otherwise provided in subparagraph (g), this Paragraph 7-509 applies only to theatrical motion pictures
7-506
- 80 -
which are subject to this BA and the principal photography of which commenced during the term of this BA.
(b)	Employer recognizes that it is desirable for theatrical motion pictures to be telecast without abridgment except as required by Network Broadcast Standards and Practices. To this end, Employer will endeavor to license films for network telecasting with no abridgment other than for the aforementioned Broadcast Standards and Practices reasons. In any event, Employer agrees that the Director, if available, shall be accorded the first opportunity to make such cuts as are required if a film is required to be abridged for network telecast. In the event the Director of such picture is deceased, the Guild will appoint a Director of comparable stature and ability to discharge such functions who will be deemed substituted for the original Director in all respects under this Paragraph 7-509. Such "Director abridging cut" shall be done for the Employer at no additional cost, and subject to its approval. It is the intention of the foregoing that in the first instance and as far as practicable, the abridgment, if any, of theatrical motion pictures shall be accomplished by the Employer, with the participation of the Director, as aforementioned, and not by the network acquiring telecasting rights in the theatrical motion pictures.
(c)	If a motion picture is licensed by Employer for United States network free television or for United States national network pay television exhibition under a contract which provides that the network may edit the motion picture for such exhibition, the Employer agrees to obligate the network or the distributor to consult with the Director of such motion picture with regard to such editing done by the network, subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The Employer or the distributor shall notify the Director in writing, at Director's last address known to Employer or the distributor, that such motion picture has been so licensed and is to be edited for such exhibition by the network. With respect to a theatrical motion picture, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 2014, such notice shall include, if known at the
- 81 -
7-509
time of the notice, the amount of time to be added to or removed from the motion picture and any change to the aspect ratio. A copy of such notice shall be mailed to the Guild. If the Director wishes to be consulted by the network or the distributor with reference to such editing, the Director shall, within five (5) business days after service of such notice, notify the Employer and the distributor in writing that the Director so desires to be consulted. Upon service of such notice by the Director, the Employer or the distributor shall notify the network that the Director wishes to be consulted with reference to such editing. The Employer shall obligate the network or the distributor to give the Director who has served such notice reasonable notice of the time and place at which the network or the distributor will consult with the Director with reference to such editing. If the Director reports at the time and place so designated, the network or the distributor shall then be obligated to consult with the Director and in such consultations, the Director may express his or her views with regard to the editing of the motion picture for such network television exhibition. As between the Director and the network and the distributor, however, the final decision as to such editing shall rest with the network and the distributor. The requirement of consultation with the Director, as set forth above, shall not apply when no editing is done by the network or in any case in which the exigencies of time do not permit, or if the Director does not make himself or herself available at the time and place designated as aforesaid.
(2)	The Director's services in connection with consultations shall be provided at the time and place specified in the notice at no cost to the network or Employer or the distributor.
(3)	The consultation rights of this Paragraph 7-509 shall apply to all editing of a theatrical motion picture released for such network exhibition. For this purpose only, the word "editing" includes placement of or changes in
7-509
- 82 -
commercial breaks, interruptions, and promotional announcements.
(d)	If a motion picture is licensed by Employer for United States syndication and Employer edits such motion picture at its own facilities, the Director, if available, shall have the right to edit the motion picture if no additional costs are thereby incurred.
(e)	If the Employer desires to have new footage shot and added to the motion picture beyond the theatrical version, the Director (subject to reasonable availability) shall be offered employment to shoot such new footage as and to the extent required by Employer at a daily compensation rate no less than one-half of the Director's initial daily compensation rate on the motion picture.
(f)	Employer agrees not to license or edit or authorize any licensee to edit feature length theatrical motion pictures in versions of less than two (2) hours duration or the length of the picture as released for general theatrical exhibition, whichever is lesser, (except for Standards and Practices requirements) for in-flight use as defined in subparagraph 18-102(b) (e.g., to avoid 45-minute versions of motion pictures previously licensed as theatrical films for use on Continental Airlines). In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of this subparagraph and the balance of Paragraph 7-509, then the provisions of this subparagraph shall control.
(g)	If a theatrical motion picture is licensed by the Employer for exhibition on a domestic national basic cable service, domestically in New Media, for domestic in-flight exhibition or for domestic videodisc/videocassette distribution, and the Employer edits such motion picture at its own facilities in the United States, the Director shall have the right to edit the English language version of the motion picture at no additional compensation. The foregoing right to edit for basic cable exhibition shall be limited to the initial exhibition on a basic cable service and shall not include editing done to meet ratings standards or requirements.
- 83 -
7-509
The provisions of this subparagraph (g) relating to editing for domestic videocassette release and domestic in-flight release shall also apply to long-form television motion pictures which are subject to this BA and the principal photography of which commenced during the term of this BA.
None of the foregoing shall apply in any case in which the exigencies of time do not permit or if the Director does not make himself or herself available at the time and place designated by the Employer to perform such editing.
7-510
7-511
Editing of Motion Picture for Foreign Television Exhibition
If a motion picture originally produced for television is sold or licensed for foreign exhibition and Employer requires additional shooting, the Director (subject to reasonable availability) shall supervise any editing of the English language version at no additional compensation, and shall be offered employment to shoot any such additional footage at a daily compensation rate equal to the Director's initial daily compensation rate on the motion picture.
Assumption of Obligations by Buyer or Assignee
As a condition of the effectiveness of any sale or assignment of a motion picture produced during the term of this BA, the Employer shall obtain a specific assumption of its obligations under Paragraphs 7-509 and 7-510 from the purchaser or assignee. If Employer authorizes its distributor to supervise editing of a theatrical motion picture, then the distributor, in lieu of the Employer, shall be subject to all of the same obligations and shall exercise the same rights of Employer pursuant to Paragraphs 7-509 and 7-517 with respect to any such picture produced during the term hereof. If Employer authorizes its distributor to supervise editing of a long-form television motion picture for foreign television exhibition, then the distributor, in lieu of the Employer, shall be subject to all of the same obligations and shall exercise the same rights of Employer pursuant to Paragraph 7-510 with respect to any such picture produced during the term hereof.
7-509
- 84 -
7-512	Producer's Scheduling Authority
Employer shall not use its scheduling authority to deprive a Director of his or her creative rights under this Article 7.
7-513	Right of Consultation
The Employer shall consult with the Director with respect to coloring, time compression and expansion, changes in the exhibition of the aspect ratio (e.g., "panning and scanning") and changes to allow exhibition in three dimensions made to a theatrical motion picture after delivery of the answer print. The Director's services in connection with such consultation shall be provided at no cost to the network or Employer or distributor.
7-514	Screenings of Unfinished Television Films
Until completed, a television motion picture may not be shown to any third party not involved in its post-production (e.g., critics and network affiliates), unless there is a notice on the screen at the beginning and end of the film that it is an unfinished work in progress. The omission of such a notice shall not be subject to grievance and arbitration under Article 2 of the Basic Agreement. However, this provision is not intended to prohibit the showing of trailers or promos for an unfinished television film to third parties not involved in post-production of the film.
7-515	Motion Picture Rating
If the Employer decides to appeal the rating given to a theatrical motion picture by the Classification and Rating Administration of the Motion Picture Association of America, the Director has the right to participate fully in the proceedings before CARA's Appeals Board. If changes are required to achieve the desired rating, the Director shall have the right to make the changes.
If Employer does not designate the Director as one of Employer's representatives to the MPAA's Classification and Rating Administration, the Employer's designated representative shall
- 85 -
7-515
promptly advise the Director of any communications with the MPAA's Classification and Rating Administration. The Director shall be told fully and accurately of the MPAA CARA's concerns, and consulted in good faith with respect to any actions to be taken.
7-516
7-517
Circulation of Film Materials
The parties acknowledge the importance of limiting access to film materials during production and post-production of theatrical motion pictures. To that end, Employer will advise the Director of the individual(s) designated to view dailies and the means of distribution (e.g., cassette, etc.). Employer will consult with the Director regarding the circulation of copies of cut material or of the Director’s Cut and the Director will not circulate copies of cut material or of the Director’s Cut without the Employer’s approval. When permitted by the Employer, security technologies such as encryption, watermarking or firewalls approved for use by the Employer may be used to identify the Director’s work in progress and the Director’s Cut to protect it from unauthorized alteration. This provision will not interfere with the Employer’s need to provide material to marketing personnel, nor the Director’s need to provide material to personnel needed to complete the film (e.g., conferring with an optical house, conferring with a writer about added scenes, etc.).
Editing Theatrical Motion Pictures for Foreign Exhibition
If Employer licenses a theatrical motion picture for foreign theatrical exhibition to which footage not contained in the domestic theatrical version is added (whether the additional footage is already shot or is to be newly shot), and the Employer edits the motion picture at its facilities in the United States, the Director (subject to reasonable availability) shall supervise the editing necessitated by the addition of such footage into the motion picture at no additional compensation. The foregoing shall not apply in any case in which the exigencies of time do not permit. (If additional footage is to be shot for the foreign version, the Director shall be offered employment to do so at a daily compensation rate equal to the Director's initial compensation.)
7-515
- 86 -
7-518	Release of "Director's Cut"
Employer may not identify any version of a theatrical motion picture or a long-form television motion picture as the "Director's Cut" unless it has been so identified by the Director. (This definition of "Director's Cut" shall apply solely to this provision.)
7-519	Notice of Director's Editing/Consultation Rights
In the event that a theatrical motion picture or long-form television motion picture is to be edited for release as provided in Paragraph 7-509(b), (c), (d), (g), in Paragraph 7-510 or in Paragraph 7-517, and the Director has the right to participate in the editing process, the Employer shall notify the Guild, in writing, of the time and place at which the editing is to be done. With respect to a theatrical motion picture, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 2014, such notice shall include, if known at the time of the notice, the amount of time to be added to or removed from the motion picture and any change to the aspect ratio. The Guild shall, in turn, promptly provide such written notice to the Director. Within five (5) business days after service of the Employer's notice upon the Guild, the Director shall notify the Employer in writing that the Director desires to perform such editing or to be consulted with reference to such editing.
7-520	Participation of Directors in Post-Production Process for One-
Hour Series Television
The parties agree to convene meetings on an Employer-by-Employer basis to discuss the participation of Directors of one-hour series television in the post-production process. It is understood that the Employer will honor requests from the Guild to supply postproduction schedules for its one-hour series in conjunction with the meeting with that Employer.
- 87 -
7-520
7-521	DVD Release of Theatrical Motion Pictures or Long-Form
Television Motion Pictures
(a)	Theatrical Motion Pictures
The Employer shall advise the Director of a theatrical motion picture of the schedule for release(s) of the domestic DVD as soon as determined. Employer shall consult with the Director, subject to Director's availability, concerning the content of the DVD release(s) in a timely manner to allow full consideration of the Director's input.
If a theatrical motion picture has been released domestically in its original theatrical version on DVD, and a different version of the motion picture which has not been approved by the Director is later released domestically on DVD, Employer will make the original theatrical version released on DVD available as well. This obligation will be satisfied by any arrangement which will allow an interested consumer ready access to a DVD copy of the original theatrical version, (e.g., by allowing purchase through the studio's catalog).
(b)	Long-Form Television Motion Picture
With respect to long-form television motion pictures, Employer shall advise Director of the release schedule of the domestic DVD as soon as it is determined. Employer shall consult with the Director concerning the content of the DVD release in a timely manner to allow full consideration of the Director’s input.

Section 7-1100 LOOPING AND NARRATION
7-1101	The looping of dialogue, including "wild tracking," for scenes already
photographed and the recording of narration for any motion picture shall be directed by the Director of the film, provided the Director is available at the time and place and at the cost scheduled by the Employer and the Director receives no additional compensation for the direction of looping and/or narration.
7-1102	With respect to theatrical motion pictures, the Employer shall be
required to send the Director of the film, if he or she is available, to the place of looping (including "wild tracking"), recording of narration and any other post-production dialogue recording unless it is minor in nature. The Employer's decision as to whether such work is minor shall be final, provided it is reasonable.
7-1103	Should the Director of the film be unavailable to attend such looping
or narration recordings, as above provided, the Employer shall consult with the Director, if he or she is available, as to what person is available and fit to direct such loopings and narrations. The final decision in the selection of such person (who may, but need not be, a person subject to this BA) shall remain with the Employer, but the Director of the film shall be given the opportunity, if practicable, to explain to such person his or her ideas as to the content and qualities of the work to be done.
7-901
- 92 -

7-1201	The Director of the film, if available, shall participate in the spotting

The Director shall make such cut within three (3) business days from the time it is made available to him. Provided, however, the Director shall not have such a right to such cut if the foreign version cut of such motion picture is made outside the United States or if such foreign version cut is done in the United States for foreign local acceptance.
If the motion picture as so exhibited is not recut for its foreign theatrical release, this provision shall not be applicable.
Section 7-1400 REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTOR
7-1401	No person assigned to or performing in a particular motion picture
before the Director is replaced can replace the Director. The Director may be replaced only by a person who has never been assigned to or performed in the particular picture and who has theretofore directed a feature motion picture or not less than ninety (90) minutes of television programming, which has been exhibited in the United States, regardless of where produced. None of the above conditions shall apply in the case of a bona fide emergency, in which event a person employed on the shooting company may direct for a period not
- 93 -
7-1401
in excess of five (5) shooting days pending arrival of a substitute Director. In the event the Employer claims such an emergency exists, Employer shall give the Guild notice of such emergency as soon as practical. If the Guild, within seventy-two (72) hours after receipt of notice from the Employer, disputes the existence of such an emergency, then, within twenty-four (24) hours after the Guild notifies the Employer of such dispute, an authorized representative of the Guild and the Employer shall meet in a good faith attempt to settle or resolve the issue of whether there was such an emergency. If the Guild does not give such notice to the Employer within such seventy-two (72) hour period, the claimed emergency shall be deemed to be a bona fide emergency.
In the event the parties fail to meet or otherwise fail to settle or resolve the dispute as to whether there was such an emergency, then, within twenty-four (24) hours of the last time period referred to above, only said dispute as to whether there was an emergency shall be submitted directly to Expedited Arbitration in accordance with the Expedited Arbitration procedure set forth in Section 2-400.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 7-1401, if the Director of a theatrical motion picture is physically incapacitated so that he or she is physically unable to direct, the Employer may employ a person already on the production to direct, provided:
(a)	the Director is deceased; the Director’s physical incapacity lasts for four (4) weeks or longer; the Director does not expect to recover from that incapacity for four (4) weeks or longer; or the Director is unable to communicate and his or her doctor does not expect the Director to recover within four (4) weeks;
(b)	the person whom the Employer wishes to be the substituting Director has previously directed a theatrical motion picture which has been distributed in the United States;
(c)	unless the physical condition of the [original] Director precludes his or her participation in the decision-making, he or she must approve the Employer’s choice of substituting Director and have the opportunity to consult with the substituting Director; and
7-1401
- 94 -
(d)	the Employer notifies the Guild of its intention to replace the Director with someone assigned to or performing in the theatrical motion picture prior to the assignment of the substituting Director.
The parties agree to maintain their respective positions as to the applicability of this Paragraph 7-1401 to the shooting of added scenes and retakes in episodic television when the Director of the program is unavailable. These positions notwithstanding, the Guild agrees to waive any claim that it would be a violation of this provision (prohibiting replacement of a Director by someone already assigned to the production in another capacity) to assign the work of directing added scenes or retakes, if the original Director is unavailable, to a producer of the series who has been a career Director, so long as the original Director agrees to the arrangement and is accorded the opportunity to consult with the individual assigned to direct the added scenes or retakes, and the Guild is notified as soon as practicable.
In addition, the Guild agrees to waive any claim based upon a producer of the series who has been a career Director directing, after the period of scheduled principal photography for a particular episode of the series, principal photography for that episode that was scheduled, but not completed, by the original Director of the episode, provided that: (1) the original Director is not available; (2) the original Director is accorded the opportunity to consult with the individual assigned to direct such principal photography; (3) the Employer notified the Guild of the name of the producer who is a career Director at the start of the season; and (4) the Employer notifies the Guild as soon as practicable each time the producer who is a career Director directs such principal photography.
Section 7-1500 GENERAL PROVISIONS
7-1501	Employer's Decision Final
The Employer's decision in all business and creative matters shall be final, but this provision shall not release the Employer or the Director from their respective obligations hereunder.
- 95 -
7-1501
7-1502	Third Party Agreements
The Employer shall not enter into an agreement with a third party, the terms of which require the Employer to breach its obligations under this Article 7 or the Director's personal services agreement. The implied promise of good faith and fair dealing is deemed an express provision of this Article 7.
The Employer agrees that it will not negotiate a provision in any other collective bargaining agreement that infringes upon the creative rights of the Director under this Agreement.
7-1503	No Retaliation
The Employer shall not discriminate or retaliate against a Director because the Director exercises or asserts his or her rights under this Article 7.
7-1504	Attendance at Casting Sessions
In order to provide the most creative environment possible for the Director and actor(s) in casting sessions, no one shall be present at casting sessions except those persons designated by the individual Producer, the Employer or the Director and all such persons shall have a reasonable purpose for attending.
7-1505	Electronic Transmissions
No images or sounds may be transmitted electronically from the stage or control booth without first informing the Director. Any instances of non-disclosed transmission shall be presented to the Creative Rights Standing Committee. The Employer shall use its best efforts to identify those places or persons that have access to such transmissions.
7-1506	Creative Rights Standing Committee
The parties have agreed that the Creative Rights Committee will continue its discussions of creative rights (non-economic) issues
7-1502
- 96 -
throughout the term of this Agreement. The Committee will be comprised of executives representing the Employers of the level ordinarily in attendance at the existing Creative Rights Committee meetings and ten (10) representatives of the Directors Guild of America. The Theatrical Committee will meet three (3) times per year, with meetings in February, June and October of each year. The Television Committee will meet twice per year, with meetings in January and August of each year. The parties may agree to meet at other times as well and to consider issues brought to the Committee by either party beyond those enumerated below.

(a)	to continue discussions with representatives of the DGA’s Multi-Camera Subcommittee regarding the issue of instructions given to the Director of multi-camera shows by multiple persons;
(b)	to discuss post-production and the Director’s role in singlecamera and multi-camera productions; and
(c)	to continue discussions with regard to credits in outdoor advertisements with particular emphasis placed on the consideration of suggestions for reduction of the proliferation of credits in billing blocks, as well as addressing the Guild’s concern regarding the visibility of the director’s credit and the Company’s need to promote a picture using the names of persons associated with it which have importance for marketing purposes. These discussions shall also focus on: (i) the application of the rules set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement concerning credits in advertising (including the rule requiring that such advertising be submitted to the Guild) to DVD/videocassette distributors; and (ii) the application of the credit rules set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement to promotional items such as popcorn tubs and bags, buttons, pins, carry trays, drink cups, etc.

ARTICLE 8
Directors' Credits
Section 8-100 GENERAL PROVISIONS
8-101	Guild to Determine Controversy Over Credits
Should more than one Director do work on a motion picture, the Guild and all such Directors (other than Directors of second units) shall be notified in writing as to the directorial credit intended to be given. Should any such Director be dissatisfied with such determination, he or she may immediately appeal to the Guild and likewise notify the Employer in writing that he or she is so doing. The Guild may then determine the issue. Except as herein provided, the Employer agrees to be bound by such determination as to credits. If the Guild should fail to reach a decision and notify the Employer within fourteen (14) days in the case of a theatrical motion picture, and seven (7) days in the case of a television motion picture (such time to run from receipt by the Guild of the print of the film), the Employer shall determine the issue and its determination shall be final. In the event that the Guild's determination as to credit is given at too late a date to permit the giving of screen or advertising credit as indicated by the Guild, then credit shall be given in such manner as may have been designated by the Employer, but appropriate credit shall be given in any bulletin to be issued by the Guild or in such other bulletin as may be mutually agreed upon. In no event shall an Employer be obligated to delay the preparation or issuance of advertising matter or the release of any motion picture pending proceedings for the determination of credits.
8-102	Form of Director's Credit
The form of the Director's credit on screen, paid advertising, phonograph records, books, tapes, videodiscs, videocassettes and the containers thereof, when and as required, shall be "Directed by."
The words "Directed by" on screen shall be at least one-half the size of type used to accord credit to the Director's name.
- 99 -
8-102
Should a Director other than the Director, or one of the Directors, receiving credit on the motion picture have the same first and last name, the Guild shall determine whether or not such Director's credit must include his or her middle name, if any, or middle initial. The Directors involved shall be bound by such determination and the Employer shall also be bound, if notified thereof by the Guild in writing within a reasonable time before prints with the main titles are prepared but shall not be bound with respect to advertising, publicity or other material prepared prior to such notice.
8-103
Restriction on Use of Word "Director
(a)	The Employer will not hereafter and during the term hereof enter into any agreement with any guild, craft, union, or labor organization in which it agrees to accord members thereof credit on screen, paid advertising, phonograph records, books, tapes (including the cover of the book, record or tape as well as any album, envelope, box or other container in which such record or tape is contained) which includes the word "Director," "Direction" or any derivation thereof, but the foregoing shall not apply to a guild or craft with which the Employer heretofore entered into an agreement requiring such credit.
(b)	Except as required by agreements heretofore executed by the Employer, and agreements permitted by subparagraph (a) above to be hereafter executed, Employer will not grant to any individual, other than a Director, any credit which includes the word "Director," "Direction" or any derivation thereof.
8-104
Better Conditions
The foregoing provisions relating to credits are minimum provisions, and any Director shall have the right to negotiate for any credit in excess of minimum. It is the policy of the Employers to affirm the traditional right of each individual and management to negotiate freely for conditions above the minimum, including all forms of special credits. Subject only to present collective bargaining agreements, each Employer intends to exercise control over granting
8-102
- 100 -
of any special credits above the minimums on screen and in paid advertising.4
Section 8-200 CREDIT FOR DIRECTORS OF THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES
8-201	Screen Credit
The Director of the film shall be accorded credit on all positive prints and all videodiscs/videocassettes of the film in size of type not less than fifty percent (50%) of the size in which the title of the motion picture is displayed or of the largest size in which credit is accorded to any other person, whichever is greater. No other credit shall appear on the card which accords credit to the Director of the film. Such credit shall be on the last title card appearing prior to principal photography. If more than one Director is given such credit, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 8-101, then such fifty percent (50%) may be reduced to thirty percent (30%) for each. The Employer shall furnish to the Guild copies of the main and end titles as soon as the same are prepared in final form but before the prints are made, for the purpose of checking compliance with the credit provisions of this BA. After such copies are furnished, there can be no changes relating to the term Director, Direction or any derivation thereof, without first giving the Guild notice of such proposed changes or elimination.
8-202	Visibility of Director's Name
Because the Employer pledges to use its best efforts to improve the visibility of the Director's name in publicity, the Guild agrees to the following provision in Paragraph 8-203 relating to paid advertising. The provisions of Paragraph 8-203 shall be effective from July 1, 2014 to January 1, 2016 and thereafter unless and until the Guild gives the AMPTP six (6) months’ written notice advising the AMPTP that Article 8 hereof is terminated. In the case of such notice, the Employer shall be bound thereafter by the provisions of Articles 8 and 12 of the DGA Basic Agreement of 1978. The Guild shall have
4 See modifications to this Paragraph 8-104 in Sideletter 27 of this Agreement.
- 101 -
8-202
the right to serve such notice any time during the term of this BA after January 1, 2016.
8-203	Credits on Paid Advertising
The Employer shall accord credit for direction of a motion picture on all paid advertising issued or prepared by the Employer in the continental United States and prepared subsequent to final determination of directorial credit in the manner herein provided, it being understood that in such advertising prepared or issued prior to such final determination the Employer shall include such credit for direction as the Employer may in good faith believe to be proper, and if this varies from the credits as finally determined, then it will not be used subsequent to such determination, to the extent not theretofore distributed.
Copies of these credits as determined, with respect to motion pictures covered hereunder, shall be sent to all of the Employer's foreign sales and distribution offices, if any.
The foregoing obligations of Employer are subject to the following:
(a)	Size and Location of Credit
Except as stated otherwise in this Section 8-200, the location of the Director's credit shall be discretionary with the Employer, and the size of type of the Director's credit shall be no less than fifteen percent (15%) of the size of type used for the title of the motion picture, but in no event less than the size and style of type for any credit accorded any persons other than actors.
(b)	Title of Motion Picture
The name of any person in the title of the motion picture shall be considered a credit, except for (i) a name which forms part of the name of a corporate Employer in existence prior to the execution date of this agreement or (ii) a name which is part of the film's title if such name reflects the content of the film and is not a form of possessory credit.
8-202
- 102 -
(c)	"One Sheets"
The Director shall receive credit on all "one sheets."
The Guild agrees to issue waivers to allow "advance one-sheets" to be issued without the Director's credit, provided that no one other than starring actors receives credit on the "one-sheet" and, provided further, that the Director is given clearly visible and legible credit on "one-sheets" issued at the time of release of the motion picture.
The Guild agrees to issue such waivers so long as the Creative Rights Committee process, as described in Paragraph 7-1506, continues. It is understood that the Guild's right to withdraw such waivers is not subject to arbitration nor to judicial review. However, prior to a Guild determination to discontinue such waivers, the matter of termination will be discussed with the ongoing Creative Rights Committee.
(d)	Outdoor-Type Advertising
Employer need not accord credit to the Director on an outdoor-type advertisement (including "24 sheets"), provided the advertisement contains no more than the title of the motion picture, key art (which may include likenesses or photographs of no more than two (2) starring actors), logos, the motion picture's rating and copyright notice, the name(s) of the subject(s) of a biographical motion picture and copy (which may include reviews and the name(s) of the reviewer(s), but may not include the name of any other person, whether or not connected with the production).
If the advertisement does not meet the foregoing requirements, the Director's credit must be included in a size of type no less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the size of type used for the title or of any individual credit, whichever is larger. If the name of the Writer or Producer appears in a presentation credit in addition to his or her other credit, the Director's credit must be boxed. If the advertisement contains five (5) or more personal credits (or mentions) the Director's credit shall be
- 103 -
8-203
boxed. If the advertisement contains six (6) or more personal credits (or mentions), the Director shall also be accorded an additional credit above the title in the form "A Film By" which shall not be smaller in size of type than the "Directed By" credit. For the purpose of calculating the number of personal credits hereunder, credit to two (2) starring actors, and no more than two (2) actors, shall be deemed one (1) personal credit. Hyphenated credits (e.g., "Produced and Written by...") count as separate credits.
Solely for the term of this Agreement, the Guild agrees to issue waivers to allow billboards and bus sides without a director's credit when the billboard or bus side contains only the names and likenesses or photographs of no more than (3) starring actors, the title of the motion picture, key art, logos and the motion picture’s rating and copyright notice.
For outdoor-type advertisements other than billboards and bus sides, the Guild agrees to issue waivers to allow outdoor-type advertisements without a director’s credit when the advertisement contains only the name and either the likeness or photograph of one (1) starring actor, or likenesses or photographs of two (2) or more starring actors, as well as the title of the motion picture, key art, logos and the motion picture’s rating and copyright notice. The Guild further agrees to give good faith consideration to requests for waivers of the restriction on the use of starring actors' names and likenesses (to enable additional starring actor(s) to be named and pictured in the advertisement), provided that the number of waivers, on an Employer-by-Employer basis, is limited.
The Guild agrees to issue such waivers so long as the Creative Rights Committee process, as described in Paragraph 7-1506, continues. It is understood that the Guild's right to withdraw such waivers is not subject to arbitration nor to judicial review. Before the Guild determines to discontinue such waivers, however, the matter of termination will be discussed with the ongoing Creative Rights Committee.
8-203
- 104 -
(e)	"Trade Paper" Advertising
The Director shall receive credit in size of type not less than thirty percent (30%) the size of type used for the title of the motion picture in any United States motion picture industry trade paper advertisement.
(f)	Advertising in Newspapers, Magazines and Other Periodicals
Employer need not accord credit to the Director in an advertisement of two hundred fifty (250) lines or less (or the equivalent in the Standard Advertising Unit system) in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals (excluding "trade papers"), provided that the advertisement mentions no person (excluding only the names of reviewers) other than two (2) starring actors. For the purpose of calculating the size of the advertisement, theater listings shall be excluded.
Employer need not accord credit to the Director in an advertisement of more than two hundred fifty (250) lines but not more than one thousand two hundred (1,200) lines (or the equivalent in the Standard Advertising Unit system) (approximately C to ^ page; b of a page in tabloid size papers) in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals (excluding "trade papers"), provided that the advertisement does not include: (1) more than thirty-five (35) words of copy (including reviews); (2) likenesses or photographs of more than three (3) starring actors; (3) any corporate name or logo; and/or (4) the name of any person other than reviewers and two (2) starring actors. The Guild will not unreasonably deny Employer's request that the provisions of this subparagraph be waived as to an advertisement which includes likenesses or photographs of more than three (3) starring actors, but otherwise does not require credit to the Director. For the purpose of calculating the size of the advertisement, theater listings shall be excluded. If the Employer places such advertising without the Director's credit, the Employer shall box the Director's credit in all subsequent advertisements in which the Director's credit is required. Unless specifically negotiated in a subsequent collective bargaining agreement, the
- 105 -
8-203
provisions of this paragraph shall automatically terminate, without notice, on June 30, 2017.
Employer need not accord credit to the Director in any advertisement which contains no more than the title of the motion picture, logos, key art (which may include likenesses or photographs of no more than two (2) starring actors), the motion picture's rating and copyright notice and copy of no more than twenty-five (25) words (which may not include reviews or the name of any person). The Guild will not unreasonably deny Employer's request that the provisions of this subparagraph be waived as to an advertisement which includes likenesses or photographs of more than two (2) starring actors but otherwise does not require credit to the Director.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (f), with respect to any theatrical advertising campaign in Los Angeles and/or New York utilizing advertisements larger than ten (10) column inches (or the equivalent in the Standard Advertising Unit system) in which the Director is not accorded credit pursuant to the preceding unnumbered paragraphs, the Director shall be accorded credit in advertisements on one weekend day (Friday, Saturday or Sunday) for three (3) consecutive weeks, provided the motion picture is in distribution in such cities during such weekends.
(g)	Exceptions
(1)	Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (2) below, none of the foregoing obligations under this Paragraph 8-203 shall apply:
(i)	to group advertising, i.e., more than one (1) motion picture is advertised;
(ii)	to so-called "teaser" advertising, as that term is used in the motion picture industry;
8-203
- 106 -
(iii)	to "trailer" advertising, as that term is used in the motion picture industry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if credit is given for film or camera process (such as Panavision, Technicolor or DeLuxe), or if the individual producer or writer is mentioned, then the Director's name shall be mentioned; and
(iv)	to other advertising on the screen, radio, or television, not to exceed one (1) minute.
(2)	None of the exceptions under subparagraph (1) above shall apply and the name of the Director shall also be mentioned if the name of any person other than two (2) starring actors is mentioned, in any of the advertising listed above, with the exception only of congratulatory advertising or award advertising where no one is mentioned other than the person being congratulated or mentioned for the award.

8-206	Phonograph Records, Books and Tapes

8-206
book, record or tape is based. This Paragraph is applicable only to books, phonograph records, or tapes which the Employer distributes or licenses for distribution.
8-207	Theatrical and Souvenir Programs

8-208	Videodisc/Videocassette Containers
The Director of the film shall receive credit on the containers of all videodiscs and videocassettes which are shipped by the Employer. Such credit shall be in size of type no less than fifteen percent (15%) the size of type of the largest title on the container and in no event smaller in size and style of type than the credit accorded any person other than actors.
8-209	Distribution and Licensing Agreements
Employer shall provide in any contract with a distributor that the distributor shall be bound for the benefit of the Employees and the Guild to all of the provisions of the BA and the individual employment agreements relating to credit. Employer shall not be responsible to Employee or Guild for breach of contract by the distributor.
Employer will hereafter provide in its licensing agreements that credits of a motion picture, as provided for herein, shall not be changed or eliminated on theatrical or television exhibition.
8-210	Submission of Press Books and Advertising to Guild
All press books and paid advertising campaign material prepared by or under the supervision of the Employer or the Employer's distributor for use in the United States and Canada shall be submitted to the Guild for approval of Director's credit prior to public release thereof.

8-206
- 108 -
books or advertising campaign material previously submitted, copies thereof shall likewise be submitted to the Guild if there is a change in the form, size or style of Director's credit prior to distribution thereof. Employer is not required to submit advertising which has the same credits, copy and artwork as a previously submitted advertisement, provided it is proportionate in size and the size and use of the advertisement does not invoke different credit requirements. Failure of the Guild to notify Employer or distributor within two (2) business days after receipt of any such material that it disapproves the form, size or style of Director's credit shall be deemed a waiver. In the event there are bona fide exigencies of time which interfere with the above procedure, Employer shall discuss the matter with a responsible officer of the Guild who may impose reasonable alternate conditions to those herein set forth.
8-211	Pseudonym
If a Director wishes to use a pseudonym in substitution of the Director's name on the screen, advertising, publicity and any other material in which credit, in any form whatsoever, is given for direction of the motion picture, the Director may invoke the following procedure:
(a)	The Director may notify Employer and the Guild of his or her desire to use a pseudonym no later than five (5) business days following the Director's first viewing of the version of the film the Employer intends to release.
(b)	The Directors Council of the Guild, utilizing the same stringent criteria it has used in the past, may grant the Director permission to use a pseudonym and, in such case, the Guild shall notify the Employer, including notice of the provisions of subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this Paragraph 8-211, within five (5) business days following the Director's notice to the Employer.
(c)	If the Employer fails to respond to the Guild within five (5) business days following the Guild’s notice to the Employer as provided in subparagraph (b) above, the decision of the Directors Council shall be final and binding on the Employer.
- 109 -
8-211
(d)	If the Employer responds to the Guild within five (5) business days following the Guild’s notice to the Employer that it is unwilling to grant such request, a Panel comprised of an equal number of Guild and AMPTP representatives (including at least three (3) AMPTP representatives and three (3) Guild representatives who served on the Theatrical Creative Rights Negotiating Committee during the 2014 negotiations) may determine by majority vote that the Employer shall use a pseudonym. If three (3) AMPTP representatives are unavailable or unable for whatever reason to serve on the Panel, the AMPTP may instead designate a substitute or substitutes from a list of appropriate substitutes approved by the DGA to serve on the Panel.5 No member of the Panel may have an interest in the outcome of the Panel’s determination.
The Panel may also determine that the Director waives the right to receive contingent compensation, including residuals, should the Director or the Guild elect to demand that the Employer comply with the Panel's decision requiring the Employer to use a pseudonym. The decision of the Panel shall be final, and shall have the same status as an arbitration award.
By invoking the foregoing procedure, the Director is deemed to have agreed to refrain from publicly discussing the request for a pseudonym. As a condition for using a pseudonym, the Director must refrain from publicly criticizing the film.

8-211
- 110 -
	Director shall be given the last solo credit card before the first scene of the picture. For the purpose of this clause, the credits of the established stars playing a continuing role in the series, or of well-established stars in the motion picture industry, or of a bona fide producing company credit shall not be considered credits of a person. (A loan-out company shall not be considered a bona fide producing company.) No commercial or other material shall intervene between the Director's credit card and the picture. If any change is made during the term of this BA in any television film subject to the 1984 or prior Basic Agreements which involves a change in the position of credits or involves other substantial changes which afford an opportunity to place the Director's credit in accordance with this Paragraph, such credit shall be so placed, it being understood that this obligation shall not apply with respect to a change of main title or replacement of commercials not also involving changes in credit positions or other substantial changes. This BA as to credits will not affect any contractual obligation Employer may have as to credits under any existing contract which was in effect on July 1, 1990. If two (2) or more episodes of the same series are exhibited “back-to-back,” whether in the medium of original exhibition or in a subsequent medium of exhibition, the Employer may place the “Directed by” credits before the first episode, so long as the “Directed by” credits are clearly identified with the correct episode or title or a designation such as Part I or Part II and appear on separate cards (unless all applicable episodes were directed by the same Director). The cards will be the last cards before the first scene of the picture or, when permitted, the first cards after the last scene. Each card will be in the clear on screen for not less than two (2) seconds.
8-302	Commercial and Other Material Not to Interfere with Director's Screen Credit Employer shall not permit any commercial, promotional or advertising material, audio or visual, to appear on or before the Director's card either as background or otherwise, and shall contract

In no event shall credit accorded to Director be displayed for a cumulative time less than the "produced by" credit.

8-306
Advertising Credit
In all paid advertising, other than night-strip advertisements, of a nonseries television film ninety (90) minutes or longer, licensed by Employer to a national free television network, the Employer agrees to obligate the network to give the Director credit if the advertisement appears in a "TV Guide-type" or newspaper advertisement one-half page or larger. The obligation to give a Director credit under this subparagraph shall be no greater than it would be if the advertisement were prepared under the control of or at the direction of Employer.
8-302
- 112 -
In all paid advertising of a television film prepared under the control of or at the direction of Employer, the Director shall be accorded credit in the largest size in which any person other than actors is accorded credit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the advertising relates solely to a television series directed by more than one (1) Director, the Employer shall not be obligated to accord credit to the Directors by reason of the fact that credit is accorded to two (2) producers who are the producers of the entire series and/or that credit is accorded to an author of the source material on which the series is based.
Except for the foregoing provisions of this Section 8-300, Director's credits in connection with television films shall be governed by the provisions of Paragraphs 8-202 and 8-203.
8-307	Assumption of Obligations
Employer shall specifically contract with its distributors and the television networks that they shall not cut, edit, move or omit the credit of the Director as placed by the Employer on the positive prints.
8-308	Publicity
In all formal publicity released by Employer in connection with a television film in which the name of any person is mentioned, the name of the Director shall be mentioned. The foregoing shall not apply if the publicity relates to a series and the person or persons mentioned rendered services in connection with the entire series and the episodes thereof were directed by more than one (1) Director.
8-309	Publicity Tours
The Employer, at its expense, shall send the Director of any nonseries film ninety (90) minutes or longer on any domestic publicity tour on which an actor is sent, provided the Director is available.

8-312	Pilot Director Recognition
If a domestic DVD or an Internet web page is created for a series, the Employer must include the name, background and filmography of the Director of the pilot of a series, if such information about the "creator" of the series is included.
Employer will in good faith consider including information about the Director of the pilot in press kits for the television series, and inviting him or her to participate in events promoting the first year of the series at meetings of the Television Critics Association. The decision to invite the Director to such events shall rest entirely within the Employer’s discretion. This Paragraph 8-312 is not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article 2 of this Agreement.

(e)	Presentations The following applies to prime time dramatic television programs:
It is agreed that "presentation programs" are not pilots.
A "presentation program" is a program shot on film, not more than thirty (30) minutes in length, produced for the purpose of selling a proposed series, but not intended for broadcast.
The minimum rate for the director of a "presentation program" is as follows:
" See text of footnote 3 on page 39.
- 127 -
10-103
	7/1/14+	7/1/15	7/1/16	Maximum Guaranteed Days
0-15 minutes	$25,899	$26,676	$27,476	10 days, of which 4 must be consecutive
16-30 minutes	$51,807 (or the applicable pilot fee, if less, but in no event less than $25,899)	$53,361 (or the applicable pilot fee, if less, but in no event less than $26,676)	$54,962 (or the applicable pilot fee, if less, but in no event less than $27,476)	14 days, of which 6 must be consecutive
The Director of a "presentation program" shall receive additional compensation so that his or her initial compensation is not less than the minimum pilot rate, based on the length of the presentation, (1) if the "presentation program" leads directly to the sale of the series (i.e., there is no subsequent presentation or pilot produced); (2) if footage in excess of two (2) minutes (not including "stock shots" or establishing shots) from the "presentation program" is used in a subsequent presentation or pilot program which does sell the series; or (3) more than ten (10) minutes of footage from the presentation is used in any episode of the series. If two (2) minutes or less of footage from the presentation (not including "stock shots" or establishing shots) is used in a subsequent pilot or presentation or if less than ten (10) minutes is used in any other program, the applicable excerpt fee must be paid to the Director of the presentation from which the footage or excerpt is taken.
(f)	Workshops The parties reserve their respective positions with regard to "workshops."
" See text of footnote 3 on page 39.
10-103
- 128 -
10-104	Interchange of Assignment - Theatrical - Television
With respect to Directors, there may be complete interchange of assignment between production of theatrical films and television films. Whenever such interchange takes place, such Director shall receive not less than the respective minimum pay and working conditions pertaining to theatrical motion pictures or television motion pictures, whichever is applicable to the assignment on which the Director is employed at the time in question.
10-105	Other Provisions
For the provisions relating to "Travel," "Compensation on Recall for Particular Services" (however, the weekly rate shall be prorated in the manner provided in Paragraph 10-102, entitled "Compensation for Fractional Week"), "Holidays, Sixth and Seventh Days Worked in the Director's Workweek," "Deal Memorandum," "Personal Services Agreement," and "Prohibition Against Credits and Offsets," see Paragraphs 4-104, 4-105, 4-107, and 4-108 through 4-110, respectively. For "Directors' Minimum Conditions -- Preparation, Production and Post-Production," see Article 7.
10-106	Daily Employment
No Director shall be employed on a daily basis except in case of second units, trailers, promos, lead-ins, government, industrial, educational motion pictures, and talent tests, the type of services described in Paragraph 4-105, changes in photoplay, pictures seven (7) minutes or less in length, bridging or shooting added scenes for television films for theatrical release or bridging or shooting added scenes for theatrical motion pictures for television release. In each such case, the Director may be employed on a daily basis.
10-107	Adjustment of Term Directors
Directors employed under term contract who, during such term, direct a Network Prime Time show(s) shall be adjusted to the Network Prime Time show rate for the period of time spent in directing such show(s);
- 129 -
10-107
provided, however, that Employer shall be entitled to offset against such adjustment all compensation paid under such term contract for the period of time the Director is not assigned to direct any motion picture hereunder.
10-108	Preparation Allowance Time
With respect to a single television picture for which preparation time is allowed by the Employer, it shall be allowed before principal photography and the Director shall receive full salary for all days the Director is engaged in preparation at the Employer's direction. Once principal photography commences, shooting days shall be consecutive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to accommodate actor or location availability, the Employer may schedule principal photography during the Director’s prep period as follows:
(a)	If the Director is guaranteed three (3) prep days on a one-half hour program, the Employer may schedule principal photography on one (1) day during the Director's prep period, provided that the Director is given an additional prep day in place of the prep day that is used for photography;
(b)	If the Director is guaranteed four (4) prep days on a one-half hour program, the Employer may schedule principal photography on one (1) day during the Director's prep period, provided that the Director is given an additional prep day in place of the prep day that is used for photography if the photography takes five (5) hours or more;
(c)	If the Director is guaranteed five (5) or more prep days on a one-half hour program, the Employer may schedule principal photography on one (1) day during the Director's prep period; and
(d)	On a one-hour program, the Employer may schedule principal photography on two (2) days during the Director's prep period, provided that shooting is not permitted on the first day of the Director's prep period and the Director must be given an
10-107
- 130 -
additional prep day in place of a prep day that is used for photography if the photography takes five (5) hours or more.
Employer will give notice to the DGA the day before principal photography occurs during the Director’s prep period where practicable, but in no event later than two (2) business days after such photography occurs.
Except as specifically prohibited below, all preparation shall apply toward fulfillment of Employer's obligation on a Director's "guaranteed employment period." With respect to a single television picture, only preparation days which are consecutive with shooting days shall be applied against Employer's obligations for the guaranteed employment period, except as otherwise permitted above if necessary to accommodate actor or location availability and except that with respect to: (a) for 8-15 minute and 16-30 minute television films, one (1) non-consecutive day, subject to the Director's availability, prior to commencement of consecutive employment may be applied against Employer's obligation for the guaranteed employment period; (b) for 31-60 minute television films, two (2) such non-consecutive days, subject to the Director's availability, may be so applied. The parties agree that the DGA will continue to give good faith consideration to granting waivers on a case-by-case basis to expand the number of non-consecutive prep days for one-hour pilots and one-hour series from two (2) to three (3).
The parties further agree that the DGA will not unreasonably deny waiver requests for the payment of intervening days under this provision when exigencies of production do not permit principal photography to be completed within the intended schedule. In no event shall an Employer be obligated to pay more than five (5) intervening days under this provision.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Employer, because of the Christmas/New Year’s holidays, schedules a hiatus in production of an episodic series or serial, the Director’s work on an episode of the series or serial may be suspended during the hiatus, even though the Director has not completed his or her work in preparation or shooting
- 131 -
10-108
of the episode. This suspension of pay is conditioned on all of the following:
(a)	the hiatus is not longer than two (2) weeks;
(b)	the Director must be notified at the time of engagement; and
(c)	Christmas Day and/or New Year’s Day (to the extent that one or both fall within the hiatus period) must be treated as holidays not worked under Paragraphs 4-107 and 10-105.
In addition, at the Employer’s election, the Director’s preparation period may be suspended without pay during a one week planned hiatus on a single-camera one-half hour television motion picture, provided that the Director is notified of the hiatus at the time of engagement; the hiatus is noted in the Director’s deal memo; and Directors of all episodes of the series in the same season are guaranteed at least four (4) prep days.
10-109	Order of Shooting or Preparation of Consecutive Films at
Employer's Discretion
When a Director has been employed for the making of two (2) or more television films consecutively and Employer has complied with the applicable guarantees as set forth in Paragraph 10-101 above, then Employer may require such Director to work on more than one (1) film during any period of his or her employment; the order of shooting, rehearsal, cutting and preparation being at the Employer's discretion.
Employer may cumulate both payments and time on a multi-part closed-end (mini) series and continuing story on any series as well as continuous employment on two (2) episodes of one (1) or more openend series.
10-110	Trailers and Promos
(a)	Trailers and promos are divided into two classes: (1) integrated and (2) all others. An "integrated trailer or promo" is one
10-108
- 132 -
designed to be shown only with the entertainment film or films of the series directed in whole or in part by the Director during his or her term of employment.
Integrated trailers and/or promos may be made without extra pay to the Director on any shooting day, or on any additional shooting day for which the Director is paid an additional day's compensation.
Other trailers and promos may be made without limitation or restriction on the kind or number of such, provided the Director is specifically employed by the week, by the day, or under a term contract, under the terms of the applicable minimum salary schedule set forth in Paragraph 10-101 above.
(b)	If a term Director is on salary for any purpose, trailers and promos may be made by such Director on any day during the period he or she is on salary, without extra pay to the Director.
(c)	In the event a Director is called specifically and only for the purpose of making trailers and/or promos, the Director shall receive the minimum salary (daily, weekly or term) provided for in the applicable minimum salary schedule in Paragraph 10-101 above, prorated on the basis of the applicable one hour rate.
(d)	There shall be no limitation on the number of trailers and/or promos a Director may shoot in a day.
(e)	If a Director is called specifically and only to do trailers, and/or promos, one day of preparation time shall be provided regardless of the length of employment or number of shooting days; provided, however, if the Director is called for a single day's employment, and the shooting of trailers and/or promos takes five (5) hours or less, then the preparation requirement shall be included in the same day and only one (1) day's compensation shall be paid.
(f)	The inclusion of trailers or promos herein is not intended to change the present practice of making trailers or promos.
- 133 -
10-110
10-111	Options -- Notice to Director Whenever the Employer exercises an option for an additional term under a term contract, the Director shall be given at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice.
10-112	Multiple Picture Commitments Commitments for a Director to direct more than ten (10) one-half or five (5) one-hour films within any consecutive twenty-six (26) week period will not be permitted without the written consent of the Guild unless the Director's salary for the total number of films involved is at least $126,169 ($129,954 effective July 1, 2015 and $133,853 effective July 1, 2016). Any multiple picture commitment entered into prior to January 1, 1978 is governed by the 1973 BA.
10-113	Director Rest Period In connection with television productions, in the event the time elapsing between company wrap on one day and the time the Director is required to be on the set on the following day or the call of the Director of Photography on the following day, whichever is later, is less than eleven (11) hours, then Employer shall make a contribution to the Directors Guild of America Educational and Benevolent Foundation in the sum of $750 for each such incursion into the rest period of the Director, but no payment shall be due hereunder unless payment for forced call is in fact made to the Director of Photography of the picture.
10-114	Subcommittee for Long-Form Television Motion Pictures A subcommittee shall be established to discuss issues related to the production of long-form television motion pictures, including the allocation between prep and shooting days.

Director Residency
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the following shall apply to television Directors for purposes of establishing where the Director may be employed as a “local hire.” The Director shall designate the production center in which he/she wishes to be employed as a “local hire” in accordance with the rules and procedures currently followed by the Guild. In addition, the Guild, upon request of the Employer, shall grant an automatic and unconditional waiver to each Los Angeles-based episodic series to employ up to four Directors per season whose designated production center is not Los Angeles and to treat those Directors as “local hires.” However, each such episodic series may hire the same Director for only one episode per season as a “local hire.” The Guild will provide, upon the Employer’s request, a list of “local hires” for each production center.

(a)	A television motion picture which has been telecast not more than once in any city in the United States and Canada is in its first run. A television motion picture which has been telecast more than once, but not more than twice, in any city in the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada, is in its second run. A similar test applies in determining when a television motion picture is in its third and succeeding runs.

(4)	(i)
Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (b)(2) and (3) above, the Employer shall pay the following to the Director of an episode of a one (1) hour network prime time dramatic television series, whether covered under this or a prior Basic Agreement (other than one made for FBC Prime Time prior to July 1, 2005), which has not previously been exhibited in syndication, or of an episode of a one (1) hour prime time dramatic series produced prior to July 1, 2005 for initial broadcast on FBC, which series has not been exhibited in syndication prior to July 1, 2003, for reuse of such episode in syndication:
(A)	Two and six-tenths percent (2.6%) of the "Employer's gross" received for exhibitions in syndication until such time as the "Employer's gross" received therefrom exceeds the sum of $400,000.
(B)	Thereafter, one and three-quarters percent (1.75%) of the "Employer's gross" received for exhibition(s) in syndication.
However, payments made pursuant to this provision shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the "fixed residual schedule" set forth in subparagraphs (b)(2) and (3) above.
Similarly, such payments shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of such "fixed residual schedule" for such exhibitions, except in the case of series licensed only in markets representing less
- 139 -
11-101
than one-half of all United States television households.
(ii)	For the purposes of this Paragraph 11-101(b)(4), the term "Employer's gross" shall have the same meaning as it does in Article 18 with respect to pay television exhibition of a free television film.
(iii)	Payments due and payable hereunder shall be sent to the Guild within the time and in the manner required by subparagraphs (a), (c) and (d) of Paragraph 18-106.
(5) If an Employer licenses a television motion picture (including a program or series made for The CW, but excluding any other program or series made for syndication) for exhibition in syndication only in Canada, it shall have the option to elect to pay to the Director thereof four percent (4%) of the “Employer’s gross receipts” (as defined in Paragraph 11-108) derived therefrom, in lieu of any other compensation required under this or any prior Agreement, as applicable, and such exhibition shall not count as a “run” for purposes of calculating residuals under Article 11. The foregoing applies to television motion pictures, whether produced under the 2014 BA or any prior BA, as to which residuals would otherwise be payable.
The provisions of this Article 11 are not applicable to commercials or the "bridging" or shooting of added scenes for theatrical films for television release, or to second units, trailers or promos, for which there are no rerun payments.
(c)	The Employer shall pay as provided herein for each respective rerun, not later than four (4) months after the first telecast of the respective rerun in any city in the United States or Canada, or upon the completion of the telecasting of the respective rerun in seventy (70) cities in the United States and Canada, whichever occurs earlier. However, in the event any rerun is telecast on a television network or on The CW, the Employer
11-101
- 140 -
shall make the appropriate rerun payment not later than thirty (30) days after the telecast of such rerun.
(d)	The telecasting of a picture over a television network shall mean the telecast of such picture over the network facilities of ABC, CBS, FBC, NBC or any other entity which qualifies as a "network" under Section 73.662(f) of the rules of the Federal Communications Commission, unless the FCC determines that such entity is not a "network" for purposes of such Section, except (1) pictures telecast on any single regional network presently established and (2) pictures telecast on any single regional network which may hereafter be established and which does not include New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.
(e)	The above formula is a minimum formula and nothing herein shall preclude any Director from bargaining for better terms with respect to such reruns.
(f)	Whenever a payment is due under the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 11-101 for telecasts, after the effective date of this Agreement, of a television motion picture in a language or languages other than English, then in lieu of such payment, the payment due the Director(s) of such television motion picture shall be an aggregate amount equal to 1.2% of the Employer's "accountable receipts," as defined in Article 18, from the distribution of such television motion picture for such telecasts. Such payment shall not affect the Employer's obligation to make the applicable rerun payments for telecasts of a motion picture in English.
This subparagraph will apply to all television motion pictures produced on or after July 1, 1971.
(g)	If a substantial portion of a program or an element essential to the program is not shown because the program is interrupted due to governmental regulation or order, strike, the failure of program transmission facilities because of war or other calamity such as fire, earthquake, hurricane, or similar acts of God, or because of the breakdown of program transmission facilities due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the
- 141 -
11-101
11-102
Employer, or because the program time is pre-empted by a Presidential broadcast, a news emergency, or a special news event, the Guild shall, upon request of the Employer stating the reason therefor, grant a waiver permitting the Employer to reexhibit the interrupted program in its entirety within a thirty (30) day period following the interrupted exhibition without incurring any additional payment to any director of the program.
(h)	The parties agree to the following for the purpose of encouraging the success of new dramatic free television series produced for a network or for The CW or MyNetwork TV. No residual compensation shall be due under Paragraph 11-101 nor Paragraph 11-108 for the second run (which may be either on free television or basic cable) of two programs chosen by the Employer from the pilot and first two episodes broadcast during the first production season, provided the second run occurs within a two month period following the initial exhibition of each program. If such second run is on free television, it shall not constitute a “run” for purposes of Paragraph 11-101(b)(1) nor 11-101(b)(3) of this BA. Employer shall be obligated to report any such run to the Guild as required under this Article 11, notwithstanding the fact that no payment shall be due therefor.
Foreign Telecasting Payments
(a)	If the Employer desires to telecast any television motion picture in any part of the world outside the United States and Canada, the Employer shall pay additional compensation for such foreign telecasting of not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the applicable "base amount" in effect on the date of commencement of principal photography, not later than thirty (30) days after the Employer obtains knowledge of the first foreign telecast.
(b)	When the Distributor's Foreign Gross, as defined herein, of any such television motion picture has exceeded $7,000 for a one-half hour picture, $13,000 for a one-hour picture, or $18,000 if such picture is one and one-half hours or more in length, the
11-101
- 142 -
Director shall be entitled to the additional payment of not less than ten percent (10%) of the applicable "base amount" in effect on the date of commencement of principal photography, not later than thirty (30) days after such Gross has been so exceeded.
(c)	When the Distributor's Foreign Gross of any such television motion picture has exceeded $10,000 for a one-half hour picture, $18,000 for a one-hour picture, or $24,000 if such picture is one and one-half hours or more in length, the Director shall be entitled to the additional payment of not less than ten percent (10%) of the applicable "base amount" in effect on the date of the commencement of principal photography, not later than thirty (30) days after such Gross has been so exceeded.

For other than dramatic programs, the one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) payment shall be triggered when the Distributor’s Foreign Gross equals fifty percent (50%) of the amounts set forth in subparagraphs (1) through (8) above, as applicable.
For the purpose of this subparagraph (e), Distributor’s Foreign Gross shall include absolute gross income realized by the distributor on account of foreign telecasting and exhibition on foreign basic cable.
In order to preserve the status quo in Paragraph 11-108, payment of the thirty-five percent (35%) of applicable minimum under the foreign telecasting formula continues to constitute payment for foreign basic cable; provided, however, that foreign basic cable receipts shall apply to “Distributor’s Foreign Gross” for purposes of reaching the thresholds in and determining the amount the Director shall be paid pursuant to subparagraphs (1) through (8) above.
The Director shall receive such additional monies pursuant to the payment provisions of Paragraph 18-106, except payment and reporting shall be due within sixty (60) days after the close of the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year in which the Employer receives “Distributor's Foreign Gross” for the picture or at such other time as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties.
- 145 -
11-102
(f)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, for those one-hour network prime time dramatic television series referred to in 11-101(b)(4) above, the fifteen percent (15%), ten percent (10%) and ten percent (10%) of the applicable base amount referred to in subparagraphs (a) through (d) above shall be collapsed into a single payment of thirty-five percent (35%) of the applicable base amount payable not later than thirty (30) days after the Employer obtains knowledge of the first foreign telecast and in no event later than six (6) months after the first foreign telecast.
(g)	The term "foreign telecasting," as used herein, shall mean any telecast (whether simultaneous or delayed) outside the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada other than a telecast on any of the following regularly affiliated stations of a United States television network as a part of the United States network television telecast: XEW-TV or XEQ-TV or XHTV or XHGC-TV, Mexico City; and ZBM, Pembroke, Bermuda, for CBS and NBC; and any network affiliate in Tijuana; and ZBF, Hamilton, Bermuda, for ABC.
(h)	As used herein, the term "Distributor's Foreign Gross" shall mean, with respect to any television motion picture, the absolute gross income realized by the distributor of such picture for the foreign telecasting thereof and including, in the case of a "foreign territorial sale" by any such distributor, the income realized from such sale by such distributor but not the income realized by the "purchaser" or "licensee." The phrase "absolute gross income" shall not include:
(1)	Sums realized or held by the way of deposits or security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable.
(i)	Such sums as are non-returnable are to be included in the "Distributor's Foreign Gross" when such television motion picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the non-returnable sum is "ascertainable."
11-102
- 146 -
(A)	Such television motion picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(1)	It first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(2)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
(B)	Such television motion picture is "identifiable" when the Employer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given television motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(C)	The amount of the non-returnable sum is "ascertainable" if:
(1)	the non-returnable sum is for one television motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(2)	the total amount of the non-returnable sum is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Employer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such sum among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable sum is to be included
- 147 -
11-102
in Distributor's Foreign Gross for that quarter. The Employer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of Distributor's Foreign Gross, which includes the non-returnable sum, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
(ii)	If such television motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the non-returnable sum is ascertainable, but the Employer does not provide the Guild with the information required by the BA and applicable law, then the non-returnable sum shall be deemed includable in Distributor's Foreign Gross no later than six (6) months after the Employer receives it.
A non-returnable sum received by an Employer's parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the payment is directed by the Employer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as a non-returnable sum received by the Employer.
(2)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of the picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the distributor, but there shall not be excluded from Distributor's Foreign Gross any net income, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
(3)	Frozen foreign currency until the distributor shall have either the right to use such foreign currency in or to
11-102
- 148 -
transmit such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. In the event such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or transmit accrues.
Distributor's Foreign Gross realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period.
If any transaction involving any picture subject to a foreign telecast payment under this BA shall also include motion pictures, broadcast time, broadcast facilities or material (including commercial or advertising material) which are not subject to such payment, there shall be a reasonable allocation between the television motion pictures which are subject to foreign telecast payment and such other pictures, time, facilities or material, and only the sums properly allocable to pictures which are subject to a foreign telecast payment shall be included in the Distributor's Foreign Gross.
(i)	The above formula for foreign telecasting is a minimum formula, and nothing herein shall preclude any Director from bargaining for better terms with respect to such foreign telecasting.
11-103	Method of Payment; Guild Access to Records
All payments of additional compensation for reruns or foreign telecasts shall be made promptly by check, payable to the order of the Director entitled thereto, and shall be delivered to the Guild for forwarding to such Director, and compliance herewith shall constitute payment to Director. The Employer shall accompany such checks with a statement of the title and production date of the film and the "run" or "runs" for which such payment is made. The Employer shall keep or have access (a) to complete records showing all cities in the United States and Canada in which all television motion pictures subject to this BA have been telecast and the number of telecasts in
- 149 -
11-103
each such city, the television stations on which telecast, and the dates thereof; and (b) to records reflecting all pertinent gross sums collected from TV exhibition outside of the United States and Canada. The Guild shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect such records and at its cost make copies of such records. If Employer fails to pay such additional compensation when due and payable, interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date payment is due.
11-104
Reports for Foreign Telecasting
With respect to each television motion picture which is distributed for foreign telecasting, Employer shall furnish reports to the Guild showing Distributor's Foreign Gross derived from such motion picture until such picture has been withdrawn from distribution for foreign telecasting.
Such reports shall be rendered to the Guild on a quarterly basis during the first three (3) years in which any such picture is distributed for foreign telecasting, on a semi-annual basis for the next two (2) years and on an annual basis thereafter. Employer agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable requests from the Guild as to whether any picture is currently being distributed for foreign telecasting.
11-105	Television Motion Pictures and Contracts to Which Provisions
Hereof Are Applicable
The provisions hereof shall apply to all existing employment contracts in effect on July 1, 2014, as well as future contracts and employments for television motion pictures on which principal photography was commenced on or after July 1, 2014.
11-106
Employer's Acquisition of Title
If a signatory Employer is not the actual producer of a television motion picture which was produced by a Guild signatory, but acquires title thereto by purchase, assignment, transfer, voluntary or involuntary, or by foreclosure of a chattel mortgage or security agreement or at a pledgee's sale, such signatory Employer shall be

- 150 -
11-107
11-108
Section 11
11-201
obligated to make the payments herein provided which become due thereafter when such picture is rerun on television or released for foreign telecasting or for theatrical exhibition, by or for the account of such signatory Employer.

Basic Cable Exhibition
(a)	Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 11-101(h), upon release, on or after July 1, 2014, to basic cable of free television motion pictures, as to which free television residuals would otherwise be payable, Employer shall pay to the Director thereof the following percentage of the Employer's gross receipts obtained therefrom: With respect to free television motion pictures produced prior to July 1, 1984, said percentage shall be two and one-half percent (2^%); with respect to free television motion pictures produced after July 1, 1984, said percentage shall be two percent (2%). For the purpose of this provision, the term "basic cable" means one or more basic cable systems which do not meet the definition of pay television as set forth in the BA and wherein the release on basic cable is a separate release and not part of a free television broadcast. The definition of Employer's gross is the same as it is in Article 18 with respect to pay television exhibition of a free television film.
(b)	Payments due and payable hereunder shall be sent to the Guild by check payable to the Director. Reports shall be furnished to the Guild in the manner required by subparagraphs (a), (c) and (d) of Paragraph 18-106.
200 ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR THEATRICAL EXHIBITION
Additional compensation shall immediately accrue and be payable to the Director of a television film when such film is used for theatrical exhibition as follows (excepting the "bridging" of television films for
- 151 -
11-201
theatrical release, trailers, promos or second units, for which there will be no additional compensation):
If a television film is exhibited theatrically outside of the United States and Canada, then upon the release of such television film for theatrical exhibition, the Director shall be paid an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable theatrical minimum. If such film is released theatrically in the United States or Canada, the Director shall be paid one hundred fifty percent (150%) of such applicable theatrical minimum; provided, however, that the maximum payment under the provisions of this Paragraph 11-201 for theatrical release of a television film shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of applicable theatrical minimum.
The foregoing shall not apply to the incidental use of a television excerpt (as that term is generally used in the industry) in a theatrical exhibition. The following provisions shall apply to use of such a television excerpt:
(a)	For use of such an excerpt in a theatrical motion picture, the following payments will be made:
(1)	Excerpt less than thirty (30) seconds, $484 ($499 effective July 1, 2015);
(2)	Excerpt thirty (30) seconds to two (2) minutes, $969 ($998 effective July 1, 2015);
(3)	Excerpt over two (2) minutes, $969 plus $390 for each additional minute or fraction thereof ($998 plus $402 for each additional minute or fraction thereof effective July 1, 2015).
(b)	The provisions of this Paragraph 11-201 relating to the use of excerpts apply to the use after July 1, 2014 of any excerpt from a television motion picture, whenever produced.
(c)	The actual production company which produces the program or motion picture containing the excerpt requiring payment is obligated to make the payment, provided the company is
11-201
- 152 -
signatory to this BA. Employer shall otherwise remain liable for the payment due.
(d)	If two (2) or more Directors are entitled to share any payment, the Guild shall determine the allocation among the Directors.
(e)	If an excerpt is used in a local program and the program is broadcast in no more than one (1) market, the payment for such use shall be fifty percent (50%) of the amount provided in this Paragraph 11-201. If the program is broadcast later in another market, the Director shall be paid the remaining fifty percent (50%).
11-202	Television Film Amplified or Combined
If one (1) television film is amplified or two (2) or more television films are combined into one (1) integrated film and the same is released for theatrical exhibition, then, in that event, the additional payment due the Director or Directors shall be the sums referred to in Paragraph 11-201 above, ratably divided among them. Applicable theatrical scale shall be computed based on the combined negative cost of all television segments contained in the compilation. In case of dispute as to the manner of allocation between Directors, the Guild will make the determination.
If Employer desires to combine two (2) or more complete television programs or episodes to make a new or expanded entity, the original Director (subject to reasonable availability) shall supervise any additional editing or be offered employment to shoot any additional footage required. The Employer shall notify the Director or Directors involved of its intent to amplify or combine the motion pictures no later than five (5) days preceding the commencement of any required services herein. There shall be no compensation for up to one (1) week of editing supervision. Any additional editing supervision and any shooting of additional footage shall be compensated at a rate equal to the pro rata rate of the initial compensation paid to Director. If more than one (1) Director is involved and there is a dispute, the Guild will determine which one among them will perform the above services. In any event, each Director represented by his or her work
- 153 -
11-202
in the combination shall receive his or her respective residuals thereon, as determined by the Guild.
11-203	Television Films to Which Additional Compensation Applicable
Additional compensation, as provided herein, for such theatrical release shall apply only to those television films on which principal photography is commenced on or after July 1, 2014.
11-204	Time of Payment for Theatrical Release
The amounts of additional compensation for theatrical exhibition of television films shall be paid to the Director on the date the Employer releases the television film for theatrical exhibition unless payment was previously made in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4-110.
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 4-110, Employer, at its option, may make any part or all of the total additional payments for theatrical exhibition provided herein at the time of employment of the Director or prior to the time when the same is due.
11-205	Method of Payment and Records of Theatrical Releases
All payments of additional compensation for theatrical release of television films shall be paid by the Employer by checks, payable to the order of the Directors entitled thereto, and mailed to the Guild at the address of the Guild first above written for forwarding to such Director, and such delivery to the Guild shall constitute payment to the Director. The Employer shall accompany such checks with a statement of the title of the television film and the manner and name of its use in theatrical release.
The Employer shall keep or have access to complete records showing the release or sale of television films for theatrical use. The Guild shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect all such records.

Excerpts From a Free Television Program
The use of an excerpt from a free television film shall be deemed a run or foreign telecast of such film hereunder, except in the following circumstances:
(a)	When used for promotional, trailer, news or review purposes; provided, however, that the length of such excerpt(s) shall not exceed five (5) minutes.
However, the maximum length of excerpts from a free television motion picture, other than a long-form television motion picture (i.e., a television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or more in length), that can be used for promotional purposes without payment of excerpt fee(s) is five (5) minutes; the maximum length of excerpts from a long-form television motion picture that can be used for promotional purposes without payment of excerpt fee(s) is ten (10) minutes; and the Employer may use up to five (5) minutes of excerpts from a free television motion picture or series on any DVD release to advertise or promote the series without payment of excerpt fee(s).
The Guild will give good faith consideration to requests for promotional uses of excerpts which exceed this length limitation, without the payment of fees, provided the use is non-commercial and the Director receives appropriate credit.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a "promotional" use of an excerpt shall be for the purpose of advertising or publicizing the specific program or serial or series from which the excerpt is taken. As used in this subparagraph (a), the term "news" means regularly-scheduled news programs (but not magazine or documentary programs), and special news programs which are not pre-planned and are broadcast within twenty-four (24) hours after the event which gave rise to the program. It is understood that obituary programs are deemed to be "special news programs" even if pre-planned.
- 155 -
11-207
(b)	When used as a so-called "stock shot" (as customarily understood in the industry -- i.e., shots excluding dialogue or identifiable characters).
(c)	When used for purposes of recapping the story to date in the context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series or anthology; provided, however, that if such recap shall exceed ninety (90) seconds in length when used on a program less than sixty (60) minutes in total length, or exceed three (3) minutes in length when used on a program sixty (60) minutes or more in total length, Employer shall pay to the Director(s) of the program(s) from which the excerpts in the recap were taken an aggregate one-time-only sum equal to $242.00 ($249.00 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or portion thereof by which the recap exceeds such length limitation; and provided, further, that no such recap shall exceed (without being deemed a run or foreign telecast as set forth above) five (5) minutes.
(d)	When used as a flashback in the context of a serial, multi-part program, episodic series, unit series, one time show or anthology; provided, however, that if such flashback shall exceed thirty (30) seconds in length, Employer shall pay to the Director(s) of the program(s) from which the excerpts in the flashbacks were taken an aggregate, one-time-only sum equal to $242.00 ($249.00 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or portion thereof by which the flashback exceeds such length limitation; and provided, further, that no such flashback shall exceed (without being deemed a run or foreign telecast as set forth above) five (5) minutes.
(e)	For any use of excerpts which is not within the exceptions provided for in subparagraphs (a) - (d) above nor Paragraph 11209 below, or if such excerpts are otherwise within subparagraphs (c) and (d) but the aggregate running time of such excerpts from a single program exceeds the maximum applicable footage lengths, the Employer shall pay for use on television of excerpts from a television program the following aggregate one-time-only sum to the Director or Directors determined by the Guild to be entitled to such compensation and prorated as determined by the Guild:
11-207
- 156 -
(1)	Ten (10) seconds or less of excerpts from such program -- $390 ($402 effective July 1, 2015); or
(2)	Over ten (10) seconds but not more than two (2) minutes of excerpts from such program -- $1,166 ($1,201 effective July 1, 2015), or the applicable rerun fee, whichever is less; or
(3)	Over two (2) minutes but not more than ten (10) minutes of excerpts from such program -- $1,166 ($1,201 effective July 1, 2015) for the first two (2) minutes and $194 ($200 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or portion thereof in excess of two (2) minutes, or the applicable rerun fee, whichever is less; or
(4)	Over ten (10) minutes of excerpts from such program -the applicable rerun fee;
provided, however, not less than $390 ($402 effective July 1, 2015) will be paid for the use of excerpts from a single program.
For the use of an excerpt in a documentary or magazine program, the excerpt fee is six percent (6%) less than the above rates.
(f)	If an excerpt from a free television film is used on pay television or videodiscs/videocassettes, as such terms are used in Article 20, or basic cable, such use shall be treated in the same manner as though the excerpt were used on free television.
(g)	The provisions of this Paragraph 11-207 apply to the use after July 1, 2014 of an excerpt from a free television program, whenever produced.
(h)	The actual production company which produces the program or motion picture containing the excerpt requiring payment is obligated to make the payment required under this Paragraph
- 157 -
11-207
11-208
provided the company is signatory to this BA. Employer shall otherwise remain liable for the payment due.
(i)	If two (2) or more Directors are entitled to share any payment provided in this Paragraph, the Guild shall determine the allocation among the Directors.
(j)	If an excerpt is used in a local program and the program is broadcast in no more than one (1) market, the payment for such use shall be fifty percent (50%) of the amount provided in this Paragraph 11-207. If the program is broadcast later in another market, the Director shall be paid the remaining fifty percent (50%).
(k)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, no excerpt fee shall be payable to the Director of the program in which the excerpt is used if:
(1)	the program is part of a series order of no fewer than thirteen (13) episodes and the Director has directed, or has a commitment to direct, ninety percent (90%) or more of the series order;
(2)	the program is an episode of a show such as “Letterman” or “Oprah,” and the Director has been continuously employed on the show for at least one (1) year before production of the episode; or
(3)	the Director is either a credited Executive Producer or Producer of the program and the credited Director of the program from which the excerpt is derived.
Films Exhibited Without Admission Charge
If a television film is exhibited other than on free television or in a supplemental market, such exhibition shall be deemed a theatrical exhibition with the following additional provisos: If the Employer licenses or grants to any third party the right to place in theatrical exhibition a television film produced after July 1, 2014, which exhibition is to be before a viewing audience which pays no fee or admission charge to view the same, Employer will pay to Director an
11-207
- 158 -
amount equal in the aggregate to five percent (5%) of the gross amounts received by Employer derived therefrom; provided, however, the sums paid to the Director hereunder shall in no event exceed the applicable amount otherwise payable to such Director under the applicable provisions of Section 11-200 had there been a fee or admission charge paid by the viewing audience. When Employer licenses or grants any such right to a subsidiary or other related entity, the gross amounts referred to in the preceding sentence shall be the amounts specifically paid to the Employer subject to there having been good faith bargaining between the Employer and such subsidiary or related entity. Employer shall account to the Director entitled to payments hereunder on no less than an annual basis, provided that no accounting need be made for any twelve (12) month period following the twelve (12) month period during which the Employer received no gross amounts with respect thereto. There shall be no duplication of the payments provided for in this provision and the payments provided for in any other provision of Section 11200. That is, any payment made under this provision shall be credited against any payment which may become due the Director under all other provisions of Section 11-200. Conversely, if a theatrical release payment is made to the Director under the provisions of Section 11200 other than under this provision, then no further sum shall be payable under this provision.
When a motion picture is exhibited at a film festival or a charitable event and an admission fee is charged, but no monies are paid to the Employer or the Employer’s licensee in consideration for the use of the film, no payment shall be due hereunder.
11-209	Compilation Television Programs
For "compilation television programs" -- i.e., programs whose running time (excluding commercials and title sequences) is comprised of more than fifty percent (50%) excerpts -- Employer will pay, for each use, to the Director(s) of the excerpted material contained in the compilation, prorated as determined by the Guild, an aggregate one-time-only sum equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the applicable thirty (30) minute minimum for each thirty (30) minutes of overall program length of the television program in which such excerpts are used. Exhibition of excerpts in such
- 159 -
11-209
compilation television programs shall not be deemed reruns or other use of the television films from which the excerpts are taken.
Payment pursuant to this Paragraph 11-209 relating to compilations shall not reduce or affect other payments which may become due to the Directors for use of the television films from which such excerpts are taken.
11-210	Lead-Ins
(a)	An aggregate payment of $106 ($109 effective July 1, 2015) shall be made to the Director(s) who direct(s) and/or who directed material used in a lead-in when each program using such lead-in is initially exhibited. Such payment shall not be required for the first program in which the lead-in is used if the Director also directs that program unless the lead-in material originally was recorded for another program. The term "leadin," as used in this Paragraph 11-210, includes title sequences.
(b)	In the case of a multiple times per week program, the payment specified above shall constitute payment for the week.
(c)	If more than one Director is entitled to receive a share of the $106 ($109 effective July 1, 2015) payment, the Guild shall determine the allocation among such Directors.
(d)	Employer shall send lead-in payments to the Guild within thirty (30) days following the end of the television season during which the programs using the lead-in were initially exhibited. The payments must be accompanied by a statement indicating the length of each excerpt and the name of the Director of each excerpt used in the lead-in. The Guild shall forward such payments to the Director(s).

Section 11-300 GENERAL
11-301	No Director May Waive Minimum Salaries or Minimum
Additional Compensation for Reruns or Theatrical Use of TV Films
Since all minimums have been established by collective bargaining, no Employee may, in any event, agree to basic salary below the minimums set forth herein, including, without limitation, basic compensation and additional compensation for reruns or foreign telecasts, nor may he or she by agreement postpone any compensation due to him or her to a period beyond the applicable time provided in this BA.
11-302	Payment for Combined or Extended Films
This Paragraph 11-302 shall apply when a previously-broadcast television program, whenever produced, is extended beyond the time category in which it was originally broadcast (e.g., one-half hour, one hour, etc.) with the addition of new photography or when two (2) or more television programs, whenever produced, are combined (with or without the addition of new photography). In any of the said cases, the aggregate payment for the extended or combined program shall be two hundred percent (200%) of the minimum compensation which would otherwise be applicable to a program of such length and type and, if more than one Director is involved, shall be allocated between them. If the Director of the extended or combined program also directed a pre-existing program(s) used in the extended or combined program, the initial compensation paid to such Director for such preexisting program(s) shall be credited against the portion of such two hundred percent (200%) allocated to him or her.
Residual payments for the extended or combined program shall be two hundred percent (200%) of the minimum residual compensation applicable to the program. If more than one Director is involved, the said amount shall be allocated between them.
In the case of any controversy as to any allocation, the amount allocated to each Director shall be resolved on a reasonable basis by
- 161 -
11-302
the Guild, and each individual Director involved shall be bound thereby.
Unless new photography (other than bridging material which in the aggregate does not exceed five (5) minutes) is added, this Paragraph 11-302 shall not apply to the combining of segments of a multi-part closed-end series, to the combining of parts of a multi-part story in an episodic series or to the back-to-back exhibition of two or more episodes or segments of episodes of the same series. The foregoing exclusions shall apply even if photography is deleted. Also, this Paragraph 11-302 shall not apply to the use of excerpts nor to "compilation" programs.
11-303	Excerpt From a Theatrical Motion Picture
Complete scenes or portions of any scenes from a theatrical motion picture may not be shown on television for purposes of advertising or exploiting the theatrical motion picture without the consent of the Guild, except that this limitation does not apply to such scenes or portion of a scene, as the case may be, which does not exceed ten (10) minutes. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of trailers advertising or exploiting the exhibition of the picture on television.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (a) Employer uses any excerpts from a theatrical picture in any television film (other than a magazine or documentary program), including television films which consist substantially of excerpts of theatrical motion pictures, or (b) in the event Employer uses any excerpts from a theatrical motion picture, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1984, in another theatrical motion picture, the Employer shall pay the following aggregate one-time-only sum to the Directors determined by and in the amounts prorated and determined by the Guild: (1) thirty (30) seconds or less of excerpts - $266 ($274 effective July 1, 2015); (2) over thirty (30) seconds but not over two (2) minutes of excerpts - $759 ($782 effective July 1, 2015); (3) over two (2) minutes of excerpts - $759 ($782 effective July 1, 2015) for the first two (2) minutes and $191 ($197 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or portion thereof in excess of two (2) minutes. In the event Employer uses any excerpts from a theatrical motion picture in
11-302
- 162 -
any magazine or documentary program, including magazine or documentary programs which consist substantially of excerpts of theatrical motion pictures, the Employer shall pay the following aggregate one-time-only sum to the Directors determined by and in the amounts prorated and determined by the Guild: (1) thirty (30) seconds or less of excerpts - $250 ($258 effective July 1, 2015); (2) over thirty (30) seconds but not over two (2) minutes of excerpts -$717 ($739 effective July 1, 2015); (3) over two (2) minutes of excerpts - $717 ($739 effective July 1, 2015) for the first two (2) minutes and $179 ($184 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or portion thereof in excess of two (2) minutes.

(ii)	is assigned to another position (whether or not subject to this BA) at a salary not less than the minimum salary of a Second Second Assistant Director, provided that if such subsequent assignment is to a theatrical motion picture or a television program ninety (90) minutes or longer, Employer notifies the Second Assistant Director not later than ten (10) days before the end of the Second Assistant Director's then current assignment that he or she is to be assigned to another position,
no Completion of Assignment Pay accrues until completion of the final assignment and then only for the one (1) week or two and one-half (21/?) days, as the case may be. The amount payable at that time shall be computed at not less than the minimum salary of a Second Assistant Director, except if there has been a permissible upgrading to a First Assistant Director or UPM in which case Completion of Assignment Pay shall be
13-104
- 180 -
computed and paid in accordance with the following paragraphs:
(1)	Second Assistant Directors -- Upgraded and Laid Off:
An eligible Second Assistant Director (as provided in Article 14) if upgraded to First Assistant Director and/or UPM (for a week or longer) and laid off after having continuously worked in one or both (as the case may be) of such upgraded positions, shall receive the applicable Completion of Assignment Pay due him or her for the highest paid category in which he or she worked. If such applicable Completion of Assignment Pay is two and one-half (21/?) days in such highest paid category, he or she shall, in addition, receive two and one-half (21/?) days' Completion of Assignment Pay of the next highest category in which he or she worked five (5) or more consecutive working days.
FOR EXAMPLE:
(i)	An eligible Second Assistant Director employed as such for two (2) weeks is upgraded to a First Assistant Director for one (1) week; such employment is continuously followed by employment as a UPM for two (2) weeks or more and such Employee is then laid off. Such Employee would be entitled to one (1) week's Completion of Assignment Pay as a UPM only and no Completion of Assignment Pay as a First or Second Assistant Director. (ii)
(ii) Assume Example (i) remains the same in all respects except that he or she was upgraded on February 2 to First Assistant Director for three continuous weeks. When laid off on July 2, he or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of one (1) week as a First Assistant Director and no Completion of Assignment Pay as a Second Assistant Director.
- 181 -
13-104
(iii)	Assume Example (i) above remains the same in all respects except that the employment as a UPM is for less than one (1) week. Such employee would be entitled to two and one-half (21/?) days' Completion of Assignment Pay as a First Assistant Director and no Completion of Assignment Pay as a UPM.
(iv) Assume Example (i) above remains the same with respect to work as a Second Assistant Director but the employment as a First Assistant Director consists of less than one (1) week continuously followed by employment as a UPM for less than one (1) week (or vice versa), but such combined continuous employment aggregates one (1) complete week. Such employee would be entitled to two and one-half (21/?) days' Completion of Assignment Pay computed on the average daily salary of the work days during such consecutive period of employment as a First Assistant Director and UPM (or vice versa), and two and one-half (21/?) days' Completion of Assignment Pay as a Second Assistant Director.
(v) An Additional Second Assistant Director is upgraded to a Second Second Assistant Director, works as Second Second Assistant Director and is then laid off after working two (2) consecutive weeks or more as a Second Second Assistant Director. Such Employee would be entitled to one (1) week's Completion of Assignment Pay computed on the basis of his or her salary as a Second Second Assistant Director.
(2)	Second Assistant Director -- Upgrading and Downgrading
An eligible Second Assistant Director may be upgraded to First Assistant Director and/or UPM (for a week or longer) and then downgraded to a Second Assistant Director once within each successive period of four (4) months of continuous employment, commencing with the date of his or her employment as a Second Assistant Director, without payment of Completion of Assignment
13-104
- 182 -
Pay at the time or times he or she is so downgraded. When subsequently laid off, such Second Assistant Director shall, at the time of his or her layoff, receive the applicable Completion of Assignment Pay of the highest category to which he or she had been upgraded, computed as described in subparagraph (1) above for each such upgrading but not to exceed a total of one (1) week's Completion of Assignment Pay.
FOR EXAMPLE:
(i)	An eligible Second Assistant Director commences employment as a Second Assistant Director on January 2. He or she works continuously and on February 2 is upgraded to First Assistant Director. He or she works one (1) week as such and is then downgraded to a Second Assistant Director. He or she is laid off as such on July 2. He or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of two and one-half (21/?) days as a First Assistant Director and two and one-half (21/?) days as a Second Assistant Director.
(ii)	Assume Example (i) remains the same in all respects except that he or she was upgraded on February 2 to First Assistant Director for three (3) continuous weeks. When laid off on July 2, he or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of one (1) week as a First Assistant Director and no completion of assignment pay as a Second Assistant Director. (iii)
(iii) Assume Example (i) remains the same except that he or she was upgraded on February 2 to a First Assistant Director for less than one (1) week and such employment was continuously followed by employment as a UPM for less than one (1) week but such combined continuous employment aggregates one (1) complete week. He or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of two and one-half (21/?) days computed as in example (1)(iv), and Completion of Assignment Pay of two and one-half (21/?) days as a Second Assistant Director.
- 183 -
13-104
(iv) Assume Example (i) remains the same except that on July 2 he or she is again upgraded, this time to a UPM, for one (1) week. He or she is then again downgraded to a Second Assistant Director and laid off as such on September 2. He or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of two and one-half (21/?) days as a UPM, two and one-half (21/?) days as a First Assistant Director and no Completion of Assignment Pay as a Second Assistant Director.
If an eligible Second Assistant Director is so upgraded and downgraded more than once during any such four (4) month period, his or her Completion of Assignment Pay for the first such upgrading and downgrading during each four (4) month period shall be computed and paid at the date of his or her final layoff in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and examples. His or her Completion of Assignment Pay for service as a UPM or First Assistant Director during the second and each successive upgrading and downgrading in any such four (4) month period shall be paid to him or her at the respective times he or she is downgraded.
FOR EXAMPLE:
Assume Example (2)(i) above remains the same except that on March 1, he or she is upgraded again, this time to a UPM. He or she continues as such until April 1, at which time he or she is downgraded to a Second Assistant Director and continues as such until laid off on July 2. He or she would be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of one (1) week as a UPM on April 1. He or she would also be entitled to Completion of Assignment Pay of two and one-half (21/?) days as a First Assistant Director payable when he or she was finally laid off on July 1.
(b)	The provisions of Paragraph 13-102(b) shall apply to this Paragraph 13-104.
13-104
- 184 -
(c)	The maximum number of completion of assignment payments required to be made by an Employer to a given Employee in any single program season is five (5) plus the final payment.
(d)	The parties hereby clarify the Completion of Assignment Pay provisions as follows: Completion of Assignment Pay is not due when an Employee voluntarily resigns. Completion of Assignment Pay shall nevertheless be due when the Employee notifies the Employer that he or she will not return to work following a hiatus.
13-105	Employment Contracts and Layoffs -- UPMs and Assistant
Directors
(a)	UPMs and Assistant Directors, in addition to being employed on a freelance, daily or weekly basis as specified in Paragraph 13-101, may also be employed as term contract UPMs or Assistant Directors. UPMs' and Assistant Directors' term contracts shall be for a minimum period of twenty-three (23) out of twenty-six (26) weeks or multiples thereof.
(b)	No layoff for a term contract UPM or term contract Assistant Director shall be for less than one (1) week at a time.
13-106	No Intent to Evade
It is not the intent of the parties to use layoffs, juggle or promiscuously interrupt the employment of First and Second Assistant Directors or UPMs, or to change the duties performed by them, for the express purpose of evading Completion of Assignment Pay or of depriving them of the benefits of this BA.
13-107	Deal Memorandum -- No Credit or Offset
Following the oral confirmation between Employer and a Freelance UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director (or his or her agent) of the rate of compensation and the starting date for a proposed employment of the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director, the Employer will deliver a "deal memorandum" to the Guild and to
- 185 -
13-107
the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director (or his or her agent) prior to his or her employment. Such "deal memorandum" shall set forth at least the information contained in Exhibit "C-4" or "C-5," as applicable, attached hereto. In no event is any UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director to commence services before delivery of the "deal memorandum" to the Guild, except in cases of bona fide emergency. Employer may require the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director to sign a copy of the "deal memorandum" prior to permitting the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director to commence services. Overscale cannot be used to credit or offset in any manner any payments required to be made hereunder to the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director.

The full payroll week shall be the established payroll week of the Employer from midnight Saturday until midnight Saturday.
13-109	Time of Payment

13-107
- 186 -
Unit Production Managers must submit claims for extended workday payments and/or dinner allowances no later than one (1) week after the UPM receives the paycheck covering the week for which the payment or allowance was due. Claims not submitted within that time period shall be waived.
(b)	First Assistant Director. The following applies to the determination of First Assistant Directors' extended workday payments:
(1)	The workday of a First Assistant Director working in conjunction with a shooting company is deemed to start at the general crew call and end at the time of camera wrap. When camera wrap occurs at a distant location or a "bus to" local location, actual travel time is added to the end of the workday.
(2)	For other than multi-camera stage shows:
(i)	A First Assistant Director whose workday as defined in subparagraph (b)(1) above is more than fourteen (14) hours but not more than sixteen (16) hours shall receive an additional one-half (/) day's salary.
(ii)	In addition to any payment required by subparagraph (b)(2)(i) above, a First Assistant Director whose workday as defined in subparagraph (b)(1) above is more than sixteen (16) hours but not more than twenty (20) hours shall receive an additional one-half (/) day's salary.
(iii)	In addition to any payment required by subparagraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) above, a First Assistant Director whose workday as defined in subparagraph (b)(1) above is more than twenty (20) hours shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof by which the workday exceeds twenty (20) hours.
- 187 -
13-110
(3)	On multi-camera stage shows, when the workday as defined in subparagraph (b)(1) above of a First Assistant Director working in conjunction with a shooting company exceeds sixteen (16) hours, such First Assistant Director shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof by which the workday exceeds sixteen (16) hours.
(4)	If a First Assistant Director works more than sixteen (16) hours other than in conjunction with a shooting company before being dismissed, subparagraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) above do not apply, and he or she shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof worked beyond sixteen (16) hours.
10(c) Key Second Assistant Director and Second Second Assistant Director. The following applies to the determination of Key Second Assistant Directors' and Second Second Assistant Directors' extended workday payments:
(1)	The workday of a Second Assistant Director working in conjunction with a shooting company is deemed to start at the earlier of the general crew call, make-up personnel call or hairdressing personnel call. A Second Assistant Director's workday is deemed to end one-half (/) hour after camera wrap in the studio and is deemed to end one (1) hour after camera wrap at a distant location, a "bus to" local location or a “report to” local location. When camera wrap occurs at a distant location or "bus to" local location, actual travel time is added to the end of the workday.
(2)	For other than multi-camera stage shows, on which only one (1) Second Assistant Director is employed, the following rules apply:
10 See Paragraph 24-406(f) for application of this Paragraph 13-110(c) to multi-camera prime time dramatic pilots, presentations and series.
13-110
- 188 -
(i)	At the studio or a "report to" local location, if the workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above is more than thirteen (13) hours but less than sixteen (16) hours, such Second Assistant Director shall receive an additional one-half (^) day's salary.
(ii)	At a distant location or a "bus to" local location, if the workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above is more than fourteen (14) hours but less than sixteen (16) hours, such Second Assistant Director shall receive an additional one-half (^) day's salary.
(iii)	In addition to any payment required by subparagraphs (c)(2)(i) or (ii) above, if such Second Assistant Director's workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above exceeds sixteen (16) hours, such Second Assistant Director shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof by which the workday exceeds sixteen (16) hours.
(3)	For shooting units on which more than one (1) Second Assistant Director is employed, any Second Assistant Director whose workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above exceeds sixteen (16) hours shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof by which the workday exceeds sixteen (16) hours.
(4)	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (c), if more than one Second Assistant Director is employed, the Employer may stagger the hours worked of any or all Second Assistant Directors to avoid extended workday payments as long as there is a Key Second Assistant Director or a Second Second Assistant Director present at the start and at the end of the workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above. If an Employer chooses to stagger the work shifts of
- 189 -
13-110
Second Assistant Directors, such Second Assistant Directors' workdays shall be the actual time worked (including meal periods). In that event, only such Second Assistant Directors whose actual time worked exceeds sixteen (16) hours shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof worked beyond sixteen (16) hours; provided that in calculating the actual time worked, no Second Assistant Director's start time shall be earlier than the start of the workday described in subparagraph (c)(1) above and no Second Assistant Director's end time shall be later than the end of the workday described in subparagraph (c)(1) above.
For example, on a day at the studio, the makeup/hair dressing personnel call is 4:00 a.m.; the general crew call is 7:00 a.m. and camera wrap is at 9:00 p.m. The workday, as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above, is from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. If a Key Second Assistant Director and a Second Second Assistant Director are employed, the Employer may assign the Second Second Assistant Director to come in at 4:00 a.m. and the Key Second Assistant Director to come in at 8:00 a.m. If the Employer releases the Second Second Assistant Director at 4:00 p.m. and the Key Second Assistant Director remains until after camera wrap, the Second Second Director's workday would be from 4:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and the Key Second Assistant Director's workday would be from 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. No extended workday pay would be due to either Second Assistant Director under this example.
(5)	On multi-camera stage shows, when the workday as defined in subparagraph (c)(1) above of a Second Assistant Director working in conjunction with a shooting company exceeds sixteen (16) hours, such Second Assistant Director shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof by which the workday exceeds sixteen (16) hours.
13-110
- 190 -
(6)	If a Second Assistant Director works more than sixteen (16) hours other than in conjunction with a shooting company before being dismissed, subparagraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4) and (c)(5) do not apply, and he or she shall receive an additional day's salary for each four (4) hour period or portion thereof worked beyond sixteen (16) hours.
(d)	Special Rules for Extended Workday Payments in the New York Metropolitan Area
(1)	For Employees Who Report Within the Thirty (30) Mile Zone
When an employee (other than a Unit Production Manager) reports for work within the thirty (30) mile “report-to” zone in the New York metropolitan area as described in Paragraph 13-117, the employee’s workday shall commence at general crew call or the make-up and hairdressing personnel call, whichever is applicable, at the location.
(2)	For Employees Who Report Outside the Thirty (30) Mile Zone
When an employee reports to work at a location which is outside the 30-mile report-to zone in the New York metropolitan area as described in Paragraph 13-117, other than a distant (overnight) location, such location shall be considered a “bus to” local location for purposes of determining the employee’s extended work day. The workday of an employee (other than a Unit Production Manager) who is required to report to such a location shall be deemed to commence at the scheduled pick-up time of the crew from a mutually agreed-upon point in the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery or from the perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery. If no pick-up is provided, then the workday shall be deemed to commence at the time that results when the start of the workday as defined in this
- 191 -
13-110
Paragraph 13-110 is adjusted backward to include the amount of time needed to travel to the location from a mutually agreed-upon point in the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery or from the perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery. The point used for determining the start of work time for the crew shall likewise be used for determining the commencement of the workday for any employee hereunder. Likewise, when no pick-up is provided, the amount of time needed to travel to the location as determined under the Motion Picture Studio Mechanics, Local #52 Agreement shall be used in determining the commencement of the workday for employees hereunder.
When an employee is required to work at such a location, an additional half-hour shall be added to the number of hours at which an extended workday payment is triggered under this Paragraph 13-110, based upon the workday starting at the time provided in the preceding paragraph and ending as provided in this Paragraph 13110.
(e)	Rate of Pay. As used in this Paragraph 13-110, a day's salary shall be in all cases one-fifth (1/5) the studio workweek rate, and all extended workday payments shall be excluded from all other computations.
(f)	Meal Period. The meal period is included within the workday in all cases.
(g)	No Compounding. The parties confirm that extended workday payments and payments for work starting on the previous day and continuing past 1:00 a.m. of the sixth or seventh day worked in an employee's workweek (as provided in Paragraphs 13-111 and 13-112) are not compounded. The Employer is instead obligated to pay the higher of the two payments.
13-110
- 192 -
13-111

A Daily UPM, a Daily Assistant Director or a Daily Associate Director who commences work on a particular day, which work continues past 1:00 a.m. of the following day, and who has worked at least fourteen (14) hours, including meal periods, before being dismissed on such following day shall be considered to have a call for such particular day and also for such following day. For example, a Daily UPM, a Daily Assistant Director, or a Daily Associate Director who commenced work at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday and worked until 2:30 a.m. Friday shall be considered to have a call for both Thursday and Friday. If he or she commenced work at 10:00 p.m. on Thursday and worked until 2:00 a.m. on Friday, he or she would not be considered to have a call for Friday. In any event, if such Daily UPM, Daily Assistant Director, or Daily Associate Director does not work past 1:00 a.m. of such following day, he or she shall not be deemed to have worked on such day. For example, if such Daily UPM, Daily Assistant Director or Daily Associate Director commenced work at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday and worked until 12:30 a.m. on Friday, he or she would not be considered to have a call for work on Friday.
13-112	Workweek, Partial Workweek, Prorating of Fractional Payroll
Weeks, Work on the Sixth and Seventh Days in the Employee's Workweek and Shifts in the Employee's Workweek
(a)	Studio Workweek: A full "studio workweek" for weekly Employees shall consist of seven (7) days with the sixth and seventh days as the regular days off at the "studio workweek rate" set forth in Paragraph 13-101 above. If a weekly UPM, weekly Assistant Director or weekly Associate Director is specifically instructed and required by Employer to perform work on six (6) days at a studio or a local location or on seven (7) days, under the direction and control of Employer, then such weekly Employee shall be compensated at the applicable following rate:
(1)	For each sixth day worked in an Employee's studio workweek, Employee shall be paid one hundred fifty
- 193 -
13-112
percent (150%) of: (i) his or her actual gross daily salary, in the case of daily employees; or (ii) one-fifth (1/5) of his or her actual gross weekly salary, in the case of weekly employees.
(2)	For each seventh day worked in an Employee's workweek, Employee shall be paid two hundred percent (200%) of: (i) his or her actual gross daily salary, in the case of daily employees; or (ii) one-fifth (1/5) of his or her actual gross weekly salary, in the case of weekly employees.
(3)	The production fee, if applicable, shall be included in the calculation of pro rata compensation for the purpose of calculating pay for the sixth day worked in an Employee's studio workweek or pay for the seventh day worked in an Employee's workweek or holiday pay.
The above provisions shall apply to any weekly UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director, who, having commenced work on the previous day, continues to work past 1:00 a.m. on such sixth day worked in the Employee's studio workweek or seventh day worked in the Employee's workweek, as the case may be, and worked at least fourteen (14) hours, including meal periods, before being dismissed on such sixth or seventh day worked, unless such Employee receives a thirty-three (33) hour rest period for one (1) day off or a fifty (50) hour rest period for two (2) days off.
Likewise, the above provisions shall apply to any daily Unit Production Manager, Assistant Director or Associate Director, who, having commenced work on the previous day, continues to work past 1:00 a.m. on such sixth day worked in the Employee's studio workweek or seventh day worked in the Employee's workweek, as the case may be, and works at least fourteen (14) hours, including meal periods, before being dismissed on such sixth or seventh day worked, unless the Employee is also employed on the first day of the workweek following the week in which the Employee worked into the sixth or seventh day and the Employee receives a thirty-three
13-112
- 194 -
(33)	hour rest period for one (1) day off or a fifty (50) hour rest period for two (2) days off.
In any event, UPMs, Assistant Directors, and Associate Directors who do not so work past 1:00 a.m. on such sixth or seventh day worked shall not be deemed to have worked on such day by reason of work between midnight and 1:00 a.m. of that day.
For the purpose of determining an Employee's premium pay for a sixth or seventh day worked, an unworked holiday shall count as a day worked.
The parties confirm that an Employee who works a regular five (5) day studio workweek and who also works on either of the two (2) designated days off in that workweek shall be paid a sixth day worked premium for work on the designated day off. Further, an Employee who works on both designated days off of the workweek shall be paid, for work on the second designated day off, a seventh day worked premium for work on that designated day off.
(b)	Distant Location Workweek: A full "distant location workweek" for weekly Employees shall consist of seven (7) consecutive distant location days, with the seventh day as the regular day off at the "distant location workweek rate" provided in Paragraph 13-101 above. Said distant location workweek rate is computed at seven-fifths (7/5) of the minimum studio workweek rate, and such payment shall include the sixth day in the Employee's workweek worked on distant location. If Employee is instructed and required by Employer to perform work at a distant location on seven (7) days in his/her workweek, under the direction and control of the Employer, then such Employee shall be paid for such seventh day worked an additional one-fifth (1/5) of his or her actual or prorated studio weekly salary, for a total of eightfifths (8/5) of his or her actual or prorated studio weekly salary for a seven (7) day location workweek.
- 195 -
13-112
(c)	In any workweek which consists of a combination of studio and distant location days, or for any work period of less than a week following the guaranteed employment period, each studio day shall be paid for at one-fifth (1/5) of the studio workweek rate plus the production fee; and each location day shall be paid for at one-seventh (1/7) of the distant location workweek rate plus the production fee, as provided herein. In no event shall such a workweek be paid at less than the weekly rate for five (5) studio days or six-fifths (6/5) of the studio rate for six (6) days if worked.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a workweek shift for a weekly Employee that results in a partial workweek either before or after one (1) full week of employment, the Employer may prorate the days worked for weekly Employees as provided above.
(d)	The day of departure for and the day of return from distant location shall be deemed distant location days. However, when an Employee travels home at the end of production or of his/her assignment on the sixth or seventh day of his or her distant location workweek and performs no other work on this day, the travel day shall be paid at one-fifth (1/5) of the studio workweek rate.
(e)	The initial workweek of employment shall begin on a day designated in the Employee's deal memo. If no such day is designated in the deal memo, the initial workweek shall be deemed to begin on Monday.
(f)	Employees shall be advised of any shift in the workweek prior to the commencement of that workweek. In the event that the Employee would receive fewer than two (2) consecutive days off in the workweek as a result of the shift change, the following alternative shall be available: Once during the production of a motion picture, or in the case of episodic television, once between hiatus periods (i.e., between the commencement or resumption of production and a cessation of principal photography for the series for at least one (1) week, the Employer may shift the workweek, without incurring added
13-112
- 196 -
costs, by adding one (1) or two (2) days off consecutive with the sixth and/or seventh days off of the prior workweek and/or by shifting a workweek commencing on Tuesday to a workweek commencing on Monday, provided that the intervening Sunday is a day off.
The parties confirm that the foregoing “shift in workweek” provision applies to a “round trip” switch so that the Employer is permitted to return the workweek to the originally scheduled workweek, without incurring any additional costs (e.g., a Monday-Friday shift which is switched to Tuesday-Saturday can be returned to Monday-Friday without incurring any additional costs.)
Except as provided above, the Employer shall pay the appropriate premium for the sixth and/or seventh day worked in the workweek. In no case may the Employer shift the workweek to avoid paying for an unworked holiday.
(g)	The AMPTP confirms that its existing contracts with the IATSE and SAG provide for premium payments on the sixth and seventh days worked in a workweek as defined herein. If the AMPTP eliminates such premium payments during the life of this Agreement, DGA may notify the AMPTP that it wishes to bargain concerning the workweek. The parties agree to commence negotiations within thirty (30) days thereafter. If no agreement is reached within sixty (60) days after bargaining has commenced, DGA may terminate this Agreement.

(a)	New Year's Day, Presidents' Day (third Monday in February), Good Friday, Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas Day shall be recognized as holidays. If any of the above holidays falls on Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered the holiday. If the holiday falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be considered the holiday except on distant locations not on a five (5) day per week shooting schedule.
- 197 -
13-113
(b)	When such a holiday not worked falls within the weekly or longer guaranteed period of employment, no deduction shall be made from the guaranteed compensation. If such a holiday falls within a full workweek of employment following the guaranteed period of employment, such Employee shall be paid his or her full weekly compensation. When such a holiday occurs within a partial workweek following the guaranteed period of employment: (i) if such Employee works the day before and the day after such holiday in the studio, he or she shall be paid one-fifth (1/5) of his or her actual studio weekly salary plus production fee; (ii) if such Employee works the day before and the day after such holiday on distant location, he or she shall be paid one-seventh (1/7) of his or her actual distant location weekly salary including the production fee.
(c)	For holidays worked, such Employee shall be compensated as follows:
(1)	For each holiday worked in the studio or on local locations, Employee will be paid two hundred percent (200%) of his or her actual gross daily salary (an additional one hundred percent (100%) of his or her actual gross daily salary).
(2)	For each holiday worked on distant location, Employee shall be paid an additional one-fifth (1/5) of his or her actual gross studio weekly salary (same extra payment as seventh day in the Employee's workweek worked on distant location).
(d)	Holidays shall apply against the guaranteed period of employment whether worked or not worked.
(e)	If the Employer in its collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild, Writers Guild, or I.A.T.S.E. hereafter grants any new holiday, the same provision shall be deemed included hereunder.
13-113
- 198 -
(f)	See the provisions of Sideletter 21 of this Agreement for holiday provisions applicable to pilots and new one-hour series.
13-114	Distant Location Days
UPMs and Assistant Directors shall receive, in addition to their current distant location rate, a distant location incidental allowance of $20.00 ($21.00 effective July 1, 2015) per day. The incidental allowance is payable at the same time and in the same manner as the per diem allowance.
13-115	Unworked Holidays - Assistant Directors, UPMs and Associate
Directors
(a)	Daily Employees: Daily UPMs, Assistant Directors and Associate Directors shall receive as compensation for unworked holidays 3.719% of Employee's annual earnings under such schedule. Such compensation shall be payable by check sent to the Employee by April 15 in the calendar year subsequent to the calendar year in which such earnings are accumulated. Pay for unworked holidays which is paid to daily Employees during distant location employment shall be offset against such Employees' annual holiday compensation, computed as above.
(b)	Weekly Employees (excluding Contract Assistants and UPMs): The total amount of salary paid in the period of a calendar year to a weekly Employee hereunder for recognized holidays not worked shall be offset against an amount equal to 3.719% of such Employee's accumulated weekly earnings within the same period. The Employee shall be paid the amount by which such 3.719% computation exceeds the amount of unworked holiday pay such Employee has received for such period.
The foregoing shall be subject to the following provisions:
(1)	The weekly pay of an Employee shall be deemed to mean his or her pay rate specified in the wage scale, plus
- 199 -
13-115
13-116
overscale payment, if any. A day's holiday pay shall be considered as one-fifth (1/5) of his or her weekly rate of pay, plus overscale payment, if any, for studio workweeks and one-seventh (1/7) of such rate of pay for distant location workweeks.
(2)	Vacation pay and completion of assignment pay shall be excluded from the 3.719% computation.
(3)	Additional holiday pay due hereunder shall be payable by check sent to the Employee by April 15 of the year subsequent to the calendar year in which such pay is earned.
(4)	The 3.719% computation shall not be applicable to any Employee hereunder for any calendar year in which he or she is paid for nine (9) recognized holidays.
(5)	It is agreed that as to an Employer producing a motion picture under a separate corporate set-up and not intended to be a continuous producing company, a Freelance Assistant Director, UPM or Associate Director shall receive with his or her closing check, as compensation for unworked holidays, 3.719% of his or her salary as provided in such subparagraph 13-115(b), subject to an offset of any unworked holiday pay such Employee has received for such period.
(6)	If the Employer in the I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement hereafter increases the rate of unworked holiday pay, the same rate increase shall be deemed included hereunder.
Rest Period
Any UPM, Assistant Director, or Associate Director working in conjunction with a shooting unit shall be entitled to a nine (9) hour rest period.
(a)	At the studio and nearby locations, the rest period starts one (1) hour after the company wrap and ends one (1) hour prior to the
13-115
- 200 -
next shooting call of such shooting unit; for the Second Assistant Director, the rest period ends at the earlier of the first make-up call or the general crew call.
At distant locations, the rest period starts one (1) hour after the company wrap plus normal travel time from shooting site to production office and ends one (1) hour prior to the next "company leaving" call of such shooting unit.
(b)	There shall not be deemed to be any invasion of such rest period unless such rest period, as above defined, is less than nine (9) hours. If such rest period is less than nine (9) hours, the UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director working in conjunction with the shooting unit shall be entitled to additional payment based on the following formula:
(1)	If such rest period is more than four and one-half (41/?) hours, he or she shall be entitled to receive one-quarter (%) day's salary for each hour that such rest period is less than nine (9) hours.
(2)	If such rest period is four and one-half (41/?) hours or less, he or she shall be entitled to receive one-quarter (%) day's salary for each hour worked from the end of such invaded rest period until commencement of a full nine (9) hour rest period, as defined above, deducting from such payment only the actual hours of rest given to Employee during the forced call.
(c)	If such shooting unit has more than one UPM or more than one First Assistant Director or more than one Second Assistant Director, then Employer may avoid such additional payment to the additional Employee or Employees in the respective category by specifically dismissing such additional Employee or Employees.

FOR EXAMPLE:
(Assume a studio location and a First Assistant Director)
	Shooting Day 1	Shooting Day 2	Shooting Day 3	Shooting Day 4
Shooting Call	8:00 p.m.	1:00 p.m.	9:00 a.m.	8:00 a.m.
(1 Hr. Prior)		12:00 noon	8:00 a.m.	7:00 a.m.
Company Wrap	3:00 a.m.	3:00 a.m.	8:00 p.m.	
(1 Hr. Later)	4:00 a.m.	4:00 a.m.	9:00 p.m.	
Example A:	Rest period from 4:00 a.m. on Shooting Day 1 until 12:00 noon on Shooting Day 2 = 8 hours; invasion = 1 hour; Invasion Payment: One-quarter (%) day's salary. (Rest period here is more than four and one-half (41/?) hours, but less than nine (9) hours, so apply subparagraph (b)(1) above).
Example B:	Rest period from 4:00 a.m. on Shooting Day 2 until 8:00 a.m. on Shooting Day 3 = 4 hours; invasion payment from 8:00 a.m. on Shooting Day 3 (the end of the rest period) until 9:00 p.m. on Shooting Day 3 (when the next full nine (9) hour rest period commences) = thirteen (13) hours; (i.e., thirteen (13) quarter day's salary). (Rest period here is less than four and one-half (41/?) hours, so apply subparagraph (b)(2) above.)
Example C:	Rest period from 9:00 p.m. on Shooting Day 3 until 7:00 a.m. on Shooting Day 4 = ten (10) hours; no rest period invasion.
(d)	When an employee reports to work at a location which is outside the thirty (30) mile zone in the New York metropolitan area as described in Paragraph 13-117, such location shall be considered a "nearby location" (i.e., a location other than a
13-116
- 202 -
distant location which is outside the thirty (30) mile "report to" zone) for purposes of determining the employee's rest period.
13-117	Work in the New York Metropolitan Area
The following applies to work in the New York metropolitan area only.
Any location within a radius of thirty (30) miles of Columbus Circle (the "thirty (30) mile report to zone"), other than Sandy Hook, New Jersey, shall be a "report to" location without any travel payment requirement.

(c)	Unit Production Managers. A UPM may be assigned to work concurrently on one or more productions, whether theatrical and/or television. A UPM shall be assigned to each feature motion picture and each television program or series except under the following conditions:
(1)	Employer may assign the duties of a UPM on no more than one theatrical motion picture or television program or series of programs at a time to each staff production executive in its employ (regardless of such executive's title) who actually performs the UPM functions, provided that Pension and Health and Welfare contributions are made on behalf of each such staff production executive to the Pension Plan and the Health and Welfare Plan as provided herein. Such contributions shall be based on the actual salary of the UPM for the time that the staff production executive performs the duties of a UPM. Each production executive performing UPM functions must be on the Qualification List, unless such executive was "qualified" under the 1978 Basic Agreement. The Employer shall send the Guild a list of such "qualified" executives.
(2)	When a picture is shooting predominantly in a studio or on a studio ranch with limited cast and sets under such circumstances that the First Assistant can function on the set to assist the Director and still discharge the off-the-set duties without assigning the same to persons not Employees, or when such duties may be performed in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 hereof by other persons who are qualified staff production executives.
(3)	Employer may request from the Guild a waiver regarding the staffing of a UPM in any other instance when such
- 205 -
13-202
staffing does not appear warranted. If the Guild fails to respond to the Employer's request for waiver within five (5) days after receipt by the Guild, the Employer may proceed as though a waiver had been given.
When no UPM is assigned to a production, the functions of a UPM shall be deemed included as part of the work of the First Assistant Director. Such UPM/First Assistant Director shall be paid no less than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the applicable minimum compensation (including production fee when applicable) for a UPM.
When both UPMs and Assistant Directors are employed by an Employer, or when a UPM is occasionally employed on individual productions, the functions of the UPM relate substantially but not entirely to business functions, and those of Assistant Directors relate substantially but not entirely to functions more directly under or with the Director.

Employees in the Armed Services
Recognizing the moral and legal responsibility to the Employees subject to this BA who have entered into the Armed Services, the Employer and the Guild agree that they have a joint responsibility (subject to the then-existing statutes) in the reinstatement of such Employees to the jobs such Employees held prior to their entry into the Armed Services.
13-205	Pay Adjustment for Work in Higher Classifications
(a)	When a UPM or a First or Second Assistant Director is assigned as a Second Unit Director, or as a Director for one (1) complete day or longer, but fewer than five (5) consecutive working days (consisting of shooting days he or she directs and applicable preparation days, as provided in Paragraph 4-102), he or she shall be adjusted to the Director's minimum daily rate for the number of such working days; provided, however, if such Employee is so assigned for five (5) consecutive working days or more, he or she shall be adjusted to the Director's minimum weekly rate.
- 207 -
13-205
(b)	When a Second Assistant Director is assigned (as provided in Article 14) as a First Assistant Director or a UPM, he or she shall be increased during the time he performs in such capacity to not less than the respective daily or weekly rate for First Assistant Directors or UPMs, as the case may be, specified in the Minimum Salary Schedule set forth in Paragraph 13-101, except when relieving the First Assistant or UPM from time to time for periods of less than one day.
(c)	In the event a Second Assistant on a second unit takes the place of a First Assistant who has been elevated (and adjusted for shooting and preparation days as above provided) then, unless there is another First Assistant on the unit, such Second Assistant, in addition to being adjusted to First Assistant rate for the shooting day or days on which he or she performs as a First Assistant, as above provided, shall also be adjusted for one preparation day only, as a First Assistant.
13-206	Notice of Termination12
(a)	An Assistant Director, UPM or Associate Director not personally notified that he or she is being taken off payroll by 4:00 p.m. on any work day (excluding holidays or the sixth or seventh day in the Employee's workweek) shall be considered as having been called to work on the following work day. In any event, such notification shall be given at the earliest time reasonably possible.
(b)	If a UPM, First Assistant Director, Second Assistant Director or Associate Director is taken off payroll prior to the completion of production of any television or theatrical motion picture to which he or she has been assigned, the Employer shall provide the Guild, upon its request, in writing, the reasons for such removal from the Employer's payroll.

- 208 -
(c)	The obligation of the Employer upon entering into an agreement for the employment of a UPM, Assistant Director or Associate Director to furnish employment during "guaranteed" periods of employment shall be wholly satisfied by the payment of the agreed salaries for the applicable minimum period. The provisions of Paragraph 6-105 of this BA shall apply to UPMs, First and Second Assistant Directors and Associate Directors.
(d)	A Unit Production Manager, First Assistant Director or Key Second Assistant Director who is replaced without good cause after completing work on at least: (i) fifty percent (50%) of the episodes in a single television series order, excluding options, of thirteen (13) episodes or more; or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the days of principal photography on a long-form television film ninety (90) minutes or longer or theatrical film, shall be paid three (3) weeks' completion of assignment pay in lieu of any completion of assignment pay required under Paragraphs 13-102, 13-103 and 13-104. In the event that the Employer employs two (2) "alternating" First Assistant Directors on an episodic television series, and replaces such alternating First Assistant Director(s) without good cause, such Employee(s) shall receive the payment provided in this subparagraph (d) if:
(1)	such Employee(s) would have worked on fifty percent (50%) of the episodes in the series order, provided that such order is for at least thirteen (13) episodes, excluding options; and
(2)	such Employee(s) has completed work on fifty percent (50%) of the episodes on which he or she would have worked had he or she not been replaced.
(e)	This subparagraph (e) applies to Assistant Directors and Unit Production Managers who have been employed on a weekly basis on a production or series for at least the three (3) consecutive workweeks prior to replacement. Should it appear necessary to replace such an Employee, the preferred practice is that the Employee be made aware of the reason(s) therefor at least two (2) days in advance. However, the Employee need
- 209 -
13-206
13-207
not be told that replacement is contemplated. If such Employee is replaced, other than for cause, without so being made aware, the Employee shall be entitled to one (1) week plus two (2) additional days of salary in addition to any other payments due under this Agreement, but in no event more than he/she would have received had he/she worked until the completion of the production or the season.
The AMPTP has expressed concerns about potential misuse of this provision. In light of those concerns, the DGA and AMPTP agree that, upon request of the AMPTP, they shall meet to review its operation and to identify problems and issues relating to its implementation. The AMPTP shall advise the Guild of any instances or claims brought by the Guild which the AMPTP believes comprise examples of misuse of the purposes of the provision and the parties will attempt to resolve any disagreement on that subject. After said meeting, the parties shall, at either party's request, meet again to review whether there has been a repetition of the problems identified at the prior meeting or other misuse of this provision. If, after this second meeting, the AMPTP determines on a good faith basis that this provision has been applied in a manner which disregards the purpose thereof as intended by the parties at the time of its negotiation and that further efforts to resolve identified problems would not be productive, then, at any time thereafter, the AMPTP may, upon three (3) months notice, cancel the provisions of this subparagraph (e).
Nothing herein is intended nor shall it be construed to imply any guarantee of employment beyond the minimum period guaranteed in this Basic Agreement.

*	A replacement UPM or First Assistant Director is guaranteed
five (5) days of preparation and a replacement Second Assistant Director is guaranteed two (2) days of preparation for a theatrical motion picture and a television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or longer. The foregoing sentence does not apply if the replacement UPM or Assistant Director was already assigned to the motion picture.
*	* Provided, however, that in the event a television motion picture or mini-series which is shot consecutively has a running time in excess of three (3) hours, then additional preparation time shall be allowed as follows:
(a)	First Assistant Director: Two (2) days of preparation time shall be added for each hour of running time in excess of three (3) hours up to a maximum of ten (10) hours; and if the running time exceeds ten (10) hours, then one (1) day of preparation time shall be added for each hour of running time in excess of ten (10).
(b)	Second Assistant Director: One (1) additional day of preparation for each hour of running time in excess of three (3) hours to a maximum of ten (10) hours of running time.

- 217 -
13-301
Second Assistant Director, as the case may be, on any such film, subject to the provision following the first asterisk above.
13-302	The amount of preparation, if any, granted for second units (except as
provided below and in Paragraph 13-205) or "bridging" of any nature, or for the type of service referred to in Paragraph 4-105, shall be at the Employer's discretion.
A First Assistant Director on a second unit shall receive preparation time when the cast (excluding extras) and crew number twenty (20) or more or whenever stunts are to be performed. The preparation time shall be one (1) day for one (1) or two (2) days of shooting, and two (2) days for three (3) or more days of shooting. However, such First Assistant Director preparation requirement does not apply to any unplanned units, emergencies or when preparation time is not needed because the First Assistant Director assigned to the second unit work has been working on the production in a Guild capacity covered by the terms of this BA.
13-303	Preparation time shall be actually worked except when it is not
possible or in case of an emergency. In each such case, the Guild shall be notified in detail as soon as possible, and an allowance equal to the preparation time provided hereunder shall be paid within one (1) week to the Assistant Director involved. However, in the event two (2) First Assistant Directors and one (1) Second Assistant Director (or their substitutes) are assigned as the regular staff to a television series which is in continuous production, and such First Assistant Directors are assigned on alternate programs, it shall be deemed to be "not possible" for such Second Assistant Director to actually work his or her preparation time, and an allowance equal to the preparation time provided hereunder shall be paid to the Second Assistant Director involved on or before the next regular pay day following the pay week in which it is earned. In the event such Second Assistant Director remains assigned to the same television series and on payroll, without working on any other project during a production hiatus of such television series, such time he or she remains on the payroll during such hiatus shall be deemed preparation time, to the extent of two (2) days per week, or the next succeeding
13-301
- 218 -
programs of such television series up to a maximum of four (4) such programs.
If a Key Second Assistant Director and Second Second Assistant Director or two (2) Key Second Assistant Directors are employed on an episodic television motion picture for at least two (2) days, neither shall receive payment for unworked preparation time.
13-304	When the aggregate of the preparation days ends in a half-day, such
half-days shall be treated as a full day.
13-305	Rehearsal Days
Rehearsal days shall be considered actual shooting days subject to the following:
(a)	In instances when no one other than cast is used, rehearsal days shall be considered preparation, and not shooting days.
(b)	For any rehearsal day that two (2) or more Assistant Directors are employed on a television film, such day shall be considered a preparation day and not a shooting day.
13-306	Order of Assignment
It is understood that the order of assignment of Assistant Directors to photography or preparation shall be in the Employer's discretion.
13-307	Waivers (For Television Films)
It is agreed that the Guild will consider Employer's request for special waivers to modify such above preparation time requirement for Assistant Directors. In such case, Employer shall request such waiver in advance of actual production and give pertinent facts with respect to the nature of the production. The Guild will act promptly upon such requests and, in the event it is found by the parties that the production does not reasonably require such preparation time, a waiver will be granted. Any waiver shall not constitute a precedent
- 219 -
13-307
for other Employers or other television films or series of the same Employer; it being understood that each individual request for such waiver is to be considered on its own merits and particular circumstances.

14-40516	(a)
Employer shall give preference of employment as follows with respect to work in the New York Area on theatrical and television motion pictures covered by this BA and High Budget SVOD Programs as defined in Sideletter No. 35:
(1)	For Second Assistant Directors, to available individuals on the New York Area Second Assistant Directors' Qualification List who have worked at least three hundred fifty (350) days in the production of motion pictures of the type covered hereunder as a Trainee,
16 See Section 24-600 for preference of employment provisions applicable to multicamera prime time dramatic pilots, presentations and series.
- 243 -
14-405
Intern, Second Assistant Director, First Assistant Director, Unit Production Manager or Associate Director.
(2)	For First Assistant Directors, to available individuals on the New York Area First Assistant Directors' Qualification List who meet the qualifications set forth in subparagraph 14-403(a) or (b) and, on multi-camera stage shows, to available individuals on the New York Area Qualifications List for First Assistant Directors who meet the qualifications in subparagraph 14-403(c).
(3)	For Unit Production Managers, to available individuals on the New York Area UPMs' Qualification List who meet the qualifications set forth in Paragraph 14-404.
For the purpose of qualifying for preference of employment under this subparagraph 14-405(a), "motion pictures of the type covered hereunder" shall not include non-dramatic basic cable motion pictures.
(b) On motion pictures covered by the introduction to subparagraph (a) above, if any individual described in the applicable part of subparagraph (a) is available for employment, Employer may employ only an individual on the respective New York Area Qualification List. However, Employer may employ any available individual on the respective Qualification List regardless of that individual's experience, or the availability of individuals on said Qualification List with greater experience. If no individual described in the applicable part of subparagraph (a) is available for employment, then Employer may hire from any source. No individual on the Qualification List will be considered available in the unusual situation in which the job requires fluency in a foreign language or a demonstratively unique skill necessary to protect the safety of cast and crew, provided satisfactory proof thereof is submitted to the Guild, and no individual on the Qualification List is available who has such language fluency or unique skill.
14-405
- 244 -
14-406	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 14-
405 above, it is understood and agreed that in the event there are no available persons who meet the qualifications set forth in subparagraph 14-405(a) on the New York Area Second Assistant Directors' Qualification List to perform the required services of a Second Assistant Director, the next preference in hiring of Second Assistant Directors shall be Trainees under the Program referred to in Paragraph 14-112, if any are available. If no such Trainees are then available for employment as Second Assistant Directors, then Employer may hire Second Assistant Directors from any source. Days so worked by Trainees shall be counted toward fulfillment of their training time only.
14-407	An Employer shall not be required to hire any individual under
Paragraphs 14-405 or 14-406 if doing so would result in the Employer paying any greater amount for travel and living expenses than the Employer would pay if the individual resided in the New York Area.
14-408	If an Employer, with respect to an employment opportunity which
would normally be filled from the New York lists, after interviewing all persons on the New York lists eligible and available for employment in that position, is unaware of a person on said lists who in its sole judgment possesses the particular artistic or other qualifications desired, and wishes to employ a person not on said lists who is not a minority or a woman, said Employer may do so with the written prior permission of the Guild. Prior to requesting the Guild's permission, the Employer shall document the individual's particular qualifications by presenting to the Guild declarations from at least two (2) Directors or Unit Production Managers who have worked with the individual on prior motion pictures, describing his particular qualifications. Since there are very large numbers of highly skilled white males on the New York lists, the Guild's permission will normally be given only if it is convinced that there is no person on said lists with said required artistic or other skills. This Paragraph shall in no way limit the Employer with respect to rights it may have which exist independently of this affirmative action provision.
- 245 -
14-408
14-409	Paragraph 14-408 is adopted in reliance upon the EEOC's Affirmative
Action Guidelines, codified in 29 CFR Part 1608. The Employer and the Guild have conducted a reasonable self-analysis of employment conditions in the occupations covered by this BA. This analysis has indicated that with respect to minorities (defined for purposes of this affirmative action provision only as all persons not properly identified as "white (not Hispanic origin)" on EEO-1 reporting forms) and women, such persons constitute a far lower percentage of individuals qualified to work on the New York Qualification List than do white men. The Employer and the Guild desire to avoid unnecessary restrictions on any protected group's access to the employment opportunities covered by this BA. Based on said statistical analysis, the Employer and the Guild conclude that there is a reasonable basis to take affirmative action. This affirmative action will insure that all groups have access to said employment opportunities. This affirmative action plan is temporary, will be re-examined with each collective bargaining agreement, is not intended to maintain a racial balance, is not intended to require the employment of any particular person or a person of any particular race or national origin or sex for any particular employment opportunity, but is simply designed to create opportunities for persons of all races, national origins and sexes to be considered for employment opportunities, and to eliminate the statistical imbalance referred to above. This plan is voluntarily entered into by the Employer and the Guild. It is under no circumstances designed to require the Employer to hire unqualified persons.
14-410	Employer shall not be required to give preference of employment as
provided in Paragraph 14-405 to Second Assistant Directors employed to manage locations in the New York Area on theatrical and television motion pictures, provided the Employer first gives consideration to individuals on the New York Area Second Assistant Director Qualification List who reside within the New York Area and have experience managing locations.
For purposes of this provision, the Employer shall be deemed to have given ‘consideration’ if it reviews the experience of those individuals identified by the Guild as possessing experience in managing locations in these areas.
14-409
- 246 -
For purposes of this provision, the New York Area shall be defined to include those locations within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of Columbus Circle, which, for purposes of this provision, shall include Suffolk County and the New Jersey shoreline to and including Atlantic City.

However, Employer may employ any available individual on the respective Qualification Lists regardless of that individual's experience, or the availability of individuals on said Qualification List with greater experience.

Paragraph 14-505, in the following situations:

17-101	No Strike, No Lockout Provisions
(a)	The Guild agrees that during the term hereof it will not call or engage in or assist any strike, slow-down or stoppage of work affecting motion picture production against the Employer and, in return, the Employer agrees during the term hereof not to lock out Employees covered by the BA. The Guild agrees that it will use its best efforts in good faith to require its members to perform their services for the Employer, even though other persons or groups of persons may be on strike. The Guild and the Employer mutually agree that during the term of this BA they will endeavor to promote good will, mutual understanding and real cooperation between the Guild and the Employer.
(b)	Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, it shall constitute a material violation of the BA for the Employer to attempt to impose discipline as the result of the refusal of any Employee to cross any primary picket line duly authorized by the Guild. Nothing in this subparagraph (b) shall prevent Employer from replacing any Employee who fails to cross the Guild primary picket line.
(c)	In the event any Employee who is also a member of a collective bargaining organization or union other than the Guild ("union") is requested in writing by Employer to cross a picket line of such union, and the Employee crosses such picket line at the request of the Employer to perform services hereunder, then the Employer shall be deemed to have indemnified and held harmless such Employee from any monetary loss, such as, without limitation, fines or claims arising out of the defense of any disciplinary or court action by the union or its members suffered by such Employee as a result thereof including, but
- 267 -
17-101
not limited to, attorneys' fees and arbitration and court costs. It shall constitute a material violation of this BA for the Employer to attempt to impose discipline because of the Employee's refusal to cross such picket line of such other union absent the specific written request (and indemnity) of Employer.
17-102	Waiver of Liability Re Strike
Upon condition that the member shall promptly, and upon the Employer's demand, comply with the applicable provisions of Paragraph 17-104, and perform as therein provided, such member shall incur no damage liability to the Employer for his or her breach of his or her employment contract resulting from his or her refusal to perform services during such strike pursuant to such strike call.
17-103	Suspension of Services During Strike
If, after the expiration or other termination of the term of this BA, the Guild shall call a strike against any Employer, then the services of persons subject to this BA (herein for convenience referred to as "members") under all then-existing employment contracts with such Employer shall be deemed automatically suspended while such strike is in effect, and at the Employer's option (exercisable promptly after the termination of such strike) with respect to any such member who shall have been assigned or scheduled by the Employer to a picture, the production or commencement of production of which was interrupted or delayed by such a strike, for such additional period, but not exceeding eight (8) weeks, for a theatrical motion picture budgeted over $200,000; six (6) weeks for a theatrical motion picture budgeted at $200,000 or less, or a television film 61 minutes in length; four (4) weeks for a television film 31-60 minutes in length; two (2) weeks for a television film 30 minutes or less in length, as may be required by the Employer for the resumption or commencement of the production of such picture. Any such automatic suspension may be continued for a further period by agreement between the Guild and the Employer. For all purposes of any such employment contract, each member shall be deemed to have refused to render services thereunder during the period of such strike and during any further period of such automatic suspension; and no
17-101
- 268 -
compensation shall accrue or be payable to such member during any such period.
17-104	Employer's Options re Strike
In the event of any such strike, the Employer shall have and may exercise as herein provided all or any one or more of the following further rights and options, and the member shall perform as herein provided:
(a)	As to any motion picture which is in production at the time any such strike is commenced, if the member has a contract to render services in connection with such motion picture, or if he or she is under a contract which permits him or her to be assigned to render services in connection with such motion picture and has been so assigned, he or she will, after the termination of such automatic suspension, and upon the Employer's request, report to the Employer and perform his or her services in connection with such motion picture at the same salary and upon the same terms and conditions as were agreed upon prior to the commencement of said strike, as modified, supplemented or extended by or pursuant to the provisions of Paragraphs 17-103, 17-104 and 17-105.
(b)	At any time during such strike and/or during any further period of such automatic suspension, and/or within thirty (30) days (or within fifteen (15) days in the case of a commitment for one television film only) after the termination thereof, the Employer, by written notice to a member, may extend the term of such member's employment contract, and/or extend the respective period of employment term under such employment contract which was current at the commencement of such strike, and/or postpone the commencement of any subsequent employment period under such employment contract and/or postpone all or any relevant starting days, option exercise dates and/or other dates under such member's employment contract, and/or extend the time within which any date or option is required under such member's employment contract to be designated or exercised by the Employer, and/or terminate the employment of such member under his or her employment
- 269 -
17-104
17-105
contract (and the Employer's obligations thereunder) as to all or any part of such member's services therein provided and which have not theretofore been performed. Any such extension and/or postponement shall, at the Employer's option, be for a period of time equivalent to all or any part of the period of such strike and/or of such automatic suspension. At the request of the Employer, each such member shall promptly execute an agreement in writing with the Employer covering and confirming all extensions and/or postponements (and/or termination) by the Employer pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (b) with respect to such member's employment contract, but it is agreed that the same shall be effective whether or not such agreement be executed.
(c)	After the termination of such strike or of such automatic suspension, each such member requested so to do by the Employer will promptly execute a new employment contract in writing with the Employer on the same terms and conditions, and at the same salary as provided in the employment contract which was in effect at the time the strike commenced, except that such new employment contract shall be for a period or periods, including options, equivalent to the unexpired term of the employment contract which was in effect when such strike was commenced; provided, however, that any such new employment contract shall give effect to and incorporate such of the extensions, postponements and/or other changes referred to in (b) above as the Employer may require.
Exercise of Rights
All or any of the rights or options of the Employer in subparagraphs 17-104(a), (b) and/or (c) (if not theretofore exercised by the Employer), may be exercised by the Employer within a reasonable time after the end of the strike or of the automatic suspension hereinabove provided for. Each and all of the provisions of Paragraphs 17-103 and 17-104 (including but not limited to, the provisions of subparagraphs 17-104(a), (b) and (c)), and the Employer's rights thereunder, shall be construed as cumulative, and no one of them as exclusive of any other.

Statute of Limitations
The statute of limitations as a defense to any action by the Employer against the member for his or her failure or refusal to render services during such strike is extended by a period equivalent to the duration of such strike plus any further period of the automatic suspension hereinabove provided for. If the member asserts any claim or defense by reason of the expiration of time during which he can be required to perform services by virtue of any statute (such as the 7-year statute), which claim or defense is based in whole or in part on the lapse of time during such strike or such automatic suspension, such waiver of liability by the Employer is ineffective thereupon, and the statute of limitations as to the Employer's rights is waived by the member automatically.
17-107
Right to Sue
The automatic suspension provisions of Paragraph 17-103 shall not affect the Employer's rights to sue and recover judgment against any member for a breach of contract resulting from his or her failure or refusal to render services to the Employer during such strike, or during the period of such automatic suspension, or the Employer's right to exercise any other right or remedy with respect to any such failure or refusal, unless such member shall have complied with his or her obligations under the provisions of Paragraph 17-104. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, nothing herein contained shall be construed to change, affect, limit or suspend any of the provisions of any such employment contract or deprive the Employer of any rights or remedies of the Employer thereunder or at law or in equity.

- 271 -
17-108
respect to any such provisions shall constitute a breach by such member of his or her employment contract.
17-109	Guild's Obligation
The Guild agrees that it will take such affirmative action as may be necessary and lawful in order to require its members to perform and comply with the provisions of Paragraphs 17-102 through 17-109 and their respective obligations hereunder and in connection therewith.

17-116	Guild Will Issue Waivers and Act Promptly Thereon
(a)	Whenever any Employer is entitled hereunder to a waiver from the Guild, the Guild agrees to issue the same without cost or conditions and to act promptly upon the request for such

17-116
waiver, and in the event that the Guild fails so to do, the Employer may proceed as though a waiver had been given.
(b)	The Guild agrees to waive the preparation time guaranteed hereunder in case of emergency, it being understood that the necessity of change, substitution or partial substitution of the Director, or the Assistant Director, as the case may be, when the Employer is incurring substantial expense for the salary of cast actually assigned to the picture involved, or when photography has started or when such substantial expense will be incurred within the period prescribed for preparation time, shall be deemed an emergency and the Director or the Assistant Director, as the case may be, must in such case waive preparation time. In such event, the Guild shall be notified as soon as practicable. Under any other circumstances, the Director or the Assistant Director, as the case may be, may waive preparation time only after the Guild has in writing consented to such waiver.

17-116
- 274 -
(a)	this Paragraph 17-118 shall not apply in any instance in which such injury, loss or damage is the result of or caused by, in whole or in part, the negligence or willful misconduct of such Employee (except that in the case of such negligence the Employer will provide such Employee involved with legal defense);
(b)	immediately upon such Employee, or his or her representative, being informed of any claim or litigation, he or she shall notify the Employer thereof and deliver to the Employer every demand, notice, summons, complaint or other process received by him or her or his or her representative; and

(e)	The Employer shall obtain and keep in force during the term of employment of any Employee a policy of comprehensive public liability insurance insuring the Employee against any liability arising out of the performance by the Employee in the course and scope of his/her employment under this BA under the direction and control of the Employer. Such insurance shall be in the amount of not less than $1,000,000 for injury to or death of one person in any one accident or occurrence and in an amount not less than $2,000,000 for injury to or death of more than one person in any one accident or occurrence.

Proof of Performance
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Guild from, at any time, requiring from the Employer a reasonable proof of ability to perform, the depositing of reasonable sums with the Guild, or the posting of a bond if the Guild deems this advisable. This may be required before a member's services commence, or during the performance of such services.
In addition, except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the Guild and the AMPTP, the Guild, prior to commencement of principal photography of a motion picture on which one (1) or more Employees covered by the Basic Agreement are employed, may require that the Employer provide the Guild with a security interest in the motion picture and those rights necessary for the distribution of said picture for the purpose of securing Residuals, as that term is used in Article 22 of this Agreement, which are or may become due with respect to said motion picture. Before foreclosing on any security interest, the Guild shall notify the Employer and Distributor of the default and advise the Employer of its right to cure same within thirty (30) days.
17-120	UPMs' and Assistant Directors' Residuals
If Employer enters into any collective bargaining agreement with any union or guild other than Directors, Actors, Writers, Producers or Musicians which provides for additional compensation for reruns on free television, or if Employer enters into any collective bargaining agreement with any union or guild other than Directors, Actors, Writers, Producers, Composers and Lyricists, or Musicians which provides for additional compensation to individuals for theatrical exhibition of television motion pictures, then in such event, such provisions, at the written option of the Guild, may be made applicable to UPMs and Assistant Directors on a commensurate basis to be determined by the parties.
17-119
- 276 -
17-121	Delay in Payment or Default
An Employee shall be paid his or her salary on Thursday for services rendered in the preceding week.
If Employer fails to pay initial compensation when due under the BA, interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall accrue for a thirty (30) day period after payment is due. Thereafter, if the Guild provides written notice of delinquency and Employer fails to remit payment, interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum shall accrue until payment is made. If written notice is not given, no further late payment charges shall accrue.
If the Employer has failed to make such payment because the executed contract was not delivered by the Employee to the Employer, or because of a bona fide dispute as to the amount due, then no such interest is due. If the contract is not so delivered by the Employee because of a dispute as to the terms of the contract and the Employer shall be held to be wrong, or if the bona fide dispute is resolved in favor of the Employee, the foregoing interest payments shall be applicable.
17-122	Guild Access to Premises
During hours when an Employee is working, Employer shall admit officially designated representatives of the Guild to its preproduction, production and post-production facilities for the purpose of transacting any business relative to this BA or the personal service agreement or deal memo of any Employee.

In consideration of the fact that Employees employed under this Agreement are entitled to contributions for pension and health plan coverage, vacation pay, and premium pay, including for work on holidays and on Employees’ sixth or seventh day of work in a workweek, the DGA expressly waives the application of the New York City Earned Sick Time Act of 2013 to all Employees employed under this Agreement.
Section 17-200 SCOPE AND INTENT OF THIS BA
17-201	Geographical Application of this BA
The provisions of this BA shall apply to work on motion pictures based in the United States and performed in the United States (including its territories and dependencies) and Canada; provided, however, that the provisions of this BA shall also apply to work performed by any Employee employed by the Employer in the United States, to direct, or to be a UPM or an Assistant Director or Associate Director on a motion picture based outside the United States (including its territories and dependencies). If the Director is so employed in the United States, as defined, for photographing of principal photography on a motion picture produced by Employer, then a First Assistant Director shall also be sent. However, no such First Assistant Director need be sent to any foreign production where an applicable foreign labor restriction, quota or law prohibits such an assignment or when such assignment would result in a loss of a foreign production subsidy. The Employer shall give the Guild prompt written notice when a First Assistant Director cannot be taken due to any of the foregoing conditions.
17-124
- 278 -
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employee whose services are utilized is a permanent resident of the United States but is temporarily resident abroad and the negotiations are carried out in the United States by the Employee's attorney, agent or other representative (including the Guild) in the United States, such agreement for the services of the Employee shall be within the scope and coverage of this BA. The foregoing test of coverage shall be met as long as the representative, agent or attorney of the Director is in the United States when the agreement is negotiated even if it is negotiated by telephone with, or mailed or cabled to a representative of the Employer who is not within the United States during all or any part of said negotiation. Any Employee who is transported from the United States for purposes of employment outside the United States is also covered by this BA.
17-202	BA to be Interpreted in Accordance with Law
In the event that any of the terms or conditions of this BA shall be contrary to law or unenforceable by reason of any law or governmental decision, ruling or regulation, performance thereof may not be enforced hereunder, and such terms or conditions shall be deemed to be severable, and the illegality or unenforceability thereof shall not in any manner affect or impair any other terms or conditions of this BA.
17-203	BA Binding on Whom
(a)	This BA, consistent with and subject to the provisions of Paragraph 17-201 above, shall be binding upon the Employer signatory hereto and upon its subsidiaries engaged in the production of theatrical motion pictures and television motion pictures produced anywhere in the world, in which subsidiaries Employer has a fifty percent (50%) or more financial interest, and upon all parties who by reason of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, sale, assignment or the like shall succeed to or become entitled to a substantial part of the business of the Employer. However, if with respect to a motion picture produced by an independent producer (whether or not such producer is a signatory to the BA) under a contract with Employer for the financing, production and distribution of such motion picture, Employer fails to give the Guild notice within
- 279 -
17-203
ten (10) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, after the opening of the production account for such motion picture that such motion picture is not to be covered by this BA, then and in such event, Employer shall be obligated hereunder with respect thereto.
(b)	With respect to any "loan-out" of a Director by Employer or any borrowing of a Director by Employer from a domestic company which is not a signatory to this BA, the Employer shall, promptly after entering into a commitment agreement for such borrowing or loaning of such Director's services, give the Guild written notice of such arrangement and the name of the lending or borrowing company, as the case may be.
Borrowing an Employee's services through a loan-out company will not in any manner deprive the Employee of any benefits of this BA to which the Employee would have been entitled had he or she been employed directly by the Employer; provided that the Employer (as distinguished from the loan-out company) shall be responsible for such benefits only to the extent that they are within the control of the Employer. Such benefits to which the Employee is entitled from the Employer shall include but not be limited to credits, compensation for television licensing of theatrical motion pictures, residuals with respect to television motion pictures, completion of assignment pay, unworked holiday pay, vacation pay and aircraft flight or underwater work allowances.
(c)	When formal negotiations, following a commitment for employment, are conducted in the United States under the auspices of Employer for the employment of an Employee by a non-signatory producer, then Employer shall notify the Guild of such negotiations as soon as such negotiations come to the knowledge of the Employer's studio Executive Producer in Hollywood.
(d)	The Employer agrees not to do indirectly that which it cannot do directly hereunder. For example, the Employer signator will be bound hereunder in connection with a motion picture produced abroad by a non-signator when the Director is
17-203
- 280 -
employed in the United States by the non-signator and the Employer signator has a fifty percent (50%) or more financial interest in such motion picture. This provision shall apply regardless of whether the production financing is direct, or in advance of commencement of production of the motion picture by way of either a guarantee or by way of a negative pick-up.
(e)	There can be no loan-out of a Guild member to a non-signator company unless the lending signator remains responsible for the borrowing company's compliance with all the terms of the BA including the required staffing of Guild Assistant Directors.
With respect to compensation, and other payments which may be due under this BA, the Employer shall pay the loan-out company or the Employee at least minimum, but is not responsible for payment by the loan-out company to the Employee.
With respect to grievance and arbitration, claims by the loan-out company against the Employer for unpaid compensation for services under the loan-out agreement shall be subject to grievance and arbitration to the same extent as though the transaction had been an employment contract.
The term "loan-out company," for the purpose of this BA, means a company which is controlled by the Employee.
In the event the Employer borrows an Employee whose employment (had he or she been employed directly by the Employer) would have been covered by this BA, whether from a domestic or foreign company, the Employer shall, within ten (10) days after the deal is agreed upon covering the loan-out transaction, give written notice to the Guild thereof including the name of the lending company.
(f)	However, the above provisions shall not be effective to the extent that they are limited or prohibited by any applicable foreign labor restriction, quotas or laws, and no provision herein shall apply if it would result in the loss of a foreign production subsidy.
- 281 -
17-203
(g)	This provision shall not apply to foreign films which are designed primarily for release in foreign countries.
17-204	Subcontracting
Employer agrees that it will not directly or indirectly avoid its obligations hereunder by subcontracting work to third parties which would be performed by Employees if done directly for Employer. This provision shall not be construed in any way as constituting an unlawful prohibition on the right of Employer to contract. To the extent of any inconsistency between the terms hereof and any applicable law, the terms of such law shall control.
17-205	Change of Name by Employer
If the signatory Employer changes its name or conducts its business by an entity other than that by which this BA has been executed, written notice thereof shall be promptly given to the Guild.
17-206	This BA Never to Be Interpreted as a "Closed Shop" Agreement
It is understood that the provisions of Article 1 shall never, under any circumstances, be so construed during the term of this BA as to constitute or permit what is known as a "Closed Shop," or construed in any manner that will at any time deprive the Employer of its right to employ or continue the employment of an Employee who is not a member of the Guild in good standing, or who does not become a member of the Guild in good standing within the period prescribed in Section 1-400, if the Employer has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to such Employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other like members of the Guild, or if the Employer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the Guild was denied, deferred, suspended or terminated for reasons other than the failure of such person to tender the applicable periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition for acquiring or retaining membership in the Guild.
17-203
- 282 -
17-207
17-208
17-209
Intent to Prevent Breach of Individual Contracts
It is agreed that it is the intent of the Employer and of the Guild that nothing in this BA shall be construed so as to give the Employer or any individual Employee the right to terminate or the right to refuse to perform pursuant to any individual contract, or the right to claim a breach of any individual contract of employment by reason of any breach of any provision of this BA.
It is also the intent of this BA that failure to pay dues or other breach by a Guild member of his or her obligations to the Guild shall not give such member any defense to the Employer's right to enforce the terms of any contract of employment existing with such Guild member, provided this shall not affect the Guild's rights under Paragraph 1-505.
Working Conditions Used in Interpretation
It is understood that the actual working conditions of Employer are to be considered in any interpretation of this BA, and that it is an element of good faith of and a part of the consideration of this BA that Employer will not make a general rearrangement of duties or change classification of employment for the purpose of defeating the purpose and intent of this BA.
Guild's Right to Discipline Members
Subject to the limitations hereinabove in Paragraph 1-504 set forth, nothing shall be so construed as to prohibit the Guild from disciplining its members under rules and regulations to be established by it, but the imposition by the Guild of such discipline shall not deprive the Employer of any rights under this BA, or under any personal service contract between the Employer and an Employee, the terms of which do not contravene any of the provisions of this BA.
- 283 -
17-209
17-210	Guild's Right to Accept Members Under its By-Laws
Nothing in this BA shall be interpreted or construed to prevent the Guild from granting membership in the Guild to any person who qualifies for membership under the By-Laws of the Guild.
17-211	Assumed Obligations
Employer shall not be responsible for breach by a third party of obligations assumed by such third parties under provisions hereof except as otherwise herein provided.
17-212	Exclusions
Cartoons and newsreels are not to be included in this BA. This BA shall also not be applicable to films made by Employer for its own or industry, non-commercial promotional uses; provided, however, that no such film referred to in this sentence may be exhibited on television or exhibited anywhere for payment.
17-213	Notices, How Given
Whenever Employer is to be notified, it will be deemed sufficient for the notice to be sent to Employer at its current address, or if such address is not known, in care of the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, Inc., 15301 Ventura Boulevard, Building E, Sherman Oaks, California 91403-5885. Notice to the Guild or any member thereof will be deemed sufficient if sent to the Directors Guild of America, Inc., 7920 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90046.
17-214	Application
Subject to the provisions of Articles 1 and 20 of this BA, the terms and conditions of this BA apply to theatrical and free television motion pictures except that when an Article, Section, Paragraph or particular provision indicates that it specifically applies either for "theatrical motion pictures," on the one hand, or for "television motion pictures," on the other hand, then such Article, Section,
17-210
- 284 -
Paragraph or provision which specifies theatrical motion pictures shall apply only to "theatrical motion pictures," or which specifies television motion pictures shall apply only to "free television motion pictures."
17-215	Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund
Upon the written authorization of the Employee, the Employer will deduct from such Employee's salary and pay to the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund the authorized contribution.

17-303	Terms Used

Section 17-400 RESIDUALS AUDITS
With regard to audits conducted by the Guild, sometimes in conjunction with other labor organizations, the Employer shall provide access to its books and records which pertain to its obligation under the BA to pay residuals. Such documents shall be made available for the audit at the Employer's business offices or other place or places where such records are customarily kept.
In connection with such an audit, the Employer shall be deemed to have asserted that license agreements or other business records contain highly sensitive, competitive, confidential and proprietary information. Without the Guild conceding that such assertions are necessarily appropriate in all instances, the Guild and the Companies agree as follows:
Prior to the date of audit entry, the Guild will designate its employees, officers, directors or agents (hereinafter "representatives") to act as liaisons with the auditors and provide the representatives' names and positions to the Employer.
17-301
- 286 -
The Guild's representatives will be persons with a "need-to-know" audit-related information.
The Guild also will agree on its own behalf, and will obtain from its auditors and other representatives their agreement, not to divulge information from such license agreements or other business records, or copies of them, to persons other than Guild representatives except: (a) to review, investigate or enforce claims against the audited Employer arising under the BA or applicable law, (b) pursuant to legal process, or (c) after obtaining the Employer's consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Any notes taken and/or work papers prepared by the auditors also shall be subject to these provisions; however, the Guild may assert a claim of privilege as to such notes and/or work papers.
Employees and representatives of the Guild may in their discretion discuss the audit findings, including the Employer's position, if known, with Guild-represented Employees. By doing so, the Guild would not be violating a duty of confidentiality, if any, owed to the Employer so long as the Guild's communications are related to its obligation to review, investigate or enforce claims against the audited Employer arising under the BA or applicable law, pursuant to legal process, or after obtaining the Employer's consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
If the Guild is required by legal process to disclose information obtained in a residuals audit, the Guild shall provide prompt written notice to the Employer to object or to seek an appropriate protective order.
At the election of the Employer, the auditors and other Guild representatives shall be required to sign an agreement duplicating the confidentiality provisions in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 17-400, but without any modifications to these provisions unless consented to by the Guild.
In consideration of the foregoing agreements in this Section 17-400, the Employer agrees not to require the Guild or its auditors or representatives to execute any other agreement relating to confidentiality as a condition of granting access to its business records.
The foregoing provisions of this Section 17-400 shall not apply to residuals audits conducted by the Guild for which (a) the date of audit entry is prior to July 1, 1996, and (b) there is a written confidentiality agreement executed by the Employer, the Guild and/or its auditors.

ARTICLE 18
Supplemental Markets - Theatrical and Free Television Motion Pictures
18-101	Motion Pictures Covered
The provisions of this Article 18 relate and apply only to theatrical and free television motion pictures which are:
(a)	produced by the Employer or within the provisions of Paragraph 18-110;
(b)	the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 2014, which motion pictures are, either during the term hereof or at any time thereafter, released in supplemental markets (as defined below); and
(c)	produced by Employer with Directors, UPMs and First and Key Second Assistant Directors employed by Employer under the terms of this BA or in the employ of the actual Producer as described in Paragraph 18-110 (to which employment the provisions of the Paragraph apply).
Such a motion picture is sometimes herein called "Such Picture."
18-102	Definitions
The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this BA, means only: The exhibition of motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 18-102) or pay television as those terms are hereafter defined in this Paragraph 18-102 and the exhibition of television motion pictures on any commercial carrier such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses (referred to herein as "in-flight").
(a)	Cassettes: For the purposes of this Article 18, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now
- 289 -
18-102
known or hereafter devised, containing a motion picture (recorded on film, discs, tapes or other material) and designed for replay through a television receiver or comparable device. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit use such as in hotel rooms constitutes "Supplemental Markets."
(b)	Pay Television: The term "pay television," as used in this Article, shall mean exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of a telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite to home or CATV when a majority of licensed systems meet the following tests:
(1)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a substantial charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(2)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(3)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a substantial charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
The term "pay television," as used in this Article 18, shall also include the exhibition of motion pictures through a television receiver or comparable device by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the individual viewer or by the hotel,
18-102
- 290 -
motel, hospital or other accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in theatres or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered pay television.
The term "Supplemental Markets" does not include the exhibition of a motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station in free television, or in theatrical exhibition (and, for this purpose, "theatrical exhibition" includes what has previously been considered to be the educational market), the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier (referred to herein as "in flight") such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures. Wherever reference is made in this Article 18 to pay television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the subscriber (which may be a hotel, motel or other accommodation) for the program viewed, or where the subscriber or viewer has the option, for a payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels. Subject to Paragraph 11-108, the exhibition of motion pictures made for theatrical or free television exhibition on "basic cable" is considered free television exhibition as distinguished from "Supplemental Markets" exhibition.
With respect to theatrical motion pictures, the Employer has agreed to the inclusion of pay television in the "Supplemental Markets" because under the present pattern of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, pay television is supplemental to the primary market. The Employer reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that pay television is no longer a "Supplemental Market" but constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and that therefore no additional payment pursuant to this Article should be made with respect to the release of theatrical motion pictures (including those covered by this BA) in said markets. The Guild reserves the
- 291 -
18-102
right to contend in future negotiations that the method of employment and payment provided for in this BA is applicable and appropriate to employment directly for motion pictures intended primarily for release on pay television or cassettes, and that the provisions of this BA with respect to all kinds of "Supplemental Markets," whether they are or have become primary markets or not, shall be improved for the benefit of Employees hereunder for said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subjects.
18-103	Supplemental Market Distribution Other Than By Cassettes
The following provisions of this Paragraph 18-103 apply to the distribution of any "Such Picture" in "Supplemental Markets" other than by means of cassettes as defined in subparagraph 18-102(a):
(a)	Percentage Payment: Employer shall pay additional compensation of one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of the Employer's accountable receipts from the distribution of Such Picture. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph (a) below for multi-camera prime time dramatic series, such payment is to be divided as follows: one-half (A) of such amount to be paid to the Director; one-third (a) of such amount to be paid to the Directors Guild of America -Producer Pension Plan (herein referred to as the "Pension Plan"); and a pro rata share of one-sixth (1/6) of such amount to be paid to the UPM, the First Assistant Director and the Key Second Assistant Director employed on such motion picture (such portion of such one-sixth (1/6) pro rata share to be based upon their respective minimum schedule wage rate hereunder).
For multi-camera prime time dramatic series for which a line cut is regularly recorded, such payment is to be divided as follows: one-half (A) of such amount to be paid to the Director; one-third (a) of such amount to be paid to the Pension Plan; and a pro rata share of one-sixth (1/6) of such amount to be to be divided as follows: twenty-eight percent (28%) to the UPM, twenty-seven percent (27%) to the First Assistant Director, nineteen percent (19%) to the Key Second Assistant Director, and twenty-six percent (26%) to the
18-102
- 292 -
Associate Director. The parties shall cooperate in identifying the title of any series for which a line cut is regularly recorded at the beginning of each season.
For all other multi-camera prime time dramatic series (other than an episode of a multi-camera prime time dramatic series covered by the following paragraph), such payment is to be divided as follows: one-half (^) of such amount to be paid to the Director; one-third (a) of such amount to be paid to the Pension Plan; and a pro rata share of one-sixth (1/6) of such amount to be divided as follows: thirty-one percent (31%) to the UPM, twenty-nine percent (29%) to the First Assistant Director, twenty percent (20%) to the Key Second Assistant Director, and twenty percent (20%) to the Associate Director.
The parties agree to form a committee immediately following the conclusion of negotiations for the 2011 Basic Agreement to discuss the allocation of Supplemental Markets payments among the Unit Production Manager, Assistant Directors and Associate Director in the event that a line cut is recorded for an episode of a dramatic series for which a line cut is not regularly recorded and the principal photography of such episode commences on or after July 1, 2011.
If more than one Director, UPM, First Assistant Director, Key Second Assistant Director or Associate Director renders services in connection with Such Picture, the allocations of their respective portion of the pro rata shares shall be determined by the Guild and the Employees shall be bound by such determination.
(b)	Definition of "Employer's Gross"
The term "Employer's gross," as used herein, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of Such Picture (who may be the Employer or a distributor licensed by the Employer) from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture in Supplemental Markets other than by means of cassettes; provided, however, that in the case of any Such Picture which is produced outside of the United States, if Such
- 293 -
18-103
Picture is subject to this BA and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of Such Picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in Employer's gross except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Employer or to the distributor of Such Picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the distributor of Such Picture does not distribute Such Picture directly in Supplemental Markets, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute Such Picture, then the "Employer's gross" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture in Supplemental Markets. In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights, for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Employer's gross." If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Employer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Employer's gross." In reaching this determination, Employer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he or she shall determine the fair and reasonable
18-103
- 294 -
amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Employer shall likewise allocate to each Such Picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Market rights; and if the Guild contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each Such Picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only supplemental markets distribution rights in a single Such Picture shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Employer to the Guild as having been received by the Employer on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Employer on such outright sale.
The "Employer's gross" shall not include sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Employer, but there shall not be excluded from Employer's gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Employer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
(c)	Definition of "Accountable Receipts"
The term "accountable receipts," as used herein, means one hundred percent (100%) of the "Employer's gross."
(d)	Employer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only after Employer's gross is received by Employer, but as to foreign receipts such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States, and until such time no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in Employer's gross. Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of
- 295 -
18-103
quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided. Upon request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country, the Employer will transfer to the Pension Plan and to any Director, UPM, First or Second Assistant Director, in the currency of such foreign country, its or his or her share, if any, of frozen foreign receipts in such country, provided the recipient will bear any costs involved; and such transfer shall be deemed to be payment of an equivalent number of U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category as determined by the Employer. Concurrently with such transfer, the recipient will pay to the Employer in U.S. dollars the total amount the Employer is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Employer utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets by conversion thereof to properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Employer shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign receipts from Supplemental Markets shall be deemed to be released on a "first-in, first-out basis," unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between Such Picture and other motion pictures distributed by the distributor in Supplemental Markets in the same ratio that receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country bear to the total receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture and all other motion pictures in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in accountable receipts. Employer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of
18-103
- 296 -
foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Employer. The Guild, the Pension Plan and the Employees shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Employer or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Employer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Employer. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Employer's gross until earned, but when the Employer is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the Employer's gross.
(e)	Allocation of License or Sales Fee
If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to Such Picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Employer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Employer's gross hereunder.
18-104	Supplemental Market Distribution on Cassettes
The following provisions of this Paragraph 18-104 apply to the distribution in Supplemental Markets of any Such Picture by means of cassettes as defined in subparagraph 18-102(a):
(a)	Percentage Payment
Employer shall pay additional compensation of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) of the "Employer's gross," as defined below, until the Employer's gross equals one million dollars ($1,000,000). Thereafter, Employer shall pay one and eighttenths percent (1.8%) of "Employer's gross" in excess of $1,000,000. Except as provided in subparagraph (4) below for multi-camera prime time dramatic series, such percentage payments are to be divided as follows:
- 297 -
18-104
(1)	Until the Employer's gross equals $1,000,000, 1% thereof shall be paid to the Director, 0.3% thereof shall be paid to the Pension Plan and 0.2% thereof shall be paid to the UPM, the First Assistant Director and the Key Second Assistant Director.
(2)	After the Employer's gross exceeds $1,000,000, 1.2% thereof shall be paid to the Director, 0.36% thereof shall be paid to the Pension Plan and 0.24% thereof shall be paid to the UPM, the First Assistant Director and the Key Second Assistant Director.
(3)	The portion of the 1.5% and 1.8% percentage payment due the UPM, First Assistant Director and Key Second Assistant Director shall be divided among them in pro rata shares based upon their respective minimum wage rate hereunder.
(4)	For multi-camera prime time dramatic series for which a line cut is regularly recorded, the portion of the 1.5% and 1.8% percentage payment due the UPM, First Assistant Director, Key Second Assistant Director and Associate Director shall be divided among them as follows: twenty-eight percent (28%) to the UPM, twenty-seven percent (27%) to the First Assistant Director, nineteen percent (19%) to the Key Second Assistant Director, and twenty-six percent (26%) to the Associate Director. The parties shall cooperate in identifying the title of any series for which a line cut is regularly recorded at the beginning of each season.
For all other multi-camera prime time dramatic series (other than an episode of a multi-camera prime time dramatic series covered by the following paragraph), the portion of the 1.5% and 1.8% percentage payment due the UPM, First Assistant Director, Key Second Assistant Director and Associate Director shall be divided among them as follows: thirty-one percent (31%) to the UPM, twenty-nine percent (29%) to the First Assistant Director, twenty percent (20%) to the Key Second
18-104
- 298 -
Assistant Director, and twenty percent (20%) to the Associate Director.
The parties agree to form a committee immediately following the conclusion of negotiations for the 2011 Basic Agreement to discuss the allocation of Supplemental Markets payments among the Unit Production Manager, Assistant Directors and Associate Director in the event that a line cut is recorded for an episode of a dramatic series for which a line cut is not regularly recorded and the principal photography of such episode commences on or after July 1, 2011.
If more than one Director, UPM, First Assistant Director, Key Second Assistant Director or Associate Director renders services in connection with Such Picture as provided above, the allocations of their respective portion of the pro rata shares shall be determined by the Guild and the Employees shall be bound by such determination.
(b)	Definition of Employer's Gross
If the Employer is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Employer, the "Employer's gross" derived from the distribution of Such Picture by "cassettes" shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be "Employer's gross." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration, and in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
Such worldwide wholesale receipts shall not include:
(1)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and in this connection the Employer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
- 299 -
18-104
(2)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Employer, but there shall not be excluded from Employer's gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Employer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;
(3)	In the case of any Such Picture which is produced outside of the United States, if Such Picture is subject to this BA and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of Such Picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Employer or to the distributor of Such Picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the Distributor is not the Employer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Employer, the "Employer's gross" shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Employer from licensing the right to distribute Such Picture by cassettes.
(c)	Employer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only after Employer's gross is received by Employer, but as to foreign receipts such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States, and until such time no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in Employer's gross. Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of
18-104
- 300 -
quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided. Upon request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country, the Employer will transfer to the Pension Plan and to any Director, UPM, First or Second Assistant Director, in the currency of such foreign country, its or his or her share, if any, of frozen foreign receipts in such country, provided the recipient will bear any costs involved; and such transfer shall be deemed to be payment of an equivalent number of U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category as determined by the Employer. Concurrently with such transfer, the recipient will pay to the Employer in U.S. dollars the total amount the Employer is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Employer utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets by conversion thereof to properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Employer shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign receipts from Supplemental Markets shall be deemed to be released on a "first-in, first-out basis," unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between Such Picture and other motion pictures distributed by the distributor in Supplemental Markets in the same ratio that receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country bear to the total receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture and all other motion pictures in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in Employer's gross.
Employer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of
- 301 -
18-104
foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Employer. The Guild, the Pension Plan and the Employees shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Employer or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Employer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Employer. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Employer's gross until earned, but when the Employer is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the Employer's gross.
(d)	Allocation of License or Sales Fee
If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to Such Picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Employer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Employer's gross hereunder.
18-105	Participating Employees
If there is at least one (1) participating Employee (listed in subparagraph 18-101(c)) subject to the BA who performs services in connection with Such Picture, the Employer shall pay the full amount of the percentage payment. If there is more than one participating Employee in any of the job categories, the Guild shall determine the allocation of such payment among such participating Employees, provided that the Director(s), Unit Production Manager(s), First Assistant Director(s) or Key Second Assistant Director(s) subject to this BA shall receive no less than their share as set forth in subparagraphs 18-103(a) and 18-104(a).
If there are no participating Employees assigned to Such Picture in a job category, the share of the percentage payment allocable to that job category shall be paid to the Directors Guild of America - Producer Health Plan. (This share will be paid directly to the Health Plan, but
18-104
- 302 -
any report to the Guild under Paragraph 18-106 shall disclose the amount so paid to the Health Plan.)
If any Employee's services for Such Picture are performed for the Employer on a loan-out basis, then for the purposes of this Article 18, the Employer shall be deemed to be the employer, and the lender shall not have any responsibility hereunder with respect to Such Picture.
18-106	Reports and Manner of Payment
(a)	Within a reasonable time after the expiration of each calendar or fiscal quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) days, Employer will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Guild a written report showing the Employer's gross during the preceding quarter from the distribution of each Such Picture by Employer in Supplemental Markets with respect to which Employer is required to make payments hereunder (whether distributed by the Employer or through another distributor).
Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report, the Employer will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of the Pension Plan and the Employees (as the case may be) entitled thereto, and shall be delivered to the Guild for forwarding to the Pension Plan and such Employees; and compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the Pension Plan and such Employees.
(b)	A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "Employer's gross" when Such Picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable."
(1)	Such Picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(i)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
- 303 -
18-106
(ii)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
(2)	Such Picture is "identifiable" when the Employer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(3)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(i)	the advance is for one motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(ii)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Employer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in Employer's gross for that quarter. The Employer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "Employer's gross," which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If Such Picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Employer does not provide the Guild with the information required by the BA and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in "Employer's gross" no later than six (6) months after the Employer receives it.
18-106
- 304 -
An advance received by an Employer's parent, subsidiary of any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Employer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Employer.
(c)	No such payment need be made to the Pension Plan or to any individual participating Employee, until the amount due to the Pension Plan or to the respective individual has accumulated to an amount equal to or more than fifty dollars ($50) for such Pension Plan or such respective individual. At the end of any calendar or fiscal year, however, any amounts due shall be paid to the Pension Plan and any participating Employee.
The foregoing paragraph shall apply to any prior Basic Agreement binding upon the Employer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Article 18.
(d)	No such reports need be furnished with respect to any period during which there was no such Employer's gross. The Employer shall make available for inspection by the Guild all distributor's statements and exhibitor's statements which are available to the Employer insofar as they relate to such Employer's gross, and all the financial terms of contracts pertaining to such Employer's gross, and the Guild shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of the Employer as to such Employer's gross pertaining to such distribution of any Such Picture, at whatever place or places such records are customarily kept by the Employer. If the Guild requests that it be informed of the license fee paid under a license for the exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, or if the Guild requests that it be sent an extract of the financial terms of such a license, and if such information is not extensive in nature, the Employer will forward such information or extract without making it necessary for the Guild to send a representative to the offices of the Employer. In general, the Employer will cooperate in furnishing such information to the Guild by mail or telephone, when doing so is not unreasonable or burdensome. If more than one (1) picture is licensed in a single license agreement, the Employer shall
- 305 -
18-106
inform the Guild, at its request, of the identity of the pictures covered by the license, and shall make available for inspection by the Guild in the office where such license agreement is customarily kept a copy of terms of such license showing the titles of the pictures licensed under such agreement and the license fee for each such picture. Employer agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable inquiries from the Guild as to whether any such picture is currently being distributed for telecasting on pay television or in any other Supplemental Market as herein defined. An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Paragraph 18-106 shall not constitute a default by the Employer hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Guild is received by the Employer.
Employer shall make all social security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation provided for in this Article 18.
18-107
Charge for Late Payment
If the Employer shall fail to make any payment provided for in this Article 18 when and as the same becomes due and payable, interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the unpaid balance thereof from the date payment is due.
18-108
18-109
The compensation payable under this Article 18 shall be excluded
from the gross compensation upon which the Employer contributions are to be made to the Pension Plan and Health and Welfare Plan.
If any Employee's employment agreement with the Employer requires
that such Employee's compensation shall be based, in whole or in part, upon, or measured by, a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture, then such percentage compensation shall be credited against any amounts payable to such Employee hereunder, and likewise any payment due to such Employee hereunder shall be credited against such percentage compensation. When all or a part of any Employee's compensation is
18-106
- 306 -
a specified sum of money, commonly known and referred to as a "deferment," such deferment may not be credited against amounts payable by the Employer to such Employee hereunder.
18-110	Employer's Acquisition of Title
If Employer was not the actual producer of Such Picture which was produced by a signatory Employer but acquired title thereto by purchase, assignment, transfer, voluntary or involuntary, or by foreclosure of a chattel mortgage or security agreement or a pledgee's sale, Employer shall nevertheless be obligated to make the payments herein provided when Such Picture is exhibited in Supplemental Markets, unless such payment required hereunder has already been paid.
18-111	Production, Finance, Distribution Agreement
The obligation of the signatory Employer hereunder with respect to the payments provided for in this Article 18 shall also apply to any Such Pictures produced by an independent producer under a contract between the signatory Employer and such independent producer for the production of such motion picture, and for the financing and distribution thereof by the signatory Employer. However, such signatory Employer shall not be liable for the payment of any Supplemental Markets fees based on monies received by a foreign distributor under a foreign production deal as defined in subparagraphs 18-103(b) or 18-104(b)(3) with respect to which such foreign distributor or such independent producer is not obligated to account to such signatory Employer. Nor shall such signatory Employer be obligated to obtain any Distributor's Assumption Agreement from any foreign distributor referred to in subparagraphs 18-103(b) or 18-104(b)(3) except if such foreign distributor is obligated to account to such signatory Employer pursuant to subparagraphs 18-103(b) or 18-104(b)(3) with respect to monies as therein provided.
- 307 -
18-111
18-112	Employer Continuing Liability
It is expressly understood and agreed that Employer shall in all events remain bound hereunder to make the payments due by reason of the exhibition of each Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, irrespective of the assumption of such liability by any other person, firm or company as provided in Article 22, except as otherwise expressly provided in this BA.
18-113	Failure to Deliver Assumption Agreement
The failure of Employer to obtain and deliver an executed assumption agreement as provided in Article 22-101(a) and Article 22-301(a) shall be deemed a substantial breach of this BA.
18-114	Employer's Dissolution
If Employer dissolves and is no longer in the business of producing motion pictures and if a distributor assumes all of the obligations of the Employer under this Article 18 and the financial responsibility of the distributor is approved by the Guild in its discretion, the Employer shall thereupon be released of any obligation with respect to any payments due hereunder; provided that if the distributor which assumes all of the obligations of the Employer is a member company of the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, Inc., or if any such member company is permanently liable to pay the Supplemental Markets fees provided for in this Article 18 with respect to the motion pictures for which the Employer is liable to make such payment of Supplemental Markets fees, then the financial responsibility of such distributor shall be conclusively deemed approved and Employer shall be released of any obligation with respect to any such payments.
18-115	Networks and Television Stations
No television network, station or advertising agency shall be required to execute any Distributor's Assumption Agreement, or Buyer's Assumption Agreement, except if it is the distributor of Such Picture
18-112
- 308 -
in Supplemental Markets or the buyer of the Employer's Supplemental Markets rights in Such Picture, as the case may be.
18-116
Trailers, Advertising, Stock Shots
The provisions of this Article 18 shall not apply to the distribution or exhibition in relation to Supplemental Markets of trailers or advertising a motion picture by shots, etc., substantially in the nature of a trailer, or the use of stock shots.
18-117
Termination of BA
Notwithstanding the sooner termination of this BA, the parties hereto agree that the terms and conditions of this Article 18 shall apply and remain in full force and effect and without change to Such Picture produced by the Employer, the principal photography of which commenced between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017, both dates inclusive, regardless of when (either during or at any time after the expiration of the term of this BA or of such period) Such Pictures are released in Supplemental Markets, and regardless of the terms or provisions of any BA which is a modification, extension or renewal of or substitution for this BA.

-310-
(c)	produced by Employer with Directors employed by Employer under the terms of this BA or in the employ of the actual producer as described in Paragraph 19-111 (to which employment the provisions of this Article apply).
19-102	Percentage of Accountable Receipts Payable
As to each such motion picture, the Employer will pay (a) to the Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Plan (herein referred to as the Pension Plan) an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Employer's accountable receipts from the distribution of such motion picture on free television, computed as hereinafter provided, and (b) one percent (1%) of such accountable receipts to be paid the Director of the motion picture on a pro rata allocation to each Director when there is more than one Director. In the latter case, in the event of any controversy as to the pro rata allocation of such one percent (1%), the amount allocable to each Director shall be resolved by the Guild and each individual Director involved shall be bound thereby. The payment of the one percent (1%) to be paid to the Director or Directors shall be sent to the Guild for forwarding to such Director or Directors and compliance therewith shall constitute payment to the Director. Such two percent (2%) payment is hereinafter referred to as the "percentage payment." These payments are not subject to health and welfare or pension contributions. The above is subject to the following conditions:
19-103	Definition of "Employer's Gross"
The term "Employer's Gross," as used herein, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of such motion picture (who may be the Employer or a distributor licensed by the Employer) from licensing the right to exhibit the motion picture on free television but shall not include:
(a)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
(b)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted
-311-
19-103
(c)
to or by the Employer or such other distributor, but there shall not be excluded from Distributor's gross receipts any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Employer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
Frozen foreign currency until the Employer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency or Employer or Distributor has the right to transmit to the United States to Employer or Distributor such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid, or if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs.
Such gross income realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has actually been transmitted to the United States, it shall be deemed converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first-in, first-out" unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds, as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue, shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities.
If the Distributor of the motion picture does not distribute the motion picture directly to free television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute the motion picture, then the Employer's gross shall be the worldwide total gross receipts
19-103
-312-
derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit the motion picture on free television.
In case of an outright sale of the free television distribution rights, for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the Employer's gross. If any such outright sale shall include free television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder), the Employer shall allocate to the free television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the Employer's gross. In reaching such determination, Employer may consider the current market value of free television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be submitted to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
If the outright sale includes free television distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Employer shall likewise allocate to each motion picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the free television rights; and if the Guild contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, he or she shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each motion picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only free television distribution rights in a single motion picture shall be subject to arbitration except that in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Employer to the Guild as having been received by the Employer on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Employer on such
-313-
19-103
outright sale. Sums paid to any advertising agency in connection with any exhibition of a motion picture on free television shall not be included in Employer's gross.
19-104	Definition of "Accountable Receipts"
The term "accountable receipts," as used herein, means the balance of the Employer's gross after deducting an arbitrary forty percent (40%) of the Employer's gross for distribution fees and expenses; except that in the case of an outright sale of free television distribution rights, there shall be deducted only an arbitrary ten percent (10%) of the Employer's gross for sales commissions and expenses of sale.
19-105	Accrual of Employer's Obligation; Charge for Late Payments
Employer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only after accountable receipts are received by the Employer. Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided.
If the Employer shall fail to make any payment provided for in this Article 19 when and as the same becomes due and payable, interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the unpaid balance thereof from the date payment is due.
19-106	Allocation of License or Sales Fee
If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to the motion picture on free television includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Employer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Employer's gross hereunder. If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not a reasonable amount, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not a reasonable amount, the Arbitrator shall determine the reasonable amount to be so allocated.
19-103
-314-
19-107
Participating Director
If the Director's services on the motion picture are performed for the Employer on a loan-out basis, then for the purpose of this BA, the Employer shall be deemed to be the employer, and the lender shall not have any responsibility hereunder with respect to the motion picture. If there is at least one (1) participating Director subject to this BA who performs services on the motion picture, the participating Director(s) shall receive full payment of the one percent (1%) of accountable receipts and the Pension Plan shall likewise receive full payment.
19-108
Reports and Manner of Payment
(a)	Employer will furnish to the Guild written reports showing the Employer's gross received from the sale, lease, license and distribution (whether by Employer or a distributor or subdistributor to the extent Employer receives such information) of each motion picture on free television. Such reports shall be furnished quarterly during each fiscal year of the Employer.
Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report, the Employer will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments due the Pension Plan shall be made by check payable to the Pension Plan and all payments due the Director shall be made by check payable to the Director sent to the Guild. Each such quarterly statement shall designate the title of the motion picture involved.
(b)	A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "Employer's gross" when the motion picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable."
(1)	The motion picture is "available" when the first of the
following occurs:
(i)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and
-315-
19-108
in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(ii)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
(2)	The motion picture is "identifiable" when the Employer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(3)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(i)	the advance is for one motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(ii)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Employer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in Employer's gross for that quarter. The Employer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "Employer's gross," which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If the motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Employer does not provide the Guild with the information required by the BA and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in
19-108
-316-
"Employer's gross" no later than six (6) months after the Employer receives it.
An advance received by an Employer's parent, subsidiary of any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Employer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Employer.
(c)	On request, Employer shall make available to the Guild or Pension Plan all accounting statements delivered by a distributor or by a subdistributor to the Employer, but only insofar as such statements relate to the Employer's gross. The Guild or Pension Plan shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Employer insofar as they relate to Employer's gross. Employer shall not be required to furnish any quarterly statement hereunder with respect to the motion picture prior to Employer's receipt of any Employer's gross with respect to the motion picture, or for any quarterly period during which no Employer's gross from the motion picture is received by the Employer.
19-109	Crediting
If a participating Director's employment agreement with the Employer requires that the Director's compensation shall be based, in whole or in part, upon, or measured by a percentage of the gross receipts or revenues derived from the distribution of the motion picture, any payment due hereunder shall be credited pro rata against such percentage compensation. When all or a part of a Director's compensation is a specified sum of money, including what is commonly known and referred to as a "deferment," such specified sum of money may not be credited against amounts payable by the Employer hereunder.
19-110	Employer's Acquisition of Title
If Employer was not the actual producer of the motion picture, but such motion picture was produced by a signatory to this BA, and Employer acquires the title to the motion picture by purchase,
-317-
19-110
19-111
assignment, transfer (voluntary or involuntary) or on foreclosure of a chattel mortgage or at pledgee's sale, Employer shall be obligated to pay the amounts, if any, due under this Article 19 unless such other producer has theretofore made or theretofore become obligated to make such payments to the Pension Plan and the Director. The Guild agrees that the Pension Plan and Director shall not be entitled to any payments from the Employer under this Article 19 with respect to any motion picture for which, under an agreement with the Guild, any other party has theretofore made or theretofore become obligated to make any such payments.
Mortgage, Pledge or Lien
With respect to the motion picture, Employer agrees either to:
(a)	include in any chattel mortgage, pledge or other lien or security agreement covering the motion picture, a provision made expressly for the benefit of the Pension Plan and Director, to the effect that the chattel mortgagee, pledgee, or lien or security holder agrees that if such mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement is foreclosed, and such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder thereby obtains title to the motion picture and subsequently exhibits the motion picture on free television, then in such event, after such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder has recouped its loan so secured plus interest and all costs and expenses incident to foreclosure, such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder will be bound by the provisions of this Article 19 with respect to payments to the Pension Plan and the Director thereafter becoming due and payable hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent such mortgagee, pledgee or lien or security holder who has acquired title to the motion picture from thereafter making a sale of the motion picture to a third party free and clear of any limitations or obligations whatsoever. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph (a), the rights of the Pension Plan and the Director hereunder shall be subordinate to the rights of such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder; or
19-110
-318-
(b)	in the alternative, be bound by the provisions of this Article 19 with respect to additional payments to the Pension Plan and the Director, if any, due after such foreclosure shall have been made. In the event Employer elects this alternative, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall be inapplicable, and if the provisions referred to in subparagraph (a) above are not included in such chattel mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement, Employer shall be deemed to have elected the alternative provided for in this subparagraph (b).
In the event of a foreclosure referred to in subparagraph (a) above, should the Employer distribute the motion picture for such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder, Employer shall be bound during the period of such distribution by the provisions of this Article 19 with respect to payments due hereunder, to the same extent as the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder under subparagraph (a) above. Any such payments made by the Employer as the distributor shall be credited against any obligation of the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder that may be due or become due to the Pension Plan under subparagraph (a) above, it being understood that the Pension Plan shall be entitled to such payments but once.
The foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 19-112 shall not apply to any motion picture subject to any security instrument in existence on September 10, 1962.
19-112	Production, Finance, Distribution Agreement
If, after July 1, 2014, the Employer enters into a contract with a so-called "independent producer" for the production and financing of a theatrical motion picture and the distribution thereof by the Employer (such contract being hereinafter referred to as an "independent contract"), Employer will include in such independent contract an agreement on the part of the independent producer, expressly for the benefit of the Pension Plan and the Director, that the independent producer will pay, in the manner herein provided, the amounts, if any, required to be paid under the provisions of this Article 19 with respect to such motion picture.
-319-
19-112
If such agreement on the part of the independent producer be not included in any independent contract prior to the exhibition of the motion picture on free television, the Employer shall be liable and responsible for the payments, if any, required to be made under the provisions of this Article 19 with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent producer is included in the independent contract prior to exhibition of the motion picture on free television, then the Employer shall not be liable or responsible in any manner or to any extent with respect to the motion picture under the provisions of this Article 19. The Employer will notify the Pension Plan of any and all such independent contracts entered into by the Employer.
19-113
19-114
Bona Fide Theatrical Release
Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, it is agreed that the provisions of this Article 19 apply only if the motion picture is first exhibited on free television after such motion picture has had a bona fide theatrical release. For such purpose, the motion picture may be regarded as having been a bona fide theatrical release even though it has not fully completed, or shall not have been withdrawn from, its theatrical release, and even though a motion picture may not have been released theatrically in foreign countries or territories. If the motion picture is exhibited on free television prior to the time that it has had a bona fide theatrical release, then the release of the motion picture to free television shall be governed by the provisions herein, but only with respect to the provisions relating to additional compensation for television reruns on free television. The provisions of this Article 19 shall not apply to the televising of trailers or advertising a motion picture by shots, etc., substantially in the nature of a trailer, or to the use of stock shots.
Continuing Obligation Beyond Term of BA
Notwithstanding the sooner termination of this BA, the parties hereto agree that the terms and conditions of this Article 19 shall apply and remain in full force and effect, and without change, to theatrical motion pictures produced by the Employer, the principal photography of which commenced between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017, both inclusive dates, regardless of when (either during or at any time after
19-112
-320-
the expiration of the term of this BA or of such period) such motion pictures are released to free television, and regardless of the terms or provisions of any agreement which is a modification, extension or renewal of, or substitution for, this BA.

ARTICLE 20
Minimum Salaries and Residual Compensation for Directors of Motion Pictures Produced Mainly for the Pay Television and Videodisc/Videocassette Market
Section 20-100 APPLICABILITY OF THIS ARTICLE
20-101	Covered Motion Pictures
This Article is applicable to the employment of Directors for motion pictures produced mainly for the "pay television" and/or the "videodisc/videocassette" market, as the quoted terms are defined below, except that the following types of motion pictures produced mainly for such market are covered only by Paragraph 20-905 of this Article 20: industrial and religious motion pictures, commercials, advertising shorts and trailers, educational, informational and instructional motion pictures and documentaries. A motion picture to which this Article is applicable is referred to herein as a "covered motion picture," but such term does not include motion pictures covered only by Paragraph 20-905.
20-102
Videodisc/Videocassette
The term "videodisc/videocassette," as used in this Article, shall mean disc, cassette, cartridge and/or other device serving a similar function which is sold or rented for play on a home-type television screen in the home.
20-103
Pay Television
The term "pay television," as used in this Article, shall mean exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of a telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite to home or CATV when a majority of licensed systems meet the following tests:
20-101
-322-
(a)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a substantial charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(b)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(c)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a substantial charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
20-104	Service and Subscribers
The term "service," as used in this Article, refers to a television service, such as HBO or Showtime, which licenses systems to exhibit motion pictures on a pay television basis; in addition, the term "service" includes systems which have been licensed to exhibit the motion picture on a pay television basis other than through such a service. For the purposes of this Article 20, the term "subscribers" includes only pay television subscribers to services which make payments for the pay television exhibition of the covered motion picture (a) to the Employer, (b) to those acting pursuant to authority derived from the Employer or (c) to an entity authorized by law to receive payment for the Employer. Only paying subscribers are counted in determining the number of subscribers for any purpose under this Article 20.
-323-
20-104
20-105
Exhibition Year
A service's "first exhibition year," as that term is used in this Article, is a one year period commencing on the date of the first pay television exhibition by that service on a non-pay per view basis. A service's "subsequent exhibition year," as used in this Article, is a one (1) year period commencing on the date immediately following the date the prior exhibition year ends. There may or may not be an exhibition of the motion picture during a subsequent exhibition year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of subscribers calculated as prescribed in Paragraph 20-401 is fewer than six million (6,000,000) for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture, then a service’s “subsequent exhibition year” is a one (1) year period commencing on the date of such first exhibition on a non-pay-per-view basis after the expiration of the prior exhibition year.
The exhibition year is utilized in determining subscriber residuals for non-pay-per-view exhibitions of a covered motion picture (including sports and non-staged events), but is not applicable to pay-per-view exhibitions (including pay-per-view exhibitions of sports and nonstaged event programs).
Section 20-200 DIRECTORS' MINIMUM SALARIES
20-201	Initial Minimum
The initial minimum salary applicable to a Director employed in the making of a covered motion picture shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 20-200.
(a)	"Network Prime Time"
The initial minimum salary for a covered motion picture of a type generally produced for network prime time television shall be as follows:
(1)	Fewer than one and one-half million (1,500,000) subscribers -- fifty percent (50%) of the applicable free television minimum. (This minimum is also applicable if
20-105
-324-
there are no license agreements for the pay television exhibition of the motion picture at the time the Director is employed.)
(2)	One and one-half million (1,500,000) subscribers or more but fewer than two million (2,000,000) subscribers -- seventy percent (70%) of the applicable free television minimum.
(3)	Two million (2,000,000) subscribers or more but fewer than three million (3,000,000) subscribers -- eighty percent (80%) of the applicable free television minimum.
(4)	Three million (3,000,000) subscribers or more -- one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable free television minimum.
The foregoing references to "applicable free television minimum" are to the minimum salary set forth in the BA for a "Network Prime Time Show" of the same length. The number of subscribers is determined, as of the time the Director is employed, by the number of subscribers to all services which have contracted for the pay television exhibition of the motion picture other than on a pay-per-view basis, plus the number of subscribers, if any, who have contracted to view the program on a pay-per-view basis.
(b)	"Non-Network or Network Non-Prime Time" - Other Than Local Distribution
The initial minimum salary for a covered motion picture of a type not generally produced for network prime time shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum salary set forth in the BA for a "Non-Network or Network Non-Prime Time Show" of the same length unless the motion picture is intended for local pay television distribution only.
If such minimum is higher than the minimum would be if it had been computed pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, then the applicable minimum shall be computed in accordance with
-325-
20-201
subparagraph (a), using the Network Prime Time rate and the applicable number of subscribers.
(c)	Local Distribution
If the program is intended for local pay television distribution only, then the initial minimum salary shall be determined in accordance with the schedule set forth in subparagraph (a) above except that the references to "applicable free television minimum" shall be to the minimum salary set forth in the BA for a "Non-Network or Network Non-Prime Time Show" of the same length. The term "local distribution," as used in this Article, means exhibition in no more than two (2) markets.
20-202	Adjustments of Initial Minimum
If the Employer has paid the Director less than one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable free television initial minimum salary, the Employer shall pay adjustments in the Director's initial salary according to the terms of this Paragraph 20-202. Nothing in this BA shall be interpreted to prevent the prepayment of adjustments in the initial minimum.
If videodiscs or videocassettes of a motion picture are released for sale or rental to consumers prior to the commencement of the term of a pay television license, the initial minimum salary shall be adjusted to one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable free television minimum.
If a motion picture intended only for local pay television distribution at the time the Director is employed is distributed in more than two (2) markets, the initial minimum salary shall be adjusted to the amount which would have been applicable had the motion picture not been intended for local distribution.
The Director's initial minimum salary shall also be adjusted if the number of subscribers increases to a level requiring a greater percentage under Paragraph 20-201. For example, if the number of subscribers was fewer than one and one-half million (1,500,000) at the time the Director was employed and the Employer paid the
20-201
-326-
Director fifty percent (50%) of the applicable free television minimum, the Employer must pay an adjustment to make the Director's salary seventy percent (70%) of the applicable free television minimum if the number of subscribers later increases to one and one-half million (1,500,000) (i.e., the Employer must pay an additional twenty percent (20%) of such minimum).
For the purpose of determining if an adjustment in initial minimum salary is due and the amount of such adjustment, the number of subscribers previously counted for purposes of initial compensation and adjustments in initial compensation shall have added to it: (a) the number of subscribers to services which contract for the first time to exhibit the motion picture on pay television, other than pay-per-view, after the Director was employed; (b) any increases in the number of subscribers at the beginning or end of a service's subsequent exhibition years (but not a service's first exhibition year); and (c) the number of subscribers who paid to view the program on a pay-per-view basis to the extent that such number is in excess of the number who had contracted for such viewing at the time the Director was employed.
A pay-per-view subscriber is counted each time the subscriber pays to view the program. If a pay-per-view subscriber who pays for the program once is thereby given the right to view the program more than once, or at any one of several alternate times, the subscriber is counted only one time.
If an adjustment in minimum compensation required by this Paragraph increases the applicable initial minimum compensation to an amount exceeding the initial compensation which the Director received, payment of such excess shall be made within thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar quarter during which the adjustment became due. Payment shall be by check payable to the order of the Director entitled thereto (or the Director's loan-out Company) and shall be delivered to the Guild for forwarding to such Director and compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the Director.
-327-
20-202
Section 20-300 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR PAY TELEVISION AND VIDEODISC/VIDEOCASSETTE EXHIBITION
The various methods of computing residual compensation for pay television and videodisc/videocassette exhibition are set forth in the following Sections:
(a)	Section 20-400, pay television exhibition excluding (1) pay-per-view and (2) sports and non-staged event programs;
(b)	Section 20-500, pay television exhibition (including pay-per-view) of sports and non-staged event programs;
(c)	Section 20-600, pay-per-view exhibition other than sports and nonstaged event programs; and
(d)	Section 20-700, videodiscs/videocassettes.
20-301	Time of Payment
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this BA, all residual payments required under this Article 20 (including, but not limited to, payments under Section 20-800) shall be sent to the Pay Television and Videodisc/Videocassette Fund Administrator (herein "Pay TV Fund Administrator"), established pursuant to Exhibit E-1 attached hereto, not later than thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter during which such payments become due.
Section 20-400 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR PAY TELEVISION EXCLUDING (a) PAY-PER-VIEW AND (b) SPORTS AND NON-STAGED EVENT PROGRAMS
Residual compensation for pay television exhibition, other than pay-per-view, of covered motion pictures other than sports and non-staged events shall be computed in accordance with this Section 20-400.
20-300
-328-
20-401
Subscriber Residual
(a)	Subscriber Residual for Services With Six Million (6,000,000) or More Subscribers for the First Exhibition Year of a Covered Motion Picture
A subscriber residual for a service with six million (6,000,000) or more subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture shall be due if there is an exhibition on pay television in the United States or Canada (excluding “the exempt run”) during any exhibition year. Employer shall make a subscriber residual payment calculated by multiplying the number of subscribers to services which completed six (6) months of an exhibition year by the per subscriber rate.
If an exhibition (excluding “the exempt run”) occurs during the first six (6) months of an exhibition year, the residual payment is calculated at the end of the six (6) months and paid within thirty (30) days following the calendar quarter in which the calculation is to be made. If there is an exhibition in the second six (6) months of an exhibition year and no exhibition (excluding “the exempt run”) in the first six (6) months, the residual payment is calculated at the end of the exhibition year and paid within thirty (30) days following the calendar quarter in which the calculation is to be made.
(1)	The Exempt Run
For the purpose of calculating the subscriber residual, the exhibitions of a motion picture during one “run” (hereinafter called “the exempt run”) on each pay television service are excluded. “The exempt run” is defined as an unlimited number of exhibitions within a twenty-four (24) hour period, but is limited to one exhibition between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The twenty-four (24) hour period shall be measured separately on each system licensed by a service. If a system is licensed by more than one (1) service to exhibit the same motion picture, there shall be an exempt run on such system for each such service.
-329-
20-401
(2)	Pay-Per-View Exhibition
If a motion picture covered by this Section 20-400 is also exhibited on a pay-per-view basis, the pay-per-view subscribers shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating the subscriber residual.
(3)	Counting Subscribers
A determination as to the number of subscribers for each service shall be made six (6) months after the beginning of each exhibition year of such service and that number shall constitute the number of subscribers for that year for that service.
In making each such determination, if the Employer and the Guild agree as to the number of subscribers, that number shall be used. Otherwise, the latest issue of a generally recognized authoritative publication, selected by agreement of the Guild and the AMPTP, shall be used; absent such agreement, “The Kagan Census of Cable and Pay TV” shall be utilized for determining the number of subscribers.
(4)	Per Subscriber Rate
The per subscriber rate applicable to a service’s first exhibition year is one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable free television minimum divided by thirty million (30,000,000), except for a covered motion picture which is a “high budget pay television motion picture.” The applicable free television minimum is determined in the same manner as in Paragraph 20201. A “high budget pay television motion picture,” as the term is used in this Article 20, is defined as a program which is eighty (80) minutes or longer and is budgeted at, or in excess of, five million dollars ($5,000,000), except for multi-part closed-end series in the genre of Shogun, Roots and Masada. For “high budget pay television motion pictures,” the theatrical minimum rather than the free television minimum is used for determining the per subscriber rate. (The minimum initial
20-401
-330-
salary for such motion pictures is not affected by this subparagraph.)
The per subscriber rate for any exhibition year following the first exhibition year shall be a percentage of the per subscriber rate for the first exhibition year as shown in the schedule below:
Exhibition Year	Subscriber Factor
2	70%
3	50%
4	30%
5	25%
6	20%
7	15%
8	10%
9	10%
10	10%
11 and each subsequent year	5%
A table is attached hereto as Exhibit “E-2" setting forth the per subscriber rates for the various types of motion pictures.
(5)	One Year’s Unlimited Exhibitions
The compensation set forth in this subparagraph 20-401(a) shall entitle the Employer to an unlimited number of non-pay-per-view exhibitions during the exhibition year for which such compensation is paid. (As provided in Section 20-500, this subparagraph 20-401(a)(5) is applicable to non-pay-per-view exhibitions of sports and non-staged event programs.)
-331-
20-401
(6)	Subscriber Residual Ceiling
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no single exhibition year’s residuals for a particular “covered motion picture” shall exceed the Director’s applicable minimum initial compensation for the motion picture.
(b)	Subscriber Residual for Services With Fewer Than Six Million (6,000,000) Subscribers for the First Exhibition Year of a Covered Motion Picture
A subscriber residual for services with fewer than six million (6,000,000) subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture shall be due, to the extent required by this Article 20, if the "aggregate" number of subscribers to services which exhibit the motion picture, calculated as provided in subparagraph 20-401(b)(5), exceeds the subscriber window.
(1)	Subscriber Window
The "subscriber window" is an aggregate of three million (3,000,000) subscribers.
(2)	The Exempt Run
For the purpose of determining if the subscriber window is exceeded and for the calculation of the subscriber residual, the exhibitions of a motion picture during one "run" (hereinafter called "the exempt run") on each pay television service are excluded. "The exempt run" is defined as an unlimited number of exhibitions within a twenty-four (24) hour period but is limited to one (1) exhibition between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The twenty-four (24) hour period shall be measured separately on each system licensed by a service. If a system is licensed by more than one (1) service to exhibit the same motion picture, there shall be an exempt run on such system for each such service.
20-401
-332-
(3)	Pay-Per-View Exhibition
If a motion picture covered by Section 20-400 is also exhibited on a pay-per-view basis, the pay-per-view subscribers shall not be counted for the purposes of determining if the subscriber window is exceeded or for calculating the subscriber residual.
(4)	Counting Subscribers
A determination as to the number of subscribers for each service shall be made six (6) months after the beginning of each exhibition year of such service and that number shall constitute the number of subscribers for that year for that service.
In making each such determination, if the Employer and the Guild agree as to the number of subscribers, that number shall be used. Otherwise, the latest issue of a generally recognized authoritative publication, selected by agreement of the Guild and the AMPTP, shall be used; absent such agreement, "The Kagan Census of Cable and Pay TV" shall be utilized for determining the number of subscribers.
(5)	Calculating Number of Subscribers for Payment of Subscriber Residual
The number of subscribers on which the subscriber residual shall be paid shall be calculated as follows:
(i)	At the end of each calendar quarter, the number of subscribers (computed as in subparagraph 20-401(b)(4)) to services which completed the first six (6) months of an exhibition year during that quarter shall be added to the total of such numbers for all prior quarters in which a service completed the first six (6) months of an exhibition year. The sum so calculated is the "aggregate" number of subscribers. This procedure shall continue until the aggregate number of subscribers exceeds the subscriber window.
-333-
20-401
(ii)	During the quarter in which the aggregate number of subscribers exceeds the subscriber window, a subscriber residual shall become due for the number of subscribers by which such window is exceeded.
(iii)	During subsequent quarters, a subscriber residual shall become due for subscribers to services which completed the first six (6) months of an exhibition year during such quarter.
(iv)	The computation provided for in subparagraph (iii) above shall continue until the conclusion of the "motion picture's first exhibition year" or until the "accountable receipts plateau" is reached, whichever is later. (The quoted terms in the preceding sentence are defined in Paragraph 20-402.)
(6)	Calculation of Subscriber Residual Payment
The amount of the subscriber residual payment is calculated by multiplying the number of subscribers for which such payment is due by the per subscriber rate.
The per subscriber rate applicable to a service's first exhibition year is one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable free television minimum divided by fifteen million (15,000,000), except in the case of a covered motion picture which is a "high budget pay television motion picture." The applicable free television minimum is determined in the same manner as in Paragraph 20-201. A "high budget pay television motion picture," as the term is used in this Article 20, is defined as a motion picture which is eighty (80) minutes or longer and is budgeted at, or in excess of, five million dollars ($5,000,000), except for multi-part closed-end series in the genre of Shogun, Roots and Masada. For "high budget pay television motion pictures," the theatrical minimum rather than the free television minimum is used for determining the per subscriber rate. (The minimum initial salary for such motion pictures is not affected by this subparagraph.) The per subscriber rate applicable to a service's subsequent exhibition years shall be seventy percent
20-401
-334-
(70%) of the rate applicable to the service's first exhibition year whether or not a subscriber residual payment was due for such first exhibition year.
A table is attached hereto as Exhibit E-2 setting forth the per subscriber rates for the various types of motion pictures.
(7)	One Year's Unlimited Exhibitions
The compensation set forth in this subparagraph 20-401(b) shall entitle the Employer to an unlimited number of non-pay-per-view exhibitions during the exhibition year for which such compensation is paid. (As provided in Section 20-500, this subparagraph 20-401(b)(7) is applicable to non-pay-per-view exhibitions of sports and non-staged event programs.)
(8)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no single exhibition year's residuals for a particular "covered motion picture" shall exceed the Director's applicable minimum initial compensation for the picture.
20-402	Percentage Residual
A percentage residual shall be due, to the extent required by this Paragraph 20-402, only for services with fewer than six million (6,000,000) subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture.
(a)	Accountable Receipts
The Employer shall pay a percentage residual equal to two percent (2%) of the "accountable receipts" which exceed the "accountable receipts plateau," except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 20-402.
In determining whether the accountable receipts plateau has been reached, the following receipts shall be included: (1) accountable receipts from pay (other than pay-per-view) television (including receipts for the exempt run) and (2) fees

or other income received by the Employer as producer from videodisc/videocassette sales or rentals.
Once the accountable receipts plateau is reached, only accountable receipts from pay television (other than pay-per-view) are included in accountable receipts for the purpose of calculating the percentage residual. However, as described in subparagraphs 20-402(d) and (e) below, accountable receipts are exempt from assessment of the percentage residual if such receipts are:
(1)	allocable to the "first year's receipts exemption;" or
(2)	allocable to any service's exhibition year (other than an
exhibition year the receipts of which are allocated as in subparagraph (1) above), the first six (6) months of which are completed prior to the motion picture reaching the accountable receipts plateau.
(b)	Accountable Receipts Plateau
The "accountable receipts plateau" shall be as follows:
(1)	For "high budget pay television motion pictures" as defined in this Article 20:
Production Cost	Accountable Receipts Plateau
$5,000,000	$10,000,000
Over $5,000,000	$10,000,000 plus $1,000,000 for each additional $1,000,000 of production costs over $5,000,000
20-402
-336-
(2)	For motion pictures of a type generally produced for prime time network television:
Motion Picture Length	Accountable Receipts Plateau
0 - 30 minutes	$1,000,000
31 - 60 minutes	$2,000,000
61 - 90 minutes	$3,000,000
91 - 120 minutes	$4,000,000
Over 120 minutes	$1,000,000 for each additional one-half hour or fraction thereof
(3)	For motion pictures other than those covered by (1) or (2) above: when the applicable minimum initial compensation for a motion picture is less than the minimum initial compensation for a motion picture of the same length covered by (2) above, the accountable receipts plateau shall be proportionately reduced in accordance with the following formula:
Applicable Free Television Minimum Initial Compensation for Motion Picture Covered by Subparagraph (3)________
Applicable Free Television Minimum Initial Compensation for Motion Picture of Same Length Covered by Subparagraph (2)
Accountable Receipts Plateau for Motion Picture
= Covered by Subparagraph (3) Accountable Receipts Plateau for Motion Picture
Covered by Subparagraph (2)
The accountable receipts plateaus for such types of motion pictures are set forth in Exhibit “E-3" attached hereto and have been computed in accordance with the foregoing formula.
(c)	Motion Picture's First Exhibition Year
A "motion picture's first exhibition year" is a one (1) year period commencing with the first exhibition of the motion
-337-
20-402
picture on pay television, other than on pay-per-view, on any service.
(d)	First Year's Receipts Exemption
The accountable receipts from a service with an exhibition year which is completed during the motion picture's first exhibition year shall be exempt from the payment of the percentage residual, provided that, if the license is for more than one (1) year, a portion of the accountable receipts from the license shall be allocated arithmetically to that portion of the license falling within such exhibition year of the service. If such license should provide for an option and such option is exercised, neither the period covered by the exercise of such option nor the accountable receipts resulting from such exercise shall be included in the foregoing computations. (Exemption of accountable receipts pursuant to this subparagraph is referred to as "the first year's receipts exemption." Accountable receipts from pay-per-view exhibitions are excluded from calculations of accountable receipts under subparagraphs 20-402(d) and (e).)
(e)	Exhibition Year Exemption
Any exhibition year of a service which reaches its six (6) month point prior to the motion picture reaching the accountable receipts plateau shall have an amount allocated to such exhibition year which shall be exempt from the payment of the percentage residual. Such amount shall be determined in the same manner as under subparagraph 20-402(d). To the extent that receipts are exempt under subparagraph (d) above, no additional exemption for such receipts shall be taken under this subparagraph (e).
(f)	Accountable Receipts -- Pay Television
The term "accountable receipts," as used in this Paragraph 20402, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of a covered motion picture (who may be the Employer or a distributor licensed by the Employer) from
20-402
-338-
licensing the right to exhibit the picture (referred to in subparagraphs 20-402(f) and (g) as "such picture") on pay television; provided, however, that in the case of any such picture which is produced outside of the United States, if such picture is subject to this BA and if the production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other consideration for production and a foreign distributor acquires one (1) or more foreign territories for the distribution of such picture in pay television, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in the gross receipts except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Employer or the distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute the picture directly in pay television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then gross receipts shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture in pay television. In case of an outright sale of the pay television distribution rights, for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "accountable receipts." If any such outright sale shall include pay television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Employer shall allocate to the pay television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "accountable receipts." In reaching this determination, Employer may consider the current market value of pay television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event
-339-
20-402
the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he or she shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes pay television distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Employer shall likewise allocate to each such picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sale price of the pay television rights; and if the Guild contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each such picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only pay television distribution rights in a single such picture shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Employer to the Guild as having been received by the Employer on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Employer on such outright sale. Accountable receipts shall not include sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Employer, but there shall not be excluded from accountable receipts any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profits tax or similar tax payable by the Employer or such Distributor on its net income for the privilege of doing business.
(g)	Employer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only after accountable receipts are received by Employer, but as to foreign receipts such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States, and until such time no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in accountable receipts.
Upon the Guild's request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country which has frozen receipts, the Employer will transfer the applicable residual to the Pay TV Fund Administrator, in the currency of such foreign country, provided the recipient will bear any costs involved; and such
20-402
-340-
transfer shall be deemed to be payment of an equivalent number of U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category as determined by the Employer. Concurrently with such transfer, the recipient will pay to the Employer in U.S. dollars the total amount the Employer is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Employer utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from exhibition of such picture on pay television by conversion thereof to properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Employer shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign receipts from pay television exhibition shall be deemed to be released on a "first-in, first-out basis," unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between such picture and other motion pictures distributed by the distributor on pay television in the same ratio that receipts derived from the distribution of such picture on pay television within the foreign country bear to the total receipts derived from the distribution of such picture and all other motion pictures on pay television within the foreign country during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in accountable receipts. Employer shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Employer. The Guild and the Employees shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Employer or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Employer may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Employer. No sums received by way of
-341-
20-402
deposits or security need be included in accountable receipts until earned, but when the Employer is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the accountable receipts.
(h)	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to such picture on pay television includes as a part thereof any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Employer shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in the accountable receipts.
20-403	Foreign Pay Television Residuals
Residuals for pay television exhibition outside of the United States and Canada shall be two percent (2%) of “accountable receipts,” as defined in subparagraphs 20-402(f)-(h), except that for services with fewer than six million (6,000,000) subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture, such residuals shall be calculated according to subparagraph 20-401(b) and Paragraph 20-402.
Section 20-500 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR PAY TELEVISION EXHIBITION (INCLUDING PAY-PER-VIEW) OF SPORTS AND NON-STAGED EVENT PROGRAMS
Only subscriber residual payments and not percentage residual payments shall be applicable to pay television exhibitions (including pay-per-view) of sports and non-staged event programs.
A non-staged event program is a motion picture of an event which would have occurred whether or not the event was being photographed, provided that the event is not substantially altered for the purpose of such photography.
Paragraph 20-402 shall not be applicable to such programs.
(a)	For services with six million (6,000,000) or more subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered program, subparagraph 20-401(a) shall apply with the following exceptions:
20-402
-342-
(1)	for sports event programs, the base for determining the subscriber residual shall be $25,108 ($25,861 effective July 1, 2015 and $26,637 effective July 1, 2016) rather than the free television minimum as provided in subparagraph 20-401(a)(4);
(2)	for pay-per-view exhibitions of sports and non-staged event programs, subparagraphs 20-401(a)(1) (“The Exempt Run”), 20-401(a)(2) (“Pay-Per-View Exhibition”) and 20-401(a)(5) (“One Year’s Unlimited Exhibitions”) shall not be applicable. A pay-per-view subscriber shall be counted each time the subscriber pays to view the program. If a pay-per-view subscriber who pays for the program once is thereby given the right to view the program more than once, or at any one of several alternate times, the subscriber is counted only once.
(b)	For services with fewer than six million (6,000,000) subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered motion picture, subparagraph 20-401(b) shall apply with the following exceptions:
(1)	the subscriber residual cut-off in subparagraph 20-401(b)(5)(iv) shall not be applicable;
(2)	for sports event programs, the base for determining the subscriber residual shall be $25,108 ($25,861 effective July 1, 2015 and $26,637 effective July 1, 2016) rather than the free television minimum as provided in subparagraph 20-401(b)(6);
(3)	the subscriber window for sports event programs shall be in the same proportion to (but not more than) the subscriber window set forth in subparagraph 20-401(b)(1) as the free television minimum is to $25,108 ($25,861 effective July 1, 2015 and $26,637 effective July 1, 2016) (minimum salaries, which are computed pursuant to Section 20-200, are not affected by this subparagraph (3));
(4)	for pay-per-view exhibitions of sports and non-staged event programs, subparagraphs 20-401(b)(2) ("The Exempt Run"), 20-401(b)(3) ("Pay-Per-View Exhibition") and 20-401(b)(7) ("One Year's Unlimited Exhibitions") shall not be applicable. A pay-per-view subscriber shall be counted each time the
-343-
20-500
subscriber pays to view the program. If a pay-per-view subscriber who pays for the program once is thereby given the right to view the program more than once, or at any one of several alternate times, the subscriber is counted only once.
Section 20-600 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR PAY-PER-VIEW EXHIBITION OTHER THAN SPORTS AND NONSTAGED EVENT PROGRAMS
Only the percentage residual payments and not the subscriber residual payments are applicable to pay-per-view exhibition of other than sports and non-staged event programs, regardless of the number of subscribers to a service for the first exhibition year of a covered program. The percentage residual shall be payable on "accountable receipts," as described in subparagraph 20-402(a), from pay-per-view licensing received after the accountable receipts plateau has been reached.
In determining whether such accountable receipts plateau has been reached, only accountable receipts from pay-per-view licensing shall be included. That the pay-per-view receipts reach the accountable receipts plateau does not affect residual payments for non-pay-per-view exhibitions; that the non-pay-per-view receipts reach the accountable receipts plateau does not affect residual payments for pay-per-view exhibitions.
Section 20-700 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR VIDEODISCS/ VIDEOCASSETTES
(a)	For sales and for the licensing of rentals in the videodisc/ videocassette market, the Employer shall pay two percent (2%) of the fee or other payment actually received by the Employer as producer from the "net unit sales" as defined below in excess of one hundred thousand (100,000) units in the aggregate; except that if a covered motion picture is exhibited on pay television other than pay-per-view prior to being released for sale or rental in the videodisc/videocassette market, the Employer shall commence paying two percent (2%) of such fees or payments from net unit sales either when the accountable receipts from such television exhibitions and the receipts received by the Employer as producer from videodiscs/videocassettes combined exceed the accountable receipts plateau or when net unit sales exceed one hundred thousand (100,000) units, whichever occurs earlier.
20-500
-344-
(b)	The term "disc," as used in this Section, shall refer to both videodiscs and videocassettes. The term "unit" shall refer to the disc or aggregate discs in each package released by the Employer for sale or rental. "Net Unit Sales" shall mean sales of units which are released by the Employer or its distributor for sale and are not returned, or are released by the Employer or its distributor for rental purposes.
(c)	It is recognized that some companies hereunder may act both as producers and as distributors of disc units in covered sales and/or rentals. In such a case, the payment set forth above shall be based on either (1) the fee or other payment received by the subsidiary, division or other department of the Employer which serves as the production branch, as distinguished from the subsidiary, division or other department of the Employer which serves as the distribution branch, or (2) when no separate subsidiary, division, or other department serves as the production branch, a reasonable allocation of the gross receipts of the Employer from covered sales and/or rentals attributable solely to fees or other payments which would be made to a production subsidiary, division or other department of the Employer if one existed, or would be made to an outside producer. The reasonableness of such allocation in (2) above, or of the fee or other payment received by the production subsidiary, division, or other department in (1) above, shall be determined by its license fee payments to outside producers for comparable disc units, or in the absence of such practice, by generally prevailing trade practice in the videodisc industry.
Section 20-800 RESIDUAL COMPENSATION FOR EXHIBITION OF COVERED MOTION PICTURES IN OTHER MARKETS
This Section provides for the residual payments which are due for the exhibition of covered motion pictures in markets other than the pay television and/or videodisc/videocassette market.
20-801	Free Television Exhibition of Covered Motion Pictures
(a)	If a covered motion picture (other than a "high budget pay television motion picture") is broadcast on free television, the Employer shall pay compensation as and when required
-345-
20-801
pursuant to Article 11 of this BA and shall send to the Guild reports of such exhibitions as and when required by Article 11. For purposes of the payments required under this subparagraph (a), the first domestic telecast of a covered motion picture on free television shall be deemed the second run. For services with six million (6,000,000) or more subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered program, the “accountable receipts plateau” is disregarded and Employer shall be entitled to a discount of payments required under this subparagraph (a) of ten percent (10%) in perpetuity. For services with fewer than six million (6,000,000) subscribers for the first exhibition year of a covered program, the discount shall be twenty percent (20%) until the “accountable receipts plateau” is reached.20
(b)	If a "high budget pay television motion picture" is broadcast on free television, Employer shall make payments in an amount computed in accordance with Article 18 of the BA as though the "high budget pay television motion picture" were a free television motion picture distributed in "supplemental markets." No amount of the one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of accountable receipts shall be paid to the Pension Plan.
(c)	As an alternative to the foregoing, if an Employer licenses a covered motion picture produced mainly for the pay television market for exhibition in syndication only in Canada, it shall have the option to elect to pay to the Director thereof four percent (4%) of the “Employer’s gross” (as defined in Article 18) derived therefrom, in lieu of any other compensation required under this or any prior Agreement, as applicable, and such exhibition shall not count as a “run” for purposes of calculating residuals due under this Paragraph 20-801. The foregoing applies to covered motion pictures produced mainly for the pay television market, whether produced under this BA or any prior BA, as to which residuals would otherwise be payable.
20 See modification to this subparagraph in Sideletter No. 34 re License of Free Television, Basic Cable or Pay Television Motion Pictures to Secondary Digital Channels.
20-801
-346-
20-802	Basic Cable Exhibition of Covered Motion Pictures
If a covered motion picture is licensed for exhibition on domestic basic cable (other than as part of domestic free television licensing), the Employer shall pay two percent (2%) of accountable receipts derived from such exhibition computed in accordance with Article 18. Exhibitions of a covered motion picture on foreign basic cable are considered free television.
20-803	Theatrical Exhibition of Covered Motion Pictures
Paragraph 11-201 of this BA shall be applicable to covered motion pictures. If a covered motion picture is exhibited theatrically, payment therefor shall be due and payable on the date the Employer releases the motion picture for such exhibition.
20-804	Supplemental Market Exhibition of Covered Motion Pictures
If a covered motion picture is licensed for exhibition in other supplemental markets (such as "in-flight"), Employer shall make payments in an amount computed in accordance with Article 18. No amount thereof shall be paid to the Pension Plan.
20-805	Other Exhibition of Covered Motion Pictures
Paragraph 11-208 of this BA shall be applicable to covered motion pictures exhibited other than on television or in supplemental markets.
Section 20-900 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
20-901	License Covering More than One Motion Picture
If a license agreement includes the right to exhibit more than one (1) motion picture in the pay television and/or videodisc/videocassette market, the Employer shall allocate a fair and reasonable portion of the fees from such license agreement to each covered motion picture. If the Guild contends that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration. In the
-347-
20-901
event that the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, the Arbitrator shall determine the amount to be so allocated.
20-902
20-903
License Covering More than One Market
If a license agreement includes the right to exhibit a covered motion picture in more than one (1) market, the Employer shall allocate a fair and reasonable portion of the fees from such license to each such market. For this purpose, videodiscs/videocassettes, pay-per-view and non-pay-per-view are treated as separate markets. If the Guild contends that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration. In the event that the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, the Arbitrator shall determine the amount to be so allocated.
Reports
Within thirty (30) days following any calendar quarter in which residual compensation or adjustments of initial compensation become due and payable under this Article 20, the Employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Guild a written report showing the amount of compensation which became due and how such amount was determined.
Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report, the Employer will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be sent to the Pay TV Fund Administrator and compliance herewith shall fully discharge Employer's obligations to make any such payments. No such payment need be made for any motion picture until the amount due for the respective covered motion picture has accumulated to an amount equal to or more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Paragraph shall not constitute a default by the Employer hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Guild is received by the Employer.
20-901
-348-
20-904
Availability of Records
20-905
The Guild shall have a continuous and continuing right to audit, to inspect, and to photocopy records maintained by the Employer relating to the motion picture which the Guild deems necessary to inspect and photocopy for the purpose of assuring compliance with the provisions hereof. If the Guild requests that it be sent an extract of the financial terms of the license of the motion picture, and if such information is not extensive in nature, the Employer will forward such information extract without making it necessary for the Guild to send a representative to the offices of the Employer. In general, the Employer will cooperate in furnishing such information to the Guild by mail or telephone, when doing so is not unreasonable or burdensome.
The Employer shall keep or have access: (a) to complete records showing all pay television services to which a covered motion picture has been licensed and the dates of exhibition by such services insofar as such dates are pertinent to determining payments under this Article 20, and (b) to records reflecting all pertinent receipts. If a covered motion picture is released in free television, the Employer shall keep or have access: (a) to complete records showing all cities in the United States and Canada in which the motion picture has been telecast on free television and the number of such telecasts in each such city, the television stations on which such telecast occurred, and the dates thereof; and (b) to records reflecting all pertinent gross sums collected from free television exhibition outside of the United States and Canada. The Employer shall keep or have access to complete records showing the release or sale of covered motion pictures for theatrical use.
Future Negotiations
With respect to production by the Employer of the types of motion pictures covered only by this Paragraph 20-905, as provided in Paragraph 20-101, i.e., industrial and religious motion pictures, commercials, advertising shorts and trailers, educational, informational and instructional motion pictures, and documentaries, (herein referred to as a "Program" or "Programs") the following provisions shall apply:
-349-
20-905
(a)	With respect to hiring after July 1, 2014, and pending agreement on other conditions pursuant to subparagraph (b) below, the employment of any person to perform duties (which if performed by that person for free television would be covered by the BA) for a Program produced within the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles or New York, or any such person hired within such areas and sent therefrom to another location to perform such duties on a Program, shall be subject only to the Guild Shop provisions of this BA. The Guild agrees to make appropriate accommodations in its initiation fees in recognition of the economics of such programming. Employer shall give the Guild notice at least ten (10) days prior to commencement of production of any Program to be produced within the metropolitan areas of New York or Los Angeles or of any Program for which a person(s) is hired within the metropolitan areas of New York or Los Angeles and is sent to another location to perform duties which, if performed by that person for free television, would be covered by the BA.
(b)	(1) Not earlier than sixty (60) days after July 1, 2014, either
the Guild or Employer may notify the other that it wishes to bargain concerning rates and other conditions of employment to be applicable to Programs. The parties agree to commence such negotiations within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.
(2)	Any agreement reached pursuant to subparagraph (a) above shall not be retroactive and, except with respect to initial compensation, shall not modify the terms of employment under individual contracts then existing.
(3)	If no agreement is reached within sixty (60) days after bargaining has commenced, the Guild may, upon written notice to Employer, instruct its members to refuse to render services with respect to Programs. In such event, subparagraph (a) hereof shall no longer be applicable.
20-905
-350-
20-906	Charge for Late Payment
If Employer fails to pay initial compensation required under Article 20 when due, interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall accrue for a thirty (30) day period after payment is due. Thereafter, if the Guild provides written notice of delinquency and Employer fails to remit payment, interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum shall accrue until payment is made. If written notice is not given, no further late payment charges shall accrue.
If the Employer has failed to make such payment because the executed contract was not delivered by the Employee to the Employer, or because of a bona fide dispute as to the amount due, then no such interest is due. If the contract is not so delivered by the Employee because of a dispute as to the terms of the contract and the Employer shall be held to be wrong, or if the bona fide dispute is resolved in favor of the Employee, the foregoing interest payments shall be applicable.
If Employer fails to make any other payment required by Article 20 when due, interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date payment is due.
20-907	Second Unit, Etc.
The residual provisions of this Article 20 are not applicable to (a) "bridging" or (b) shooting of added scenes for theatrical films for television release or for motion pictures covered by this Article 20 for free television release or (c) to second units, for which there are no residual payments.
20-908	No Waiver of Minimum Terms
No Employee may agree to compensation below the minimums set forth in this Article 20 or agree to postpone any compensation due him or her to a period beyond the applicable time provided in this BA; however, nothing herein shall preclude the Employee from bargaining for better terms.
-351-
20-908
It is understood that the residual compensation required to be paid under this Article 20 constitutes an addition to the salaries provided under Section 20-200 herein.
20-909	Excerpts From a Pay Television Program
(a)	If an excerpt from a pay television motion picture is used on television or videodiscs/videocassettes, and such use falls within Paragraph 11-209 or the exceptions in subparagraphs 11-207(a), (b), (c) or (d), the Employer shall pay the amount, if any, provided in such applicable provision. If use of the excerpt does not fall within such provisions or if such excerpts are otherwise within subparagraphs 11-207(a), (b), (c) or (d) but the aggregate running time of such excerpts from a single program exceeds the maximum applicable time limits, the Employer shall pay the following:
(1)	Ten (10) seconds or less of excerpts from the program -$390 ($402 effective July 1, 2015); or
(2)	Over ten (10) seconds but not more than two (2) minutes of such excerpts -- $1,166 ($1,201 effective July 1, 2015); or
(3)	Over two (2) minutes of such excerpts -- $1,166 ($1,201 effective July 1, 2015) for the first two (2) minutes and $194 ($200 effective July 1, 2015) for each minute or fraction thereof in excess of two (2) minutes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employer may use up to ten (10) minutes of excerpts from a motion picture made for home video for promotional purposes without payment of excerpt fee(s).
(b)	The provisions of this Paragraph 20-909 apply to the use after July 1, 2014 of an excerpt from any motion picture, produced at any time mainly for the pay television and/or the videodisc/videocassette market.
20-908
-352-
(c)	The actual production company which produces the program or motion picture containing the excerpt requiring payment is obligated to make the payment required under this Paragraph, provided the company is signatory to this BA. Employer shall otherwise remain liable for the payment due.
(d)	If two (2) or more Directors are entitled to share any payment provided in this Paragraph, the Guild shall determine the allocation among the Directors.
(e)	If an excerpt is used in a local program and the program is broadcast in no more than one market, the payment for such use shall be fifty percent (50%) of the amount provided in this Paragraph 20-909. If the program is broadcast later in another market, the Director shall be paid the remaining fifty percent (50%).
(f)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, no excerpt fee shall be payable to the Director of the program in which the excerpt is used if:
(1)	the program is part of a series order of no fewer than thirteen (13) episodes and the Director has directed, or has a commitment to direct, ninety percent (90%) or more of the series order;
(2)	the program is an episode of a show such as "Letterman" or "Oprah," and the Director has been continuously employed on the show for at least one (1) year before production of the episode; or

Distributor hereby agrees, expressly for the benefit of the Directors Guild of America, herein called "the DGA" or "the Guild," as representative of the Employees who rendered services on the Picture, and for the benefit of the Pension Plan, when the Picture is telecast on free television or exhibited in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), to make the additional payments required thereby, if any, with respect to the territories, media and term referred to above as provided in the applicable Articles and/or Sideletter referred to hereinabove (all such payments are collectively hereinafter referred to as "Residuals").
-359-
22-101
Distributor, for and on behalf of the Employer, shall make all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation referred to in the preceding sentence.
It is expressly understood that the right of Distributor to license the Picture for exhibition on free television or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), or to exhibit or cause or permit the Picture to be exhibited on free television or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment of Residuals with respect to the territories, media and term referred to above in accordance with said applicable Articles and/or Sideletter. It is agreed that the Guild, in addition to all other remedies, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against Distributor in the event such payments are not made.
To the extent that Employer has executed a security agreement and financing statement in the Guild's favor in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the DGA-Security Agreement ("DGA Security Interest"), Distributor agrees and acknowledges that Distributor's rights in the Picture acquired pursuant to the Distribution Agreement (to the extent those rights are included in the collateral covered by the Security Agreement) are subject and subordinate to the DGA Security Interest.
The DGA agrees that so long as Residuals with respect to the Picture for the territories, media and term referred to above are timely paid in accordance with said applicable Articles and/or Sideletter that the DGA will not exercise any rights under the DGA Security Interest which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Distributor to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution.
The Guild further agrees that if it exercises its rights as a secured party, it will dispose of collateral which encompasses any of Distributor's rights or interests in, or physical items relating to, the Picture, only to a transferee which agrees in writing to be bound by the Guild's obligations under this Assumption Agreement.
22-101
-360-
Within a reasonable time after the expiration of each calendar quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) days, Distributor will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Guild a written report showing the "Employer's gross" during the preceding quarter from the distribution of the Picture by Distributor on free television or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), with respect to which Distributor is required to make payments hereunder, (whether distributed by the Distributor or through another distributor).
Distributor shall also make available for inspection by the DGA all Distributor's statements delivered to Employer insofar as they relate to such "Employer's gross." The Guild shall have the right at reasonable times and on reasonable notice to examine the books and records of Distributor as to such "Employer's gross" pertaining to such distribution on free television or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable) of the Picture. If Distributor shall fail to make such payments required under Articles 18 and 19 as and when due and payable, interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the unpaid balance thereof commencing to accrue from the date payment is due.
In the event of any sale, assignment or transfer of Distributor's distribution or exhibition rights in the Picture, Distributor shall remain liable for the Residuals unless Distributor obtains an executed Distributor's Assumption Agreement from such purchaser, assignee or transferee and the Guild approves in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights. The Guild agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee. In the event the Guild is notified that such purchaser, assignee or transferee is a Qualified Distributor, as that term is defined in Paragraph 22-103, then the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be deemed automatically approved on the date the Guild receives written notice of the assumption of obligations hereunder by the Qualified Distributor. Nothing herein shall release Employer of its obligations under the Basic Agreement or any other agreement between Employer and the Guild.
-361-
22-101
If the Guild does not approve in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights, this DISTRIBUTOR'S ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT shall remain effective and binding upon Distributor, and Distributor shall be obligated to pay Residuals which accrue during the term for those territories and media for which it was granted distribution rights and all extensions and renewals. Such obligations shall be subject to Section 22-200 of the Basic Agreement. The Distributor shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 of the Basic Agreement, the issue of whether the Guild has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee for payments due hereunder.
Distributor and the Guild hereby agree that all disputes based upon, arising out of or relating to this Assumption Agreement, other than the Guild's entitlement to injunctive or other equitable relief, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions contained in the Basic Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor agrees and acknowledges that the Guild is not precluded by this or any other provision of this Assumption Agreement from obtaining from a court injunctive relief or any other legal remedy at any time prior to arbitration or issuance of an arbitration award. The right to obtain injunctive relief from a court shall be applicable whether an arbitration proceeding has or has not been initiated, and further, without limitation, shall be applicable in conjunction with a proceeding to confirm and enforce an arbitration award against Distributor.
THIS DISTRIBUTOR'S ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SAME WOULD BE APPLIED BY A FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. The Guild and Distributor agree that any arbitration or legal action or proceeding brought to interpret or enforce the provisions of this Distributor's Assumption
22-101
-362-
Agreement (including an action to compel arbitration or a petition to vacate an arbitration award) shall be held or brought in Los Angeles County, California, and Distributor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guild, at its option, may bring a legal action or proceeding outside California under the following circumstances: (i) if Distributor has no principal place of business in California; or (ii) whether or not Distributor has a principal place of business in California, to enforce or execute upon an arbitration award or court order or judgment, in any jurisdiction in which Distributor's assets are located (and Distributor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of such places for purposes of such execution or enforcement). Distributor consents to service of process by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to Distributor's general counsel or to Distributor's representative identified below or by first class mail to Distributor when Distributor has not designated a representative or a general counsel, or by any other method permitted by law.

Financial Assurances
With respect to any such motion picture produced hereunder, the Guild, prior to the commencement of principal photography of such motion picture, may require such financial assurances from Employer as it deems advisable to insure performance of Employer's obligations to pay the Residuals, including without limitation, the execution of security agreements, guarantees or other protective agreements, subject, however, to the following:
(a)	If the Guild shall require financial assurances from the Employer in the form of a security agreement for a security interest in the Picture, so long as the Residuals are timely paid with respect to all territories, media and term acquired by the Distributor in accordance with Article 18, Article 19 and/or Sideletter No. 15 of the Basic Agreement, as applicable, the Guild shall not exercise any rights under such security agreement which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Distributor to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution, provided that such Distributor has executed and delivered a Distributor's Assumption Agreement to the Guild and is in compliance with the terms thereof.
(b)	If any "Qualified Distributor," as that term is defined in Paragraph 22-106, assumes in perpetuity under the Distributor's Assumption Agreement the obligation to pay the Residuals for all territories and media with respect to the Picture or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to the Guild (which shall include the Standard
22-101
-364-
Letter of Guaranty set forth in Exhibit "B-1" of this Agreement) all of such obligations thereunder, the Guild will release and cause to be discharged of record all such security interests, liens, charges or encumbrances entered into by or obtained from such Employer and will not require further financial assurances from such Employer; provided, however, the Employer's primary liability as an Employer shall not be released thereby.
(c)	If any "Qualified Distributor" acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media (but not all territories and media) in perpetuity, and thereby has assumed responsibility for the payment of Residuals for such territories and media so acquired pursuant to the Distributor's Assumption Agreement or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to the Guild (which shall include the Standard Letter of Guaranty set forth in Exhibit "B-1" of this Agreement) all of such obligations thereunder, then if the Employer has granted or thereafter grants a security interest in favor of the Guild in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the DGA Security Agreement, the Guild: (1) agrees to modify the definition of the collateral in the DGA Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media acquired by such Qualified Distributor; and (2) acknowledges Distributor's continuing rights of full, unlimited but non-exclusive access to and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
(d)	If any "Qualified Distributor" acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media for a limited period of time, and thereby has assumed responsibility for the payment of Residuals for such term and in such territories and media pursuant to the Distributor's Assumption Agreement or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to the Guild (which shall include the Standard Letter of Guaranty set forth in Exhibit “B-1" of this Agreement) all of such obligations thereunder, then any security agreement or security interest obtained by the Guild from the Employer in connection with the Picture shall remain in effect, but the Guild agrees: (1) to modify the definition of the collateral in the DGA Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media for the term of the rights acquired by Distributor, including renewals and extensions; and (2) acknowledges Distributor's continuing rights of full, unlimited but non-exclusive access to
-365-
22-102
22-103
and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
Qualified Distributors
(a)	In addition to those distributors who have been deemed "Qualified" by the Guild due to their past bargaining relationship and/or Residuals payment history, the term "Qualified Distributor" shall mean a Distributor who satisfies the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (1) and (2) below:
(1)	Distributor has the financial history, liquidity, net earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, assets, and net worth to establish its present and future ability to pay Residuals arising from the exploitation of the Guild Pictures being distributed.
(2)	The Distributor has been in business for five (5) or more years and has a history of prompt and proper payment of Residuals pursuant to DGA contracts in five (5) consecutive years immediately prior to seeking Qualified Distributor status.
(b)	A Qualified Distributor must agree to assume Residuals obligations, or guarantee the payment of Residuals in accordance with the Qualified Distributor/Buyer Letter of Agreement, as set forth in Exhibit "A-1" of this Agreement, for each Picture produced under this Basic Agreement for the territories, media and term for which it has distribution rights and must execute the Qualified Distributor's Agreement.
(c)	In the event of a dispute as to qualifications of an applicant for Qualified Distributor status, Employer shall provide such financial assurances as the Guild may deem appropriate, which may include, but are not limited to, a security interest in the Picture and related collateral, in which case Distributor shall acknowledge same. Said security interest shall remain effective unless and until it is established by agreement or in an arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained in the Basic Agreement, that the applicant Distributor meets the
22-102
-366-
aforementioned requirements for qualification. Such applicant shall have the burden of proof that it satisfies the aforementioned requirements for qualification in any arbitration and shall, upon the Guild's request, furnish to the Guild all relevant financial or corporate information relating thereto as the Guild may reasonably require.
(d)	Any information submitted to the Guild in order to determine whether a distributor is entitled to status as a Qualified Distributor shall, at the Distributor's discretion, be subject to reasonable confidentiality arrangements.
(e)	In the event that a Qualified Distributor, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, generally fails to report and/or pay Residuals when they are due or generally fails to pay obligations to creditors when they become due or in the event a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy Code by or against a Qualified Distributor, the Guild shall have the right to terminate the Distributor's Qualified Distributor status. The Distributor shall have the right to invoke the arbitration procedures described above to challenge such termination. Pending the resolution of such challenge, the Qualified Distributor's status shall be considered terminated. The Guild agrees that it will not terminate a Qualified Distributor's status when there is a bona fide dispute as to whether Residuals are due, or a bona fide dispute as to the amount of Residuals due to the Guild, if the Distributor has otherwise timely reported and paid Residuals. In addition to the above, if a Guild audit conducted pursuant to the Basic Agreement or other financial information discloses that the Qualified Distributor no longer meets the aforementioned standards for qualification, the Guild may initiate an arbitration pursuant to the Basic Agreement to terminate the Qualified Distributor's status.

Distributor hereby agrees, expressly for the benefit of the Directors Guild of America, herein called "the Guild" or "the DGA," as representative of the Employees who rendered services on the Picture and, insofar as Supplemental Markets rights are concerned, for the benefit of the Directors Guild of America - Producer Pension Plan (hereinafter "the Pension Plan"), when the Picture is exhibited on free television, foreign television, basic cable or theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), to make the additional payments required thereby, if any, and the pension and health contributions required thereby, if any, with respect to the territories, media and term referred to above as provided in the applicable Paragraphs, Sections, Articles and/or Sideletter referred to hereinabove (all such payments are collectively hereinafter referred to as "Residuals"). Distributor, for and on behalf of the Employer, shall make all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability
22-301
-382-
insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation referred to in the preceding sentence.
It is expressly understood that the right of Distributor to license the Picture for exhibition on free television, foreign television, basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), or to exhibit or cause or permit the Picture to be exhibited on free television, foreign television, basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment of Residuals with respect to the territories, media and term referred to above in accordance with said applicable Articles. It is agreed that the Guild, in addition to all other remedies, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against Distributor in the event such payments are not made.
To the extent that Employer has executed a security agreement and financing statement in the Guild's favor in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the DGA - Employer Security Agreement ("DGA Security Interest"), Distributor agrees and acknowledges that Distributor's rights in the Picture acquired pursuant to the Distribution Agreement (to the extent those rights are included in the collateral covered by the Security Agreement) are subject and subordinate to the DGA Security Interest.
The Guild agrees that, so long as Residuals with respect to the Picture for the territories, media and term referred to above are timely paid in accordance with said applicable Paragraphs, Sections, Articles and/or Sideletter, the Guild will not exercise any rights under the DGA Security Interest which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Distributor to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution.
The Guild further agrees that if it exercises its rights as a secured party, it will dispose of collateral which encompasses any of Distributor's rights or interests in, or physical items relating to, the Picture, only to a transferee which agrees in writing to be bound by the Guild's obligations under this Assumption Agreement.
Distributor agrees to keep (i) complete records showing all cities in the United States in which the Pictures have been telecast and the
-383-
22-301
number of telecasts in each such city, the television stations on which telecast, and the dates thereof; (ii) complete records showing Distributor's Foreign Gross for the Picture(s) to the extent that such records are pertinent to the computation of payments for foreign telecasting; (iii) records showing the date on which each such Picture is first exhibited in theatrical exhibition anywhere in the world and the place of such exhibition; and (iv) complete records showing Employer's gross receipts from basic cable exhibition and from the distribution of such Picture in Supplemental Markets or New Media. The undersigned Distributor shall also keep such records as are necessary for the computation of Residuals for reruns, foreign telecasting, basic cable exhibition, theatrical exhibition, Supplemental Market use and New Media use for so long as such Residuals may be due or payable. The Guild shall have the right, at all reasonable times, to inspect any and all such records. If Distributor shall fail to make such payments as and when due and payable, Distributor shall pay late payment damages as specified in the applicable provision of the Basic Agreement, if any.
With respect to motion pictures produced mainly for the pay television and videodisc/videocassette market, Distributor shall comply with Paragraphs 20-903 and 20-904 to the extent they apply to Distributor's distribution of the motion picture.
If Distributor has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture on free television, Distributor shall give the Guild prompt written notice of the date on which the Picture is first telecast in any city in the United States for the second run and for each subsequent run thereafter. If the second or third run is on a network or run in network prime time, the notice shall state that fact.
If the Picture is distributed for foreign telecasting and if Distributor has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture for foreign telecasting, Distributor shall furnish reports to the Guild showing Distributor's Foreign Gross derived from the Picture until (i) the Picture has been withdrawn from distribution for foreign telecasting; or (ii) the Director(s) of the Picture has (have) received the full additional payments for such foreign telecasting to which they are entitled pursuant to the Basic Agreement. Such reports shall be rendered to the Guild on a quarterly basis during the first three (3) years in which the
22-301
-384-
Picture is distributed for foreign telecasting, on a semi-annual basis for the next following two (2) years, and on an annual basis thereafter.
If the Picture is distributed in Supplemental Markets and if Distributor has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture in Supplemental Markets, Distributor shall furnish reports to the Guild, quarterly during each calendar year, showing Distributor's gross receipts derived from such Supplemental Market use for as long as Distributor receives any such gross receipts.
If the Picture is distributed theatrically and if Distributor has acquired the rights to exhibit the Picture theatrically, the Distributor shall give prompt written notice to the Guild of the date on which the Picture is first exhibited theatrically (i) in the United States, its commonwealths, territories and possessions and Canada and/or (ii) in all other countries.
If the Picture is distributed on basic cable and if Distributor has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture on basic cable, the Distributor shall furnish reports to the Guild, quarterly during each calendar year, showing Distributor's gross receipts derived from such distribution for so long as Distributor receives any such gross receipts.
Distributor agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable requests from the Guild as to whether the Picture is currently being rerun on television, distributed for foreign telecasting, on basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media. An inadvertent failure to comply with any of the notice or reporting provisions hereof shall not constitute a default by Distributor hereunder, provided said failure is cured promptly after written notice thereof from the Guild.
In the event of any sale, assignment or transfer of Distributor's distribution or exhibition rights in the Picture, Distributor shall remain liable for the Residuals unless Distributor obtains an executed Television Distributor's Assumption Agreement from such purchaser, assignee or transferee and the Guild approves in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights. The Guild agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee. In the event that such purchaser, assignee or transferee is a Qualified Residual
-385-
22-301
Payor, the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be deemed automatically approved on the date the Guild receives written notice of the assumption of obligations hereunder by the Qualified Residual Payor. Nothing herein shall release Employer of its obligations under the Basic Agreement or any other agreement between Employer and the Guild.
If the Guild does not approve in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights, this TELEVISION DISTRIBUTOR'S ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT shall remain effective and binding upon Distributor, and Distributor shall be obligated to pay Residuals which accrue during the term for those territories and media for which it was granted distribution rights and all extensions and renewals. The Distributor shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 hereof, the issue of whether the Guild has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee for payments due hereunder.
Distributor and the Guild hereby agree that all disputes based upon, arising out of or relating to this Assumption Agreement, other than the Guild's entitlement to injunctive or other equitable relief, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions contained in the Basic Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor agrees and acknowledges that the Guild is not precluded by this or any other provision of this Assumption Agreement from obtaining from a court injunctive relief or any other legal remedy at any time prior to arbitration or issuance of an arbitration award. The right to obtain injunctive relief from a court shall be applicable whether an arbitration proceeding has or has not been initiated and, further, without limitation, shall be applicable in conjunction with a proceeding to confirm and enforce an arbitration award against Distributor.
THIS TELEVISION DISTRIBUTOR'S ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SAME WOULD BE APPLIED BY A FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
22-301

The Guild and Distributor agree that any arbitration or legal action or proceeding brought to interpret or enforce the provisions of this Television Distributor's Assumption Agreement (including an action to compel arbitration or a petition to vacate an arbitration award) shall be held or brought in Los Angeles County, California, and Distributor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guild at its option may bring a legal action or proceeding outside California under the following circumstances: (i) if Distributor has no principal place of business in California; or (ii) whether or not Distributor has a principal place of business in California, to enforce or execute upon an arbitration award or court order or judgment, in any jurisdiction in which Distributor's assets are located (and Distributor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of such places for purposes of such execution or enforcement).

Buyer hereby agrees, expressly for the benefit of the Directors Guild of America, hereinafter called "the DGA" or "the Guild," as representative of the Employees who rendered services on the Picture and, insofar as Supplemental Markets rights are concerned, for the benefit of the Directors Guild of America -Producer Pension Plan (hereinafter "the Pension Plan"), when exhibited on free television, foreign television, basic cable or exhibited theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), to assume and be bound by Employer's obligation thereunder to make the additional payments required thereby, if any, with respect to the territories and media referred to above and the pension and health contributions required thereby, if any, as provided in the applicable Paragraphs, Sections, Articles and/or Sideletter referred to hereinabove (all such payments are collectively hereinafter referred to as "Residuals"). Buyer, for and on behalf of the Employer, shall make all Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance
-395-
22-304
payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation referred to in the preceding sentence.
It is expressly understood that the right of Buyer to license the Picture for exhibition on free television, foreign television, basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), or to exhibit or cause or permit the Picture to be exhibited on free television, foreign television, basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media (as applicable), shall be subject to and conditioned upon the prompt payment of Residuals with respect to the territories and media referred to above in accordance with said applicable Section(s). It is agreed that the Guild, in addition to all other remedies, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against Buyer in the event such payments are not made.
To the extent that Employer has executed a security agreement and financing statement in the Guild's favor in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the DGA - Employer Security Agreement ("DGA Security Interest"), Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Buyer's rights to the Picture acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (to the extent those rights are included in the collateral covered by the Security Agreement) are subject and subordinate to the DGA Security Interest. Buyer further agrees to execute a security agreement, mortgage of copyright, UCC-1, and other UCC documentation and any other document required under the Basic Agreement or necessary or desirable in the Guild's discretion to continue the DGA Security Interest. The Guild agrees that, so long as Residuals with respect to the Picture for all the territories and media referred to above are timely paid in accordance with said applicable Paragraphs, Sections, Articles and/or Sideletter, the Guild will not exercise any rights under the DGA Security Interest which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Buyer to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution.
The Guild further agrees that if it exercises its rights as a secured party, it will dispose of collateral which encompasses any of Buyer's rights or interests in, or physical items relating to, the
22-304
-396-
Picture, only to a transferee which agrees in writing to be bound by the Guild's obligations under this Assumption Agreement.
Buyer agrees to keep (i) complete records showing all cities in the United States in which the Pictures have been telecast and the number of telecasts in each such city, the television stations on which telecast, and the dates thereof; (ii) complete records showing Distributor's Foreign Gross for the Picture(s) to the extent that such records are pertinent to the computation of payments for foreign telecasting; (iii) records showing the date on which each such Picture is first exhibited in theatrical exhibition anywhere in the world and the place of such exhibition; and (iv) complete records showing Employer's gross receipts from basic cable exhibition and from the distribution of such Picture in Supplemental Markets and New Media. The undersigned Buyer shall also keep such records as are necessary for the computation of Residuals for reruns, foreign telecasting, basic cable exhibition, theatrical exhibition, Supplemental Market and New Media use for so long as such Residuals may be due or payable. With respect to motion pictures produced mainly for the pay television and videodisc/videocassette market, Buyer shall comply with Paragraphs 20-903 and 20-904 to the extent they apply to Buyer's distribution of the motion picture. The Guild shall have the right, at all reasonable times, to inspect any and all such records. If Buyer shall fail to make such payments as and when due and payable, Buyer shall pay late payment damages as specified in the applicable provision of the Basic Agreement, if any.
In the event of any sale, assignment or transfer of Buyer's distribution or exhibition rights in the Picture, Buyer shall remain liable for the Residuals, with respect to the territories, media and term referred to above, unless Buyer obtains an executed Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement and other documents required by the Guild from such purchaser, assignee or transferee and the Guild approves in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights. The Guild agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee. Nothing herein shall release the Employer of its obligations under the Basic
-397-
22-304
Agreement or any other agreement between Employer and the Guild relating to the Picture, unless the Employer has been relieved of liability pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph 22-304.
If the Guild does not approve in writing the financial responsibility of the party obtaining such rights, this Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement shall remain effective and binding upon Buyer.
Buyer and the Guild hereby agree that all disputes based upon, arising out of or relating to this Assumption Agreement, other than the Guild's entitlement to injunctive or other equitable relief, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions contained in Article 2 of the Basic Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the Guild is not precluded by this or any other provision of this Assumption Agreement from obtaining from a court injunctive relief or any other legal remedy at any time prior to arbitration or issuance of an arbitration award. The right to obtain injunctive relief from a court shall be applicable whether an arbitration proceeding has or has not been initiated and, further, without limitation, shall be applicable in conjunction with a proceeding to confirm and enforce an arbitration award against Buyer.
If Buyer has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture on free television, Buyer shall give the Guild prompt written notice of the date on which the Picture is first telecast in any city in the United States for the second run and for each subsequent run thereafter. If the second or third run is on a network or the run is in network prime time, the notice shall state that fact.
If the Picture is distributed for foreign telecasting and if Buyer has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture for foreign telecasting, Buyer shall furnish reports to the Guild showing "Buyer's Foreign Gross" derived from the Picture until the Picture has been withdrawn from distribution for foreign telecasting. Such reports shall be rendered to the Guild on a quarterly basis during the first three (3) years in which the Picture is distributed
22-304
-398-
for foreign telecasting, on a semi-annual basis for the next following two (2) years, and on an annual basis thereafter.
If the Picture is distributed in Supplemental Markets and if Buyer has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture in Supplemental Markets, Buyer shall furnish reports to the Guild, quarterly during each calendar year, showing Buyer's gross receipts derived from such Supplemental Market use for as long as Buyer receives any such gross receipts.
If the Picture is distributed theatrically and if Buyer has acquired the rights to exhibit the Picture theatrically, the Buyer shall give prompt written notice to the Guild of the date on which the Picture is first exhibited theatrically (i) in the United States, its commonwealths, territories and possessions and Canada and/or (ii) in all other countries.
If the Picture is distributed on basic cable and if Buyer has acquired the rights to distribute the Picture on basic cable, the Buyer shall furnish reports to the Guild, quarterly during each calendar year, showing Buyer's gross receipts derived from such distribution for so long as Buyer receives any such gross receipts.
Buyer agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable requests from the Guild as to whether the Picture is currently being rerun on television, distributed for foreign telecasting, on basic cable, theatrically or in Supplemental Markets or New Media. An inadvertent failure to comply with any of the notice or reporting provisions hereof shall not constitute a default by Buyer hereunder, provided said failure is cured promptly after written notice thereof from the Guild.
THIS TELEVISION BUYER'S ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SAME WOULD BE APPLIED BY A FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. The Guild and Buyer agree that any arbitration or legal action or proceeding brought to interpret or
-399-
22-304
enforce the provisions of this Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement (including an action to compel arbitration or a petition to vacate an arbitration award) shall be held or brought in Los Angeles County, California, and Buyer irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guild, at its option, may bring a legal action or proceeding outside California under the following circumstances: (i) if Buyer has no principal place of business in California; or (ii) whether or not Buyer has a principal place of business in California, to enforce or execute upon an arbitration award or court order or judgment, in any jurisdiction in which Buyer's assets are located (and Buyer irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of such places for purposes of such execution or enforcement). Buyer consents to service of process by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to Buyer's general counsel or to Buyer's representative identified below or by first class mail to Buyer when Buyer has not designated a representative or a general counsel, or by any other method permitted by law.

BUYER'S REPRESENTATIVE OR GENERAL COUNSEL
(b)	The Employer agrees to deliver to the Guild an executed copy of the above referred to Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement within thirty (30) days after the sale, assignment or transfer of such motion picture, with the name and address of the purchaser or assignee.
(c)	Any inadvertent failure on the part of the Buyer to comply with any of the reporting provisions of this Paragraph 22-304(a) shall
22-304
-400-
in no event constitute a default by the Employer or such Buyer or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice in writing thereof from the Directors Guild of America.
(d)	Upon delivery of such Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement and other documents from Buyer required under this Assumption Agreement and on condition that the Guild approves in writing the financial responsibility of the purchaser, assignee or transferee, Employer shall not be further liable for the keeping of any such records, or for the payment of Residuals in accordance with said applicable Section, it being agreed that the purchaser, assignee or transferee shall solely be liable therefor.
The Guild agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee, it being further agreed that if the Guild, within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of written notice of any such sale, assignment or transfer, has not advised the Employer that it disapproves the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee, the Guild will be deemed to have approved the financial responsibility thereof. If any such purchaser, assignee or transferee is a Qualified Residual Payor, then the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be deemed automatically approved. In the event the Guild advises the Employer within such twenty-one (21) day period that it disapproves the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee and Employer disputes such disapproval, the Employer shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 hereof, the issue of whether the Guild has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee for payments due hereunder.
22-305	Financial Security
To the extent that Employer has granted a security interest in favor of the Guild in the Picture and related collateral as defined in any DGA Security Agreement, Buyer's rights in the Picture acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall be subject to the following:
-401-
22-305
(a)	So long as the Buyer timely pays Residuals for the Picture with respect to all territories and media in which Buyer has distribution rights in accordance with Articles 11, 18, 20, 23, 24 and/or Sideletter No. 15 of this Basic Agreement, as applicable, the Guild shall not exercise any rights under such security agreement which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Buyer to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution, provided that such Buyer has executed and delivered a Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement to the Guild and is in compliance with the terms thereof.
(b)	If any "Qualified Residual Payor," as that term is defined in Paragraph 22-306, assumes in perpetuity under the Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement the obligation to pay the Residuals for all territories and media with respect to the Picture or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to the Guild (which shall include the Standard Letter of Guaranty set forth in Exhibit "B-2" of this Agreement) all of such obligations thereunder, the Guild will release and cause to be discharged of record all such security interests, liens, charges or encumbrances entered into or obtained from such Employer and will not require further financial assurances from such Employer.
(c)	If any "Qualified Residual Payor" acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media (but not all territories and media) in perpetuity, and has assumed responsibility for the payment of Residuals for such territories and media so acquired pursuant to the Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to the Guild (which shall include the Standard Letter of Guaranty set forth as Exhibit "B-2" of this Agreement) all of such obligations thereunder, then if the Employer has granted a security interest in favor of the Guild in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the DGA Security Agreement, the Guild: (1) agrees to modify the definition of the collateral in the DGA Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media acquired by such Qualified Residual Payor; and (2) acknowledges Qualified Residual Payor's continuing rights of full, unlimited but non-exclusive access to and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
22-305
-402-
22-306
Qualified Residual Payor
(a)	In addition to those buyers who have been deemed "Qualified" by the Guild due to their past bargaining relationship and/or Residuals payment history, the term "Qualified Residual Payor" shall mean a Buyer who satisfies the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (1) and (2) below:
(1)	Buyer has the financial history, liquidity, net earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, assets, and net worth to establish its present and future ability to pay all Residuals arising from the exploitation of the Guild Pictures being distributed.
(2)	The Buyer has been in business for five (5) or more years and has a history of prompt and proper payment of Residuals pursuant to the Guild contracts in five (5) consecutive years immediately prior to seeking Qualified Buyer status.
(b)	A Qualified Residual Payor shall have the right to elect, with respect to each DGA Picture for which it has distribution rights, whether or not to assume Residuals obligations or guarantee the payment of Residuals in accordance with the Qualified Residual Payor's Letter of Agreement, for the territories and media for which it has distribution rights. However, the Qualified Residual Payor shall be entitled to the rights of a Qualified Residual Payor hereunder only when it elects to so assume such obligations or so guarantee the payment of Residuals.
(c)	In the event of a dispute as to qualifications of an applicant for Qualified Residual Payor status, Employer shall provide such financial assurances as the Guild may deem appropriate, which may include, but are not limited to, a security interest in the Picture and related collateral, in which case Buyer shall acknowledge same. Said security interest shall remain effective unless and until it is established by agreement or in an arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained in the Basic Agreement, that the applicant Buyer meets the aforementioned requirements for qualification. Such applicant shall have the
-403-
22-306
burden of proof that it satisfies the aforementioned requirements for qualification in any arbitration and shall, upon the Guild's request, furnish to the Guild all relevant financial or corporate information relating thereto as the Guild may reasonably require.
(d)	Any information submitted to the Guild in order to determine whether a Buyer is entitled to status as a Qualified Residual Payor shall, at the Buyer's discretion, be subject to reasonable confidentiality arrangements.
(e)	In the event a Qualified Residual Payor, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, generally fails to report and/or pay Residuals when they are due or generally fails to pay obligations to creditors when they become due or in the event a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy Code by or against a Qualified Residual Payor, the Guild shall have the right to terminate such Qualified Residual Payor status. The Qualified Residual Payor shall have the right to invoke the arbitration procedures described above to challenge such termination. Pending the resolution of such challenge, the Qualified Residual Payor's status shall be considered terminated. The Guild agrees that it will not terminate a Qualified Residual Payor's status when there is a bona fide dispute over whether Residuals are due to the Guild, or a bona fide dispute as to the amount of Residuals due to the Guild, if the Distributor has otherwise timely reported and paid Residuals. In addition to the above, if a Guild audit conducted pursuant to the Basic Agreement or other financial information discloses that the Qualified Residual Payor no longer meets the aforementioned standards for qualification, the Guild may initiate an arbitration pursuant to the Television Agreement to terminate the Qualified Residual Payor's status.
Section 22-400
EMPLOYER'S DISSOLUTION
If Employer dissolves and if a Distributor assumes all of the obligations of the Employer for the payment of Residuals, and the financial responsibility of the Distributor is approved by the Guild in its discretion, then Employer shall thereupon be released of any obligation with respect to any payments due hereunder.
22-306
-404-
Section 22-500 ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT NOT REQUIRED
No television network, station, sponsor or advertising agency shall be required to execute any Television Distributor's Assumption Agreement or Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement, unless it is the distributor of such television motion picture or the buyer of the Employer's television rights in such motion picture, as the case may be.

23-104	Residual Compensation24
(a)	Residuals for basic cable re-use in the United States and Canada will be the following percentages of the applicable residual base:
Run	Percentage of Residual Base25

10th	3.5%
11th	3.0%
12th	2.5%
Each run thereafter	1.5%
(b)	If the program is run on “domestic” syndicated free television after the ten (10) runs and after one (1) year following its first exhibition on basic cable, then the residuals for such free television runs shall be two percent (2%) of the “Employer’s Gross” derived from the distribution of the Program on domestic free television.
(c)	If the program is run on “domestic” syndicated free television (excluding the first sale in Canada) before the program has had ten (10) runs on basic cable or sooner than one (1) year following
24 See modifications to this paragraph in Sideletter No. 34 re License of Free Television, Basic Cable or Pay Television Motion Pictures to Secondary Digital Channels and Sideletter No. 41 re Second or Subsequent License of High Budget Dramatic Programs Made for Basic Cable to a Different Basic Cable Service.

the program’s initial exhibition on basic cable, then the residuals for such free television runs must be paid according to the percentages contained in Paragraph 11-101(b)(3) of this Agreement. The first run of the program on domestic free television shall be deemed the second run under Article 11 of this Agreement.
As an alternative to the foregoing, if an Employer licenses a high budget dramatic motion picture made for the basic cable market for exhibition in syndication only in Canada, it shall have the option to elect to pay to the Director thereof four percent (4%) of the ‘Employer’s gross receipts’ (as defined in Paragraph 11-108) derived therefrom, in lieu of any other compensation required under this or any prior Agreement, as applicable, and such exhibition shall not count as a “run” for purposes of calculating residuals under this Article 23. The foregoing applies to programs, whether produced under this Basic Agreement or any prior Basic Agreement, as to which residuals would otherwise be payable.
(d)	The term “Employer’s gross,” as used herein, is defined in the same manner as that term is used in Article 18 of this Agreement with respect to the pay television exhibition of a free television program, but only to the extent of the “Employer’s gross” derived from the distribution of the program on domestic free television.
(e)	No residuals shall be due for the “first sale” of a program in Canada. The first sale is limited to the first license agreement (which may not exceed five (5) years), except that the DGA shall not unreasonably withhold a waiver of the five (5) year limitation in the event of an outright sale (rather than a license of a program) with a Canadian broadcast service (which may be a free television, pay television or basic cable service).
(f)	All other reuse payments will be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Except as provided herein, these programs will be treated in all respects as programs made for syndication with all terms and conditions as per this Agreement.

As of July 1, 2014
Dear __________________:
Reference is made to the provisions of Article 22(b) of the Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement of 2014 ("Basic Agreement").
The Directors Guild of America ("the DGA" or "the Guild") hereby agrees that the undersigned Company satisfies the requirements for Qualified Residual Payor status with respect to each television motion picture produced under a DGA contract for which the undersigned Company, or any of the additional companies identified below, has distribution rights and has agreed to be bound by, perform, or guarantee the performance of, all the obligations to be performed by a Distributor/Buyer pursuant to the Distributor's or Buyer's Assumption Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto, and to adhere or guarantee adherence to all other provisions in Article 22(b) of the Basic Agreement including, without limitation, the arbitration provisions ("Such Picture"), subject to the following conditions:
1.	The undersigned Company shall, promptly after acquisition, notify the Guild in writing of the territories, media and term of distribution rights in Such Picture which the undersigned Company, or any of the companies identified below, hereafter acquires.
2.	As to Such Picture, the undersigned Company shall be afforded all of the rights, and assume all of the obligations, of a Qualified Residual Payor under the Basic Agreement.
3.	With respect to any Such Picture for which the undersigned Company is acting as a guarantor, it agrees to execute and deliver, in a form acceptable to the Guild (which may include the Standard Letter of Guaranty), an
EXHIBIT "A-2"

unconditional guarantee of payment of all Residuals and any obligations related to the reporting or payment of Residuals under the Basic Agreement.
4.	With respect to any Such Picture for which the undersigned Company has agreed to guarantee the payment of Residuals and performance of all other obligations of a Qualified Residual Payor, the undersigned Company also agrees that the Guild may arbitrate against it disputes under this Letter of Agreement or under the Basic Agreement which relate to the performance of the obligations guaranteed pursuant to this Letter of Agreement to the same extent as it would be able to arbitrate such disputes against the Distributor/Buyer of a DGA Picture. The Guild may initiate an arbitration against the undersigned Company in the event of a default by the signatory employer or other obligor without being required to arbitrate against employer or other obligor. Any arbitration shall be pursuant to the arbitration provisions of the Basic Agreement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to waive any rights and remedies that the Guild may have against the Employer when the undersigned Company is acting as guarantor. Notwithstanding the above, the Guild agrees not to initiate any claim or demand for arbitration against the Qualified Residual Payor as guarantor unless and until it has first made a written demand on the Employer and such demand remains unsatisfied for a period of not less than thirty (30) days.
5.	THIS QUALIFIED RESIDUAL PAYOR'S LETTER OF AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SAME WOULD BE APPLIED BY A FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Guild and the Company agree that any arbitration or legal action or proceeding brought to interpret or enforce the provisions of this Letter of Agreement shall be held or brought in Los Angeles County, California, and Company irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guild, at its option, may bring a legal action or proceeding outside California under the following circumstances: (a) if the Company has no principal place of business in California; or (b) whether or not the Company has a principal place of business in California, to enforce or execute upon an arbitration award or court order or judgment,
EXHIBIT "A-2"

in any jurisdiction in which the Company's assets are located (and the Company irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of such places for purposes of such execution or enforcement). The Company consents to service of process by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Company's general counsel or the Company's representative identified below or by first class mail to the Company when the Company has not designated a representative or a general counsel, or by any other method permitted by law.
6.	The undersigned Company acknowledges and agrees that the Guild may revoke its Qualified Residual Payor status pursuant to the provisions of the Basic Agreement. Likewise, the Guild agrees that the undersigned Company may, after an initial term of not less than two (2) years, rescind its Qualified Residual Payor status upon ninety (90) days notice to the Guild.

7.	In the event of revocation by either the Guild or the Qualified Residual Payor, the undersigned Company agrees that it shall continue to be bound to the obligations of this Letter of Agreement with respect to all Such Pictures distributed by the Qualified Residual Payor prior to revocation.
8.	This Letter of Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any rights hereunder be waived, except in a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the modifications, amendment or waiver is sought.
9.	This Letter of Agreement does not create, and shall not be construed as creating, any rights enforceable by the Employer of any Such Picture or by any other person not a party to this Agreement.
10.	If any provision of this Letter of Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Letter of Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

When completing this report, the employment statistics must be reported in order that two (2) types of statistics can be obtained; the first statistic will indicate the number of persons employed in the respective category (referenced above) during that quarter. The second statistic will indicate the number of days worked or guaranteed in the respective categories for that quarter. Therefore, in each category there will be two (2) separate sets of statistics, one on top of the other separated by a horizontal slash (example below). The top statistic will represent the number of employees working. The bottom statistic will be the number of days worked during the same quarter.
Example:

1.	(a) Reference is made to Article 20 of the Basic Agreement and
Article 29 of the FLTTA.
(b)	Subject to Paragraph 2(c) hereof, each Employer shall make payments to the Administrator as required in said Articles ("Fund Payments").
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 460 -
(c)	Each Employer shall also pay the following amounts to the Administrator with respect to each Fund Payment made by such Employer:
(i)	Pension and health and welfare contributions (collectively the "P, H & W Contributions"), if any, which such Employer would have owed if the Employer had made the Fund Payments directly to the applicable Director or, if applicable, to the Director's loan-out company.
(ii)	Social security taxes, federal and/or state unemployment insurance taxes or contributions, state disability benefit contributions, workers' compensation premiums, and any other employment taxes and/or premiums (such type of taxes and premiums collective referred to as "Employment Taxes and Premiums"), if any, which such Employer would have been required to pay if such Employer had made the Fund Payments directly to the applicable Director or, if applicable, to the Director's loan-out company.
It is understood that in those instances in which the Employer would not have been required to make a payment of a type specified in Paragraph 1(c)(i) and 1(c)(ii) because the applicable ceiling has been exceeded, because payment is to a loan-out company or for any other reason, then no payment of that type is required by this Exhibit.
(d)	No later than thirty (30) days after each calendar quarter, each Employer shall pay to the Administrator all such payments which become due and payable during the preceding calendar quarter.
(e)	All payments and other communications by the Employer to the Administrator shall be made to the Administrator at its office, which shall be in Los Angeles, California.
2.	(a) The Administrator accepts the duties hereby assigned to it and
shall establish administrative machinery and processes appropriate to its duties hereunder. The Administrator shall, as soon as practicable after receipt of Employer's payments, distribute the Employees' Share of the Fund (defined hereafter), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in said Articles 20 and 29, in accordance with the written instructions set forth in Exhibit E-1(A), to Employees covered by the Basic Agreement and the FLTTA and distribute the P, H & W
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 461 -
Contributions, including the Employees' 21Z>% contribution, to the Pension and Health and Welfare Plans.
The "Employees' Share of the Fund" is an amount equal to the sum of the Employers' payments pursuant to Paragraph 1 hereof plus any net earnings of the Fund less:
(i)	All expenses reasonably incurred in the administration of the Fund, including the compensation of the Administrator herein provided and appropriate insurance premiums;
(ii	) Amounts reasonably reserved by the Administrator as an operating fund, and for contingencies; and
(ii	i) The Employer's share of all Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions due with respect to actual distributions from the Fund to Employees.
Upon the death of an Employee entitled to a payment hereunder, the Administrator shall distribute such payment to the beneficiary designated by the Employee pursuant to the Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension and Health and Welfare Funds; and if no beneficiary is so designated, then to the surviving spouse of such Employee; and if there be no such person, to the Employee's estate.
(b)	The Employers, individually and collectively, hereby irrevocably designate the Administrator as their agent to pay from the Fund to the appropriate governmental agencies or other parties all Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions. The Administrator shall prepare and file on behalf of the Employers all returns and reports due with respect to such Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions and shall pay all such Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions out of the Fund. In addition, the Administrator shall prepare and file all federal, state and local income, property, and other tax returns due with respect to the income and property of the Fund and shall pay all such taxes out of the Fund. The Administrator shall make all deductions and withholdings from the Employees' Share of the Fund required by law or contract and the types and amounts of such deductions and withholdings to be made with respect to a distribution to a
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 462 -
particular Employee shall be determined as if such distribution had been paid to such Employee or, if applicable, such Employee's loan-out company, directly by the Employer who made the Fund Payments as to which such distribution relates. The Administrator shall timely make all such reports and payments to governmental agencies, and shall also timely deliver to each Employee such reports or information returns (including, but not limited to, Forms W-2 and/or 1099), as may be required by law to be delivered with respect to the allocation and distribution to such Employee of such Employee's share of the Fund Payments.
(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator shall refund to each Employer that part of the Employer's payment to the Fund representing a part or all of said Employer's portion of the total Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions which the Employer, before distribution thereof by the Administrator, may request be refunded to it. Any such refund and all reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, which are necessary for payment, and reporting or filing with respect thereto, of any such Employment Taxes or Premiums and P, H & W Contributions to the relevant governmental agency or other party by each Employer shall be transmitted to each Employer by the Administrator so as to enable the Employer to timely, accurately and completely make such payments and reports or filings. If a refund is made to an Employer under this Paragraph 2(c), the Administrator shall not be responsible for payment, or reporting or filing, of such Employer's Employment Taxes or Premiums and P, H & W Contributions so refunded. Should any government agency or authority require information, returns, reports or other material in regard to Employment Taxes or Premiums payable with respect to any Fund Payments to be filed or reported by any Employer, rather than the Fund (even though payment of such Employment Taxes or Premiums are made by the Fund), or should any Employer request that it, rather than the Fund, file or report such information, returns, reports or other material, the Administrator shall transmit to the Employer all such reports, returns, information or other material, completed in proper form for reporting or filing, so as to enable the Employer to make such filing or reporting timely, completely and accurately. Any claim for refund or adjustment of any Employment Taxes and Premiums shall be made by the Employer entitled thereto, or by the Administrator, as may be required by law, and the benefit of any such refund or adjustment shall belong to such Employer.
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 463 -
For purposes of this Paragraph 2(c), the term "Employer" shall include any party which has undertaken, pursuant to the Basic Agreement and/or the FLTTA, an Employer's obligation to make payments to the Fund and any other party which has acted as agent on behalf of an Employer with respect to payment to the Fund.
(d)	The Guild and the Employers agree to furnish to the Administrator all data in their possession or subject to their control which is necessary and proper to assist in orderly and accurate distributions to Employees, and to request the Trustees of the Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension and Health and Welfare Funds to do likewise.
(e)	The Administrator shall indemnify and hold the Employers harmless out of the Fund against any liability for making any of the payments to the Employees and the Pension and Health and Welfare Plans under Paragraph 2(a) hereof or any payments of Employment Taxes and Premiums which may be required to be made by the Administrator under Paragraph 2(b) hereof, it being the express intent of the parties that all such payments are to be made out of the Fund with no further cost or expense of any kind whatsoever to the Employers. Without limitation of the foregoing, prior to the delivery of any funds to the Administrator, the Administrator shall furnish proof of insurance coverage relating to employee dishonesty and errors and omissions, in an amount and with a company satisfactory to the Employers and the Guild, to guarantee the full and faithful performance of its duties.
(f)	In making distribution to Employees hereunder, the Administrator shall clearly and legibly display the following legend on all checks, vouchers, letters or documents of transmittal: "This is a special payment to you by the Employers who are operating under the Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement of 2014 and the Directors Guild of America Freelance Live and Tape Television Agreement of 2014."
3.	(a) Nothing contained herein shall create any cause of action in
favor of any Employee as defined in the Basic Agreement or in the FLTTA against any Employer but the Guild may enforce distribution of the Employees' Share of the Fund on behalf of the Employees.
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 464 -
(b)	The Administrator shall deposit all money and property received by it, with or without interest, in a segregated account with any bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and having capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the "depository"); provided, however, that if Canadian dollars are received by the Administrator and it is not feasible or desirable to convert such Canadian dollars into United States funds, such Canadian funds and any securities purchased therewith may be deposited in the Chartered Bank of the Dominion of Canada, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The Administrator shall have the right and power to invest and reinvest the said money and property only in federally insured deposits of the depository and bonds and other direct obligations of the United States of America (and, to the extent permitted above for the depositing of funds in Canada, of the Dominion of Canada) without regard to the proportion which any such investment or investments may bear to the entire amount of the Fund and to sell, exchange and otherwise deal with such investments as the Administrator may seem desirable.
(c)	Parties dealing with the Administrator shall not be required to look to the application of any monies paid to the Administrator.
(d)	The Administrator consents to act as Administrator hereunder upon the express understanding that it shall not be liable under any circumstances for loss or damage resulting from anything done or omitted in good faith, and further, this understanding shall not be limited or restricted by any reference to or inference from any general or special provisions herein contained or otherwise. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator shall not be subject to any personal liability for monies received and expended in accordance with the provisions hereof.
(e)	Within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar or fiscal year, the Administrator shall furnish, at the Employer's request, a statement of its operations to each Employer making payments to the Administrator. Such statements shall set forth in detail the monies distributed by the Administrator during the immediately preceding calendar or fiscal year, and such other information and data as shall be appropriate to inform fully the recipients of such statements.
(f)	The Administrator, at all times without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, shall keep full and accurate records and accounts concerning all
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 465 -
transactions involving the receipt and expenditure of monies hereunder and the investment and reinvestment thereof, all in convenient form and pursuant to approved and recognized accounting practices. Each Employer and the Guild shall have the right from time to time, without limitation to the duration of this Agreement, and at all reasonable times during business hours, to have their respective duly authorized agents examine and audit the Administrator's records and accounts for the purpose of verifying any statements and payments made by the Administrator pursuant to this Agreement, during a period not exceeding two (2) years preceding such examination. The Administrator shall afford all necessary facilities to such authorized agents to make such examination and audit and to make extracts and excerpts from said records and accounts as may be necessary or proper according to approved and recognized accounting practices.
(g)	The Administrator shall recognize and honor lawful assignments to the Guild of a portion of the payments to which any Employee shall become entitled hereunder. Payments may not otherwise be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, or made subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.
4.	The compensation of the Administrator shall be set forth in Exhibit E-1(B) hereto attached, and shall be paid out of the funds and property in the hands of the Administrator as set forth therein.
5.	(a) The Administrator may resign at any time by thirty (30) days'
written notice to the Employers and the Guild. A successor Administrator shall thereupon be selected by the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers ("AMPTP") and the Guild. If the AMPTP and the Guild cannot agree on a successor Administrator, the selection of the successor Administrator shall be submitted to arbitration under Article 2 of the Basic Agreement. The successor Administrator's appointment shall become effective upon the Administrator's acceptance of this Agreement, including Exhibit E-1(B) hereto.
(b)	The Administrator shall be subject to removal at any time by the mutual agreement of the AMPTP and the Guild.
(c)	The Administrator shall be removed if the Administrator is guilty of malfeasance or neglect of duty hereunder, or shall fail to provide evidence of insurance coverage as provided in Paragraph 2(e) hereof, or, if an individual, the
EXHIBIT "E-1"
- 466 -
Administrator becomes unable to perform his or her duties hereunder by reason of illness or other incapacity, or, if an accountant, shall cease to be licensed or shall be suspended from practicing as an accountant admitted to practice in the State of California or before the Internal Revenue Service. If the AMPTP and the Guild cannot agree that there are grounds for removal, such dispute between the AMPTP and the Guild respecting the removal of the Administrator for the reasons aforesaid shall be submitted to arbitration under Article 2 of the Basic Agreement.
(d)	Upon the death of the Administrator, if an individual, or the removal of the Administrator, a successor Administrator shall be appointed in the manner designated in Paragraph 5(a) hereof.
(e)	No Administrator under this Agreement shall be a representative of any labor organization or a representative of employees within the meaning of Section 302(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.
6.	This Agreement shall be governed, construed and regulated in all respects by the laws of the State of California.
7.	This Agreement may be amended at any time and from time to time in writing by the AMPTP, acting on behalf of the Employers, and by the Guild.
8.	Upon termination of the Fund, any amount exceeding the Employees' Share of the Fund, expenses for administering and winding up the business of the Fund and Employment Taxes and Premiums due shall be distributed to the Pension Plan.
9.	All notices, requests, demands and other communications to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person or, if mailed, forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, addressed to the parties at the addresses set forth after their names below (or at such other address as a party hereto may direct by notice given pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph).

Instructions to Pay TV Fund Administrator
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in other provisions of the Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement of 2014 ("BA") and the Directors Guild of America Freelance Live and Tape Television Agreement of 2014 ("FLTTA"), the percentage interest of a particular Employee (or, if applicable, an Employee's loan-out company) with respect to a particular Fund Payment and the amount of Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions, or other amounts to be withheld and paid over by the Administrator shall be determined according to these instructions.
1.	The percentage interests of an Employee shall be determined as follows:
(a)	Under the BA, the percentage interest of the Director(s) of a "covered motion picture" shall be 83.3%, the percentage interest of the Unit Production Manager(s) shall be 6.5%, the percentage interest of the First Assistant Director(s) shall be 6.2% and the percentage interest of the Key Second Assistant Director(s) shall be 4.0%.
(b)	Under the FLTTA, the percentage interest of the Director(s) of a "covered program" shall be 83.3%, the percentage interest of the Associate Director(s) shall be 8.35% and the percentage interest of the Stage Manager(s) shall be 8.35%.
(c)	If more than one Employee in one of the categories mentioned above renders services, subject to the BA or FLTTA, in connection with a "covered motion picture" or "covered program," the allocation of each such Employee's respective portion of the share for such category shall be determined by the Guild, and the Employees shall be bound by such determination.
(d)	If no Employee in a category mentioned above (excluding Director) performed services in connection with a "covered motion picture" or "covered program," the share for such category shall be allocated to the Director(s) thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Employee in a category mentioned
EXHIBIT "E-1(A)"
- 469 -
above (other than the Director) has been assigned to a ninety (90) minutes or longer "covered motion picture" or "covered program," the share for such category shall be paid to the Directors Guild of America - Producer Health Plan.
2.	For purposes of determining the amounts of (a) Employment Taxes and Premiums and P, H & W Contributions to be paid by the Administrator on behalf of a particular Employer with respect to an individual Employee, or (b) the amounts to be withheld from such Employee's share and paid over to any entitled governmental agency or other person, such Employee shall be deemed to have received compensation from such Employer in an amount determined by the formula A times B times C divided by D where:
A = The amount of the Fund Payment paid into the Fund during the Accounting Period with respect to the "covered motion picture" or "covered program" for which the computation is being made.
B = The Employees' percentage interest (expressed as a decimal) in the Fund Payment with respect to which the computation is being made, such percentage interest to be as determined pursuant to paragraph 1 above.
C = The total amount of the Employees' Share of the Fund available for distribution to all Employees as of the date with respect to which the determination is being made.
D = The total amount of all Fund Payments paid into the Fund during the Accounting Period.
Accounting Period shall mean the period commencing with the date which is one (1) day after the date with respect to which the last previous determination was made and ending on the date with respect to which the determination is being made.
3.	If an Employer has prepaid all or any part of the Director’s 83.3% share of the residuals, as permitted by Paragraph 20-1101, the share of the residuals due the Production Manager(s), First Assistant Director(s) and Key Second Assistant Director(s) shall nonetheless be paid to them, subject to subparagraph 1.(c) and 1.(d) above, pursuant to the instructions herein.

Dear Mr. Counter:

The Employers and the Guild will appoint representatives to the committee as soon as possible. The committee will invite representatives of other appropriate labor organizations to participate, but the business of the committee will not depend upon their participation.

Dear Mr. Counter:
The Employers and the Guild recognize that the extent to which and the manner in which theatrical motion pictures are edited by local television stations and then broadcast is a mutual problem, and in particular, denigrates the Directors' contributions to these motion pictures.
The AMPTP and the Guild have therefore agreed to make a joint request to the National Association of Television Programmers and Executives permitting representatives to speak at their next annual meeting. The representatives will include one or more top executives from major studios and one or more members of the Guild.
The Employers, in consultation with the Guild representatives, will also formulate a plan by which written recommendations will be sent to local stations with a print of the film. The recommendations will specify how the motion picture should be edited to meet the stations' desires as to broadcast length and their concerns about violent or sexual content.

Re:	Second or Subsequent License of High Budget Dramatic Programs Made for
Basic Cable to a Different Basic Cable Service
Dear Jay:
Reference is made to the provisions of Paragraph 23-104 of the 2014 DGA Basic Agreement.
During the 2014 negotiations, the parties agreed that residuals for any second or subsequent license of a high budget dramatic program or series made for basic cable to a basic cable service other than the one to which it was originally licensed shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Sideletter, rather than pursuant to Paragraph 23-104. Specifically, with respect to any such license, the Employer shall pay two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross receipts” (as defined in Paragraph 11-108), provided that the program or series (i) has not been in production for at least two years and (ii) has not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula on basic cable or free television (except syndication in the non-lead market) for at least eighteen (18) months.
When the “Employer’s gross” derived from such exploitation is received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the Distributor or exhibitor of the program, then the “Employer’s gross” received by the Employer from the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the Distributor/exhibitor’s payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs, or, if none, then the amounts received by the Employer from unrelated and unaffiliated Distributors/exhibitors in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs or series, or, if none, a comparable Distributor/exhibitor’s payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs or series.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the minimum payment pursuant to this Sideletter for any program licensed to a related or affiliated entity shall be $100.00 for a 30-minute program, $200.00 for a 60-minute program, $300.00 for a 90-minute program, or $400.00 for a 120-minute program, as applicable.
- 480 -
SIDELETTER NO. 7 (continued)
The foregoing applies to motion pictures, whether produced under the 2014 Basic Agreement or any prior Basic Agreement, as to which residuals otherwise would be payable. For purposes of this Sideletter, a “high budget” dramatic program or scries made for basic cable means any program or series made for basic cable before July 1, 1999 or a program or series made for basic cable on or after July 1, 1999 that meets the high budget test in effect at the time the basic cable program or series was produced.

Language was added in each of the provisions of the 1990 Basic Agreement which correspond to these provisions specifying that at least 75% of the days needed to qualify for placement on the Qualifications List must be spent with the actual shooting company.
This will confirm that the addition of this language was not intended to, and should not be construed as, a substantive change, but is instead consistent with, and intended to clarify, the meaning of those provisions as both parties have interpreted them in the past.

SIDELETTER NO. 10
Mr. J. Nicholas Counter III President Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers 14144 Ventura Boulevard Sherman Oaks, California 91423
Dear Mr. Counter:
This letter confirms our mutual understanding of the interpretation of the new residual formula in subparagraph (b)(iv) of Paragraph 11-101.
(1)	Coverage
The formula applies only to episodes of one-hour network prime time dramatic series which were not exhibited in syndication before July 1, 1987. It applies to episodes produced under this BA and any earlier BA.
The new formula is:
(a)	2.6% of Employer's gross until Employer's gross
exceeds $400,000 per episode; and
(b)	1.75% of Employer's gross thereafter.
If the series is licensed to markets representing less than one-third of all U.S. television households, the Employer simply pays the percentage residual, not the "customary" fixed residual payments triggered whenever there are additional runs in any city in the U.S. or Canada.
If the series is licensed in markets representing one-third or more of all U.S. television households, the above percentage payment still applies, but is subject to a "floor" which is 50% of the applicable fixed residuals and a "ceiling" which is 150% of the applicable fixed residuals.
(2)	Applying the Formula
A few examples can best illustrate how the formula operates.
Suppose that the Employer licenses a series comprising 100 episodes for six (6) runs in markets representing more than one-third of all U.S. television households. The license fees for same total $30,000,000, which will be paid out over five (5)
-484-
SIDELETTER NO. 10 (continued)
years. In the first quarter of the License period, the Employer receives 32,000,000; in the second quarter, the Employer receives an additional 31,000,000; there are no additional receipts in the third or fourth quarters. (For convenience, assume that the quarters of the license period coincide with calendar Quarters.)
Assume that each episode has already had two network
exhibitions. Under the syndication deal, one run of half of the episodes occurs in the first quarter; in the second quarter, the remaining 50 episodes are run once; no additional runs of any episode occur in the third quarter; in the fourth quarter, a second run of all episodes takes place.
Assume for the sake of convenience that all episodes were made in the July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987 time period.
Under these facts, payments would be made as follows:
(a)	The First Quarter
Since the Employer first received money in the
first quarter of the license period, residuals must be paid within sixty days after the end of that quarter. The amount of the residual is calculated as follows:
To the extent possible, the total license fees
should be prorated equally among all episodes. Therefore, each episode will be credited with $20,000 of receipts in the first quarter. The Employer must pay 2.6% of that amount ($520) to the Director; subject, however, to the "floor" since the series is licensed in markets representing more than one-third of all U.S. television households. This means that the payment cannot be less than 50% of the fixed residual that would otherwise be due. Because some episodes have been run once, while others have not been run, the "floor" will differ among the episodes.
As to the episodes that have not been run in syn-
dication, the floor is zero (0). This is because fixed residual payments are only due if a run occurs. Since no run has occurred, no fixed residual would be payable. Accordingly, the Directors of episodes not run in the first Quarter should receive $520, (i.e ■ , 2.6% of $20,000) .
As to the episodes that have been run, the floor
is 50% of the fixed residual payments that would otherwise be due. The fixed residual payment for this run is 30% (the percentage payable for the third non-network run) of $10,262 (the
-485 -
SIDELETTER NO. 10 (continued)
base amount applicable to one-hour network prime time procrams produced between July 1, 1986 and June 30, 1987), or $3,078.60. The floor is 50% of that amount or $1,539.30. Therefore, those Directors of episodes run once in syndication in the first quarter would receive $1,539.30.
(b)	The Second Quarter
Within sixty (60) days following the end of the second quarter, the following residual payments should be made:
(1)	First, it must be determined whether the group of Directors whose episodes ran in the first quarter are entitled to additional payments because of the Employer's receipt of an additional $1,000,000 ($10,000 per episode). To make this determination, it is necessary to compare the percentage payment against the floor. The percentage payment for each episode would amount to $780 (2.6% of $30,000). Since no additional runs of these episodes have taken place, the floor would remain at $1,539.30. Since this group has already received that amount, no further payment would be due after the second quarter.
(2)	The group of Directors who received $520 after the first quarter would be entitled to additional compensation after the second quarter since their episodes have now been rerun. The Employer would be obligated to pay each member of this group 2.6% of $30,000 or $780, but not less than 50% of the fixed residual that would otherwise be due (i.e., 50% x [30% x $10,262]), or $1,539.30. The payment of $520 made in the first quarter may be deducted from this amount. Therefore, an additional payment of $1,019.30 must be made to this group of Directors.
(c)	The Third Quarter
Since there are no additional receipts and no additional runs in the third quarter, no additional payments would have to be made.
(d)	The Fourth Quarter
Following the fourth quarter, additional payments will be due, even though the Employer received no additional monies, since all episodes were run again. This means that the floor will have to be recalculated. The floor would be 50% x [(30% + 25%) x $10,262], or $2,822.05. (The percentage applied
-486-
SIDELETTER NO. 10 (continued)
to the base amount for the third non-network run fourth non-network run, the percentage is 25%.) viously paid (SL ,539.30) should be deducted from Therefore, an additional $1,282.75 would be owed

Re: Distributor's/Buyer's Liability for Residuals; Notice and Opportunity to Cure Default
Dear Nick:
Reference is made to Article 22 of the Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement of 1996 relating to responsibility for residuals. As part of the agreement reached during the 1996 negotiations, portions of Articles 11, 18, 19 and 20 and all of Exhibits "A" and "B" were deleted and Article 22 was added in their place to include provisions under which the Directors Guild of America has agreed not to exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to any motion picture and related collateral in a manner which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Distributor to distribute the picture and receive all revenues from such distribution so long as Residuals with respect to the picture for the territories, media and term held by the Distributor are timely paid in accordance with the applicable DGA Agreement.
This will confirm our agreement that any exercise of the Guild's rights as a secured party or disturbance of the Distributor's distribution rights will be preceded by a notice of default in the payment of Residuals from the Guild to the Employer and Distributor. Notice shall be sent to the last known address of Employer and to Distributor at the address indicated on the Distributor's or Buyer's Assumption Agreement. Such notice shall specify that the Employer and/or Distributor shall have thirty (30) days from the date of notice within which to cure the default, and the Guild shall refrain from exercising its rights as a secured party during this period. In the event that payment is made within such thirty (30) day cure period, then such payment shall be considered "timely" and the Guild shall have no right to

Re:	Experiment in Syndication of Half-Hour Series in Markets Representing
50% or Fewer of U.S. Television Households
Dear Jay:
Reference is made to the provisions of Paragraph 11-101(b) of the 2002 DGA Basic Agreement. During the 2002 negotiations, the Employers expressed a concern that if a series could only be syndicated in markets representing 50% or fewer of the U.S. television households, residuals payable pursuant to Paragraph 11-101(b) would render such syndication fiscally untenable. The Employers asserted that the payment of any residuals in such circumstances would benefit both the Employer and the individual directors since no payments are presently made.
While the DGA expressed concern that an accommodation might be subject to abuse or otherwise reduce overall syndication residuals, the parties agreed to an experiment for the term of the 2002 Agreement, to be reviewed each successive term, to determine its effectiveness and whether or not it should be extended. The parties have agreed to renew the experiment for an additional term commencing July 1, 2014 and terminating June 30, 2017. Employers agree to provide the DGA with license fee information at the time of the first payment hereunder.
When a half-hour series is syndicated in markets representing in the aggregate fifty percent (50%) or fewer of U.S. television households, residuals for such series shall be payable at twenty percent (20%) of the applicable “base rate” pursuant to Paragraph 11-101(b)(2) for each such run but shall not constitute a “run” for purposes of Paragraph 11-101(b)(3).
If the series is further syndicated and the aggregate of the markets in which the series is syndicated exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the U.S. television households, the payments required pursuant to Paragraph 11-101(b)(2) and (3) shall be due on any subsequent runs.

SIDELETTER NO. 12 (continued)
This experiment will only apply to series that have not yet been placed into syndication as of July 1,2002.

Dear Jay:
This will confirm the Guild's agreement to issue waivers to allow directors to be employed on distant location to shoot scenes for multiple episodes of one-hour series, such as "NYPD Blue," "E.R." and "Party of Five," or one-half hour single camera episodic television series, under the following terms and conditions:
(1)	In the case of a one-hour series, no individual episode will contain more than the lesser of five (5) minutes or ten percent (10%) footage from a director other than the principal director of the episode. In the case of a one-half hour series, no individual episode will contain more than three (3) minutes of footage from a director other than the principal director of the episode.
(2)	The principal director of the episode shall be given the option to direct the distant location scenes for the episode, if he or she is available.
(3)	In any event, the principal director of the episode shall have a right to consult with the director(s) of the distant location scenes.
(4)	The director(s) filming the distant location scenes must either have previously directed an episode of the series or must be committed to direct an episode in the future.
(5)	The director(s) filming the distant location scenes must not have been employed on the series in any capacity other than as "director;" however, the Guild agrees to recommend that the Western Directors' Council waive this restriction for experienced directors who work on the series in another capacity. If the Council intends to deny a request for such a waiver, it shall so advise the AMPTP and, thereafter, the parties agree to convene the Creative Rights Committee as soon as possible to discuss the matter.
- 491 -
SIDELETTER NO. 13 (continued)
(6)	Any director employed pursuant to this sideletter shall be paid at a rate equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable daily rate for each shooting day.
(7)	There shall be one (1) day of prep time for each day of shooting which exceeds five (5) hours. Prep days shall be paid at one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable daily rate.
(8)	The director filming the distant location scenes may be employed for no more than fourteen (14) hours on any such shooting day.
(9)	The dircctor(s) filming the distant location scenes may direct scenes for up to three (3) episodes in a given day.
(10)	If a director is employed to shoot scenes only for episodes which that director has directed or will direct, then such director shall be paid at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the director's pro rata daily salary for each location day of shooting. In all other respects, the foregoing conditions shall apply to such director.
(11)	Paragraphs (2) and (3) above are only applicable when the distant location scenes to be shot arc done after the director(s) of the episode(s) in which they will be used is (are) hired.
If the Guild intends to deny a request for such a waiver, it shall so advise the AMPTP and, thereafter, the parties agree to convene the Creative Rights Committee as soon as possible to discuss the matter.
The foregoing waivers will be continued as long as the creative rights process continues. It is understood that the Guild's right to withdraw such waivers is not subject to arbitration nor to judicial review. However, prior to a Guild determination to discontinue such waivers, the matter of termination will be discussed with the ongoing Creative Rights Committee.

Such payment would enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or limited number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment, licenses to Moviefly the right to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals shall be based upon 100% of the license fee paid by Moviefly to Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment for such picture.

The seven (7) consecutive day period may be divided between the period immediately prior to and immediately following the rerun in any ratio determined by the Employer.

(a)	Library Product. For television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971 but before July 1, 2014, as to which free television residuals are still payable, the residuals for streaming outside the free streaming windows are as set forth in Section 3.A. of Sideletter 15 of the 2011 BA;
2 For convenience, the parties have agreed to address in this Sideletter the use of television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2014, on an advertiser-supported video-on-demand service of a multichannel video programming distributor (“MVPD”) (hereinafter referred to as an “MVPD AVOD service”), even though exhibition on an MVPD AVOD service does not fall within the definition of an exhibition on a New Media platform.
- 501 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
(b)	Current Product
For television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2014:
(i)	If the Employer makes such television motion picture available for streaming outside the free streaming window(s) provided in Paragraph A.(1) above of this Section 3, on a free-to-the-consumer, advertiser-supported service transmitted via the Internet or mobile or other device or on an MVPD AVOD service or any similar service that exists or may hereafter be developed, the Employer shall pay residuals as follows:
(A)	If the Employer makes the television motion picture available for streaming outside all free streaming windows, but within one (1) year of the expiration of the free streaming window applicable to the initial exhibition, it shall pay four percent (4%) (four and one-half percent (4.5%) for a television motion picture, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2015, and five percent (5%) for a television motion picture, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2016) of the residual base applicable to the television motion picture3 for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period beginning on the first day that the television motion picture is made available for streaming following the expiration of the free streaming window and within the one-year period following the television exhibition. The applicable residual base for dramatic programs shall be no more than the network prime time residual base.
(B)	If the Employer makes the television motion picture available for streaming outside all free streaming windows for all or any part of the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period immediately following the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period described in the preceding paragraph, but within one (1) year of the expiration of the initial exhibition free streaming window, then it shall pay four percent (4%) (four and one-half percent (4.5%) for a television motion picture, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2015, and five percent (5%) for a television motion picture, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2016) of the residual base applicable to the television motion picture3 for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period beginning on the first day that the television motion picture is made available for streaming during such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period. The applicable residual base for dramatic programs shall be no more than the network prime time residual base.
(C)	None of the aforementioned twenty-six (26) consecutive week periods shall cover a period that is more than one (1) year after the expiration of the initial exhibition free streaming window. In the event that streaming of the television motion picture is commenced on a date that does not allow for the full twenty-six (26)
3 The residual base for programs made for pay television that are of a type generally produced for network prime time shall be the same residual base as is used for network prime time programs.
- 502 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
consecutive week period of use within one (1) year of the expiration of the initial exhibition free streaming window, then the payment for that period shall be prorated in weekly units to cover the shorter use period.
For example, suppose that the Employer streams a television motion picture during a free streaming window and then does not stream the program again until thirty-nine (39) weeks after the expiration of the window period. Since only thirteen (13) weeks remain within the one (1) year period, a payment of one-half of the amount that would otherwise be due for the twenty-six (26) week streaming period would be payable for streaming during the thirteen (13) week period.
(D)	If, upon expiration of the one (1) year period following expiration of the initial exhibition free streaming window and outside all free streaming windows, the Employer makes available a television motion picture for streaming, then it shall pay residuals at the rate of two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employer did not make the television motion picture available for streaming during the one (1) year period following its initial exhibition on television, or if it was available for streaming only during a free streaming window, then the foregoing payment shall apply beginning one (1) year after initial exhibition of the television motion picture on television.
(ii)	Revenues derived from foreign streaming shall be included in “Distributor’s Foreign Gross,” as provided in Paragraph 11-102 of the BA.
(5)	Use of Excerpts During Any Paid 26 Consecutive Week Period Within First Year After Initial Exhibition of the Program. The payment set forth in Paragraph A.(4)(b) above shall also entitle the Employer to use excerpts from that television motion picture in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service during the same period as is covered by the streaming payment, without any additional payment therefor.
B.	Theatrical Motion Pictures
If the Employer should make available for streaming a theatrical motion picture, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971, then the Employer shall pay residuals at the rate of one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter.
One-half of such residual shall be paid to the Director, or if there is more than one Director, on a pro rata allocation to each Director; the remaining one-half shall be paid to the DGA-Producer Pension Plans.

SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
4.	Use of Excerpts in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD Service.
A.	In addition to the use of excerpts permitted in Paragraph A.(3) and (5) of Section 3 above, Employer may use an excerpt or excerpts from a television motion picture (other than a long-form television motion picture) for promotional purposes in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service, provided that such excerpt(s) does not exceed five (5) minutes in length. Employer may use an excerpt or excerpts from a long-form television motion picture, from a motion picture made for the home video market or from a theatrical motion picture for promotional purposes in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service, provided that such excerpt(s) does not exceed ten (10) minutes in length.
B.	The following uses of an excerpt or excerpts in New Media or on an
MVPD AVOD service shall be considered "promotional" and shall require no payment, whether or not the Employer receives revenue in connection therewith:
(1)	When used to promote the exhibition of a theatrical or television motion picture or series or a motion picture made for home video on free television, basic cable or pay television and “‘tune in’ information” is included. "‘Tune-in’ information" for promotional purposes is sufficient when it informs the consumer where he or she can view the motion picture, program or series from which the excerpt is taken. The tune-in information may appear on-screen or in a "click-through" format - i.e., accessible through links. It is agreed that the network channel or station "bug" alone does not suffice. It is also understood that the Employer is not required to provide the same level of "‘tune-in’ information" as is commonly provided in traditional network television promotional announcements.
(2)	When used to promote the traditional home video release or any "special edition" home video release of a theatrical or television motion picture or series or a motion picture made for home video, and the availability of the picture in home video is referenced.4
(3)	When used to promote the theatrical exhibition of a motion picture, and reference to the theatrical release is included. Reference to the theatrical release shall be unnecessary if the excerpt(s) is used as part of a "teaser" advertising campaign.
4 It is understood that the “special edition” provision allows the Employer to promote a motion picture in home video in connection with the theatrical exhibition of a sequel to that motion picture. For example, Warner Bros. is entitled to promote sales in home video of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (the first of the Harry Potter movies) in connection with the theatrical exhibition of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (the seventh of the Harry Potter movies).
- 504 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
(4)	When used to promote the exhibition of a theatrical motion picture, motion picture made for home video or television motion picture or series in New Media in conjunction with the availability of an electronic copy of the motion picture or series for rental, purchase, or ad-supported streaming via the Internet or other New Media platform and instructions are included for renting, purchasing or streaming an electronic copy of the motion picture or series from the website or other New Media platform on which the excerpt appears or a direct link is provided to another website or New Media platform where an electronic copy of the motion picture or series can be rented, purchased, or streamed, or when used to promote the exhibition of a television motion picture or series on an MVPD AVOD service and instructions are included for viewing the television motion picture or series on the MVPD AVOD service.
(5)	When used for "viral" promotion in New Media of any use or exhibition of a theatrical or television motion picture or series or a motion picture made for home video, if the excerpt is circulated non-commercially to multiple websites or made available for individuals to circulate. The fact that the viral excerpt is exhibited on a revenue-generating site owned by or affiliated with the Employer shall not render this exception inapplicable, provided that the excerpt is released without payment to other sites.
C.	The use of excerpts shall not be considered "promotional" within the
meaning of subparagraph B. above if the excerpts are used on a New Media site which archives the contents of several prior seasons of the series and is designed to enable the viewer to search the archives using a sophisticated search engine, as distinguished from a New Media site which offers excerpts from several prior seasons of a series that are intended as a recap of the events that transpired during those prior seasons or that are intended to promote the exhibition or sale of full episodes of the series from which the excerpts are taken.
D.	If the use of an excerpt or excerpts in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service is not within one of the promotional provisions in subparagraph B. above, or if the excerpt(s) used from a motion picture, the principal photography of which commences on or after July 1, 2014, exceeds the length limitations set forth in subparagraph A. above:
(1)	There shall be no payment for the use of excerpts from a television motion picture on a free-to-the-consumer New Media platform or on an MVPD AVOD service during the free streaming windows. Further, if the Employer pays the “New Media program fee” pursuant to Paragraphs A.(4)(a) and/or (b) of Section 3 of this Sideletter, then payment for the use of the entire program in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service shall also constitute payment for the free-to-the-consumer use of any portion thereof in New Media and on an MVPD AVOD service during the corresponding time period.
(2)	If an excerpt from a television motion picture is used on a free-to-the-consumer New Media platform or an MVPD AVOD service outside all free streaming windows, but within one (1) year following expiration of the initial exhibition free streaming
- 505 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
window,5 and the use of the excerpt of the television motion picture is not otherwise permitted or paid for under Paragraphs A.(4)(a) and/or (b) of Section 3 above, the Employer shall pay for such use as follows:
(a)	For an excerpt(s) up to two (2) minutes in length, the lesser of $50 or the “applicable New Media program fee.6”
(b)	For an excerpt(s) in excess of two (2) minutes in length but not more than four (4) minutes in length, the lesser of $157.50 or the “applicable New Media program fee.”
(c)	For an excerpt in excess of four (4) minutes in length, the “applicable New Media program fee.”
(3)	If an excerpt is from a television motion picture and is used on a free-to-the-consumer New Media platform or on an MVPD AVOD service, outside all free streaming windows and more than one (1) year following the expiration of the initial exhibition streaming window,7 the Employer shall pay two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter.
(4)	If an excerpt is from a theatrical motion picture or a motion picture made for home video and is used on a free-to-the-consumer New Media platform or on an MVPD AVOD service, the Employer shall pay one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of “Employer's gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter.
(5)	If an excerpt(s) from a theatrical or television motion picture is used on a “consumer pay” platform, and the use is not within one of the promotional provisions in subparagraph B. above, Employer shall pay one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of “Employer's gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter, for theatrical and television motion pictures.
5 If the television motion picture has not been streamed during the one (1) year period following initial exhibition on television, or if it has been streamed only during the free streaming window, then the payment required by Paragraph D.(2) of Section 4 of this Sideletter shall apply until one (1) year after initial exhibition of the television motion picture on television.
6 The “applicable New Media program fee” for television motion pictures is the applicable fee for the use of the entire program in New Media as provided in Paragraphs A.(4)(a) and (b) of Section 3 of this Sideletter.
7 If the television motion picture has not been streamed during the one (1) year period following initial exhibition on television, or if it has been streamed only during the free streaming window, then the payment under this Paragraph D.(3) of Section 4 of this Sideletter shall apply beginning one (1) year after initial exhibition of the television motion picture on television.
- 506 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
This formula shall apply to a "hybrid" use where the consumer pays for the excerpt and advertising revenues are also derived by the Employer from such use. Such revenues shall be incorporated in "Employer’s gross."
(6)	All payments for the use of excerpts in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service during the term of this Agreement shall be made to the DGA-Producer Health Plan without attribution to any individual(s).
(7)	The use of excerpts in New Media from motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971 and before July 1, 2014, shall be as provided in the 2011 BA.
E.	Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(1)	If excerpts from the current season of a series and excerpts from past seasons of the series are used together on an ad-supported, free-to-the-consumer basis or on an MVPD AVOD service and the use is not within one of the promotional provisions in subparagraph B. above and payment is otherwise due, then the Employer shall pay two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of this Sideletter, for all such excerpts.
(2)	No payment shall be required for the free-to-the-consumer "non-commercial" promotional use of excerpts in excess of the length limitations set forth in subparagraph A. above if the Director is credited. A "non-commercial" use is a use from which the Employer and its related and affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, distributors and exhibitors, receive no revenues, including, but not limited to, advertising revenues.
(3)	It is understood that the use of an excerpt from a theatrical motion picture, a television motion picture or a motion picture made for home video shall not require any payment hereunder if the use would not require a payment under the theatrical or television excerpt provisions, as applicable, of the BA or FLTTA.
5.	“Employer’s Gross”
A.	Definition
The term “Employer’s gross,” for purposes of all reuses in New Media of motion pictures and television programs made for traditional media and of Original and Derivative New Media Productions (each hereinafter referred to as “such Picture”), shall be as defined in BA Paragraph 18-103(b).8 “Employer’s gross” shall also include amounts derived from making available a motion picture, the principal photography of which commenced
8 For sake of clarity, “Employer’s gross” specifically includes advertising revenues when the license, distribution or other agreement provides for sharing in such revenues.
- 507 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
on or after July 1, 2014, on an MVPD AVOD service in connection with transactions for which residuals are payable under this Sideletter.
When the “Employer’s gross” derived from New Media or MVPD AVOD exploitation is received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the exhibitor/retailer of such Picture, then the “Employer’s gross” received by the Employer from the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the exhibitor/retailer’s payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable pictures, or, if none, then the amounts received by the Employer from unrelated and unaffiliated exhibitors/retailers in arms’ length transactions for comparable pictures, or, if none, a comparable exhibitor/retailer’s payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable pictures.
B.	Agreements and Data
On a semi-annual basis, within ten (10) business days after such request, the Employer shall provide for inspection by DGA’s designated employee or auditor, at Employer’s premises in Los Angeles, full access9 to all unredacted license, distribution, and other agreements pertaining to New Media exploitation of covered pictures that were entered into during the immediately preceding inspection period. In any subsequent semi-annual inspection, the DGA’s designated employee or auditor may re-inspect any agreements previously inspected and inspect any agreements not previously inspected.
Upon request, in a manner to be mutually agreed upon in good faith, the Employer shall expeditiously provide, or make available, to DGA data in its possession or control, or the possession or control of its related distribution entities, regarding the New Media exploitation of covered pictures, such as number of downloads or streams by source and ad rates.
The provisions of this Paragraph B. of Section 5 do not apply to agreements relating to a multichannel video programming distributor (“MVPD”) or any similar service that currently exists or may hereafter be developed.
C.	Recordkeeping and Reporting
Payment for exploitation of covered pictures in New Media or on an MVPD AVOD service shall be due sixty (60) days after the end of the quarter in which the “Employer’s gross” from such exploitation is received. The Employer shall accompany such payments with reports regarding the “Employer’s gross” derived from such exploitation, which shall be specified by medium and source whenever reasonably possible and will be separated from revenues derived from exploitation of such Pictures in traditional media. Along with such
9 Full access includes access to all agreements, notwithstanding any confidentiality clause contained therein, and access to all sideletters, exhibits, addenda, and other ancillary documents.
- 508 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
payments, the Employer shall provide DGA with unredacted copies of all corollary distributor’s, sub-distributor’s, and exhibitor’s statements relating to the reported “Employer’s gross.” The DGA and the Employer shall discuss and agree upon a method of making available to the DGA the information required by this Paragraph C.
During the term of the 2014 BA, each Employer agrees to meet with DGA representatives on an Employer-by-Employer basis for the purpose of discussing reporting residuals from transactional video-on-demand on a consumer pay platform in New Media separately from residuals from a subscription consumer pay platform in New Media.
Where the Employer allocates revenues between New Media rights and other rights in any such Picture, among New Media rights in multiple such Pictures, or otherwise, it shall specify such allocation.
D.	Confidentiality
The information provided to DGA by the Employer will be treated as confidential pursuant to BA Section 17-400 and appropriate arrangements will be made to safeguard the confidentiality of that information.
E.	Other Terms and Conditions
Except as expressly provided herein, all other terms and conditions of the BA, including, but not limited to BA Article 2 and BA Section 17-400, shall apply; in the event of a conflict, the terms and condition of this Sideletter shall control.
6.	Sunset Clause
The parties recognize that this Sideletter is being negotiated at a time when the business models and patterns of usage of motion pictures and other productions in New Media are in the process of exploration, experimentation and innovation. Therefore, Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Sideletter expire on the termination date of the 2014 BA and will be of no force and effect thereafter. No later than sixty (60) days before that expiration date, the parties will meet to negotiate new terms and conditions for reuse of Made for New Media Productions and of motion pictures and television programs in New Media to be in effect thereafter.
The parties further acknowledge that conditions in this area are changing rapidly and that the negotiation for the successor agreement will be based on the conditions that exist and reasonably can be forecast at that time. For example, the parties acknowledge that with respect to the formula in Section 2 for the electronic sell-through of motion pictures and television programs, the growth of electronic sell-through could adversely impact traditional home video sales. In future negotiations, the parties agree that the criteria to be considered in good faith in determining whether the electronic sell-through residual should be increased or decreased include patterns of cannibalization of the home video market and changes in the wholesale price.
- 509 -
SIDELETTER NO. 15 (continued)
7.	Reservation of Rights
With respect to theatrical motion pictures and television motion pictures or programs, the Employer has agreed to a separate payment for this use because New Media exhibition is at this time outside the primary market. The Employer reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical and television motion pictures, and that, therefore, no additional payment pursuant hereto should be made with respect to the exhibition of theatrical or television motion pictures (including those covered by the Agreement) in New Media. The Guild reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitors are or have become part of the primary market, residual provisions for motion pictures so exhibited should be improved.

Dear Jay:
Reference is made to the provisions of Paragraph 2-304(a)(1) of the 2014 DGA Basic Agreement.
During the 2014 negotiations between the Directors Guild of America and the Employers represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, the parties agreed that, with respect to disputes involving the major studios (including those Employers on whose behalf a representative of a major studio is acting) and the networks, the Los Angeles panel of arbitrators shall be arranged in order according to a random draw which shall take place before July 1 of each year of the Agreement, rather than alphabetically, as provided in Paragraph 2-304(a)(1).
Pursuant to that procedure, the Los Angeles list of Arbitrators for such disputes during the period July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015 shall be as follows:
Joseph Gentile Dixon Dern Michael Prihar Kenneth Perea Douglas Collins Mark Burstein William B. Gould IV Joel Grossman Michael Rappaport Barry Winograd

On July 1, 2015 and again on July 1, 2016, the parties shall again place the names of the foregoing Arbitrators in a hat and the names shall be drawn at random, one after the other, to establish the order in which the Arbitrators are to be assigned during the subsequent one year period.
The Arbitrator shall be selected in rotation, on an individual studio or network basis (which shall mean, for purposes of this provision only, all Employers for which a given studio is responsible as mentioned above), starting from the top of the list down, during each one (1) year period of the 2014 Agreement. The rotation shall continue to be on an individual studio or network basis, as provided above, and shall be unaffected by the selection of an Arbitrator by mutual agreement.

award filed in any court of competent jurisdiction shall be served upon the respondent in such proceeding by registered or certified mail or by personal delivery. If the petitioner is unable to effect service in this manner, service then may be effected by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address for service last designated in writing by the Company, together with publication in Daily Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times.
7.	Conduct of Proceedings
Except as set forth elsewhere herein, the arbitrator shall adopt such rules of procedure and shall conduct proceedings in such manner as he/she shall determine to be proper; provided, however, that each party to any arbitration shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argument before the arbitrator.
All hearings, deliberations and proceedings of the arbitrator shall be closed to the public. Only interested parties, their representatives and witnesses may attend.

SIDELETTER NO. 17 (continued)
C.	ARBITRATION
1.	Initiation of Proceedings
a.	When One or More Guilds Have Previously Served Separate
Arbitration Claims and/or Grievances.
A tri-Guild arbitration shall be initiated by the Guilds by written notice setting forth the particulars of the claim. The written notice shall describe all previously served claim(s) and/or grievance(s) to be submitted to the tri-Guild proceeding. The written notice shall be sent in accord with the procedures described in Section B.6. above, within eighteen (18) months following the date of the final audit report.
The tri-Guild procedure would not be available, however, when an arbitrator has been selected to hear a claim filed separately by one of the Guilds.
b.	When No Arbitration Claims Have Been Previously Served By Any
Guild.
A tri-Guild arbitration shall be initiated by the Guilds by joint (i.e., single) written notice setting forth the particulars of the claim, to be sent in accord with the procedures described in Section B.6. above. No grievance proceedings shall be utilized.
2.	Respondent's Written Statement of Position
The respondent shall, within ten (10) business days following receipt of the notice of invocation of a tri-Guild proceeding, inform all Guilds of its representatives and serve a written statement of its position.
3.	Selection of Arbitrator
The arbitrator shall be a neutral third party. The parties shall in good faith attempt to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) business days after the respondent's receipt of the notice of invocation of a tri-Guild proceeding. Should the parties fail to so agree, the arbitrator shall be selected by the "Strike Process" as follows:
a.	The arbitrators listed in subparagraph e.(2) below shall constitute the list
of arbitrators.
b.	On a respondent-by-respondent basis, the Guilds collectively and the
respondent shall alternate on a case-by-case basis in first striking a name
- 516 -
SIDELETTER NO. 17 (continued)
from the list of arbitrators. Thereafter, the other party shall "strike" a name from the list. The parties shall continue to alternate in striking names from the list, until one (1) arbitrator's name remains.
c.	The arbitrator whose name remains (after the Strike Process is completed)
shall be the arbitrator.
d.	The "Strike Process" shall commence within two (2) business days
following completion of the ten (10) business day period referred to in Section 3. above and must conclude no later than three (3) business days following completion of the ten (10) day period referred to in Section 3. above.
e.	In the event that one of the parties fails to participate in the Strike Process,
or fails to strike in order and/or timely, the other party may thereupon select the arbitrator to hear the matter.
(1)	If there is more than one respondent, then the respondent which is the real party in interest shall participate in the striking process with the Guilds. In the event that such respondents cannot agree on which of them is the real party in interest, then such respondents shall determine by lot which of them shall participate in the striking process with the Guilds.
(2)	The authorized list of arbitrators is as follows:
Sara Adler
Howard Block
Dixon Dern
Joseph Gentile
Fredric Horowitz
Edgar A. Jones, Jr.
Anita Christine Knowlton
Michael Rappaport
Sol Rosenthal
Additional names may be added from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that the panel shall consist of an odd number of arbitrators at all times.
- 517 -
SIDELETTER NO. 17 (continued)
4.	Substitution of Arbitrators
If the arbitrator selected cannot serve, a substitute shall be selected in accordance with Section 3. above.
5.	Notice of Hearing
The arbitrator or, at his/her request, one of the parties shall give written notice to the parties of the time and place of the arbitration hearing. In fixing such date, the arbitrator shall consult the parties and shall consider the time reasonably necessary for the parties to prepare their cases.
6.	Exchange of Information
The parties will cooperate in the exchange of information reasonably in advance of the hearing date regarding the expected utilization of documents and physical evidence. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the arbitration hearing, any party may make a written request to the other to produce, on a date not later than five (5) days before the hearing, documentary evidence of the type producible pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum. The documents must be produced on the date requested, but the other party may object to the production of the documents to the same extent as though the documents were subpoenaed. Any such objection shall be considered by the arbitrator at the hearing.
The introduction of documents or physical evidence shall not be precluded because they were not exchanged in advance of the hearing.
7.	Hearing
a.	The arbitrator may, upon a showing of good cause, continue the hearing.
The arbitration hearing shall be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.
b.	The arbitration shall take place as noticed or continued regardless of
whether one (1) or more of the parties fails to participate.
8.	Defenses
The respondent may assert any and all defenses available to it, including those available against only one or two Guilds.
- 518 -
SIDELETTER NO. 17 (continued)
9.	Waiver of Time Limits
Any and all time limits in this Sideletter may be waived by the mutual consent of the parties.
10.	Confidentiality
The parties and the arbitrator shall maintain the confidentiality of business records and/or other documents introduced at the hearing as if the provisions of Article 53.B. of the WGA Minimum Basic Agreement, Article 17-400 of the DGA Basic Agreement, Article 7.H. of the DGA Freelance Live and Tape Television Agreement and Article 6.1 of the SAG Codified Basic Agreement applied.
D.	ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES WHICH INVOLVE QUESTIONS OF JURISDICTION OR ARBITRABILITY
1.	General
An objection to jurisdiction or arbitrability shall first be determined by the arbitrator prior to proceeding with a hearing on the merits. If the arbitrator determines that there is jurisdiction and that the dispute is arbitrable, the arbitrator shall proceed to a decision on the merits; provided, however, that the party contesting arbitration or jurisdiction shall not, by proceeding to a determination of the merits of such arbitration, be deemed to have waived its position that the dispute is not arbitrable or that the arbitrator does not have jurisdiction. If the arbitrator rules he/she has no jurisdiction over the dispute or that the dispute is not arbitrable, then each party shall be free to pursue the remedies available to it.
2.	Timeliness Defense
If the respondent alleges that the claim is time-barred under one or more of the Guilds' Agreements, such defense shall be bifurcated and heard in a separate proceeding in advance of the proceeding on the merits, absent consent of all parties to decide this defense in the same proceeding. In a bifurcated proceeding, only the parties to the Agreement under which the timeliness defense has been raised shall be parties. These parties shall select a different arbitrator to decide the timeliness defense under the procedures described above in Section C.3., unless they agree to use the same arbitrator selected to decide the merits of the tri-Guild claim. The arbitrator shall refrain from issuing a decision on the merits of any triGuild claim subject to a timeliness defense until issuance of the decision on such defense.
- 519 -
SIDELETTER NO. 17 (continued)
E.	ARBITRATION EXCLUSIVE REMEDY
Arbitration under this Sideletter shall be the exclusive remedy in connection with claims hereunder against the respondent concerning the interpretation or application, or alleged breach, of any residuals provisions of the Guilds' current or predecessor Basic Agreements.

CONSERVATION COLLECTION SIDELETTER
As of November 1, 2000;
Revised as of July 1, 2002;
Revised as of July 1, 2005;
Revised as of July 1, 2008;
Revised as of July 1, 2011;
Revised as of July 1, 2014
This sideletter applies to: (a) any theatrical motion picture covered under the 2014 Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement which is released in the domestic theatrical market; and (b) any theatrical motion picture covered under the 2014 Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement intended for domestic theatrical release for which the Employer has not located a domestic theatrical distributor within six (6) months following the completion of post-production.
1.	Objectives of the Conservation Collection
During the term of the 1999 Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement, the Directors Guild of America, Inc. ("DGA") and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ("the AMPTP"), on behalf of the Employers it represented in the 1999 DGA negotiations for a successor agreement to the 1996 DGA Basic Agreement (referred to individually as "the Employer" and collectively as "the Employers"), established an archival collection, for conservation purposes, of 35 millimeter release prints of feature films. The collection is named “The Directors Guild of America-Motion Picture Industry Conservation Collection at the UCLA Film and Television Archive” (“the Collection”)* and is housed at the Southern Regional Library Facility of the Film and Television Archive at the University of California at Los Angeles ("the Archive") in Los Angeles, California.
The objective in establishing the Collection was the conservation of release prints of the theatrical motion pictures described above so that they may be used as masters should the original film elements not survive in good condition or otherwise to assist in the restoration of films when necessary. Films in the Collection may also be used on an extremely limited basis for select noncommercial screenings, as is further provided in Paragraph 4, below. The Collection will help ensure that motion pictures survive for the cultural awareness and enjoyment of future generations.
* Should other entertainment entities become active participants in the establishment and/or funding of the Collection, the parties agree to give good faith consideration to renaming the Collection to include those entities.
- 529 -
SIDELETTER NO. 19 (continued)
2.	The Role of the UCLA Film and Television Archive
The Collection is housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled vaults at the Southern Regional Library Facility of the Archive. The Collection is maintained by the Archive’s staff in accordance with accepted techniques for the long-term storage of film and digital video elements.
The DGA and/or its representative(s) are responsible for raising the funds needed to pay the costs of administering the Collection, as specified in the separate agreement between the Archive, on the one hand, and the AMPTP and the DGA, on the other hand ("the Archive Agreement"). It is understood that the Archive will provide the DGA with a proposed budget for each calendar year not later than October 31st of the preceding year and that the final budget for each calendar year will be subject to negotiation between the DGA and the Archive. The proposed budget for each year must fall within a reasonable and expected range, given the Archive’s budget for the preceding year. If the DGA deems that the budgetary increases proposed by the Archive are neither reasonable nor expected, the DGA and/or its representative may opt to discontinue its obligation to raise funds to support the Collection’s administration. In that event, the Agreement between the Archive, on the one hand, and the DGA and the AMPTP, on the other hand, shall be deemed terminated and the Archive shall return each print in the Collection to the Employer which deposited the print, or to the holder of domestic theatrical rights to the picture.
The Archive will be responsible for receiving, inventorying, storing, insuring, and ensuring the ongoing quality, safety and security of the Collection, as well as any related administrative duties. The Archive will make certain that the highest standards are maintained to ensure minimal risk of damage to prints in the Collection. The Archive will also administer the approval process for loan requests, including maintaining and annually updating the list of authorized persons who may approve requests to borrow and/or exhibit prints.
The AMPTP, on behalf of the Employers, shall have the right to audit and inspect the Archive, at any time during regular business hours, for the purpose of assuring the Employers that the Archive is taking appropriate safety and security measures to prevent loss or damage to or piracy of the prints in the Collection. In the event the AMPTP finds that such safety and/or security measures are inadequate, the AMPTP shall have the unilateral right to discontinue this sideletter and the Archive Agreement upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice to the DGA and the Archive. During the sixty (60) day period following such notice, the AMPTP will consider any solutions proposed by the DGA and/or the Archive to remedy the inadequate safety and/or security measures. However, in the event that such notice is given, and the Archive fails, within the sixty (60) day period, to implement corrective measures satisfactory to the AMPTP (or fails, within the sixty (60) day period, to devise corrective measures satisfactory to the AMPTP with an appropriate plan and timetable for implementation), then each print in the Collection shall be returned to the Employer which deposited the print, or to the holder of domestic theatrical rights to the picture.
In addition to the foregoing, the DGA and AMPTP may discontinue their agreement with the Archive upon 180 days’ written notice to the Archive. The Collection will otherwise remain at the
- 530 -
SIDELETTER NO. 19 (continued)
Archive, which cannot opt to discontinue housing the Collection, as long as appropriate funding, as is more particularly described in the Archive Agreement, is available.
3.	Print Deposit Guidelines
Each Employer shall be obligated to deposit with the Archive one (1) new, first class 35mm print, preferably a show print, of each theatrical motion picture described in the first paragraph of this sideletter. Each print must be delivered in the same format as was used for its first run release, preferably a quad print. Prints must be delivered to the Archive either on cores, in cans, or on reels in ICC cases, in accordance with the Archive Agreement. The Employer will deposit or cause to be deposited a print of each such theatrical motion picture within thirty (30) days after its release in the domestic videocassette, DVD, or laserdisc market. If the theatrical motion picture has not been released in the domestic videocassette, DVD or laserdisc market within one (1) year following its theatrical release, the DGA may, at any time thereafter, request that a print be deposited with the Archive and the Employer agrees not to unreasonably deny the DGA’s request. The Employer will bear the costs associated with obtaining and delivering a print to the Archive.
Each print should be pre-screened by the Employer prior to delivery to the Archive. The Archive will perform quality control checks on newly-deposited prints to the greatest extent possible.
At the time that it deposits the print with the Archive, the Employer shall designate in writing the name(s) of its representative(s), or the name(s) of the representative(s) designated by the entity which holds the Employer's domestic theatrical rights ("the domestic theatrical rights holder”), who shall be authorized to act on requests to borrow the print of the theatrical motion picture. The Employer or the domestic theatrical rights holder may, at any time, give the Archive notice of a change in the identity of those representatives and the Archive shall, following receipt of such written notice, contact the newly-designated representative(s) in connection with any request to borrow the print of the theatrical motion picture. The Archive will update the list of all representatives annually and, upon request of the DGA, furnish a copy of the list to the DGA.
In the event that the Employer is not also the distributor of the theatrical motion picture, the Employer shall bind the distributor holding domestic theatrical rights to the foregoing obligations.
The DGA will review its records of completed signatory films on a quarterly basis and notify the AMPTP and the respective Employer or its domestic theatrical rights holder of any films which have not been deposited as required.
4.	Guidelines for the Use of Prints in the Collection
Any request to borrow a Collection print for exhibition or for use in the restoration process shall be made in writing to the Archive. The Archive shall forward a copy of the request to the DGA and to the authorized representative of the Employer or the domestic theatrical rights holder whose theatrical motion picture is the subject of the request. The decision to grant or deny such a request shall be within the sole discretion of the Employer which produced the film in question
- 531 -
SIDELETTER NO. 19 (continued)
or the domestic theatrical rights holder. However, all such requests must be considered in light of the objectives set forth above and in keeping with these guidelines.
The Collection is not a print exchange. Prints will be loaned for exhibition only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
a.	the screening is non-commercial and in connection with a retrospective of the work
of one or more of the key creators involved in making that film;
b.	the screening is at a major venue or theater operated by one of the talent guilds, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Archive, the National Film Archive at the Library of Congress, Eastman House, the Museum of Modern Art, or any other venue approved by the parties; provided that prints will be loaned only to those venues which meet the projection standards outlined in the standard Archive Loan Agreement; and
c.	a print of adequate quality is not practically or readily available from any other
source.
Prints in the Collection are not available for study or other use at film schools and universities. Prints in the Collection may not be copied, onto videotape or otherwise, except in connection with mutually approved restoration efforts.
The Archive will provide the DGA and the AMPTP with an annual report listing all loan requests, approvals and denials.
5.	Approval Procedures
After receiving a request for print usage, the Archive will seek written confirmation or approval of one of the representative(s) designated by the signatory Employer or the domestic theatrical rights holder, who has the authority to act upon such requests. The decision to grant or deny a request shall rest solely within the discretion of the Employer or the domestic theatrical rights holder. However, the Employer, or the domestic theatrical rights holder, must consider every such request in good faith and may not unreasonably withhold its consent. The actions of the Employer and the domestic theatrical rights holder must be consistent with the objectives of the Collection. The Archive shall be responsible for processing all requests for print usage, including communicating the decision to approve or deny the request.
The Archive will keep a log of all requests for print usage, and whether the requests were granted or denied.
- 532 -
SIDELETTER NO. 19 (continued)
6.	Terms and Conditions of Use of Prints in the Collection
All expenses incurred in connection with the exhibition or other approved use of a Collection print will be borne by the borrower. No print will be loaned to a borrower which does not have adequate liability insurance in place and the Archive must be made an additional named insured on any such policy before a print is released to the borrower. In lieu of insurance, the borrower may post a bond or cash deposit or otherwise escrow funds sufficient to replace the print before it will be released to the borrower. Should a print be so badly damaged that it cannot be repaired and must be replaced, and the borrower does not have sufficient insurance coverage or other resources to fund replacement of the damaged reel or print, then the Employer, or the domestic theatrical rights holder, is encouraged to replace the damaged reel or entire print, but the cost of doing so shall be borne by the borrower.
When a print from the Collection is loaned for exhibition or for restoration purposes, the borrower must make the following acknowledgments, as appropriate:
♦	written credit in the program material;
♦	verbal acknowledgment during the actual program; and
♦	screen credit in the case of a restoration or use of clips.
In each instance, the borrower must refer to the Collection as “The Directors Guild of Amcrica-Motion Picture Industry Conservation Collection at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.”
7.	Reporting Procedure and Dispute Resolution Process
The DGA and the AMPTP will each designate an individual to serve on a subcommittee which will have the authority to resolve any problems regarding print use or any other matter arising under or pertaining to this Sideletter.
Except as provided in the following sentence, disputes arising under this sidelettcr shall not be subject to grievance nor arbitration, but shall instead be referred exclusively to the bargaining party subcommittee referred to in the preceding paragraph for resolution. Disputes arising under Paragraph 3 of this sideletter shall be subject to grievance and arbitration under Article 2 of the Basic Agreement, but the authority of the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering the Employer and/or the domestic theatrical rights holder to deposit immediately with the Archive a print of the motion picture that is the subject of the dispute.

Re: Terms and Conditions for Non-Prime Time Multi-Camera Dramatic
Programs
Dear Jay:
This will confirm our agreement that employees employed on multi-camera, dramatic programs intended for broadcast in other than prime time will be covered by the Freelance Live and Tape Television Agreement provided that the program is shot on videotape or is recorded digitally. With respect to multi-camera, dramatic programs produced on or after July 1, 2002 which are intended for broadcast in other than prime time and shot on film which, were they produced for broadcast in prime time, would be covered under Article 24 of the Basic Agreement, the Employer and the Guild will negotiate in good faith over the working conditions applicable to DGA-represented employees employed thereon. In the absence of an agreement, the wages and working conditions set forth in Article 24 of the Basic Agreement shall apply.
ACCEPTED AND AGREED:
Sincerely.

Re: Diversity
Dear Ms. Lombardini:
During the negotiations for the 2008 BA and FLTTA, the parties discussed their respective concerns regarding diversity in the production of television programs. The Employers and the DGA have agreed to address concerns regarding the implementation of BA Article 15 and FLTTA Article 19 as follows:
1.	Both parties mutually understand the need to continue the diversity meetings with high level creative, production or programming executives, pursuant to BA 15-700 and FLTTA Article 19, Section E.
2.	The Major Production Companies have agreed to continue their commitment of substantial resources to increase the employment of both experienced and emerging women and minority Directors in television. To this end, several programs have been instituted including the ABC/Touchstone Directing Assignment Initiative, the NBC Director in Training Program and the HBO/DGA Directing Fellowship. These programs and other initiatives have the potential to be an important source of employment opportunities. The DGA will continue to provide lists of women and minority Directors who may be available for assignment.
3.	The DGA will endeavor to educate the DGA executive producers, supervising producers and/or showrunner members about the need to enhance the employment of women and minority Directors. In addition, the DGA will cooperate with other organizations, including the WGAw. at the Employer’s request, to further the goal of diversity.

Re: Diversion of Pension Plan Contributions
Dear Mr. Counter:
During the recent negotiations for the 2005 BA and FLTTA, the parties discussed the possible need to divert Employer contributions from the Pension Plan to the Health and Welfare Plan.
Accordingly, the parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the BA or FLTTA, the parties reserve the right, upon mutual agreement, to divert a portion of the Employer contributions to the Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Plan required under Paragraph 12-201 of the BA and Article 11, Section A. I. of the FLTTA, as well as the Pension Plan share of payments under Articles 18 and 19 of the BA and Article 24 of the FLTTA, to the Directors Guild-Producer Health and Welfare Plan, for as long a time period as the parties deem necessary.

Re: Script Delivery in Television
Dear Mr. Counter:
In order to effectuate the provisions of Paragraph 7-302 dealing with script delivery, the parties agree to a Sideletter as follows:
1.	DGA may inform Employer that the Guild wishes to discuss compliance with the obligation to deliver timely scripts in accordance with Paragraph 7-302 of the Basic Agreement on a particular series. In that event, Employer will arrange a meeting for DGA representatives with the responsible producers and studio executives.
2.	The parties have established the following requirements with respect to the timely submission of scripts:
a.	For each series in its second year of production, at least 50% of all scripts for the season’s episodes must be delivered timely.
b.	For each series in its third year of production, at least 66% of all scripts for the season’s episodes must be delivered timely.
c.	For each series in its fourth or subsequent year of production, at least 75% of all scripts for the season’s episodes must be delivered timely.
3.	For any script delivered late after the allowable percentage of late scripts, computed in accordance with subparagraph 2.a., b. or c. above, as applicable, has been exhausted, the Employer will pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000 for each day the script is late.
Payments will be to the Directors Guild - Producer Health and Welfare Plan, but shall be sent to the DGA for transmittal.
4.	For purposes of Paragraph 3 of this Sideletter:
a.	Any series in its second year of production with fewer than 13 episodes in its initial order will be treated in the same manner as a series in its first year of production; i.e, it will be exempt from the requirements of Paragraph 7-302 and this sideletter.
- 539 -
SIDELETTER NO. 25 (continued)
b.	The penalty will be calculated from delivery of the “writer’s draft,” (not necessarily the "completed shooting script" as that term is used in Paragraph 7-302 of the Basic Agreement), but an earlier draft script which is intended to serve as the basis for the "completed shooting script," with the characters, locations and dialogue intended for the entire episode. It is understood that the “writer’s draft” is subject to change and that an outline does not suffice as the “writer’s draft.”
c.	Compliance with Paragraph 2 above will be tested at the end of each season.
d.	DGA must meet with the Employer to discuss the script delivery situation on a series before the penalty will be required.
Employers will continue to cooperate with the Guild in providing data and arranging meetings on this subject. Upon request, Employer will provide the Guild with copies of the season's production schedule, including directing assignments, at the start of each production season, with revisions as they occur.
Sincerely,
ial Executive Director
Agreed:

Re:	“Supersized” Episodes
Dear Mr. Roth:
The parties agree that the following provisions shall apply to any recorded episode of a one-half hour or one-hour prime time dramatic series, the running time of which extends beyond the regular time period of a typical episode of the series.
1.	a.	Initial compensation for the Director of a half-hour episode which is "extended" to
have a running time that is forty-five (45) minutes or less (i.e., the episode has a longer running time than a typical episode of the series, but does not exceed 45 minutes) shall be the thirty (30) minute rate plus fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the half-hour rate and the one (1) hour rate. Three (3) extra days shall be added to the guaranteed period. See attached “Initial Compensation” schedule.
b.	Initial compensation for the Director of a one-hour episode which is "extended" to
have a running time that is seventy-five (75) minutes or less shall be the sixty (60) minute rate plus fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the sixty (60) minute rate and the ninety (90) minute rate. Five (5) extra days shall be added to the guaranteed period for network prime time programs; three (3) extra days shall be added for non-network and network non-prime time programs. If the running time of the extended episode is more than seventy-five (75) minutes but less than ninety (90) minutes, the episode shall be considered a 61-90 minute program and the Director shall be compensated accordingly. See attached “Initial Compensation” schedule.
c.	The running time of an episode shall be determined by the broadcast schedules which
are released by the network, or the exhibition schedules which are released by the cable companies and published in viewer’s guides such as TV Guide. Commercial time and title sequences, as well as the use of excerpts from previously-recorded programs, shall be considered part of the extended episode when determining running time.
d.	If excerpts comprise more than fifty percent (50%) of the running time (excluding
commercials and title sequences) of the extended episode, it shall be considered a "compilation program" under Paragraph 11-209 of the BA, except that:
- 541 -
SIDELETTER NO. 26 (continued)
i.	The rate for a compilation program more than thirty (30) minutes but not
more than forty-five (45) minutes shall be the rate for a thirty (30) minute compilation program plus fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the rate for a thirty (30) minute compilation program and the rate for a sixty (60) minute compilation program; and
ii.	The rate for a compilation program more than sixty (60) minutes but not more
than seventy-five (75) minutes shall be the rate for a sixty (60) minute compilation program plus fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the rate for a sixty (60) minute compilation program and the rate for a ninety (90) minute compilation program.
iii.	The rate for a compilation program more than seventy-five (75) minutes but not more than ninety (90) minutes shall be the rate for a ninety (90) minute compilation program.
e.	The parties understand that there shall be no additional payments for episodes with a
running time up to three (3) minutes over the length of a typical episode.
2.	a.	Residuals for an "extended episode" shall be determined by the residuals schedule
attached hereto, except as provided below.
b.	Residuals for an "extended" episode of a half-hour series which is shortened after its
initial broadcast and run as a half-hour program shall be treated as one-half hour in length for the purpose of calculating the free television rerun payments, both domestic and foreign.
c.	Residuals for an "extended" episode of a one-hour series which is subsequently
shortened after its initial broadcast and run as a one-hour episode shall be treated as one (1) hour in length for the purpose of calculating free television rerun payments, both domestic and foreign.
d.	In the event two (2) or more versions of an episode are delivered as part of a
syndication package, each version shall be considered a distinct “television motion picture” for purposes of determining the “run” pursuant to BA 11-101.
e.	If an extended episode is sold to a foreign subdistributor (or a foreign distributor
affiliated with Employer) and there is a distinct valuation of that episode (i.e., it is sold separately or for an additional fee) the foreign residual (including the “base” and all residuals payments) shall be determined by the episode’s delivered length and the Employer shall report to the DGA that an “extended” version was delivered or sold in a foreign territories. In all other cases, the residual shall be based on the typical episode time. This provision shall not imply any obligation to sell such extended episode separately or for an additional fee.
- 542 -
SIDELETTER NO. 26 (continued)
3.	The parties have determined to restrict the application of this Sidclctter to “supersized” episodes which exceed the length of a typical episode by half or less because this is the manner in which they have thus far been produced. Should any Employer produce an “extended episode” which exceeds the running time of a typical episode by more than half, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith the rates and conditions applicable to such extended episode.

Re:	License of Free Television, Basic Cable or Pay Television Motion Pictures to
Secondary Digital Channels
Dear Jay:
During the 2014 negotiations, the parties discussed the residual formula for exhibition of television motion pictures on secondary digital channels. The parties agreed that instead of a fixed residual formula, an Employer shall pay a percentage residual formula of two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross receipts” (as defined in Paragraph 11-108) for any license to a secondary digital channel of any free television or pay television dramatic motion picture, or any basic cable program not subject to Paragraph 23-104(b) of the Basic Agreement, as to which a fixed residual otherwise would be payable that (i) has been out of production for at least three years and (ii) has not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula in syndication (except in the non-lead market) or pay television for at least three years in the case of a free television or pay television program or has not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula in syndication (except in the non-lead market), pay television or basic cable for at least three years in the case of a basic cable program. However, for any free television series consisting of sixty-eight (68) or fewer episodes or any basic cable or pay television series consisting of forty (40) or fewer episodes, the series need only have been out of production for at least two years and not been exhibited under a fixed residual formula on basic cable, pay or free television (except syndication in the non-lead market) for at least one year.
When the “Employer’s gross” derived from this exploitation is received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the Distributor or exhibitor of the program, then the “Employer’s gross” received by the Employer from the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the Distributor/exhibitor’s payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs, or, if none, then the amounts received by the Employer from unrelated and unaffiliated Distributors/exhibitors in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs, or, if none, a comparable Distributor/exhibitor’s payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable programs.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the minimum payment pursuant to this Sideletter for any program licensed to a related or affiliated entity shall be $50.00 for a 30-minute program, $100.00 for a 60-minute program, $150.00 for a 90-minute program, or $200.00 for a 120-minute program, as applicable.

Sideletter No. 34 (continued)
The foregoing applies to motion pictures, whether produced under the 2014 Basic Agreement or any prior Basic Agreement as to which residuals otherwise would be payable.
Sincerely,
ACCEPTED AND AGREED:

Re:	Programs Produced for New Media
Dear Ms. Lombardini:
The parties mutually recognize that the economics of New Media production are presently uncertain and that greater flexibility in terms and conditions of employment is therefore mutually beneficial. If one or more business models develop such that New Media production becomes an economically viable medium, then the parties mutually recognize that future agreements should reflect that fact.
During the 2014 negotiations, in recognition of the development of a demand for high budget dramatic productions made for subscription video-on-demand services, such as Netflix’s House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, the parties agreed to add terms and conditions for “high budget” dramatic productions made for subscription consumer pay New Media platforms (hereinafter “subscription consumer pay platforms”) as provided in Sections D. and E.3. below.
A.	Terms and Conditions for “Derivative New Media Productions” (Other Than “High Budget” Dramatic Productions Made For a Subscription Consumer Pay Platform).
A “Derivative New Media Production” hereunder is a production for New Media based on an existing television motion picture or program that was produced under the Basic Agreement for “traditional” media - e.g., a free television, basic cable, or pay television motion picture or program (the “Original Production”).
1.	A Director must be employed. The Employer shall pay the Director a
salary for a Derivative New Media Production separate from any directing salary for the Original Production, which shall be subject to negotiation between the individual Employee and the Employer, and which must be reported to the Guild in a deal memorandum specifying the salary and terms of employment no later than the start of principal photography.
2.	UPMs and Assistant Directors employed on the Original Production may be
assigned to the Derivative New Media Production as part of their regular workday on the Original
- 559 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
Production. The work for the Derivative New Media Production shall be considered part of the workday for the UPMs and ADs on the Original Production and shall trigger extended workday payments or overtime if work on the Derivative New Media Production extends the workday on the Original Production past the contractually defined regular workday. If an Employee who is not employed on the Original Production is employed to perform UPM or Assistant Director duties exclusively for a Derivative New Media Production, then the terms and conditions set forth below govern.
3.	All terms and conditions of employment, including initial compensation
and deferred compensation, if any, will be subject to negotiation between the Employer and the individual Employee, except for Director’s credit and residuals as set forth in Paragraphs c. and d. below and those provisions of the BA incorporated herein by reference in Paragraph a. below. DGA agrees that it will not interfere in any such negotiations between the Employee and the Employer.
a.	The following provisions of the BA are incorporated herein. To the
extent the provisions herein are inconsistent with the BA, the provisions of this sideletter control.
(1)	Article 1, Recognition and Guild Shop.
Notwithstanding the Guild Shop provisions set forth in Paragraph 1-401 of the Basic Agreement, an individual engaged as the Director of a Derivative New Media Production shall not be required to become a “member of the Guild in good standing” until he or she completes production of 120 total minutes of programming, as edited for exhibition. The 120 minutes of programming applies per Director, regardless of the number of Employers for which the Director works. The above provision applies only to Directors who are not, and have not previously been, members of the DGA and only to work performed on covered New Media productions.
(2)	Article 2, Grievance and Arbitration.
(3)	Article 12, Pension and Health Plans.
(4)	Although the provisions of Section 1-300 are not applicable, it is understood that the Employer may not assign any of the duties described therein to persons outside the bargaining unit. The Employer shall not be required to assign work to an Employee hereunder when the Employer would not be required to do so under the BA.
(5)	Article 17, Miscellaneous Provisions, except that (1) the second, third, and fourth sentences of Paragraph 17-201 shall not apply, and (2) if no First Assistant Director is employed, the meeting described in Section 17-500 may instead be called by the person who is designated as the safety officer.
- 560 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
b.	The Employer shall advise the DGA of the employment of any
Employee by forwarding to the DGA a copy of a deal memorandum, signed by both the Employer and the Employee, which shall set forth at least the information required by Exhibits 1(A) and (B) attached to this sideletter no later than the start of principal photography.
c.	The Employer is required to accord screen credit to the Director if
anyone else receives screen credit on the New Media production. The Director’s credit shall be in the form “Directed by” and must be in the same size and style of type as any other such credit. Credits may appear in the corner of the screen. “Click-through” credits may be used.
d.	Reuse - Refer to Section E. below.
e.	DGA agrees to make appropriate accommodations in its initiation
fees in recognition of the economics of Made for New Media Productions.
B.	Terms and Conditions for “Experimental New Media Productions” (Original
Productions Only).

The actual cost of the Experimental New Media Production shall consist of all direct costs actually incurred in connection with the Production. The only costs excluded in determining the actual cost of production shall be development costs, overhead charges, financing costs (i.e., loan origination fees, gap fees, legal fees, and interest), contingency of up to ten percent (10%), essential elements insurance costs, the cost of the completion bond, marketing expenses, contingent payments to talent or other parties, and delivery items required by sales agents, distributors or sub-distributors (i.e. delivery materials beyond the answer print, NTSC Video Master if the Production is delivered on videotape, or the digital equivalent if the Production is delivered in a digital format).
C.	Terms and Conditions for Original “Made for New Media” Dramatic Motion Pictures and Dramatic Series Productions (Other Than “High Budget” Dramatic Productions Made For a Subscription Consumer Pay Platform).
A Director must be employed. All terms and conditions of employment, including initial compensation and deferred compensation, if any, will be subject to negotiation between the Employer and the individual Employee, except for Director’s credit and residuals as set forth in Paragraphs 3. and 4. below and those provisions of the BA incorporated herein by reference in

b.	Article 2, Grievance and Arbitration.
c.	Article 12, Pension and Health Plans.
d.	Although the provisions of Section 1-300 are not applicable, it is
understood that the Employer may not assign any of the duties described therein to persons outside the bargaining unit. The Employer shall not be required to assign work to an Employee hereunder when the Employer would not be required to do so under the BA.
e.	Article 17, Miscellaneous Provisions, except that (1) the second,
third, and fourth sentences of Paragraph 17-201 shall not apply, and (2), if no First Assistant Director is employed, the meeting described in Section 17-500 may instead be called by the person who is designated as the safety officer.

- 563 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
fixed and definite terms entered into by the Employer prior to July 1, 2014.1 However, if such license agreement is entered into subject to conditions precedent, then all such conditions must be satisfied prior to July 1, 2014.

Programs).
The provisions below apply to the reuse of Derivative New Media Productions which do not satisfy the definition of a “High Budget SVOD Program” set forth in Section D.1. above.
a.	What Initial Compensation Covers.
Initial compensation for a Derivative New Media Production shall constitute payment for thirteen (13) consecutive weeks of use on all free-to-the-consumer, advertiser-supported platforms transmitted via the Internet or mobile devices (hereinafter “advertiser-supported platforms”), commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for exhibition on any advertiser-supported platform, and for a separate twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use on any consumer pay New Media platform (hereinafter “consumer pay platform”), commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for exhibition on any consumer pay platform.
- 568 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
b.	Use on Advertiser-Supported Platforms Within One (1) Year
Following Expiration of the Thirteen (13) Consecutive Week Period.
(1)	If the Employer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms beyond the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, but within one (1) year after expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, then the Employer shall make a residual payment equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the following “residual base for syndication” as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use, commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for use on any advertiser-supported platform following the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period:
For a Derivative New Media Production that is derivative of a dramatic television motion picture or program of the type covered by the BA, the “residual base for syndication” is the residual base used under the BA to pay runs in syndication for a dramatic free television motion picture of the same length as the Derivative New Media Production.
For example, for a Derivative New Media Production five (5) minutes in length that is derivative of a network prime time dramatic television motion picture, the residual payment is calculated by multiplying the residual base for syndication in the BA for a dramatic program 7 minutes and under in length ($2,753 as of July 1, 2014) by 3.5%.
(2)	If the Employer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms for all or any part of the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period immediately following the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period described in Section E.1.b.(1) above, but within one (1) year after expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, then the Employer shall make a residual payment equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the “residual base for syndication,” as that term is defined in Section E.1.b.(1) above, as consideration for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use, commencing with the first day that the Derivative New Media Production is available for use during such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period.
(3)	None of the aforementioned twenty-six (26) consecutive week periods shall cover a period that is more than one (1) year after the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period. In the event that use of the television motion picture on advertiser-supported platforms is commenced on a date that does not allow for the full twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use within one (1) year of the expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, then the payment for that period shall be prorated in weekly units to cover the shorter use period.
- 569 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
c.	Use on Advertiser-Supported Platforms More Than One (1) Year
Following Expiration of the Thirteen (13) Consecutive Week Period.
Upon expiration of the one (1) year period following expiration of the thirteen (13) consecutive week period, if the Employer desires to use the Derivative New Media Production on advertiser-supported platforms, then it shall pay residuals at the rate of two percent (2%) of “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media.
d.	Use on Consumer Pay Platforms.
For use of a Derivative New Media Production on New Media platforms for which the consumer pays (e.g., download-to-own, download-to-rent, paid streaming), the Employer shall pay a residual equal to 1.2% of the “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via New Media, attributable to the period beyond the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use.
e.	Use in Traditional Media.
The Employer shall pay residuals for the use of a Derivative New Media Production in “traditional media” (e.g., free television, basic cable, pay television, home video) under existing BA formulas.
(1)	Free Television Exhibition.
(a)	Except with respect to exhibition of Derivative New Media Productions that are more than fifteen (15) minutes in length as exhibited in network prime time, residual payments for free television exhibition of Derivative New Media Productions shall be computed as follows:
The New Media exhibition of the Derivative New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments in free television. The residual base used to compute the payment shall be the residual base used to pay runs in syndication for a free television motion picture or program of the same category and length as the Derivative New Media Production. The residual base shall be multiplied by the percentage applicable to the run in question and the resulting product shall be the residual payment.
(i)	As an example, suppose that a five (5) minute dramatic Derivative New Media Production is exhibited for the first time in network prime time. The applicable residual base is the residual base used for dramatic programs seven (7) minutes and under in length exhibited in syndication ($2,753 as of July 1, 2014). That figure will be
- 570 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
multiplied by 50%, the percentage applicable to a second run on a network, for a residual payment of $1,377 (as of July 1, 2014).
(ii)	If the same Derivative New Media Production were exhibited a second time on the network, that run would generate a residual payment of $1,101 ($2,753 x 40%) as of July 1, 2014.
(b)	The formula for reruns in network prime time of Derivative New Media Productions more than fifteen (15) minutes in length as exhibited is as follows: The New Media exhibition of the Derivative New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments for use on free television. The residual payment shall be the amount payable under the BA for a rerun in network prime time of a free television motion picture or program of the same type and length as the Derivative New Media Production.
(i)	For example, if a dramatic Derivative New Media Production twenty (20) minutes in length is exhibited in network prime time, the residual payment is $12,739 (as of July 1, 2014), the same payment applicable to the rerun of a 30 minute dramatic program in network prime time.
(ii)	As another example, if a dramatic Derivative New Media Production forty-three (43) minutes in length is exhibited in network prime time, the residual payment is $23,994 (as of July 1, 2014), the same payment applicable to the rerun of a 60 minute dramatic program in network prime time.
(2)	Exhibition on Pay Television, on Home Video and on Basic Cable.
For exhibition on pay television, the Employer shall pay residuals equal to 1.2% of “Employer’s gross” pursuant to Paragraph 18-103 of the BA. For home video exploitation, the Employer shall pay residuals pursuant to Paragraph 18-104 of the BA. For exhibition on basic cable, the Employer shall pay residuals pursuant to Paragraph 11-108 of the BA.
2.	Original New Media Productions (Other Than High Budget SVOD
Programs).
The provisions below apply to the reuse of Original New Media Productions which do not satisfy the definition of a “High Budget SVOD Program” set forth in Section D.1. above.

Initial compensation for an Original New Media Production shall constitute payment for a twenty-six (26) consecutive week period of use on any consumer pay platform, commencing with the first day that the Original New Media Production is available on any consumer pay platform, and all uses on advertiser-supported platforms.
b.	Use on Consumer Pay Platforms.
(1)	No payment shall be due for any use on consumer pay platforms for an Original New Media Production budgeted below $25,000 per minute of actual program material as exhibited.
(2)	For all uses of an Original New Media Production budgeted at or above $25,000 per minute of actual program material as exhibited on consumer pay platforms (e.g., download-to-own, download-to-rent, paid streaming) beyond the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period, the Employer shall pay a residual equal to 1.2% of the “Employer’s gross,” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media, attributable to the period beyond the twenty-six (26) consecutive week use period.
(3)	Paragraph 2.a. above shall apply to an Original New Media Production initially released on a consumer pay platform which is subsequently released on an advertiser-supported platform or vice versa.
c.	Use in Traditional Media.
The Employer shall pay residuals for the use of an Original New Media Production in “traditional media” (e.g., free television, basic cable, pay television, home video) under existing BA formulas.
(1)	Free Television Exhibition.
(a)	Except with respect to exhibition of Original New Media Productions that are more than fifteen (15) minutes in length as exhibited in network prime time, residual payments for free television exhibition of Original New Media Productions shall be computed as follows:
The New Media exhibition of the Original New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments in free television. The residual base used to compute the payment shall be the residual base used to pay runs in syndication for a free television motion picture or program produced for non-network or network non-prime time of the same category and length as the Original New Media Production. If the program category has both a high budget rate and a low budget rate, then the
- 572 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
residual base shall be the base applicable to the low budget category. The residual base shall be multiplied by the percentage applicable to the run in question and the resulting product shall be the residual payment.
(i)	As an example, suppose that a five (5) minute dramatic Original New Media Production is exhibited for the first time in network prime time. The applicable residual base is the residual base used for network non-prime time dramatic programs seven (7) minutes and under in length exhibited in syndication ($2,753 as of July 1, 2014). That figure is multiplied by 50%, the percentage applicable to a second run on a network, for a residual payment of $1,377 (as of July 1, 2014).
(ii)	If the same Original New Media Production is exhibited a second time on the network, that run would generate a residual payment of $1,101 ($2,753 x 40%) (as of July 1, 2014).
(b)	The formula for reruns in network prime time of Original New Media Productions more than fifteen (15) minutes in length as exhibited is as follows:
The New Media exhibition of the Original New Media Production shall constitute the first run for purposes of calculating residual payments for use on free television. The residual payment shall be the amount payable for a rerun in network prime time of a free television motion picture or program produced for non-network or network non-prime time of the same category and length as the Original New Media Production. If the program category has both a high budget and a low budget rate, then the residual base shall be the base applicable to the low budget category.
(i)	For example, if a dramatic Original New Media Production twenty (20) minutes in length is exhibited in network prime time, the residual payment is $12,739 (as of July 1, 2014), the same payment applicable to the rerun of a thirty (30) minute dramatic non-network or network non-prime time program in network prime time under the BA. If the Original New Media Production is run a second time in network prime time, the same payment ($12,739) would be due.
(ii)	As another example, if a dramatic Original New Media Production 43 minutes in length is exhibited in network prime time, the residual payment is $23,994 (as of July 1, 2014), the same payment applicable to the rerun of a sixty (60) minute dramatic non-network or network non-prime time program in network prime time under the BA. If the Original New Media Production is run a second time in network prime time, the same payment ($23,994) would be due.
(2)	For exhibition on pay television, the Employer shall pay residuals equal to 1.2% of “Employer’s gross” pursuant to Paragraph 18-103 of the BA. For home video exploitation, the Employer shall pay residuals pursuant to Paragraph 18-104 of the BA.
- 573 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
For exhibition on basic cable, the Employer shall pay residuals pursuant to Paragraph 11-108 of the BA.
3.	High Budget SVOD Programs.
The provisions below apply to the reuse of High Budget SVOD Programs as defined in Section D.1. above.
a.	What Initial Compensation Covers.
Initial compensation paid to the Director of a High Budget SVOD Program intended for initial exhibition on a subscription consumer pay platform constitutes payment for one year of use worldwide on such platform (including any related or affiliated foreign subscription consumer pay platform), commencing with the first day that the High Budget SVOD Program is available on such subscription consumer pay platform(s).
b.	Subsequent Use on the Subscription Consumer Pay Platform on
Which the High Budget SVOD Program Was Initially Exhibited.
i.	For each year of use of a High Budget SVOD Program on a
subscription consumer pay platform with 15 million or more subscribers in the United States and Canada (including on any related or affiliated foreign subscription consumer pay platform) beyond the initial one-year use period described in subparagraph a. above, the Employer shall make a fixed residual payment based on the applicable network prime time residual base, according to the following schedule:
- 574 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
Exhibition Year1	Percentage of Applicable Network Prime Time Residual Base
Year 2	30.0%
Year 3	30.0%
Year 4	25.0%
Year 5	20.0%
Year 6	15.0%
Year 7	10.0%
Year 8	8.0%
Year 9	5.0%
Year 10	4.5%
Year 11	3.0%
Year 12	2.5%
Each Year thereafter	1.5%
ii.	For each year of use of a High Budget SVOD Program on a
subscription consumer pay platform with fewer than 15 million subscribers in the United States and Canada (including on any related or affiliated foreign subscription consumer pay platform) beyond the initial one-year use period described in subparagraph a. above, the Employer shall make a fixed residual payment for each subsequent one-year period according to the schedule set forth in subparagraph b.i. above, but the residual base shall be 65% of the applicable network prime time residual base.
c.	Use on a Subscription Consumer Pay Platform Other Than the
Platform on Which the High Budget SVOD Program Was Initially Exhibited.
For exhibition of a High Budget SVOD Program on any subscription consumer pay platform other than the subscription consumer pay platform on which the program was initially exhibited and any of its related or affiliated foreign subscription consumer pay platform(s), the Employer shall make a residual payment equal to 1.2% of the “Employer’s gross” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media.
"Each Year shall commence with the first day that the High Budget SVOD Program is made available for exhibition on the subscription consumer pay platform following the conclusion of the prior one-year use period.
- 575 -
SIDELETTER NO. 35 (continued)
d.	Use on Other Consumer Pay Platforms (i.e., Transactional VOD).
For exhibition of a High Budget SVOD Program on any consumer pay platform other than a subscription consumer pay platform (i.e., for exhibition on a transactional consumer pay platform involving download-to-own or download-to-rent transactions), the Employer shall make a residual payment equal to 1.2% of the “Employer’s gross” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media.
e.	Use on Advertiser-Supported Platforms.
Except as provided in the next paragraph, for exhibition of a High Budget SVOD Program on any free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported platform, the Employer shall make a residual payment equal to 2% of the “Employer’s gross” as defined in Section 5 of Sideletter No. 15 re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employer shall have the right to exhibit a High Budget SVOD Program (including any one-time program or the first three (3) episodes of a new series), without any additional payment, on free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported platforms for a period of seven (7) consecutive days for the purpose of promoting the High Budget SVOD Program.
f.	Use in Traditional Media.
The Employer shall pay residuals for the use of a High Budget SVOD Program in “traditional media” (e.g., free television, basic cable, pay television, home video) under existing BA formulas.
F.	Sunset Clause.
The parties recognize that this Sideletter is being negotiated at a time when the business models and patterns of usage of productions made for New Media are in the process of exploration, experimentation and innovation. Therefore, the provisions of Sections E.1. and 2. of this Sideletter expire on the termination date of the 2014 BA and will be of no force and effect thereafter. No later than sixty (60) days before that expiration date, the parties will meet to negotiate new terms and conditions for reuse of such New Media Productions to be in effect thereafter. The parties further acknowledge that conditions in this area are changing rapidly and that the negotiation for the successor agreement will be based on the conditions that exist and reasonably can be forecast at that time.

Re:	Casting
Dear Carol:
During the negotiations for the 2014 Basic Agreement, the parties discussed issues regarding casting in episodic television. The parties agreed that, once per year, a Senior Creative Executive of the Employer will provide a notice to the Executive Producers of each television pilot and episodic television series with a copy to the Casting Department, reminding them of the following provisions in the DGA Basic Agreement concerning the participation of the Director in casting decisions, as follows:
“From:	[Senior Creative Executive]
To:	Executive Producers
Copy:	Casting Department
Subject:	Television Director’s Participation in Casting Decisions
“As we prepare for the upcoming television production season [modify as applicable], we thought it important to bring to your attention the provisions of the DGA Basic Agreement regarding the participation of the Director of a television motion picture in casting decisions.
“The Basic Agreement provides that once the Director is employed, the Director shall be informed as soon as practicable of any proposed casting and, if reasonably available, shall participate in all decisions with respect to proposed casting. The Director’s advice and suggestions are to be considered in good faith.
“It is important to us that Directors be advised of and participate in casting decisions as reflected above. In particular, we gain valuable feedback when Directors participate in in-
- 587 -
person casting sessions. We support in-person casting sessions as appropriate and ask that those sessions be scheduled to include the Director when practicable.
“The Director should be informed of the final casting decisions as soon as possible. We value the involvement of Directors throughout the television casting process and appreciate the insights that Directors bring to casting decisions.”
Sincerely,
Agreed:
Carol A. Lombardini

Dear Carol:
Once per year, Employer shall provide its creative executives, post-production executives and post-production supervisors with a copy of a summary of the Director’s creative rights, along with a full text of the creative rights provisions in Articles 7 and 8 of the Agreement. At or around the beginning of principal photography of a theatrical motion picture, Employer shall provide the same to freelance producers who are assigned to the production.
The parties shall agree upon the language of the summary to be provided before this requirement becomes effective. The summary shall not be used to alter or vary the terms of Articles 7 or 8. In the event of a dispute, the language of the Agreement shall govern, and the summary shall not be introduced into evidence for the purpose of establishing the meaning of any provision in Articles 7 or 8.
The provisions of this Paragraph shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration under this Agreement.
