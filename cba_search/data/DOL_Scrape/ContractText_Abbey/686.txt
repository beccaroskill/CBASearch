If the employee's employment is terminated on any other basis, health coverage will terminate on the last day the employee works prior to such termination of employment. This date will not be extended by any Paid Days Off.
3.	The following rules apply to an employee on an approved leave of absence or layoff who was a participant in a health plan as of the date of the leave or layoff:
28
a.	The Employer contribution to health coverage which is not financed by employee pre-tax contributions shall continue to be made until the end of the month following the month in which the approved leave or layoff begins, provided the employee contributions are made on a timely basis.
b.	If the employee is on an approved leave which qualifies as covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Employer contribution described in (a) will continue as required by this Act. The leaves that may qualify as covered under this Act, provided the employee is eligible and entitled to the benefits provided by the Act, are the following:
-	Disability Leave
-	Personal Maternity Leave
-	Family Care Leave
c.	When continuation of Employer contributions for health coverage are no longer required under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee may elect coverage at his expense pursuant to the applicable requiiements as defined by the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).
d.	If the employee's weekly pre-tax contributions are not made because of an absence of wages during a layoff or leave, the employee may purchase coverage in the plan on an after tax basis.
iG the extent that the Employer contributions are made as described in (a) and (b), the employee contribution will be equal in amount to the pre-tax coatributioxis made by the employee before the layoff or leave.
After the period in which the Employer contributions are made as described in (a) and (b), the employee contribution will be the total cost of coverage for the plans elected, as defined under COBRA This coverage may continue for the duration of the period required by COBRA, provided the employee remains eligible for such coverage as defined by the COBRA law.
J.	An employee on an approved leave of absence or layoff, who has continued his health coverage by paying the full monthly cost in advance or whose coverage has stopped, will be eligible for reinstatement of Employer contributions toward such coverage as of the first day of the calendar month following the day the employee returns to work, so long as the employee is otherwise eligible for such benefits. The employee's pre-tax contributions shall resume as of the first day of the calendar month following the day the employee returns to work
Pursuant to the FMLA, an employee on a qualified FMLA Leave will be provided with health coverage continuation or reinstatement of coverage upon the employee's timely return to work as required by this Act.
29
K.	During each payroll accounting quarter, employees must maintain a weekly average of at least twenty-four (24) hours per week to continue health coverage, which will be tested at the end of each payroll accounting quarter. The employee’s weekly hours average will be determined by taking the total hours paid for actual work, paid days off, holiday pay, jury duty pay, and bereavement pay during the payroll accounting quarter and dividing these total hours by the number of the employee's active service weeks during the accounting quarter. An active service week is any week for which an employee receives pay as described above.
Employees who do not maintain an average of at least twenty-four (24) hours per week will be subject to a cancellation of coverage on the last day of the month in which the second consecutive quarter with insufficient hours ends. Employees losing coverage as a result of this provision will become eligible for coverage again on the Erst day of the month following the completion of an accounting quarter during which the employee has maintained an average of at least twenty-four (24) hours per week.
Employees who have had health coverage canceled because of a quarterly average of hours below twenty-four (24) hours per week may reinstate their coverage, without lapse, pursuant to the COBRA guidelines for continuation of coverage. Employees continuing coverage under this provision will be required to notify the Employer of their intent to continue coverage on a timely basis and pay 102% of the full cost of this coverage, on a timely basis, as defined under Federal COBRA legislation and regulations. The duration of continuation coverage will also be consistent with the Federal COBRA law.
I. An employee whose coverage terminates for any reason is to return all Health Benefits Identification cards to the Employer immediately. In addition, if an employee owes the Employer any amount for unpaid employee contributions toward health coverage, for benefits paid in error, or for any other reason, the Employer may deduct such amount owed by the employee from the employee's accrued unpaid wages and benefits.
M. Effective April 1,2002, the benefit coverage available for the Comprehensive Medical Plan (including Prescription Drug Coverage), the Dental/Optical Plan, and the required weekly pre-tax contribution rates for health coverage are set forth in subsections 11.IM 1 through 6. Each health benefit plan will operate on the basis of a Plan Year which begins on April 1 and ends on the following March 31.
1.	Medical Plan Funding/Omtribution Requirements
All Medical Plans offered, by the Employer will be funded as described in this subsection 11.1M1.
a.	The Comprehensive Medical Plan and Prescription Drug coverage will be funded by the Employer according to the cost that is established cn the basis of the actual cost experience of previous claims, adjusted by ai actuarial projection of future claims and costs, phis administration expenses.
30
Eligible employees who choose to participate will finance a portion of the established cost through weekly pre-tax contributions. The actual amount of an employee’s contribution will be equal to the percentage of the established cost of the employee / dependent coverage category elected, as listed in the following schedule.
Plan Year	Weekfy Pre-tax Ckmtributions
Plan Year 2002 (4/1/2002 - 3/31/2003)	$7.77 Employee only $10.43 Employee w/ child $15.98 Employee w/ spouse $14.23 Employee w/ children $21.35 Employee w/ spouse and child(ren)
Plan Year 2003 (4/1/2003 - 3/31/2004)	17% of the Established Cost
Plan Year 2004 (4/1/2004-3/31/2005)	18% of the Established Cost
Plan Year 2005 (4/1/20G5-3/31/2006)	19% of the Established Cost
* P1anYear2006 rW/200G~ 3/31/2007;	20% of the Established Cost
b.	When an eligible employee elects coverage under an Alternative Medical Plan, the Employer will fund the Alternative Medical Flan coverage and the Prescriptian Drug coverage in an amount that is equal to the Employer’s portion of the cost for the same employee I dependent coverage election under the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage. The Employer's equal dollar funding will apply to all Alternative Medical Plan / Prescription Drug coverage options except as limited by the minimum contribution requirement described in subsection ll.lMl(d), below.
c.	The employee's contribution to the cost of the Alternative Medical Flan and Prescription Drug coverage elected will be the difference between the Employer funded amount, as described above, and the total cost of the coverage elected. Therefore, if the Alternative Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage is more costly then the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage, then the employee weekly contribution will be greater for this option. However, if the Alternative Medical Flan with Prescription Drug coverage is less costly
31
than the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescriptian Drug coverage, then the employee weekly contribution will be less for this option.
d.	Notwithstanding the above provisions, it is the policy of the Employer that any employee participating in a Medical Plan offered by the Employer shall contribute on a weekly basis to the cost of the coverage of the plan elected. Therefore, no employee participating in a Medical Plan offered by the Employer shall pay less than fifty percent (50%) of the contribution amount required for participation in the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage.
e.	The Employer agrees that the methodology used to establish the cost of coverage undar the CMP and the Employer’s contribution to the cost of coverage under an Alternative Medical Plan will be in compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations as described in COBRA, ERISA, IRC, and the HCFA regulations. Although these Federal requirements were written for specific purposes, there exists a common requirement, either stated or implied, that the “applicable premium” will be equal to a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing that coverage.
The union agrees that these are the legal obligations of the Employer and that these requirements provide sufficient assurance that the established cost of the CMP and the Employer’s contribution to an Alternative Medical Plan has been determined reasonably.
Each year the Employer establishes costs for each coverage category within the CMP for setting COBRA rates and for bargaining with Alternative Medical Plans (such as HMOs). The Employer will provide the Union with this cost information as early in the year as is practical after these costs have been established. In addition, the Employer will provide the Union with Health Plan enrollment information on a quarterly basis.
2.	Comprehensive Medical Plan (CMP)
The CMP makes available to participants a Preferred Provider Network. Whai participants use such Preferred Providers (In-Network) for covered services, the benefits payable under the Plan are enhanced according to the “In-Network Payment Formula.” When participants use providers who are not designated as Preferred Providers under the Plan (Out-of-Network), covered services will be paid according to the “Out-of-Network Payment Formula” which provides a lesser benefit The In-Network and Out-of-Network Payment Formulas and other benefit features are described below.
