16
return the list to the American Arbitration Association. If a party does not return the list within the time specified, all persons named therein shall be deemed acceptable to that party.
5-5-1-2 From among the persons who have been approved on both lists, and in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference, the American Arbitration Association shall invite the acceptance of a mediator/fact-finder.
5-5-1-3 If the parties fail to agree upon any of the persons named, or if those named decline or are unable to act, or if for any other reason an appointment cannot be made from such list of names, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint a mediator/fact-finder from its other members without submitting additional lists.

5-6-1 The mediator/fact-finder will have the authority to hold hearings, make procedural rules, and set the dates and times for meetings, which will be conducted in closed sessions.
5-6-2 The mediator/fact-finder will meet with the District and the Association, through their representatives, either separately or together, to mediate the disputes.
5-6-3 To the extent that a tentative agreement is reached as a result of such mediation, the procedures provided in Sections 5-6-1 and 5-6-2 shall apply. If mediation fails in whole or in part, the mediator shall report the issues which remain in dispute to the respective parties.

If either party objects, another fact-finder shall be selected as outlined in Section 5-5.
5-6-5 Within five (5) school days after receiving the fact-finding report of the mediator/fact-finder or the fact-finder, the District and the Association, through their representatives, will meet to discuss the report. Public release of the report may be made any time after the conclusion of such meeting. Thereafter, such report shall be declared a public document.
5-6-6 The respective parties shall take official action on the report of the mediator/fact-finder or the fact-finder no later than thirty (30) school days after the meeting described in Section 5-6-5 above.
5-6-7 To the extent that tentative agreement is reached on the issues in dispute as a result of such mediation/fact-finding, the procedures provided in Sections 5-4-1 and 5-4-2 shall apply.
17
5-6-8 The costs for the services of the mediator/fact-finder, or fact-finder, including per diem expenses, if any, and actual and necessary travel expenses, shall be shared equally by the Board and the Association.
5-6-9 Either party may request that an official stenographic record of all or part of the testimony taken at the fact-finding hearings be made, and a copy of any transcript shall be provided to the fact-finder. The party requesting a stenographic record shall pay the costs thereof, except that if the other party shall request a copy of any transcript, it shall share equally the entire cost of making the stenographic record.

Article 18
18 Class Size
18-1 The parties recognize that maximum attention to students by the teacher is desirable to ensure the high quality education that is the goal of both the Association and the Board. It is also acknowledged that the primary duty and responsibility of the teacher is to teach, and that the organization of the school, the school day and assignment of students to classes should be directed toward ensuring that the energies of the teacher are primarily utilized to this end.
18-2 The Board and the Association further acknowledge that proper class size is a function of many factors, including course objectives, subject matter, teaching process, scheduling patterns, and style of educational activity. Further, that every effort will be made to adjust class size to allow individual attention to each student when that is the required mode of instruction, and except in any emergency situations, pupils will not be placed in any
39
classroom in larger numbers than the capacity of the teaching facilities and stations available in that classroom.
18-3 The Association and the Board recognize all grades as being very critical in the educational development of the student. Further, both parties recognize that class size has an effect upon the students' experience. Accordingly, it is mutually agreed that every effort will be made to limit the class size as follows:
18-3-1	Average class size in grades K-6 and Specials are defined below beginning in the
fall of 2005:
Grade Level	Class Size Target	Acceptable Range
Kindergarten	24	22-26
Grades One,	20	18-22
Two and Three	24	22-26
Grade Four Grades Five and Six	28	26-30
Elementary Specials staffing is as follows for grades 1-6:
Specials FTE	Number of Sections
0.5	2	3	4
1.0	5	6	7
1.5	8	9	10
2.0	11	12	13
2.5	14	15	16

5.5	32	33	34
6.0	35	36	37
When combining specials classes there may be no more than thirty (30) students per class.
When classes reach the following thresholds, a request may be made to the Class Size Relief Committee. Class size relief will take into consideration classes that are impacted by special needs students. The committee will investigate ways to alleviate the class size problem.
Grade
Kindergarten - Four Five, Six and Specials
Students
25
28
40
Students with IEP’s, 504 Plans, and English language learners can be considered in determining class size.
18-3-1-1	Requests for additional aide time or class size adjustments may be
made when the individual class size reaches the numbers specified in the preceding paragraph on the third student contact day of a semester. Provisions for additional assistance will be in effect for the remainder of the semester unless changed for justifiable reasons, emergencies, or by mutual agreement in writing between the principal and teacher(s) affected.
Furthermore, it is agreed that the allocation of aide time is to be used as a temporary solution to provide interim relief while the administrator seeks ways to fulfill the class size standard established herein and shall be in addition to the assigned District aide ratio.
18-3-1-2	Exceptions to the class size requirement may be made for
experimental programs and by mutual agreement, in writing, between the principal and teacher(s) affected.
18-3-2 The class size relief fund will be $627,400.
18-3-3 The maximum secondary load, the number of students for which a teacher shall be responsible for evaluating, will be 150 students per day for each classroom teacher. To exceed the one hundred fifty (150) maximum, the principal will collaborate with the affected teacher to insure that course objectives and safety standards can be met with the additional students. The principal and the teacher will attempt to arrive at a mutually agreeable decision. If they cannot do that the curriculum specialist in the affected content area will provide consultation. Laboratory classes shall not exceed the number of students which can be safely taught at the number of work stations in the classroom. A supervisory assignment as opposed to a teaching assignment will consist of supervising student safety and behavior and does not apply to the 150 student per day count. It will not include teaching, planning or assessment of student work. Such supervision may include tutoring, advisory time and/or help sessions.
18-3-3-1	The aforementioned secondary load shall be accomplished by staffing
high schools at a ratio of 42.5 teachers per 1,000 students and middle schools at a ratio of 43.5 teachers per 1,000 students.
18-4 Prior to assigning any educationally and/or emotionally handicapped self-contained student to a regular education (including elementary specials) classroom, the teacher having responsibility for implementing an Individual Education Plan (IEP) shall be given an opportunity to contribute to the IEP or be advised of his/her implementation responsibilities, if their presence is not deemed to be essential to the IEP development.

administrator) Leadership Advisory Team to the Class Size Relief Committee, in accordance with 18-5-2 above.
18-5-4	The District will grant necessary and reasonable release time to Committee
members to perform necessary duties of the Committee.
18-5-5	Upon approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee, decisions of the Class
Size Relief Committee shall be final.
18-6 Any teacher assigned to perform non-teaching duties of an administrative or supervisory nature for fifty (50) percent or more of his/her workday shall not be counted in the staffing ratio, unless the teachers within a building or administrative area approve such assignment by a majority vote. The results of the vote will be kept on record. This action may be subject to annual review.
18-7 In no instance shall a full teaching position within a building, as permitted by the ratio, be converted to a classified position.
18-8 In order to implement this provision, the parties agree to the following:
18-8-1	The principal will review his/her staffing at the beginning of each school year
and will make adjustments to conform to the ranges established herein.
18-8-2	If the class size standard is exceeded when school starts, a teacher may appeal
to his/her principal to adjust his/her class size to conform to said standard.
18-8-3	Upon receipt of the appeal, the principal will attempt to rectify the situation by
hiring additional teaching staff, if at all possible, and will involve the teacher(s) who requested the adjustment and the association representative. If a satisfactory resolution is reached, the parties shall reduce the resolution to writing and each shall sign it.
18-8-4	If agreement cannot be reached, an appeal may be initiated. Said appeal shall
be reviewed by the community superintendent. The community superintendent shall respond within ten (10) working days.
42
18-8-5 If a teacher feels his/her contractual rights were violated in this process, the teacher may file a grievance.
18-9 The Association and the District agree that any development of new, or changes in current staffing practices and/or ratios for any teacher or group of teachers, will involve the Association with the intent of developing an agreement that is mutually acceptable to both parties.

School authorities will endeavor to achieve correction of student misbehavior through consistent application of the school discipline policy, and through counseling and interviews with the child and his/her parents, when warranted.
19-5-1	In lieu of suspension, the principal or his/her designee may, at his/her discretion
permit the student to remain in school on the condition that the student’s parent(s) attend class with the student for a period of time established by the principal or designee. This alternative is not automatic. The principal or his/her designee will consult with the student’s teachers and obtain their consent before implementing this alternative. In the event that this alternative becomes disruptive, the school will immediately terminate this option.
19-5-2	Consistent with District Policy JK-R, Student Discipline (Habitually Disruptive), a
remedial discipline plan will be developed by the principal or his/her designee
44
with the assistance of the student’s teacher(s) and any other school personnel involved.

Performance Positions included in the job description. Such positions will not be filled by involuntary transferees unless qualified and acceptable.
34-6	Involuntary Teacher Transfer
34-6-1	If at any time a school is identified as being overstaffed, the following process
will be used to identify involuntary transfers. Involuntary teacher transfers at the elementary level will be determined on a building-wide basis. In the case of a school with mandatory, district-defined ESL requirements, ESL-qualified teachers and teachers in process and scheduled to become ESL-qualified within two (2) years can be protected from being an involuntary if the school does not have the minimum number of required ESL-qualified teachers. Involuntary teacher transfers at the secondary level will be identified based on the subject area that is currently being taught. Teachers teaching in multiple subject areas
59
will be identified based on the majority of sections taught or, in the case of an equal split, will be identified in multiple areas. Extra one-sixth (1/6th) periods, will not be considered. An involuntary with multiple endorsements who is highly qualified in more than one area cannot bump another, less senior teacher, in a different subject area in which they are not currently teaching, but may be assigned to a vacancy for which they are highly qualified. Prior to identifying an involuntary transfer an administrator will communicate to the staff the number of anticipated classes by grade level and subject area and the resulting impact on staff.
34-6-2	Teachers who have been identified as potential involuntary transferees will be
advised as soon as possible but no later than March 1 each year of this possible transfer. Should the projected number of positions be reduced after that date, any additional potential involuntary transferees shall be notified as soon as possible.
34-6-3	Teachers may be involuntarily transferred under the following conditions:
34-6-3-1	Where reduction in student enrollment makes such transfer
necessary
34-6-3-2	To accommodate paid leave returnees
34-6-3-3	To fill assignments which cannot be accommodated by the existing
staff
34-6-3-4	Teachers holding Schedule I positions may be subject to involuntary
transfer if they resign from their additional performance responsibilities within three (3) years of their initial employment, provided no individual within the building is qualified and willing to fulfill said additional performance assignment, or no other teaching position is open to which the additional performance assignment could be linked.
A. This provision (Section 34-6-3-D) shall only apply to teachers whose original hiring or transfer included one (1) or more of the aforementioned additional performance responsibilities as a part of their teaching assignment.
34-6-4	Teachers identified as potential involuntary transferees will be identified in the
following manner:
34-6-4-1	The department, grade level or team which has the surplus will be
identified.
34-6-4-2	In the following provisions, length of service in the District shall be,
as defined in Section 1-9, Full-time Continuous Service.
60
34-6-4-3	The teachers within the identified grade level, department, or team
will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given first option to involuntarily transfer. If this teacher is not interested in the transfer, the transfer will be offered to the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District, etc. If no teacher desires to fill the position, the teacher with the least length of service in the District will be identified as the potential involuntary transferee, unless, by the transferring of the teacher with the least length of service in the District, the school or, in the case of SERS personnel, the Area, is unable to meet identified instructional needs within the grade level, department or team.
34-6-4-4	In instances where declining enrollment causes teaching positions
within a building, or, in the case of SERS personnel, within an Area, to be combined, the teachers involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as a potential involuntary transferee. If, after the teacher with the greatest length of service has made his/her choice, open positions still remain, the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District will be offered his/her choice of the remaining position(s), etc. The aforementioned process shall be followed going from the most senior to the least senior teacher, until no positions remain. In the case where none of the teachers involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the teacher(s) with the least length of service in the District.
34-6-4-5	In instances where declining enrollment in separate buildings
(school locations) causes the combining of teaching positions, which would result in the elimination of teaching position(s), the teachers involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective position(s). If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as a potential involuntary transferee. If, after the teacher with the greatest length of service has made his/her choice, open position(s) still remain, the teacher with the next greatest length of service in the District will be offered his/her choice of the remaining position(s), etc. The aforementioned process shall be followed going from the most senior to the least senior teacher until no positions remain. In the case where none of the teachers involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be
61
awarded to the teacher(s) with the least length of service in the District.
34-6-4-6	In instances where teachers are assigned to more than one (1)
school (split assignments), the principal of the home school or his/her building level administrator shall identify for said teachers their home schools within thirty (30) calendar days of the beginning of the teacher’s work year. The teacher shall be considered a staff member of the identified school and shall be given all the rights and privileges accorded thereto, including intra-building reassignment.
34-6-4-7	In instances where split school assignments have been re-paired
and where the newly-paired schools have been identified as home schools for the teachers involved in the split assignments, the teachers involved shall attempt to arrive at a mutually-acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of service in the District shall be placed in the position of his/her choice. The teacher with the least length of service in the District shall be placed in the remaining position.
34-6-4-8	Exceptions to the above may be made when the involuntary
transfer might affect a teacher with below-average evaluations and for which a planned program of improvement has been submitted to the teacher.
34-6-4-9	Teachers who have been identified as possible involuntary
transferees may seek a voluntary transfer through June 30, as outlined in Section 34-5-2.
34-6-4-10 When possible, teachers who have been identified as involuntary transferees will be transferred to a comparable position, provided they are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs of the school.
34-6-5 In the event two (2) or more potential involuntary transferees under Section 34-6-4 have the same length of service in the District, the teacher with the least length of service, using the following criteria, shall be identified as the potential involuntary transferee.
34-6-5-1	Teachers shall be ranked in order of the greatest length of service as
a teacher in the building, provided this criteria shall not apply to Section 34-6-4 (34-6-4-4) or (34-6-4-5).
34-6-5-2	In the event that ties still exist after the application of paragraph A.
above, teachers shall be ranked as to when they signed their employment contract with the District.
62

41 Job Sharing
41-1 For the purpose of this Agreement, job sharing shall mean the occupation of a single staff position by two (2) non-probationary teachers, with each assignment being half-time each day for the entire contractual work year. Both teachers must be highly qualified to fill every aspect of the position to be shared. Job sharing is not a contractual right, but rather, an opportunity for non-probationary teachers. The principal or immediate supervisor and the job sharing teachers (team) may agree to a work schedule allowing the teachers to work every other day or a variation thereof in order to better meet educational needs. However, a job sharing teacher may not work a prolonged period of time with a like amount of time off, such as, one quarter on, and one quarter off; or one (1) semester on, one (1) semester off. In all arrangements, each teacher must work each week. In the case of secondary school assignments, where sharing a teaching position in the same manner each day would lead to an unbalanced workload, teaching schedules shall be arranged in a manner as to provide for an equal workload between the participants during the course of the school year. Temporary teachers and first and second year probationary teachers are not eligible to apply for job sharing. Third year probationary teachers may apply for job sharing if the teacher meets or exceeds standards in all four (4) performance areas.
41-2 Non-probationary teachers who so choose may agree to share one job position for a period of time not less than one (1) year. A team may renew its job sharing position for additional year(s) or the teacher may select a new teammate and reapply.
A teacher returning from any job sharing position after one (1) or two (2) year(s) will be returned to his/her former or comparable position at the same school or in the same SERS Area. Job protection provisions are in Article 46.
41-3 Teachers who have exhausted their two (2) years of school- or Area-specific job protection, in the case of SERS, will share any approved job share position. If either of the job sharing teachers determine not to apply for a job share in successive years, or the job share application is not approved, the job sharing partners would attempt to arrive at a
78
mutually agreeable solution as to which teacher stays in the current job sharing position, and which teacher would be an unassigned leave returnee, as per Section 34-7. If the job sharing teachers cannot agree, the teacher with the greatest length of continuous service shall be given his/her choice of staying in the current position or being an unassigned leave returnee, as per Section 34-7.
A teacher job sharing beyond two (2) years will have his/her job protected only if he/she is job sharing his/her own position with a teacher who has not exhausted two (2) years of job-specific protection per Article 46.
41-4	If one (1) teacher in a job sharing situation has an illness or takes a short leave of absence,
the other teacher may agree to teach full-time during said leave at the substitute rate or other mutually agreed upon arrangement as approved by the Director of Employment Services or his/her designee.
41-5	Any such job sharing arrangements shall be voluntary and mutually agreed upon, in
writing, by the teachers and principals or immediate supervisors involved, as well as the District and JCEA. A teacher desiring to job share should approach his/her principal or supervisor for preliminary approval prior to seeking a job-sharing partner.
41-6	Teachers interested in job sharing shall be responsible for identifying teachers who would
be willing to job share with them. Teachers agreeing to job share shall submit a completed application form to the Human Resources Department with a copy to JCEA. The Human Resources Department shall be responsible for determining job sharing eligibility.
41-7	All agreements for job sharing must be submitted to Human Resources with principal
approval prior to February 15th.
41-8	Both teachers of a job sharing team must be highly qualified for the shared position.
41-9	Service credit for P.E.R.A. will be counted in accordance with P.E.R.A. policy.
41-10	Participants in job sharing agree to half the standard benefits allocation, half leave
accruals, and half their annual salary, as determined by their positions on the adopted salary schedule as a full-time teacher at the time they begin the job sharing assignment.
41-11	Continuous service will accrue for a teacher in a job share position on a half-time basis.
41-12	After consultation with the participants, the teaching schedule will be determined by the
administrator(s) who will have supervisory responsibility for the team under this Article.
41-12-1 If requested, both teachers will attend required faculty meetings.
41-12-2 As needed, teachers will participate in scheduled parent conferences, as required of all other full-time teachers.
41-12-3 Teachers must share equally the responsibility in meeting identified building or position needs, provided the workload for a job sharing team shall not be greater than the equivalent of one (1) full-time teaching position.
79
41-13 The job sharing team shall continue for a minimum of one (1) year. If, for any reason, one of the participants in a job share is unable to fulfill their half of the agreement, first the other partner will be given the option to fill the position full-time. If this is not agreeable, a temporary teacher will be hired on a half-time basis to fill the vacant half of the position with no negative bearing on the remaining teacher. Non-probationary or probationary teachers will not be considered for this opening.
41-14 Teachers approved for job sharing will be considered as a part of the faculty of the school/SERS assignment from which they came for such matters as determining involuntary transferees, etc.
41-15 Vacancies created by teachers forming a job sharing team shall be filled with a temporary contracted teacher if the teachers in the job share are eligible to protect their position per Article 46. This will be determined and communicated by Human Resources based on the individual circumstances of each job share partner.
41-16 Job sharing shall not be used as a means of reducing the work force.
41-17 Job sharing teachers shall have the right to return to full-time status with no loss of benefits upon termination of their job sharing team, except as provided in Section 41-3.
41-18 Non-probationary teachers who are job sharing under the provisions of this Article will be entitled to the protections set forth in the Teacher Employment, Compensation and Dismissal Act.

APPENDIX 4
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Goals for Elementary Visual Arts, Music and Physical Education Teacher
1	The Jefferson County Public Schools and Association are committed to retain and support the visual arts, music and physical education teacher concept at the elementary level. Teachers in the instructional areas of visual art, music, and physical education are provided because they:
1-1 Have proven educational expertise in their fields;
1-2 Provide quality experiences in the subject areas meeting student, District, and community expectations;
1-3 Take best advantage of the instructional time available in these subject areas to provide quality experiential learning;
1-4 Encourage students' creative and aesthetic growth;
1-5 Provide students with safe and proper activities for physical and skill development;
1-6 And provide expertise in the safe handling and utilization of various types of equipment, instruments, tools, mediums, and materials available in the programs.
2	The regular classroom teacher, normally, does not have the educational background or interest in these areas sufficient to carry out the sophisticated programs in place in Jefferson County Public Schools.
3	The purpose of these goals is to establish standards for the assignment of elementary visual arts, music and physical education teachers. These goals strive for equity throughout the District regarding teaching loads, frequency of class contact, and length of contact sessions to meet the standards of Board policy relative to the instructional day.
4	These goals are to be utilized by area administrators and principals as goals for elementary visual arts, music and physical education program implementation effective August, 1995. In the event that an unexpected increase in pupil enrollment or a lack of facilities dictates that these goals cannot be honored, area administrators and principals will take note and initiate adjustments as soon as educationally feasible.
4-1 Insofar as possible, the goals will be to assign eighteen (18) sections per teacher. *Note: Class size relief may be applied for if the number of sections exceeds nineteen (19).
4-2 To the extent possible, class size of the visual arts, music and physical education teacher should be consistent with the teaching load of a classroom teacher within the building.
4-3 Special education students who are mainstreamed into visual art, music, and physical education should be integrated in a manner consistent with the regular classroom. When it is most appropriate educationally to maintain a group of special education students as a separate class in visual arts, music, and physical education, this group shall be counted as a section for the visual arts, music and physical education teachers.
98
4-4 There should be time allowed for travel between schools as determined by the principal and area administrator.
4-5 Expectations for special programs are identified in Key Features documents and other program materials.
5	When visual arts, music and physical education teachers are assigned to two (2) schools, adjustments are needed regarding expectations for performances, exhibits, and other identified program, as well as time to travel, set up, put away and plan, in order to meet instructional needs at each site. The yearly school calendars should be coordinated in a meeting of the principals and the visual arts, music and physical education teachers involved.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Co-Operative Decision Making (CDM)
In order to assure successful implementation of the Co-operative Decision Making (CDM) process, the District and the JCEA agree to incorporate the CDM Task Force report into this Memorandum of Understanding. Further, the parties agree to the following:
•	Building CDM committees will develop norms which provide a safe environment for all stakeholders and encourage their full participation in the CDM process.
•	The building CDM Committee will operate separately from the building Liaison Committee, as provided for in Article 20.
•	Funding for training will be made available in an amount to be determined on an annual basis in conjunction with the budget development process. Full report follows.
Co-Operative Decision Making
1 Introduction
1-1 The concept of shared decision-making was first explored in January, 1990, as an avenue to involve stakeholders and make better decisions in the District. A task force of representatives of the employee associations, PTA and the District sponsored three District-wide conversations for school employees and community members to create an action plan for shared decision-making in Jeffco. In August, 1991, the Board of Education adopted the CoOperative Decision-Making Statement of Beliefs which states in part, “There is an expectation that schools and departments in the District will use a co-operative decision-making process whenever appropriate.”
1-2 A broad-based task force worked for two years to identify common ingredients of successful models; determine unresolved issues; learn about needs and resources; and make recommendations based on seventy-eight (78) site interviews throughout the District.
1-3 In May, 1993, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Board of Education and JCEA created a charge to the Co-Operative Decision-Making Task Force. The charge was: define cooperative decision-making; clarify the scope and authority of decision making at work sites;
99
determine training needed; and develop a transition process and models, and a proposed time line for implementation.
1-4 This document represents the work of the Task Force in fulfilling that charge. It is expected that all schools and work sites will have a functioning structure for co-operative decisionmaking by September, 1996.
1-5 Students and their proficiencies are the primary focus of all co-operative decisions made at each work site and serve as the foundation for a student-centered vision.
1-6 Co-operative decision-making works best in a context which ensures broad-based representation of primary clients including: students, parents, employees and the community. Other participants can be included in the process, as the need requires.
1-7 Each school’s Accountability Plan and each work site’s goals and objectives will reflect a student-centered vision. These will provide the necessary framework for effective implementation of a District-wide, student-centered quality program. It is expected that all decisions made are in compliance with Federal and State regulations, employee agreements, and District policies and procedures.
1-8 The co-operative decision-making process is flexible enough to ensure effective responses to varying situations and needs. Collaboration which seeks consensus enhances the potential for successful implementation of decisions. The co-operative decision-making process will look different at the various work sites. A collaborative process will be used to determine: 1) which decisions will be collaborative, consultative or command at a given work site; 2) which decision-making methods will be used; 3) in which areas of scope and authority co-operative decision-making will occur; and 4) what are the roles and responsibilities for implementation.
2	Definition
2-1 Co-Operative Decision-Making is a collaborative process that includes all of these elements:
2-1-1	A commonly held, student-centered vision.
2-1-2	A climate of trust.
2-1-3 A respect for diverse ideas and interests.
2-1-4 An open dialogue and debate.
2-1-5 A shared leadership, accountability, authority and responsibility.
2-1-6 An actively involved, broad-based representation of employees, parents, students and the community.
2-2 The goal of Co-Operative Decision-Making is to continuously improve education for the students in Jefferson County Public Schools.
100
3	Types of Decisions
3-1 CDM recognizes that there are different types of decisions:
3-1-1 Collaborative: Decisions made by stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups. Collaboration based on consensus ensures that all stakeholders will have a voice and will support the decisions.
3-1-2 Consultative: Decisions made by the designated individuals after consultation with stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups.
3-1-3 Command: Decisions made by the designated individuals without consultation with stakeholders and/or representatives of stakeholder groups.
4	Scope and Authority
4-1 Scope and authority determine what types of decisions are made and how they are made. The impact of a school/department decisions on other parts of the organization must be considered. Therefore, co-operative decision-making teams need to select decisions within the context of approved employee contracts, adopted Board policies and existing federal, state and local laws. Decisions to be made may include, but are not limited to, the following examples.
4-2 Instruction: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Instructional models and strategies; student assessment and placement; learning resources, staff development and employee training; student awards and recognition; enrichment activities and exceptional students needs.
4-3 Allocation of Resources: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Interviewing, selecting and recognizing employees and volunteers; recruiting volunteers; budget development, expenditures and evaluation; grant writing and the use of community and volunteer resources.
4-4 Governance and Management: Suggestions for potential decisions include: Room assignments, facility management, support services, transportation, field trips, discipline plan, extra-curricular activities, student progress reporting procedures, scheduling, community relations and communications.
4-5 Requests from the site for variances and memoranda of understanding will be reviewed at both the work site and within the articulation areas, as well as by representatives of appropriate State agencies, Board of Education, District administration, employee organizations and community groups. A procedure has been established for seeking variances from the JCEA R-1 Master Agreement.
5	Standards for the Co-Operative Decision-Making Process
The following standards and questions are designed to assist in the establishment and ongoing assessment of your co-operative decision-making process: Schools/work sites are in various stages of development in their practice of CDM and may use these accordingly.
101
5-1 The participants are broadly representative of the school community.
5-1-1 What procedures are you following that assure your membership is representative of your school/work site community?
5-1-2 How will you assure that the membership selection process is fair and open?
5-1-3 What is the process by which you replace members?
5-1-4 How will you assure that each member has an equal voice?
5-1-5 How will you assure ethnic diversity?
5-2 The process operates with written rules that are widely understood.
5-2-1 How does your governing document establish roles and responsibilities?
5-2-2 What is the structure for your process?
5-2-3 What is your plan for distributing your governing documents to your school/work site community?
5-3 The roles of the various decision-making groups are understood within the CDM process.
5-3-1 What decision-making groups exist at your school or work site?
5-3-2 What is the relationship among decision-making groups at your school/work site?
5-4 The CDM process has a shared vision that focuses on improvement of student learning.
5-4-1 What is the shared vision around which your co-operative decision-making process is organized?
5-4-2 In what way does your vision include improving the learning environment and education/services to all students?
5-5 The CDM process determines what decisions are made and how they are made.
5-5-1 What decisions will be made at the school/work site?
5-5-2 What is your plan for collaboratively determining how decisions are made and the manner in which they will be communicated to members of your school/work site community?
5-6 Meetings are open and at convenient times.
5-6-1 What process will you use to assure that meetings are open and convenient to all?
5-7 The CDM process is communicated internally and externally.
102
5-7-1 How does your communication plan serve your internal and external communities?
5-7-2 What plan do you have for producing, maintaining and distributing a written record of your process to your school/work site community?
5-8 The process is evaluated to determine its effectiveness.
5-8-1 How will you evaluate the effectiveness of your process?
5-8-2 Training is provided for all participants.
5-8-3 What is your strategy for providing ongoing technical knowledge/training for each participant?
5-9 Assistance is utilized when needed.
5-9-1 What additional assistance does your school/work site require in order to help you establish or improve your co-operative decision-making process, e.g., consultation, concrete examples, technical assistance and training?
6	CDM Implementation
6-1 It is expected that all schools and work sites will have a functioning structure for co-operative decision-making by September, 1996. Some sites that already have co-operative decisionmaking structures in operation, and after self-evaluation, may move into step two of implementation. For those sites in the early stages of development, it is recommended that a facilitator be used to provide assistance in the development and ongoing evaluation of a successful co-operative decision-making process. Sites that do not have a co-operative decision-making process in place may use an existing group or groups to meet the cooperative decision-making standards. Ongoing training of all stakeholders is a critical and necessary component of successful co-operative decision-making.
6-2 The following steps detail a process for successful transition to co-operative decision-making at all schools and work sites:
6-2-1 Step One: Development of Site Co-Operative Decision-Making
6-2-1-1 Conduct a self-assessment of critical attributes to determine readiness or effectiveness of operation using the questions in Section V., Standards for the Co-Operative Decision-Making Process.
6-2-1-2 Prepare a school or site implementation program with defined time lines.
6-2-1-3 Define a co-operative decision-making governance structure. To implement a Co-Operative Decision-Making process, sites may use existing committees, restructure existing committees, create a new entity, or any combination to meet the defined co-operative decision-making standards for their site.
6-2-1-4 Adopt and implement a scope and authority model (who will decide what).
103
6-2-1-5 Develop method for selecting CDM participants.
6-2-1-6 Plan and provide training for key stakeholders.
Examples and detailed descriptions of how sites have used co-operative decisionmaking, appointed selected participants, and structured their process are described in the “Co-Operative Decision-Making Resource Book.” The Resource Book also includes samples of operating rules, process descriptions and membership structures of existing co-operative decision-making systems. Copies of the resource book will be available in conjunction with the self-assessment video that the Task Force will provide. (See page 7.)
6-2-2 Step Two: Implementation of Site CDM Plan
6-2-2-1 Formalize goals and objectives.
6-2-2-2 Continue training for stakeholders participating in the program.
6-2-2-3 Revisit scope and authority model.
6-2-2-4 Provide ongoing evaluation of program.
7	Support and Assistance
7-1 As the District moves toward the full implementation of a co-operative decision-making process, schools/work sites will require support to understand how this process can best meet the needs of the school/work site. To provide this support, a team of trained facilitators will be made available to assist these schools/work sites. District employees, parents and volunteers who have demonstrated an ability to provide positive leadership for the cooperative decision-making process will be recruited as facilitators.
7-2 In addition to support and assistance from trained facilitators, there will be a process review to assess the effectiveness of CDM on a District-wide basis. A Coordinating Committee will be structured to provide this process review.
7-3 Site Evaluation
7-3-1 A critical first step in implementing co-operative decision-making in the District will be the identification of a CDM process at each school/work site. This report recommends providing support to participants of training and technical assistance. The CoOperative Decision-Making (CDM) Task Force will produce an interactive video that will assist all schools/work sites in a self-assessment to determine where they are in the process and what needs to be done. After viewing the video and completing the self-assessment, schools/work sites will determine training needs and utilize their allocation from the CDM funds identified by the Board.
7-3-2 Schools and work sites will also receive a CDM Resource Book that will contain samples from other schools and districts, and a list of resources for assistance and support.
104
7-3-3 At the conclusion of each year, each school/site will be required to complete a form reporting on how assistance was used as well as the effectiveness of co-operative decision-making efforts. The form will ask for signatures of each participant serving at the school/site.
7-4 Support and Assistance by Local Facilitators
7-4-1 The District will create a Co-Operative Decision-Making Support Team by training volunteers who will be willing to assist sites on an “as-called” basis. Volunteers will include teachers, administrators, classified employees, parents, students and others who currently use co-operative decision-making at their site.
7-4-2 To create the pool of facilitators, the following organizations should be asked to solicit volunteers for this task. Following training, the names will be compiled for distribution to each school/site council:
7-4-2-1	Jefferson County	Education Association
7-4-2-2	Jefferson County	Administrators Association
7-4-2-3	Classified School	Employees Association
7-4-2-4	Student Councils
7-4-2-5 Parent Teacher Association
7-4-2-6 District Accountability Committee
7-4-2-7 Volunteers/seniors active in the District
7-5 District CDM Coordinating Committee
7-5-1 A Coordinating Committee will be created with two assigned responsibilities:
7-5-1-1	Review of site appeals.
7-5-1-2	District co-operative decision-making assessment.
7-6 The Coordinating Committee will meet a minimum of twice a year, mid-year and at the end of the school year, to evaluate progress in co-operative decision-making efforts throughout the District. To conduct this review, the Committee will use the data from the feedback provided by sites at the end of the year.
7-7 The second function proposed for the Coordinating Committee is to provide an appeals process for schools/sites. The Coordinating Committee should be composed of Board of Education appointees and representatives of JCEA, JCAA, CSEA District Accountability, Parent/Teacher/Student Associations, volunteers and community organizations.
7-8 When presented with an appeal, the Coordinating Committee, using the standards set for all schools/sites, will determine if the appeal is a co-operative decision-making issue. It is not the
105
purpose of the Coordinating Committee to review site decisions, but to assist in assuring a cooperative process has taken place.
7-9 The Coordinating Committee members may be expected to gather appropriate data prior to convening meetings. Coordinating Committee meetings will be convened to review appeals, to collect information from all parties and to respond with suggestions for process improvement.
7-10 Co-operative decision-making is a process designed to encourage involvement for mutual benefit. It is the expectation of the Board of Education that the process be developed within each school and department. The purpose of the District Co-Operative Decision-Making Coordinating Committee is to assure that such a process is in place and to assist in facilitating the process where possible. The issues and procedures used in co-operative decision-making will always be within the limitations of Board of Education policies and procedures, negotiated agreements, and State laws.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

The Jefferson County School District and Jefferson County Education Association agree to create a Memorandum of Understanding to implement an addition to the regular ratio in the Negotiated Agreement Section 18-3-3-1. It is agreed up to an additional thirty-six (36) teachers will be hired to meet the current State mandated Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) recommendations for increased math and science instruction.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Workload Relief
This Memorandum of Understanding is made and executed this 16th day of May, 2011, by and between Jefferson County Public School District (“District”) and the Jefferson County Education Association (“Association”).
WHEREAS, the District and Association share a mutual interest that new initiatives be implemented in a manner that encourages the effective and efficient implementation of such initiatives; and
WHEREAS, the District and Association have identified certain initiatives for which additional time and support for implementation is warranted for the 2011-2012 school year.
THEREFORE, the District and Association agree as follows.
A.	Standards-Based Grading at Middle Schools:
1.	For middle schools that have not used standards-based grading in the 2010-2011 school year:
a.	No additional middle schools will implement standards-based grading in 2011/2012.
106
b.	The District will continue the work group created last year comprised of principals, teachers and members of the Division of Instruction. This group will continue to review issues and strategies in order to develop an effective and efficient standardbased report card. They will develop a timeline and design a process to ensure successful implementation of the standards-based reporting tool for all middle schools after the 2011/2012 school year.
2.	Middle schools who have already begun to implement standards-based grading:
a.	DLEA will provide intensive support for identified middle schools who are currently using a standards-based report card to ensure the development of a collaborative model that will benefit the individual schools as well as the District in developing a standardized middle school reporting tool. The specific support needed will be determined collaboratively with the school administration and teachers, and will be based on the needs of the school. Some schools in the process may need more assistance than others. These schools will be represented in the above-mentioned work group.
b.	Communication will continue to be provided to the schools/teachers concerning the support that will be made available.
B.	Elementary Infinite Campus Grade Book and Parent Portal:
1.	Parent Portal
a.	The Parties acknowledge that Parent Portal has never been required at the elementary level and those schools that have initiated it have done so as a sitebased decision. Accordingly, any elementary school not currently using Parent Portal will not be permitted to initiate such use in the 2011/2012 school year.
b.	Elementary schools that are already using Parent Portal will be encouraged to involve stakeholders, including teachers and parents, to address concerns and to address any questions about the continued use of Parent Portal at the school.
2.	Infinite Campus Grade Book
a.	The roll-out of Infinite Campus Grade Book for schools that have not already implemented or that are in the process of implementing will be extended an additional year. This will push completion of the rollout out to the 2013/2014 school year.
b.	Schools can use already existing forums such as Leadership Advisory Teams to make a determination if they want to proceed with the next level of implementation during the 2011/2012 ‘suspension’ year.
107
c.	Schools and the District will continue to evaluate the Infinite Campus Grade Book tool, work with IT to address technical issues, and improve communication among stakeholders regarding strategies for making the use of Grade Book more useful and efficient. The Instructional Advocacy Council (IAC) will continue to partner collaboratively in this work.
