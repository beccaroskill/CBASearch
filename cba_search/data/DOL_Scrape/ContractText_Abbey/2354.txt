Employee must make a vacation request under this section at least two weeks before the day the employee wishes to take the vacation day. The Company will grant or deny the request at the Company's sole discretion based on production and scheduling needs and any other considerations considered relevant by plant management.

Tentative Agreement
. MARCH 18,2016
Revise the first paragraph of “Appendix B” as follows:
Beginning on January 1, 2014, and each year thereafter, employees will be allowed to carry forward accrued and unused Personal and Sick Days, up to a collective total of 12 days (that is, any combination of Personal and Sick Days that equals a maximum total of 12 days), Employees may choose to carry over unused 2013 personal days in lieu of incentive pay. Each employee will earn one (1) unpaid Personal Day for every two months worked. Each day shall be earned and awarded at the beginning of each two-month period. In addition to Personal Day accrual, each employee shall receive three (3) unpaid Sick Days per year. Sick days may be used to care for immediate family members as defined in the FMLA. Sick Days shall be awarded on March 1 of each year following January 1, 2014. For each day an employee misses work due to an illness, one (1) Sick Day shall be deducted from the employee’s Sick Day bank. Sick Days shall be used simultaneously with any FMLA and other leave(s) of absence under Section 68, Leaves of Absence for Illness or Injury, Section 70, Maternity Leave, Section 71(a), Leave of Absence for Care of Newborn or Adopted Child, and Section 71(b), Leave of Absence for Family Care, except employees will be able to retain and/or accrue up to three (3) Sick Days that shall not be used simultaneously with a leave under this section. For example, an employee with a bank of three Sick Days and nine Personal Days (totaling 12 Sick and Personal Days) who takes a five week leave, must use nine of those 12 days simultaneously with a leave, leaving a maximum of three Sick Days to be used, if needed, after the conclusion of the approved leave. Employees who exhaust all Sick Days but require additional time off for illness or medically-excused absences must convert and use any available Personal Days as Sick Days. When an employee reaches the maximum twelve (12) personal/sick days accrued in a year, the excess will be banked to be paid out as incentive at the end of the year.
