Agreement by and between the Northern California Chapter, NECA, Alameda County Branch, and Local Union 595, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
It shall apply to all firms who sign a Leiter of Assent to be bound by this Agreement.
As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term “Chapter" shall mean the Northern California Chapter, Alameda County Branch. NECA, Inc., ‘and the term “Union” shall mean Local Union 595, IBEW.
The term “Employer" shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an Assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
Hie Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the beneficial relationship between the Employer, the Union and the public. Progress in industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union.
The Union recognizes the desirability of dealing with reputable and stable Employers. The Employer recognizes the responsibility of supplying the public with services performed by experienced personnel who can effectively install, service and maintain electrical installations in an efficient and safe manner prescribed by the National Board of Fire Underwriters, federal, state and local laws and ordinances.
The Employer finds it economically impossible to maintain or recruit his manpower requirements for the intermittent and temporary character of the work inherent in the Building Trades Industry. Therefore, the Employer desires to avail him/herself of a proven method of securing trained personnel on short notice and requests the Union to assist him/her in meeting this public responsibility. All will benefit by continuous peace by adjusting any differences by rational, common sense methods. Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promise and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows.
No employee covered by the provisions of the Agreement will be discriminated against on the basis of his or her race, color, sex, marital status, religion, age, national origin or ancestry, with regard to hiring, promotion, termination, or any other term or condition of employment. The intent and purpose of this Section is to meet the spirit and letter of all federal and state laws, regulations and executive orders that deal with equal employment.
