The undersigned Local of the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union and The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC are in agreement on the following items with a reference to layoffs and reductions resulting from a store closing.
There are eight zones to be used for layoffs and reductions of Full-time employees with Locals 1445 and 328. A Full-time employee may exercise his seniority within his zone in his same classification, or any lower classification. If an employee is unable to find an employee in a classification within his zone who has less seniority, he may look to another zone to find such a person. In any bump which takes place either within the same zone, or into another zone, the employee must bump the least senior employee at the location that employee is working; that is, there are no intermediate bumps. The new store into which an employee bumps becomes his new home store, for travel pay purposes, if it is further than his prior home store for travel pay purposes.

ADDENDUM TO THE PENSION PROVISIONS OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
[From Contract effective January 1,1997 through February 10,2001]
Section I
UFCW Locals 1445 and 1445 and The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company have discussed the possibility of merging the New England UFCW Pension Fund into the UFCW Industry Pension Fund. The bargaining parties determined that such a merger may be beneficial to the plan participants and the plan sponsors. However, at the current time, not enough information is available to the bargaining parties to fully evaluate merger options. Therefore, the Unions and the Employer agree to the following modifications of the pension provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement:
1.	The Employer will continue to contribute and participants will continue to accrue benefits in the New England UFCW Pension Fund. Effective February 9, 1997, the contribution for former Purity employees will increase to 45 cents per paid hour (subject to the appropriate maximums). Effective September 1, 1997, the contribution rate to the Pension Fund will increase to 50 cents for ail paid hours. This contribution increase shall not go into effect if the merger of the New England UFCW Pension Fund into the UFCW Industry Pension Fund takes place on or before September 1; 1997.
2.	The Employer and the Unions to this Collective Bargaining Agreement will recommend to the Trustees of the New England UFCW Pension Fund to immediately initiate merger discussions with the UFCW Industry Pension Fund. An agreement by the two pension funds to merge will be based on the following conditions:
a)	Unless the merger becomes effective on or before September 1, 1997, the provisions of (1) above must be implemented.
b)	Contribution Rate When/If A Merger Takes Place: Prior to the effective date of a merger, the Employer shall meet with the Unions and establish monthly contribution rates which in the.aggregate will not exceed the maximum contribution rates established in (1) above (the rate set forth in paragraph 1 above multiplied by a conversion factor of 1.15 based on 170 hours per month for Full-time and 101 hours per month for Part-time employees). If the terms of the merger agreement between the two pension funds result in Appropriate Unit Contribution Rates (AUCR's) for the New England UFCW Pension Fund group that, applying the above contribution rates, generate future service benefits greater than $58/month for Full-time and $22.50/month for Part-time employees, then, effective
-63-
Loctl 1445 (Cfata)
with the date of the merger, the Employer's contribution rate obligation will be adjusted to an amount needed to produce that benefit
c)	Contribution Rate Changes After The Effective Date Of The Merger: If after the effective date of the merger of the two pension plans, but before the expiration of this collective bargaining agreement, the AUCR's for the New England UFCW Pension Fund group are modified (prospectively or retroactively) by the Trustees of the UFCW Industry Pension Fund in a manner that would provide lower benefit rates than those established in 2(b) above, the Employer agrees to contribute up to the maximum rates consistent with 1 and 2(b) above (provided they are not already in effect) for so long as such modified AUCR's remain in effect during the life of this Agreement, or to recommend that the Trustees of the UFCW Industry Pension Fund utilize a portion of surplus reserves, if any,, that have been set aside from the assets of the New England UFCW Pension Fund.
Section II
UFCW Industry Pension Fund
Through June 30,1997 the Employer will continue to make the present contribution to the UFCW Industry Pension Fund. Effective July 1, 1997, the Employer shall contribute $125.73 per month for eligible Full-time employees and $15.72 per month for eligible Part-time employees in the Industry Fund. Effective January 1, 2000, the Employer shall contribute $127.86 per month for eligible Full-time employees in the Industry Fund. In no case, however, will the contribution rates so established produce a future service benefit from the Industry Fund greater than $58 per month for Full-time and $12.50 for Part-time employees. If the contribution rates would produce future service benefits in excess of those amounts, any contributions which would produce such excess shall be placed in a mutually-agreed upon account to be utilized, if necessary, to maintain future service benefits up to the maximum rates set forth in this paragraph.
Furthermore, effective July 1, 1997, the Company Meatcutters Supplemental Pension Plan shall be frozen for Full-time employees currently in the Plan. For Part-time eligible employees the future service benefit in the Supplemental Plan shall be $10.00 per month and extended to all Part-time employees participating in the Industry Pension Fund.
The parties agree that in the event of a merger between the New England UFCW Pension Fund and the UFCW Industry Pension Fund, pursuant to the conditions set forth in Section I of this Addendum, which results in an Employer contribution pursuant to paragraph 2(b) of Section I of this Addendum of less than the maximum amount required to be paid by die Employer under the terms of that paragraph, the Employer shall allocate the difference between the amount paid pursuant to said paragraph 2(b) and the maximum amount required to be paid by the Employer under the terms of that paragraph to increase Its contribution to the Industry Fund for Part-time employees, so long as any such contributions shall not produce future service benefits in the Industry Fund in excess
-64-
Local l44S(Cfata)
of $12.50 per month for Part-time employees. These contributions would commence no earlier than September 1,1997.
The bargaining parties will also recommend to the Trustees of the Industry Fund that as part of their re-valuation process of the AUCR's they treat all groups now employed by Stop & Shop who are currently in the Industry Fund as two groups - Full-time and Part-time - with no distinction in AUCR's within each such group.
Sect! n III
General Pension Provisions
The parties agree that effective January 1, 1997, all employees now participating In either the UFCW Industry or New England Funds shall remain in those funds, provided, however, that prior to the dates on which contribution rates may be changed under this Agreement, the existing contribution rates shall be paid for current participants in the New England and Industry Funds.
Furthermore, effective January 1, 1997, all employees who become eligible for pension coverage shall be placed in the pension fund appropriate to their classification.
It is also the parties' intention to treat the Shrewsbury store as a Stop & Shop store and to treat the employees in that store in the same manner as Stop & Shop employees newly eligible for coverage in the New England or Industry Funds, and effective February 9,1997 the 401(k) Plan applicable to those employees shall be frozen.
