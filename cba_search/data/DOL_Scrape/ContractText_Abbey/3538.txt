The employer and the Union determined that it was in the best interests of the employees to reduce their wages in order to allow Union members to participate in the LIUNA Pension Fund. The parties agree that the amount, which would otherwise be paid in salary or wages will be contributed instead to the Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund as pre-tax employer contributions. The Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund is a supplemental pension fund authorized by Minnesota Statutes, Section 356.24 subdivision l(8)(2001). This pension is funded 100% by Local #363 members that work for the MPRB. In 2014 those members will be required to contribute $1.07 per hour of their pay to the pension, in 2015 they will be required to contribute $ 1.18 per hour of their pay to the pension, and in 2016 they will be required to contribute $1.30 per hour of their pay to the pension. Employee wage reductions are the sole source of contribution to the Laborers International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund.”
The Employer agrees to implement mandatory pension increases as required by Laborer’s National Industrial Pension Fund. Any mandatory pension increases will be made in lieu of, not in addition to, the equivalent amount of wages that would otherwise have been paid to the member.

MPRB and City Employees Local #363
January 1,2014 through December 31, 2016
unable to agree upon an arbitrator within said seven (7) calendar day period, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation Services to submit a panel of seven (7) arbitrators. Both the Board and the Union shall have the right to alternately strike two (2) names from the panel.

The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provision of the Agreement. The Arbitrator shall be limited to only the specific written grievance submitted by the Board and the Union, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any issue not so submitted. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing within ten (10) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is the later, unless the parties agree to an extension thereof.

The filing of a grievance based on the same issue or subject matter shall act as a bar for any action based on the same grievance brought in any court or administrative body pursuant to federal or state law, or Minneapolis City Charter provision.

No employee shall use, possess, sell or transfer drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment, except pursuant to a legitimate medical reason, as determined by the Medical Review Officer, or when approved by the Employer as a proper law enforcement activity.
C.	No employee, while on duty, shall engage or attempt to engage or conspire to engage in conduct which would violate any law or ordinance concerning drugs or alcohol, regardless of whether a criminal conviction results from the conduct.

4.	CIRCUMSTANCES FOR DRUG OR ALCOHOL TESTING
A.	Reasonable Suspicion Testing. The Employer may, but does not have a legal duty to, request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the Employer or any supervisor of the employee has a reasonable suspicion (a belief based on specific facts and rational inferences drawn from those facts) related to the performance of the job that the employee:
1.	Is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment; or
2.	Has used, possessed, sold, purchased or transferred drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia while the employee was working or while the employee was on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment; or
3.	Has sustained a personal injury as that term is defined in Minnesota Statutes §176.011, Subd. 16, or has caused another person to die or sustain a personal injury; or
4.	Was operating or helping to operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-related accident resulting in property damage or personal injury and the Employer or investigating supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the cause of the accident may be related to the use of drugs or alcohol.
Whenever it is possible and practical to do so, more than one Agent of the Employer shall be involved in reasonable suspicion determinations under this LOA.
B.	Treatment Program Testing - The employer may request or require an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing if the employee is referred for chemical dependency treatment by reason of having a positive test result under this LOA or is participating in a chemical dependency treatment program under an employee benefit plan. In such case, the employee may be required to submit to drug or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following notification that he/she will be subjected to Treatment Program Testing,
C.	Unannounced Testing by Agreement. The employer may request or require an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing without prior notice on terms and conditions established by a written “last-chance” agreement between the Employer and employee’s collective bargaining representative.

D.	Testing Pursuant to Federal Law. The employer may request or require an employee to submit to testing as may be necessary to comply with federal law and regulations. It is the intent of this LOA that federal law preempts both state drug and alcohol testing laws and Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board policies and agreements. If this LOA conflicts with federal law or regulations, federal law and regulations shall prevail. If there are conflicts between federal regulations and this LOA, attributed in part to revisions to the law or changes in interpretations, and when those changes have not been updated or accurately reflected in this policy, the federal law shall prevail.
5.	REFUSAL TO UNDERGO TESTING
A.	Right to Refuse - Employees have the right to refuse to undergo drug and alcohol
testing. If an employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing requested or required by the Employer, no such test shall be given.
B.	Consequences of Refusal - If any employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing requested or required by the Employer, the Employer may subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge from employment.
C.	Refusal on Religious Grounds - No employee who refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing of a blood sample upon religious grounds shall be deemed to have refused unless the employee also refuses to undergo alternative drug or alcohol testing methods.
D.	Failure to Provide a Valid Sample with a Certified Result - Includes but is not limited to: 1) failing to provide a valid sample that can be used to detect the presence of drugs and alcohol or their metabolites; 2) providing false information in connection with a test; 3) attempting to falsify test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution; 4) failing to provide a specimen without a legitimate medical explanation; and 5) demonstrating behavior which is obstructive, uncooperative, or verbally offensive, and which results in the inability to conduct the test.
6.	PROCEDURE FOR TESTING
A.	Notification Form - Before requesting an employee to undergo drug or alcohol testing, the Employer shall provide the individual with a form on which to (1) acknowledge that the individual has seen a copy of the Employer's Drug and Alcohol Testing LOA, and (2) indicate consent to undergo the drug and alcohol testing.
B.	Collecting the Test Sample - The test sample shall be obtained in a private setting, and the procedures for taking the sample shall ensure privacy to employees to the extent practicable, consistent with preventing tampering with the sample. All test samples shall be obtained by or under the direct supervision of a health care professional.
C.	Testing the Sample. The handling and testing of the sample shall be conducted in the manner specified in Minn. Stat. §181.953 by a testing laboratory which meets, and uses methods of analysis which meet, the criteria specified in subdivisions. 1, 3, and 5 of that statute.
D.	Thresholds. The threshold of a sample to constitute a positive result alcohol, drugs, or their metabolites is contained in the standards of one of the programs listed in MN Statute §181.953, subd 1. The employer shall, not less than annually, provide the unions with a list or access to a list of substances tested for under this LOA and the threshold limits for each substance. In
25
MPRB and City Employees Local #363

addition, the employer shall notify the unions of any changes to the substances being tested for and of any changes to the thresholds at least thirty (30) days prior to implementation.
E.	Positive Test Results - In the event an employee tests positive for drug use, the employee will be provided, in writing, notice of his/her right to explain the test results. The employee may indicate any relevant circumstance, including over the counter or prescription medication taken within the last thirty (30) days, or any other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result.
7.	RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES
Within three (3) working days after receipt of the test result report from the Medical Review Officer, the Employer shall inform in writing an employee who has undergone drug or alcohol testing of:
A.	A negative test result on an initial screening test or of a negative or positive test result on a confirmatory test;
B.	The right to request and receive from the Employer a copy of the test result report;
C.	The right to request within five (5) working days after notice of a positive test result a confirmatory retest of the original sample at the employee's expense at the original testing laboratory or another licensed testing laboratory;
D.	The right to submit information to the Employer’s Medical Review Officer within three (3) working days after notice of a positive test result to explain that result; indicate any over the counter or prescription medications that the employee is currently taking or has recently taken and any other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result;
E.	The right of an employee for whom a positive test result on a confirmatory test was the first such result for the employee on a drug or alcohol test requested by the Employer not to be discharged unless the employee has been determined by a Minnesota Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC) or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency to be chemically dependent and the Employer has first given the employee an opportunity to participate in, at the employee's own expense or pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the Employer after consultation with a Minnesota LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency, and the employee has either refused to participate in the counseling or rehabilitation program or has failed to successfully complete the program, as evidenced by withdrawal from the program before its completion;
F.	The right to not be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation on the basis of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test;

H.	The right to not be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or required to be rehabilitated on the basis of medical history information revealed to the Employer concerning the reliability of,
26
MPRB and City Employees Local #363
January I, 2014 through December 31, 2016
or explanation for, a positive test result unless the employee was under an affirmative duty to provide the information before, upon, or after hire;
I.	The right to review all information relating to positive test result reports and other information acquired in the drug and alcohol testing process, and conclusions drawn from and actions taken based on the reports or acquired information;
J.	The right to suffer no adverse personnel action if a properly requested confirmatory retest does not confirm the result of an original confirmatory test using the same drug or alcohol threshold detection levels as used in the original confirmatory test.
K.	The right to suffer no adverse personnel action based solely on the fact that the employee is requested to submit to a test.
8.	ACTION AFTER TEST
The Employer will not discharge, discipline, discriminate against, or request or require rehabilitation of an employee solely on the basis of requesting that an employee submit to a test or the existence of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test.
A.	Positive Test Result. Where there has been a positive test result in a confirmatory test and in any confirmatory retest (if the employee requested one), the Employer will do the following unless the employee has furnished a legitimate medical reason for the positive test result:
1.	First Offense - The employee will be referred for an evaluation by an LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency. If that evaluation determines that the employee has a chemical dependency or abuse problem, the Employer will give the employee an opportunity to participate in, at the employee's own expense or pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the Employer after consultation with an LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency. If the employee either refuses to participate in the counseling or rehabilitation program or fails to successfully complete the program, as evidenced by withdrawal or discharge from the program before its completion, the Employer may impose discipline, up to and including discharge.
2.	Second Offense - Where an employee tests positive, and the employee has previously participated in one program of treatment required by the Employer, the Employer may discharge the employee from employment.
B.	Suspensions and Transfers.
1.	Pending Test Results From an Initial Screening Test or Confirmatory Test. While awaiting the results from the Medical Review Officer, the employee shall be allowed to return to work unless the Employer reasonably believes that restrictions on the employee’s work status are necessary to protect the health or safety of the employee, other Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board employees, or the public, and the conduct upon which the employee became subject to drug and alcohol testing would, independent of the of the results of the test, be grounds for discipline. In such circumstances, the employer may temporarily suspend the tested employee with pay, place the employee on
27
MPRB and City Employees Local #363
January 1,2014 through December 31, 2016
paid investigatory leave or transfer the employee to another position at the same rate of pay-
2.	Pending Results of Confirmatory Retest. Confirmatory retests of the original sample are at the employee’s own expense. When an employee requests that a confirmatory retest be conducted, the employer may place the employee on unpaid leave, place the employee on paid investigatory leave or transfer the employee to another position at the same rate of pay provided the Employer reasonably believes that restrictions on the employee’s work, status are necessary to protect the health or safety of the employee, other Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board employees, or the public. An employee placed on unpaid leave may use his/her accrued and unused vacation or compensatory time during the time of leave. An employee who has been placed on unpaid leave must be made whole if the outcome of the confirmatory retest is negative.
3.	Rights of Employee in Event of Work Restrictions. In situations where the employee is not allowed to remain at work until the end of his/her normal work day pursuant to this paragraph B, the Employer may not prevent the employee from removing his/her personal property, including but not limited to the employee’s vehicle, from the Employer’s premises. If the employer reasonably believes that upon early dismissal from work under this paragraph the employee is about to commit a criminal offense by operating a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, the Employer may advise the employee that 911 will be called if the employee attempts to drive or call 911 before dismissing the employee from work so that a law enforcement officer may determine whether the employee is able to operate a motor vehicle legally. This LOA is not applicable with regard to any such determination by a law enforcement officer.
C.	Other Misconduct - Nothing in this LOA limits the right of the Employer to discipline or discharge an employee on grounds other than a positive test result in a confirmatory test, subject to the requirements of law, the rules of the Civil Service Commission, and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement. For example, if evidence other than a positive test result indicates that an employee engaged in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the Employer's workplace, the employee may receive a warning, a written reprimand, a suspension without pay, a demotion, or a discharge from employment, depending upon the circumstances, and subject to the above requirements.
D.	Other Consequences - Other actions may be taken pursuant to Civil Service Rules, collective bargaining agreements or laws.
E.	Treatment Program Testing - The Employer may request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the employee has been referred by the employer for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation or is participating in a chemical dependency treatment program under an employee benefit plan, in which case the employee may be requested or required to undergo drug or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following completion of any prescribed chemical dependency treatment program.

I acknowledge that I have seen and read the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board Drug and Alcohol Testing LOA. I hereby consent to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing pursuant to said LOA, and I authorize the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board through its agents and employees to collect a sample from me for those purposes.
