SECTION 2:	Dues Deduction
2/2/1 Upon receipt of a voluntary written individual order from any of its employees covered by this Agreement on forms presently being provided by the Union, the Employer will deduct from the pay due such employee those dues required as the employee’s membership in the Union. A list of all employees from whose pay dues have been deducted shall be sent to the appropriate local with that local’s dues deduction check. At the same time, a copy of said list of employees shall also be sent to Council 24.
2/2/2 Such orders shall be effective only as to membership dues becoming due after the date of delivery of such authorization to the payroll office of the employing unit. New individual orders will be submitted on or before the 25th day of any month for deduction the following pay period. Such deductions shall be made from the employee’s pay for the first pay period of each month, except that where the payroll of the department is processed by the centralized payroll of the Department of Administration, such deductions shall be evenly divided between the A and B pay periods. Deductions shall be made only when the employee has sufficient earnings to cover same after deductions for social security, federal taxes, state taxes, retirement, health
36
insurance, income continuation insurance, and life insurance. Deductions shall be in such amount as shall be certified to the Employer in writing by the authorized representative of the local Union.

When an employee represented by the WSEU who has a WSEU membership card on file moves to a position which may not legally be represented by the WSEU, the dues deducted on behalf of the WSEU shall cease. Subsequent to the employee movement, dues deductions will be paid to the local Union having jurisdiction over the geographic assignment of the employee. New authorization cards must be submitted as indicated above by employees returning after a leave of absence without pay in excess of twelve (12) months. The Employer will remit all such deductions to the appropriate local Union within ten (10) days after the payday covering the pay period of deduction.
2/2/4 Such orders may be terminated in accordance with the terms of the order the employee has on file with the Employer. However, under no circumstances shall an employee be subject to the deduction of membership dues without the opportunity to terminate his/her order at the end of any year of its life or earlier by the employee giving at least thirty (30) but not more than one hundred twenty (120) days written notice to the Employer and local Union.
2/2/5 In those units that have a fair share or maintenance of membership agreement, the Employer agrees to deduct the amount of dues or proportionate share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration measured by the amount of dues uniformly required of all members, as certified by the Union from the earnings of the employees in the units. The amount so deducted shall be paid to the Union.

2/13/4 The Union shall be allowed to prepay the retirement contributions for employees (at differing rates for employees in general or protective occupations) who are on leaves of absence without pay for contract negotiations.

ARTICLE IV
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
SECTION 1:	Definition
4/1/1 A grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint involving an alleged violation of a specific provision of this Agreement.
4/1/2 Only one (1) subject matter shall be covered in any one (1) grievance. A grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance by indicating the issue involved, the relief sought, the date the incident or violation took place, and the specific section or sections of the Agreement involved. The grievance shall be presented to the designated supervisor involved in quadruplicate (on mutually agreed upon forms furnished by the Employer to the Union and any prospective grievant) and signed and dated by the employee(s) and the Local Union representative. A grievant shall not represent him or herself. Only a designated grievance representative pursuant to Article IV, Section 6 of this agreement may represent a grievant.
4/1/3 If an employee brings any grievance to the Employer’s attention without first having notified the Union, the Employer representative to whom such grievance is brought shall immediately notify the designated Local Union representative and no further discussion shall be had on the matter until the appropriate Local Union representative has been given notice and an opportunity to be present.
4/1/4 All grievances must be presented promptly and no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.
4/1/5 The parties will make a good faith effort to handle filed grievances, discipline and investigations in a confidential manner. The Employer and the Union agree to not release any open or closed grievance or arbitration file(s) to another organization or person not representing the Union or the Employer unless both parties mutually consent or the release is required by the WERC or a court of law. A breach of confidentiality will not affect the merits of the grievance, discipline or investigation.
52
4/1/6 (AS) Representatives of the Union and Management shall be treated as equals and in a courteous and professional manner.
SECTION 2:	Grievance Steps
4/2/1 Pre-Filing: When an employee(s) and his/her Local Union representative become aware of circumstances, other than disciplinary actions, that may result in the filing of a Step One grievance, it is the intent of the parties that, prior to filing a grievance, the Local Union representative will contact the immediate supervisor of the employee to identify and discuss the matter in a mutual attempt to resolve it. The parties are encouraged to make this contact by telephone. The State’s DAIN line facilities will be used whenever possible. Both parties will provide any and all documents available, if requested, at the pre-filing step. If the grievance is denied, the grievance response will include an explanation of the reason for denial.
4/2/2 If the designated agency representative determines that a contact with the immediate supervisor has not been made, the agency representative will notify the Local Union and may hold the grievance in abeyance for not more than fourteen (14) days, for an attempt at such contact to be madeuntil such contact is made.
4/2/3 The Employer representative at any step of the grievance procedure is the person responsible for that step of the procedure. However, the Employer may find it necessary to have an additional Employer representative present. The Union shall also be allowed to have one additional Local Union representative present in non-pay status. Only one (1) person from each side shall be designated as the spokesperson. By mutual agreement, additional Employer and/or Union observers may be present.
4/2/4 All original grievances must be filed in writing at Step One or Two, as appropriate, promptly and not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.
4/2/5 Step One: Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance or within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date of the supervisor contact provided for in 4/2/1, whichever is later, the designated agency representative will schedule a hearing with the employee and Local Union representative and respond to the Step One grievance. By mutual agreement of the parties, the parties are encouraged to hold grievance hearings by telephone or video conferencing. The State’s DAIN line facilities will be used whenever possible. If the grievance is denied, the grievance response will include an explanation of the reason for denial.
53
4/2/6 Step Two: If dissatisfied with the Employer’s answer in Step One, to be considered further, the grievance must be appealed to the appointing authority or the designee (i.e., Division Administrator, Bureau Director, or personnel office) within fourteen (14) calendar days from receipt of the answer in Step One. Upon receipt of the grievance in Step Two, the department will provide copies of Step One and Step Two to the Bureau of Collective BargainingLabor Relations of the Departmentoffice of State Employment Relations as soon as possible. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance, the designated agency representative(s) will schedule a hearing with the employee(s) and his/her designated Local Union representative(s) and a representative of Council 24 (as Council 24 may elect) and respond to the Step Two grievance, unless the time limits are mutually waived. The Employer and the Union agree to hear Step Two grievances on a regular schedule, where possible, at the work site or mutually agreed upon locations. By mutual agreement of the parties, the parties are encouraged to hold grievance hearings by telephone or video conferencing. The State’s DAIN line facilities will be used whenever possible. If the grievance is denied, the grievance response will include an explanation of the reason for denial. If the Employer has not responded to the grievance within sixty (60) days of the filing at Step Two, the Union may, prior to Step Three, refer the grievance to Council 24 and the Office of State Employment Relations to expedite an answer to the grievance.
4/2/7 Step Three: Grievances which have not been settled under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to arbitration by either party within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the agency’s answer in Step Two, or from the date on which the agency’s answer was due, whichever is earlier, except grievances involving discharge, which must be appealed within fifteen (15) calendar days from the agency’s answer in Step Two, or from the date on which the agency’s answer was due, whichever is earlier, or the grievance will be considered ineligible for appeal to arbitration. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to arbitration, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Second Step answers without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated in the Second Step shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the arbitrator, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing.
Time Limits
4/2/8 Grievances not appealed within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure will be considered as having been adjudicated on the basis of the last preceding Employer answer. Grievances not answered by the Employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within the designated time limits of the appropriate step of the procedure. The parties may, however, mutually agree in writing to extend the time limits in any step of the grievance procedure.
54
4/2/9 If the Employer representative with whom a grievance appeal must be filed is located in a city other than that in which the grievance was processed in the preceding step, the mailing of the grievance appeal form shall constitute a timely appeal if it is postmarked within the appeal period. Likewise, when an Employer answer must be forwarded to a city other than that in which the Employer representative works, the mailing of the answer shall constitute a timely response if it is postmarked within the answer period. The Employer will make a good faith effort to insure confidentiality.
4/2/10 Arbitrations for discharge cases will be heard within one (1) year from the date of appeal to arbitration.
SECTION 3:	Arbitration Panel Procedures
4/3/1 Within seven (7) calendar days from the date of appeal to arbitration, the parties shall meet to select an arbitrator from the panel of arbitrators according to the selection procedures agreed upon.
4/3/2 Where two or more grievances are appealed to arbitration, an effort will be made by the parties to agree upon the grievances to be heard by any one (1) arbitrator. On the grievances where agreement is not reached, a separate arbitrator from the panel shall be appointed for each grievance. Where the grievance is denied by the arbitrator, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the costs of a court reporter, if one was requested by either party for the hearing, will be borne by the Union. Where the grievance is upheld by the arbitrator, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the costs of a court reporter, if one was requested by either party for the hearing, will be borne by the Employer. Where the grievance is upheld in part and denied in part by the arbitrator, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the costs of the court reporter, if one was requested by either party for the hearing, will be shared equally by the parties. Except as provided in Section 11 of this Article, each of the parties shall bear the cost of their own witnesses, including any lost wages that may be incurred. On grievances where the arbitrability of the subject matter is an issue, a separate arbitrator shall be appointed to determine the question of arbitrability unless the parties agree otherwise. Where the question of arbitrability is not an issue, the arbitrator shall only have authority to determine compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award which in effect would grant the Union or the Employer any matters which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
4/3/3 Both parties agree that there will be a panel of twelve (12) arbitrators selected to hear arbitration cases that are covered under the Agreement between the parties.
55
The procedure for selecting this panel of twelve (12) arbitrators is as follows:
A.	Both parties will make an attempt to mutually agree on a panel of twelve (12) arbitrators.
B.	If mutual agreement cannot be reached on the total twelve (12) arbitrators then the remaining number of arbitrators needed to complete the panel will be selected equally between the two parties.
C.	After one (1) year from the date the panel was selected, either party shall have the right to eliminate up to two (2) arbitrators from the panel.
D.	In replacing the arbitrators that were eliminated from the panel the procedure	in B above shall
again be used, but, it is noted that any arbitrator eliminated in C above may not be placed back	on the panel.
4/3/4 The procedure for selecting an arbitrator from the panel to hear a particular case is as follows:
A.	Each arbitrator shall be assigned a number one (1) through twelve (12).
B.	In selecting an arbitrator for a case the parties shall draw five (5) arbitrator numbers at random
from the total twelve (12). Then the elimination process will be used to select one (1) arbitrator from the group of five (5).
C.	If both parties mutually disagree with the arbitrator number that has been selected in B above, then the original process of selecting an arbitrator shown in B above will again be used.
D.	If, after two attempts, the parties mutually disagree with the arbitrator number that has been selected, then both parties shall jointly request a panel of arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
E.	Both parties shall jointly send letters to the twelve (12) arbitrators selected and request these arbitrators to agree to participate on the panel and comply with specific requirements.
F.	Both parties agree to some type of retainer fee for each of the selected arbitrators in addition to a set daily fee allowed each arbitrator for his/her services.
56
4/3/5 Both parties shall jointly contact court reporters from around the state and develop a listing of these reporters who will agree to return the transcript of a hearing within ten (10) days from the date of the hearing.
4/3/6 Both parties agree to submit exhibits to each other that will be entered into evidence at the arbitration at least three (3) work days prior to the date of arbitration. Exhibits postmarked at least three (3) work days prior to the arbitration will satisfy the requirement.
4/3/7 The names of the witnesses that will be called to testify shall be shared with the other party three (3) work days prior to the hearing.
4/3/8 Disputes which arise under 4/3/6 or 4/3/7 will be resolved by DOSER and Council 24.
4/3/9 If briefs are to be filed, both parties shall file their briefs within fourteen (14) days from the date of their receipt of the transcript. This time limit may be extended if mutually agreed by the two parties.
4/3/10 The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on both parties of this Agreement. When the arbitrator declares a bench decision, this decision shall be rendered within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the arbitration hearing. On discharge and 230.36 hazardous duty cases, the decision of the arbitrator shall be rendered within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the briefs of the parties or the transcript in the event briefs are not filed. On all other cases, the decision of the arbitrator shall be rendered within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the briefs of the parties or the transcript in the event briefs are not filed.
SECTION 4:	Retroactivity
4/4/1 Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, where it is determined that the award should be applied retroactively, except for administrative errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step One. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment (not including those who retire) will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. When a discharged employee resigns for the purpose of withdrawing funds from the State’s retirement system, his/her grievance of the discharge will not be considered as withdrawn.
57
SECTION 5:	Exclusive Procedure
4/5/1 The grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of this Agreement.
SECTION 6:	Number of Representatives and Jurisdictions
4/6/1 (BC, SPS, T, LE) Council 24 shall designate a total of up to 750 grievance representatives who are members of the bargaining units for the bargaining units.
4/6/2 (AS) Council 24 shall designate a total of up to 500 grievance representatives who are members of the bargaining unit for the bargaining unit.
4/6/2A (PSS) Council 24 shall designate a total of up to 115 grievance representatives who are members of the bargaining unit for the bargaining unit.
4/6/3 The Union shall designate the jurisdictional area for each grievance representative and his/her alternate. Each jurisdictional area shall have a similar number of employees and shall be limited to a reasonable area to minimize the loss of work time and travel giving consideration for the geographic area, employing unit, work unit, shift schedule and the right and responsibility of the WSEU to represent the employee of the bargaining unit. Jurisdictional areas shall include other employing units and/or departments where the number of employees in such units or departments are too minimal to warrant designation of a grievance representative.
4/6/4 (BC, T, PSS, LE) Each local Union or each chapter of a statewide local Union (for PSS and Department of Transportation SPS only) may appoint one chief steward whom the designated grievance representative of the local or chapter may consult with by telephone pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (Telephone Use) in the event the grievance representative needs advice in interpreting the Agreement or in handling a grievance.
4/6/4A (AS) Each local Union may appoint chief stewards, and shall furnish to the Employer, in writing, the name of the Chief Steward for each respective jurisdictional area. The grievance representative of the local may consult with his/her appropriate jurisdictional area Chief Steward by telephone pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (Telephone Use) in the event the grievance representative needs advice in interpreting the Agreement or in handling a grievance.
58
4/6/5 In those instances where there is not a designated grievance representative from an employee’s bargaining unit available in the same building, a designated grievance representative from another WSEU represented bargaining unit or local Union within the same building shall be allowed, pursuant to Paragraph 4/8/1, to cross bargaining unit or local Union lines so as to provide grievance representation. Such substitute grievance representative shall obtain approval from his/her supervisor prior to providing such substitute representation.
4/6/6 (BC, SPS, T, PSS, LE) The Union shall furnish to the Employer in writing the names of the grievance representatives, and their respective jurisdictional areas within thirty (30) calendar days after the effective date of this Agreement. Any changes thereto shall be forwarded to the Employer by the Union as soon as the changes are made.
4/6/7 (AS) The Union shall furnish to the Employer in writing the names of the grievance representatives, and their respective jurisdictional areas as soon as they are designated and determined but not later than 180 calendar days after the effective date of this Agreement. Any changes thereto shall be forwarded to the Employer by the Union as soon as the changes are made.
4/6/8 The Employer will supply the local Union with a list of supervisors to contact on grievance matters.
SECTION 7:	Union Grievances
4/7/1 Union officers and stewards who are members of the bargaining unit shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of this Agreement has been violated or when the Employer interpretation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement leads to a controversy with the Union over application of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.
SECTION 8:	Processing Grievances
4/8/1 A. The grievant, including a Union official in a Union grievance, will be permitted a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay to process a grievance from pre-filing through Step Three (including consultation with designated representatives prior to filing a grievance) during his/her regularly scheduled hours of
59
employment. The employee’s supervisor will arrange a meeting to take place as soon as possible for the employee with his/her Union representative through the Union representative’s supervisor.
4/8/1 B. For purposes of training, first time new local union stewards will be permitted a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay to accompany a senior steward during the investigation and processing of one grievance (from pre-filing through step 2), one investigatory interview and one pre-disciplinary (Loudermill) meeting. Prior approval from the new steward’s supervisor is required to exercise these provisions.
Management will base participation decisions on the proximity of the stewards, work schedules, and staffing levels. The Employer may grant additional steward training as identified in this provision. Current practices will continue.
4/8/2 Designated grievance representatives will also be permitted a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay to investigate and process grievances from pre-filing through Step Three (including consultations) in their jurisdictional areas during their regularly scheduled hours of employment. Only one designated grievance representative will be permitted to process any one grievance without loss of pay as above. Further, in a group grievance, only one grievant, appearing without loss of pay, shall be the spokesperson for the group. (Group grievances are defined as, and limited to, those grievances which cover more than one employee, and which involve like circumstances and facts for the grievants involved.) Group grievances must be so designated at the first step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance.
4/8/3 The grievance meeting as provided in the Pre-Filing Step and Steps One and Two above shall be held during the grievant’s regularly scheduled hours of employment unless mutually agreed otherwise. The Employer shall designate the time and location for pre-filing, first and second step grievance hearings. The grievant’s attendance at said hearings, including reasonable travel time to and from the hearing, shall be in pay status. The parties will provide all documents and information available if requested, at the prefiling step, step 1, step 2 or when appropriate.
4/8/4 The designated grievance representative shall be in pay status for said hearing and for reasonable travel time to and from said hearing, provided that the hearing occurs during his/her regularly scheduled hours of work. If the grievant and/or the designated representative has a personally assigned vehicle, he/she may use that vehicle, without charge, to attend such grievance meetings, except that in the State Patrol, a designated grievance representative may only use his/her vehicle to attend a grievance hearing if the hearing occurs during his/her regularly scheduled hours of work. If there is a state fleet vehicle available, at the sole discretion of the
60
Employer, the designated grievance representative may use the vehicle, without charge, to attend such grievance meetings. However, the decision of the Employer is not subject to the grievance procedure.
4/8/4 A. (BC, AS, SPS, T, LE) The Pre-Filing Step and Step One of the grievance procedure will be held on the grievant’s and the grievant’s representative’s work time if the work time is on the same or overlapping shift. It is understood that the grievance time limits may have to be extended to accommodate this provision and that work schedules need not be changed.
4/8/4 B. In cases where a steward is not available on an employee’s shift to represent an employee in a hearing, the Employer will arrange for a steward from another shift. In scheduling the hearings, the Employer shall give consideration to minimizing the time between the hearing and the steward’s shift. By mutual agreement, the steward’s schedule may be adjusted to allow the steward to be in pay status during the hearing.
4/8/5 The Employer is not responsible for any compensation of employees for time spent processing grievances outside their regularly scheduled hours of employment. The Employer is not responsible for any travel or subsistence expenses incurred by grievants or Union representatives in the processing of grievances.
4/8/6 (BC, AS) The Employer and the Union may mutually agree to the need for an interpreter in discipline hearings and the Pre-Filing Step and Steps One and Two of the grievance procedure. The interpreter shall be used to assist persons who are hearing impaired or who do not speak English to understand the proceedings. The person selected as the interpreter will be mutually agreed to, and the Union and the Employer shall share the costs equally.
4/8/7 The Employer will send one (1) copy of the answered grievance at Step One to the District Council 24 area representative.
4/8/8 Information Requests
Both parties have the responsibility to share information when available. When requested by Council 24, information, materials, or photo copies pertinent to representation in the grievance procedure will be provided at no cost to the Union, prior to the 2nd step of the grievance process.
Any requests where costs exceed $50.00 (fifty dollars), if questioned by the agency, must be approved by the Director of Council 24, and DOSER.
61
SECTION 9:	Discipline
4/9/1 The parties recognize the authority of the Employer to suspend, demote, discharge or take other appropriate corrective disciplinary action against employees for just cause. An employee who alleges that such action was not based on just cause may appeal a demotion, suspension or discharge taken by the Employer beginning with the Second Step of the grievance procedure. A grievance in response to a written reprimand shall begin at the step of the grievance procedure that is appropriate to the level of authority of the person signing the written reprimand, unless the parties mutually agree to waive to the next step. Any letter issued by the department to an employee will not be considered a written reprimand unless a work rule violation is alleged or it is specifically identified as a letter of reprimand.
4/9/2 A. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a designated grievance representative at an investigatory interview (including informal counseling) if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe or has been informed that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her.
4/9/2 B. When an employee reasonably believes a meeting or informal counseling with his/her supervisor will result in disciplinary action, the employee has the right to consult with a union representative when the employee requests one. If a supervisor tells an employee that the interview or counseling will not result in discipline, there is no reasonable basis to believe the meeting will result in discipline, the employee must answer questions or may be subject to discipline for insubordination. If a supervisor denies an employee union representation and informs the employee that he/she will not be disciplined as a result of the meeting or counseling and then the supervisor does discipline the employee as a result of the meeting or counseling, the Office of State Employment Relations will not support the agency’s disciplinary actions.
4/9/3 Unless Union representation is present during informal counseling or performance evaluation, disciplinary action cannot be taken at such counseling or performance evaluation meetings. The occurrence of an informal counseling or performance evaluation meeting shall not be used as the basis for or as evidence in any subsequent disciplinary action. Such a meeting can be used to establish that an employee had been made aware of the circumstances which resulted in performance evaluation or informal counseling.
4/9/4 If any discipline is taken against an employee, both the employee and local Union president, or his/her designee, will receive copies of this disciplinary action. If the supervisor and the employee meet to explain or discuss the discipline, a Union representative shall be present, if requested.

4/12/1 In the interest of achieving more efficient handling of routine grievances, including grievances concerning minor discipline, the parties agree to the following special arbitration procedures. These procedures are intended to replace the procedure in Subsection 4/3/1-7 for the resolution of non-precedential grievances as set forth below. If either of the parties believes that a particular case is precedential in nature and therefore not properly handled through these special procedures, that case will be processed through the full arbitration procedure in subsection 4/3/1-7.

head or his or her designee(s). Placement on the program must not be arbitrary and capricious. At the time an employee is placed on a concentrated performance evaluation program, the Union will receive formal written notice of the action. At the request of the employee (after the employee has been made aware of the possible consequences of being put on the program), a Union representative may attend the meeting in which formal notice of performance problems will be explained to the employee. Selection of a Union representative shall not delay this scheduled meeting. Neither the notice to the employee nor the placement of the employee on such a program is grievable under this Agreement until such time as the employee receives a written notice of a disciplinary action under this program. At such time as the employee is subjected to disciplinary action, the principle of just cause must be met.
4/13/1A (AS, T) Employees will be placed on a concentrated performance evaluation program (for example, Performance Improvement Plan/PIP, Concentrated Performance Planning and Development/CPPD, Final Performance Improvement Plan/FPIP, Concentrated Performance Evaluation/CPE, etc.) only after the Employer has documented the reasons for such action and with the prior approval of the department head or his or her designee(s). Placement on the program must not be arbitrary and capricious. At the time an employee is placed on a concentrated performance evaluation program, a representative of the local Union will receive formal written notice of the action. At the request of the employee (after the employee has been made aware of the possible consequences of being put on the program), a Union representative may attend the meeting in which formal notice of performance problems will be explained to the employee. Selection of a Union representative shall not delay this scheduled meeting. Neither the notice to the employee nor the placement of the employee on such a program is grievable under this Agreement until such time as the employee receives a written notice of a disciplinary action under this program. At such time as the employee is subjected to disciplinary action, the principle of just cause must be met.

5/1/4 (BC, AS, T, PSS) Where within five (5) years of resignation or discharge an employee is rehired, his/her new seniority date will be the original date of employment adjusted to a new and later date which gives no credit for the period of separation during which he/she was not an employee of the state, except when an employee is laid off and recalled or reinstated from layoff within five (5) years thereof, he/she shall reclaim his/her original date of employment for the computation of seniority.
68
5/1/5 In the event two employees have the same seniority date, seniority of the one as against the other shall be determined by age with the older employee considered having the greater seniority.
5/1/6 (State Patrol Troopers and Inspectors Only) In the event two employees have the same seniority date, seniority of the one against the other shall be determined by first academy class ranking with the person having the higher ranking considered to have greater seniority.

Any negotiating note(s) or local agreement(s), in effect on January 1, 2003, which provides a greater benefit to the employee will supersede this provision. For seasonal employees only, all accrued compensatory time shall be used at times and in amounts most desired by the employee, unless the use of such time is unduly disruptive of the agency’s operation. New language in this provision is effective January 1, 2003.
6/4/2 (BC, AS, SPS, T, LE) Employees not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act shall have the right to take earned compensatory time for overtime. At the Employer’s discretion, the employee may be paid in cash for unused compensatory time credits. If cash is not paid the employee shall carry such time until May 1 of the following year.

However, if the Employer does not permit the employee to use accrued compensatory time by January 1, the Employer shall permit the employee to carry such credits into the first four (4) months of the next calendar year.

Upon receipt of such request management shall have seven (7) calendar days to schedule and conduct such meeting.
8/3/1A (AS) Impending Layoff. The Employer and the Union agree that a reduction in the work force (layoff), while regrettable, is sometimes necessary, and that this process can be extremely stressful for all concerned. Recent practice has shown that when Management and Union work together as a team, involving employees in the affected work areas in the process, compassionate and constructive plans are more likely to emerge. Therefore, Management will notify the Local Union and AFSCME Council 24 within seven (7) days after Management’s knowledge of impending layoff, but not less than thirty (30) days with respect to the impending reduction and will also inform the Union when the information is available, of the classes in which the layoffs are to occur and the anticipated number of positions to be eliminated.

Such reduction shall not be considered a layoff. Reduction of hours of part-time employees will be prorated, based on the percentage of their budgeted full time equivalency (FTE). See also 8/14/2.
8/4/2 If management determines, at its option, to reduce the weekly hours of some of the employees as identified above, the employee(s) who will work the reduced hours will be determined on the basis of seniority with the least senior employee(s) working the reduced hours; except, with the agreement of the Employer, a more senior employee may volunteer to work the reduced hours in lieu of a less senior employee. Volunteers shall be considered on the basis of seniority from most senior to least. Any reduction of hours imposed by Management will not be arbitrary or capricious.

Alternatively, an individual employee may authorize a designated grievance representative or an AFSCME Council 24 field representative to review the employee’s personnel file(s) on the employee’s behalf in the presence of a designated management representative. Such authorization must be in writing, must specifically identify the representative authorized to review the file(s) and must be provided to the agency or department within a reasonable time prior to the review of the file(s).

Section 15:	Contracting Out
11/15/1 When a decision is made by the Employer, pursuant to the provisions of ss. 16.705 Wis. Stats., Chapter Adm 10, Wis. Admin. Code, or any other relevant statutes relating to state contracting or as these may be amended, to contract or subcontract work normally performed by employees of the bargaining unit, the State agrees to a notification and discussion with the Union at the time of the Request for Purchase Authority (RPA) or prior to an official sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), but not less than thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation. For contracts under s. 84.01(13), Wis. Stats., the Employer will provide a biennial report of contracts in the spring prior to a new biennium. The Employer shall not contract out work normally performed by bargaining unit employees in an employing unit if it would cause the separation from state service of the bargaining unit employees within the employing unit who are in the classifications which perform the work. It is understood that this provision shall not limit the Employer’s right to contract for services which are not provided by the employing unit, services for which no positions are authorized by the legislature, or services which an agency has historically provided through contract (including, but not limited to, group home services, child-caring institutions, and services under s. 46.036, Wis. Stats.). If the employee is involuntarily transferred or reassigned as the result of contracting or subcontracting out, every reasonable effort will be made to retain the employee in the same geographic area and at the same rate of pay. When the Employer determines that an employee(s) will be involuntarily transferred, due to contracting out, a notice of this action will be given to the employee(s) and the Union, prior to implementation. Where possible, fourteen (14) days notice will be given. The Employer also will make an effort to notify the employee and Union of a permanent reassignment due to contracting out. [Sections 11/15/1, 2 and 3 do not apply to procurements of services of other items that are not contractual services or to any contracts under ss. 16.75(2)(b), 16.87 or 84.01(13), Wis. Stats., because contracts under these statutes are exceptions to Chapter Adm 10, Wis. Admin. Code.]
11/15/2 In order to provide full information to the Union, including reasons for contracting, the justification required in Chapter Adm 10, Wis. Admin. Code, or as amended, must be included, along with the required notice to the Union at the time of the Request for Purchase Authorization (RPA).
The justification in Chapter Adm 10, Wis. Admin. Code, under contracting out, requires the following information:
136
A.	A reference to the federal law or regulation or state law which requires or authorizes the procurement of the contractual services;
B.	A description of the services to be performed, a list of any items to be delivered, complete timetables, and any other specific conditions to be required of the contractor;
C.	A statement showing why the services can be performed more economically or efficiently by contract rather than by current state employees. The consideration of costs shall include, but not be limited to, cost of salaries, fringe benefits, training and unemployment compensation benefits;
D.	A statement showing why the proposed procurement is in compliance with applicable state collective bargaining Agreements and that the labor organization or organizations representing the appropriate certified collective bargaining unit or units have been notified of the proposed procurement;
E.	A statement showing why it is not possible to have the services performed by another state agency; and
F.	A statement indicating that competitive bidding will be used or why competitive bidding cannot be used and the justification for using the proposed alternative.
11/15/3 The Employer agrees to notify the Union upon issuance of the letter of intent to award a contract. Such notice shall be made to the Union within the five (5) working days, as specified in s. Adm 10.15(1), Wis. Admin. Code. Actually it is a union five day right to protest in the administrative code.

SECTION 17:	P.E.O.P.L.E. Deductions

137
11/17/2 Such orders may be terminable in accordance with the terms of the order the employee has on file with the Employer.
11/17/3 The Union shall indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Section.
SECTION 18:	Affirmative Action
11/18/1 The Union recognizes that the Employer is actively engaged in an affirmative action program, fully supports the concepts of such a program and will assist in any way possible in the meeting of the objectives of such a program in order to promote and encourage the full utilization of human resources in state service. The Employer agrees to provide Council 24 with sixty (60) copies of the “Wisconsin State Government Affirmative Action Plan Versus Performance Report” whenever said report is issued. Similar performance reports on Affirmative Action programs for the University of Wisconsin System shall also be provided to Council 24 for distribution to the local unions on the campuses. At the written request of the local Union, the appointing authority or his/her designee shall furnish a copy of the agency or department affirmative action plan, performance report, or relevant and readily available affirmative action information, the release of which is not prohibited by state or federal law, within five (5) working days, if possible, to the local Union. In those departments which have or create affirmative action committees, such information shall be a topic for discussion. In those departments which do not have or create an affirmative action committee, such information shall be a topic of Union-Management meetings.
11/18/2 In those departments which have or create affirmative action committees, the WSEU shall appoint two (2) employees of the department to each of the committees to represent all WSEU bargaining units without loss of pay.

SECTION 20:	Employing Unit Designations
11/20/1 Whenever there shall be a change in employing unit designation, the Union shall be given thirty (30) days advance notice, whenever practicable, and an opportunity to discuss and confer with the Administrator, Division of Merit Recruitment and Selection, and the head of the agency(ies) involved or their designee(s) regarding such change in employing unit(s).
SECTION 21:	Employee Assistance
11/21/1 The Employer and the Union recognize the value of counseling and assistance programs to those employees who have personal problems which interfere with the employee’s efficient and productive performance of his/her job duties and responsibilities. The Employer and the Union will, therefore, aid such employees who request assistance with such problems. The Employer and the Union will encourage the employee to seek professional assistance where necessary. Whenever possible, resources for treatment/assistance shall be made known by the Employer and/or the Union.
Where the department-appointed EAP coordinator is in the employee’s immediate chain of command, the employee may seek assistance from another coordinator outside his/her chain of command. Employees and EAP coordinators will be permitted a reasonable amount of time, without loss of pay, to confer about employee assistance referral services. The Employer agrees it will endeavor to appoint volunteer EAP resource coordinators on all shifts. If an employee feels he/she is in need of immediate employee assistance and no resource coordinator is available on his/her shift, the employee will be permitted to contact an off-duty resource coordinator by telephone for the purpose of immediate consultation and assistance.
The Employer will include information on employee assistance programs as part of its orientation program for employees. Annually, each department shall provide its employees with a listing of department employee assistance coordinators and available resources.
139
11/21/2 Where the Employer becomes aware that an employee has personal problems adversely affecting his/her work performance and/or attendance the Employer will notify the Union. The parties will attempt to resolve the problem with the employee.
11/21/3 Such notification and subsequent involvement, if any, of the parties to this Agreement will in no way detract, alter, or modify the rights and obligations of the parties recognized in other provisions of this Agreement. Employee participation in the Employee Assistance Programs will not be the basis for discipline. An employee, however, will not be immune from discipline for work rule violations while participating in such programs.
11/21/4 The Employer encourages the establishment of department-wide or employing unit Employee Assistance Advisory Committee(s). Where such committees are formed or currently exist, the Union may designate one representative to serve on such committee(s) without loss of pay.
SECTION 22:	Child Care
11/22/1 Upon request of the local Union, the Employer will make available to employees, information and material related to child care and family issues. This information will be placed in a centralized, clearly designated area.
11/22/2 The Union may appoint one member to represent all WSEU bargaining units to each existing and/or new on-site child care committee.

Topics of discussion in these committee(s) will not include topics mandated under the Master Agreement, or Chapter 111.80, Wis. Stats., but may include identifying, analyzing and recommending changes or solutions to employee/Employer concerns about the work product or the affected work area.

11/26/1 The pre-employment arrest/conviction record of a current bargaining unit employee with permanent status shall not be used by the Employer as a basis for removing the employee from his/her existing position or disallowing movement to another position unless the Employer can demonstrate that the employee falsified or withheld information or there is a substantial relationship between the arrest/conviction and the circumstances of the employee’s existing position or the position to which the employee requests to move that is detrimental to the Employer.

2.	If the non-WSEU position is allocated to a classification which is in a pay range that is not counterpart to a pay range in the applicable WSEU schedule, the RA used shall be that of the WSEU pay range having a maximum closest to but higher than the pay range maximum of the non-WSEU pay range involved; and
3.	If, under 2., above, there are no higher pay range maximums in the applicable WSEU schedule, the highest RA in that schedule shall be the RA for the pay range of the position from which the employee is moving. In addition, this RA shall also be considered the first RA between the old and new pay ranges if the demotion is more than one (1) range.
12/10/9 On involuntary demotions, demotions in lieu of layoff, or demotion after being designated at risk under 8/2/1, the employee shall continue to be compensated at their present rate of pay. If the present rate of pay exceeds the pay range maximum, the employee shall receive a TTR for one year. The first day of the pay period following the expiration of the employee’s TTR, the employee’s pay rate shall be reduced to the maximum of the pay range into which they demoted. If at expiration of the TTR period the pay range maximum exceeds the employee’s TTR, the employee’s TTR will become the employee’s present rate of pay.
An employee demoted for disciplinary purposes shall be compensated at their present rate of pay, subject to the maximum. The employee demoted for disciplinary purposes shall not be eligible for a TTR.
12/10/10 On voluntary transfer, except those in 12/10/11, the employee shall continue to be compensated at their present rate of pay.
12/10/11 On involuntary transfers, transfers in lieu of layoff, or transfers after being designated at risk under 8/2/1, the employee shall continue to be compensated at their present rate of pay. If the employee’s present rate of pay exceeds the pay range maximum, the employee shall receive a TTR for one year. The first day of the pay period following the expiration of the TTR, the employee’s pay rate shall be reduced to the maximum of the pay range. If at expiration the pay range maximum exceeds TTR, the TTR will become the present rate of pay.
176
12/10/12 On reinstatement, the employee’s base pay rate shall be the last rate received in the position from which reinstatement eligibility is derived.
When an employee who has not held permanent status in class within the last 5 years is reinstated, pay on reinstatement shall be determined as if in accordance with pay on original appointment.
12/10/13 On restoration, the employee shall receive a base pay rate equal to the last rate received plus intervening adjustments. The adjustments applied to the employee’s last rate received shall be that of the appropriate pay schedule for the classification from which restoration rights are derived.
12/10/14 On movement to a trainee position, a current employee’s base pay rate shall be determined in accordance with provisions applicable to the transaction type involved.
12/10/15 A TTR received under the provisions of Appendix 5 shall continue if the employee is subsequently covered by the provisions of this section. If an employee received a TTR in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 5, but is no longer covered by the Appendix 5 provisions on the TTR expiration date or the date the employee leaves a WSEU-represented position, the pay rate will be determined as follows:
Effective the first day of the pay period following the expiration date of the TTR, or the date of the employee leaves a WSEU-represented position, the employee’s pay shall be calculated as if the employee had been voluntarily demoted or voluntarily transferred in accordance with 12/10/9 or 12/10/10, whichever is applicable for the transaction that caused the TTR. If the date of expiration or termination is the first day of the pay period, that date will be the effective date.
The TTR shall also expire if a subsequent transaction will result in a higher pay rate. The new pay rate will be calculated as if the employee had voluntarily demoted or transferred in accordance with 12/10/9 or 12/10/10, whichever is applicable for the transaction that caused the TTR, immediately prior to the transaction.
For all demotion calculations, RAs in effect at the time of the TTR expiration, termination or subsequent transaction shall be used.
12/10/16 Any personnel transaction not covered in this section will be administered in accordance with Chapter ER 29, Wis. Adm. Code.

ARTICLE XIII
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
SECTION 1:	Health Insurance
13/1/1 The Employer agrees that the benefits offered under the Standard Plan and all compensable alternative plans shall be comparable. The parties agree that the alternative plans approved by the Group Insurance Board at its meeting on September 5, 1985, are comparable in benefit levels and shall be considered as examples of comparability.
13/1/2 The Employer agrees to pay ninety percent (90%) of the gross premium for the single or family standard health insurance plan offered to State employees by the Group Insurance Board or one hundred five percent (105%) of the gross premium of the alternative qualifying plan offered under s. 40.03(6), Wis. Stats., that is the least costly qualifying plan within the county in which the alternate plan is located, whichever is lower, but not more than the total amount of the premium.—Employer contributions for employees residing outside of Wisconsin who select the standard plan shall be based on their county of residence. Qualifying health insurance plans shall be determined in accordance with standards established by the Group Insurance Board.
13/1/3 The Employer agrees to pay fifty percent (50%) of the above listed contribution amounts for insured employees in permanent part time or project positions defined under s. 230.27, Wis. Stats., who are appointed to work for at least six hundred (600) but less than one thousand forty four (1044) hours per year.
13/1/3 Effective with premiums due for coverage beginning January 1, 2004, a three-tier health insurance model will be implemented. The employee monthly contributions toward health insurance premiums will be based on the specific tier to which their qualifying health insurance plan has been assigned for employees appointed to work one thousand and forty four (1044) hours or more per year. Employee contributions under this three-tier approach are as follows:
178
	Employee Monthly Contribution Effective January 2004 through December 2004		Employee Monthly Contribution Effective January 2005 through December 2005	
	Single	Family	Single	Family
Tier 1	$18.00	$45.00	$22.00	$55.00
Tier 2	$47.00	$117.50	$50.00	$125.00
Tier 3	$100.00	$250.00	$100.00	$250.00
Qualifying health insurance plans, and the tier to which each will be assigned, will be determined in accordance with standards established by the Group Insurance Board.
The administrative means by which the monthly premium payments are paid will be established in a manner similar to that established for premium payment by nonrepresented employees and that does not cause undue hardship on affected employees.
13/1/4 Effective with health insurance premiums due for coverage beginning January 1, 2004, provided in 13/1/3, above, the Employer agrees to pay fifty percent (50%) of the total monthly premium amount for the health plan selected for insured employees in part-time positions defined under s. 230.27, Wis. Stats., who are appointed to work for at least six hundred (600) hours but less than one thousand forty-four (1044) hours per year.

13/3/5 The Employer agrees to establish a labor-management committee for the purpose of developing the dental plan design.
SECTION 4:	Income Continuation Insurance

181
In the event the Employer has reason to believe that an employee is abusing the sick leave privilege or may not be physically fit to return to work, the Employer may require a medical certificate or other appropriate verification for absences covered by this Article. When an employee has been identified as a sick leave abuser by the Employer and required to obtain a medical doctor’s statement for sick leave use, the notice of such requirement will be given to the employee and the local Union in writing. If the medical certificate verifies that the employee was not abusing sick leave or is physically fit to report to work, the Employer shall pay the cost of the medical certificate. When an employee must obtain such medical certificate during his/her regularly scheduled hours of employment, he/she shall be allowed time off without loss of pay or sick leave credits to obtain the certificate. Employees will be permitted to use holidays, compensatory time off and/or annual leave in lieu of sick leave when they so request.
To protect employee privacy, the parties shall make a good faith effort to maintain the confidentiality of personal medical information which is received by or disclosed to the Employer in the course of administering this section.
Sick leave, unanticipated use of sick leave, and innovative positive methods or programs to reduce the use of sick leave are appropriate topics of discussion at local labor/management meetings.
13/5/2B (BC, SPS, T, PSS, LE) Review Program for Unanticipated Use of Sick Leave
In those employing units which have established a sick leave review program, or in those employing units which establish such programs at a future date, such programs will be used to address the unanticipated use of sick leave.
For purposes of these programs, unanticipated use of sick leave is defined as:
“An employee or family member who calls the employee’s place of employment per the established call-in procedure indicating he/she is not able to report to or continue to work for that day under the guidelines of Article XIII, Section 5.”
If an employee provides the Employer a medical certificate or other appropriate verification for absences covered by this article, that instance (and/or hours) shall not be considered unanticipated use of sick leave.
182
In those employing units which have a program in place for unanticipated sick leave review, and in those employing units which establish such programs, the following criteria must be included.
A.	A written policy.
B.	A thirty (30) day advance written notice to the local union(s) and to all current employees and a copy to all new employees at the time of hire.

183
13/5/5 Employees may use accrued sick leave for temporary emergency care of ill, injured, or disabled parents, stepparents, grandparents, foster parents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, foster children, brothers (and their spouses), and sisters (and their spouses) of the employee or spouse, the spouse, aunts and uncles of the employee or spouse, sons-in-law or daughters-in-law of the employee or spouse, person(s) for whom the employee is legal guardian or legal guardian(s) of the employee. Employees may use accrued sick leave for temporary emergency care of other ill, injured or disabled relatives of the employee or spouse residing in the household of the employee for a limited period of time to permit the employee to make other arrangements. Use of sick leave for the purposes of this section is limited to five (5) workdays for any one illness or injury, however, the use of sick leave may be extended to cover unusual circumstances provided prior approval is obtained from management.
13/5/6 Employees may use accrued sick leave to supplement the Worker’s Compensation benefits provided pursuant to Chapter 102, Wis.

13/5/8 The Employer agrees to credit unused sick leave accumulated prior to the effective date of this Agreement to the account of the employees covered under this Agreement.
13/5/9 The Employer agrees to continue in effect the provisions of s. 230.35(2) and 40.05(4)(b), Wis. Stats,, which provide that at the time of retirement or in the event of death, accumulated unused sick leave shall be converted at current value and credited to the employee’s account. The conversion credits once recorded shall be used on behalf of the employee or surviving spouse, child(ren), or other dependents to offset the cost of the monthly health insurance premiums as provided under the provisions of s. 40.05(4)(b), Wis. Stats.
13/5/10 The Employer agrees to provide the following supplemental health insurance conversion credits for permanent employees who retire or are permanently laid off from the service, or for the surviving insured dependents of permanent employees who die while in the service or while permanently laid off, under the following conditions:
184
A.	The credits shall be based upon an employee’s full number of years of adjusted continuous service on the date of retirement, layoff or death.
B.	The credits shall be calculated based on the employee’s sick leave balance on the date of retirement, layoff or death.
For employees who retire, are laid off or die with at least fifteen (15) full years of adjusted continuous service, the Employer shall match each one (1) hour of accumulated sick leave up to a maximum of fifty two (52) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of service through twenty four (24) years. For years of adjusted continuous service over twenty four (24) years, the Employer shall match each (1) hour of accumulated sick leave credit up to a maximum of one hundred and four (104) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of continuous service over twenty four (24) years.
For employees who have earned all of their adjusted continuous service while having protective occupation status and who retire, are laid off or die with at least fifteen (15) full years of adjusted continuous service, the Employer shall match each one (1) hour of accumulated sick leave up to a maximum of seventy eight (78) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of service through twenty four (24) years. For years of adjusted continuous service over twenty four (24) years, the Employer shall match each (1) hour of accumulated sick leave credit up to a maximum of one hundred and four (104) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of continuous service over twenty four (24) years.
Employees who have earned part of their adjusted continuous service while in protective occupation status shall have their credits prorated in accordance with these provisions:
C.	If, at the time of retirement, layoff or death, the employee has adjusted continuous service of less than twenty five (25) years, multiply the number of years as general by fifty two (52) hours. Multiply the number of years as protective by seventy eight (78) hours. Combine these totals to determine the maximum matching credits.
D.	If, at the time of retirement, layoff or death, the employee has adjusted continuous service of over twenty four (24) years, determine the proration based on the first twenty four (24) years of service and then add one hundred four (104) hours for each year of adjusted continuous service over twenty four (24) years.
185
Employees who suffer from a personal illness or injury that requires them to use at least five hundred (500) hours of accrued sick leave during the three (3) years immediately prior to retirement, layoff or death shall receive five hundred (500) hours credited to this account upon retirement, layoff or death.
Employees shall be required to provide medical documentation of such illness or injury to the Employer on forms provided by the Employer at the time the leave is taken. Employees who have suffered such an illness or injury during the three (3) years immediately preceding the effective date of this contract shall also be required to provide supporting medical documentation.
Access to these credits for payment of post retirement health insurance premiums shall occur only after all Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credits (ASLCC) have been exhausted. In the event an employee returns to a position covered by this agreement after having retired, the credits in this account shall be held in escrow until the employee again retires. The credits will then be adjusted to reflect additional years of continuous service and sick leave accrual.
At the employee’s option, these These credits shall be converted using the employee’s highest base pay rate at the time of retirement or the average of the employee’s base pay rates during the employee’s three highest earnings years while in state service.
For informational purposes, a chart portraying this benefit is found in Appendix #6.
E.	Credits granted to a permanently laid off employee, or that person’s surviving insured dependents, shall be available until the credits are exhausted, the laid off employee is re-employed, or 5 years have elapsed from the date of layoff, whichever occurs first.
F.	For the purposes of this section, a permanently laid off employee is a laid off employee who is not on a temporary, school year, seasonal or sessional layoff.
13/5/11 The employee may elect to delay conversion of his/her sick leave credits for a period of up to ten (10) years after the date of retirement provided that the employee is covered by a comparable health insurance plan or policy between the date of retirement and the time that the employee elects to convert his/her sick leave credits. Such conversion shall be based on the employee’s hourly wage rate at the time of retirement.
186
13/5/12 Separation from the service shall cancel all unused accumulated sick leave. However, when a person who is an employee with permanent status in class resigns, any unused accumulated sick leave shall be restored provided he/she is re-employed by any agency of the State within five (5) years. When a person who is an employee with permanent status in class is laid off, any unused accumulated sick leave shall be restored provided he/she is re-employed by any agency of the State within five (5) years.
13/5/13 An employee who qualifies for benefits under s. 40.65, Wis. Stats., shall be considered an eligible employee under s. 40.02(25)(b), Wis. Stats., for purposes of group health insurance coverage.
Under this Agreement, an employee who is eligible for benefits under s. 40.65 or s. 40.63, Wis. Stats., as a result of a work-related injury or disease shall be eligible to convert accumulated unused sick leave at the employee’s then current basic rate to credit for payment for health insurance premiums.
Conversion of accumulated unused sick leave credits for payment of health insurance premiums by employees who qualify for benefits under s. 40.65 or s. 40.63, Wis. Stats., shall not be treated as earnings under s. 40.02(22), Wis. Stats.

F.	Appropriate use of bereavement leave under this section will not initiate an employee being placed on a review program for unanticipated use of sick leave.
13/5/15 Employees may use one (1) day of accrued sick leave to attend the funeral of nieces, nephews, cousins, god children or god parents of the employee or spouse. Travel time to attend such funerals shall not exceed four (4) workdays.

13/165/2 Application for benefits under s. 230.36, Wis. Stats., shall be made by the employee or his/her representative to the appointing authority within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of injury on forms provided by the Employer. While medical verification is required for final approval of a claim, failure by the physician to provide verification within the fourteen (14) days shall not be the basis for denial. In extenuating circumstances, the time limit for application for benefits may be waived. The application shall contain sufficient factual information to indicate the nature and extent of the injury or illness, the circumstances surrounding its occurrence and the qualifying duties on which the application is based.
208

examinations ordered by the Employer or medical treatment ordered by the examining physician shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.

Upon return to full work status, an employee’s benefits under this section shall cease, providing his/her attending physician has released him/her from further medical treatment.

4.	The additional reimbursement rates authorized under 13/17/5 or 13/17/6 shall not apply to the use of motorcycles.
211
C.
Airplane
The Employer agrees to reimburse any employee who is authorized and required to use a private airplane in his/her work for the state at the rate of thirty two and one-half cents ($0.325) per mile.
13/176/5 An additional reimbursement at the rate of one cent ($.01) per mile shall be paid to any employee for the use of his/her personal automobile when used for any or all of the following reasons: as an emergency vehicle or under conditions which may cause excessive wear or depreciation (including pulling trailers; carrying two or more passengers; carrying tools, equipment or supplies) or which require the installation of special equipment. In addition, when an employee is authorized to use his/her vehicle on a construction project (including a pit, quarry, or to a bituminous mixing or concrete mixing site and survey work), or in woods or fields where trails, roads or portions thereof are not open to the public and not paved, the employee will be reimbursed at the rate of four cents ($.04) per mile for such actual miles driven under these conditions, in addition to the rates listed above to which the employee may be eligible. The total amount which will be reimbursed under this section shall not exceed five cents ($.05) per mile.
13/76/6 Reasonable charges for taxis and air limousines, including taxi tips at a maximum rate of 15% of the charge, are reimbursable when other modes of travel are not available or practical. Employees are required to obtain receipts where the cost of a one-way fare will exceed fifteen dollars ($15) twenty-five ($25) dollars.
13/176/7 When an assigned pool or state-owned automobile is available and the employee is given the option to utilize his/her personal automobile, the mileage allowance shall be at a rate equal to the approximate cost of operation of state cars, including depreciation.
If an employee, because of certified medical reasons, is not able to utilize a state vehicle, he/she shall be permitted to use his/her personal vehicle at the rate provided under 13/17/4. (See Negotiating Note No. 1)
13/176/8 Meals - Employees shall be reimbursed for all actual, reasonable, and necessary amounts expended for their own meals incurred in the performance of their official duties. The performance of the employee’s official duties must be at a point more than fifteen (15) miles from his/her assigned headquarters. However, exceptions to the fifteen (15) mile requirement may be granted by the agency heads or their designee(s). Employees shall be reimbursed without receipts for meals, according to the following schedule.
212
A.
As of July 1, 2001:
Breakfast -- $ 8.00 Lunch --	$ 9.00
Dinner --	$17.00
Maximum permitted amounts for individual meals in out-of-state cities, including tax and tip:
B. As of July 1, 2001:
Breakfast -- $10.00 Lunch --	$10.00
Dinner --	$20.00
13/176/9 The maximum allowable tip is fifteen percent (15%) of the meal claim. To be eligible for the noon meal reimbursement, agencies require that an employee leave his/her assigned headquarters station prior to 10:30 a.m. and return after 2:30 p.m.. For an employee whose scheduled hours of work are such that his/her workday would be completed prior to 2:30 p.m. (e.g. 5:00 a.m. to 1:45 p.m.), the above structure is inappropriate. For employees in travel status who work other than a 7:45 a.m.- 4:30 p.m. work schedule, a sliding corridor of four (4) hours will be used to determine eligibility for reimbursement for the noon meal. If an employee were to start at a time earlier than 7:45 a.m., the 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. time block would be moved back correspondingly. For example, an employee who starts at 6:45 a.m. would have to be away from his/her headquarters station from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. to be eligible for the noon meal reimbursement, provided all other requirements are met. Exceptions to the provisions in this paragraph may be made at the sole discretion of the Employer.
Those employees in the Professional Social Services bargaining unit who are working on a flextime schedule are only eligible for the noon meal reimbursement if they leave their headquarters station prior to 10:30 a.m. and return after 2:30 p.m., unless mutually agreed otherwise.
Employees, to be eligible for the breakfast reimbursement, must leave home before 6:00 a.m..
Employees, to be eligible for a dinner meal, must return home after 7:00 p.m..
213
When an employee is entitled to reimbursement for two or more consecutive meals in a day, the amount expended for any particular meal is left to the discretion of the employee, but the total reimbursement claim shall not exceed the individual meal rates for the consecutive meals in a day.
13/176/10 As of the effective date of this Agreement, employees shall be paid a flat rate of four dollars ($4.00) for each bag meal.
All of the above amounts include tax and tip.
13/176/11 Requests for reimbursement for amounts in excess of the above schedule must be accompanied by a receipt and full explanation of the reasonableness of such expense.
13/176/12 Lodging - Employees shall be reimbursed for their actual, reasonable and necessary expenses for lodging incurred in the performance of their official duties. Receipts are required for all lodging. An explanation of reasonableness is necessary where the lodging is in excess of the amount set forth below.
As of July 1, 2001 - $72.00 per night in Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha counties, plus any applicable taxes.
As of July 1, 2001 - $62.00 per night in counties other than Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha, plus any applicable taxes.
Employees on field assignment shall not be required to share a room.
13/176/13 When employees are assigned to training programs, the Employer will not require sharing of rooms for more than two (2) consecutive nights when the room is furnished with two (2) normal motel room beds (excluding hide-a-bed or rollaway) nor will there be more than two (2) employees per room. The above limitations do not apply to those employees attending training programs who are lodged at academies and/or dormitories. The Employer will attempt to accommodate an employee’s choice of the co-employee with whom he/she wishes to share a room, the non-smoking preference, and health or religious related dietary needs identified by the employee.
214
13/176/14 Parking - Reasonable and necessary parking charges incurred in the performance of an employee’s duties are reimbursable whether the employee is using his/her own personal car or an assigned car. This is based on the assumption that the employee is removed from his/her assigned headquarters.
13/176/15 Miscellaneous - Travel Expenses - While the use of credit cards is encouraged, travel expenses shall be advanced to employees upon request when estimated monthly expenses exceed fifty dollars ($50). Such advance shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the estimated expenses.
13/176/16 One personal call home per day is reimbursable up to five dollars ($5.00) each for the following conditions:
A.	Each night an employee must spend overnight away from home in travel status, or
B.	As a result of each unscheduled geographical location change, or
C.	As a result of an unscheduled change in travel status, which results in more than	a one (1) hour
extension to the employee’s originally scheduled return time.
SECTION 187: Administration of Worker’s Compensation Benefits
13/187/1 In the administration of the Worker’s Compensation Act as set forth in Chapter 102, Wis. Stats., the Employer shall make an initial determination as to whether the injury was job related; and if so, the Employer may authorize payment for temporary disability as specified in the Worker’s Compensation Act.
13/187/2 In the event the Employer makes an initial determination that an injury or disease is job related and authorizes payment for temporary total disability as specified in the Worker’s Compensation Act or until the Department of Administration makes a decision, whichever is first, the Employer shall continue to pay its share of Health Insurance premium as provided in Article XIII, Section 1 for the period of the temporary total disability.
13/187/3 In the event the Employer denies the employee’s claim of worker compensable injury or disease, and the employee’s claim is later sustained, the Employer will reimburse the employee its proportionate share of the
215
premium payment per Article XIII, Section 1, if the employee had continued paying the full cost of the Health Insurance premium payment during the period of worker’s compensation claim pendency.
13/187/4 Employees on Worker’s Compensation benefits who are unable to use earned personal holiday, compensatory time, annual leave, or legal holiday credits due to being on Worker’s Compensation benefits, and had such credits canceled at the end of the year, shall have such credits restored for use in the first six (6) months following their return to work.
SECTION 198: Standby/On Call
13/198/1 (BC, AS, SPS, T, LE) Standby When the Employer requires that an employee must be available for work and be able to report in less than one (1) hour, the employee shall be compensated on the basis of a fee of eighteen dollars ($18.00) for each on call eight (8) hour period, or portion thereof, for which the employee is in standby status. The Employer shall make a reasonable effort to notify those affected employees of their release from standby status.
13/198/2 On Call: When the Employer requires that an employee respond to contact by either a beeper, pager or cell phone while off duty, the employee shall receive one (1) hour of compensatory time credit or pay for each calendar day where such response is required. In no case shall an employee receive both standby pay and on call compensatory time during the same offwork time period.
Bargaining Note: This section is inapplicable to Social Workers in the Milwaukee Child Protections Services Program, Department of Corrections Clinical Service staff employees, and Probation and Parole Agents, who are otherwise covered under the provisions of Article VI, Section 16 and Memorandum of Understanding Nos. 17 and 18.
SECTION 2019: Hostage Leave
13/2019/1 For purposes of this section, when the Employer determines that an employee has been held against his/her will for a period of time by a person or persons and during this time the person or persons holding the employee attempts to obtain a pledge from the Employer to submit to certain terms and/or conditions prior to releasing the employee, then the employee will be considered to have been held hostage.
216
13/2019/2 An employee who alleges that he/she has suffered an injury as a result of being taken hostage, and whose injury is not covered under section 13/16/1 or 13/18/1 of this Agreement, shall receive an examination by a Doctor of Psychiatry (MD) who is authorized to provide services under one of the State of Wisconsin’s approved health insurance programs. If the diagnosis by the psychiatrist supports the employee’s claim, the employee shall be eligible for the following Employer-provided benefits:
A.	Psychiatrically-prescribed treatment and/or counseling services; and/or
B.	A leave of absence without loss of pay or benefits for a period of time not to exceed forty-five
(45)	calendar days from the date of the conclusion of the hostage event.
13/2019/3 If the psychiatrist determines that the employee is not fit to return to work within the forty-five (45) calendar days provided under subsection B above, or the employee needs continued treatment or counseling as provided under 13/20/1 above, all benefits provided under this section shall cease and the Employer shall place the employee on Worker’s Compensation as provided under Article XIII, Section 8 of this Agreement. The employee shall continue to be covered by Worker’s Compensation until the psychiatrist determines the employee is fit to return to work. When the psychiatrist determines the employee is fit to return to work, the employee shall be returned to his/her original position or one of like or similar nature, as determined by the Employer.
SECTION 210: Catastrophic Leave
13/210/1 This is a program to allow employees to voluntarily donate (transfer) annual leave, Saturday legal holiday, personal holiday and sabbatical leave time to employees who have been granted unpaid leaves of absence due to catastrophic need for which no eligible paid leave benefits or replacement income are available.

Failure of the Union to take such action shall be considered in determining whether or not the Union caused or authorized, directly, or indirectly, the strike. This clause is not subject to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement but shall be enforced by the ordinary processes of law.

ARTICLE XV
GENERAL
SECTION 1:	Obligation to Bargain
15/1/1 This Agreement represents the entire Agreement of the parties and shall supersede all previous agreements, written or verbal.

These negotiations shall take place in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, Section 2.
To begin the negotiation procedure, local management shall submit a list of the posts and types of break for each post to the local Union.
In these negotiations, the parties shall consider “Type A” (defined as a rest period for those work stations where an employee could reduce his/her activity while remaining at the station. The employee would either be expected to use his/her sound discretion in choosing an appropriate time for the reduction in his/her activity, or a set time would be established in advance and operational coverage would be increased by other employees during the break period for that particular assignment.) and “Type B” (defined as a rest period for those work stations where relief coverage could be provided within existing staffing levels.) breaks as potential solutions and shall also consider other types and kinds of solutions which may be appropriate for a particular post or institution, as may be mutually agreed to.
In the event disputes remain at the local level forty (40) days after the effective date of the Agreement, a department level meeting with representatives of the Department of Health and Family Services, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Employment Relations and Council 24 shall be held within twenty (20) days to resolve any remaining differences. In institutions where agreement is reached, they shall go in effect notwithstanding unresolved issues at other institutions.
Absent agreement, no changes in present practices shall be made at any post in any institution. Following agreement, no changes shall be made in the practice with regard to any post unless there is mutual agreement to change the practice.
Any and all agreements relating to this issue shall be signed by both parties.

The employee shall be given one hour of compensatory time and one-half hour of cash payment for each hour compensated at the premium rate.
Employees who are required to work during a calendar day in which compensatory time is scheduled will have their compensatory time credits restored and replaced by work time on an hour-for-hour basis.
Employees who earn in excess of forty (40) hours of compensatory time credits shall have the option of receiving cash payment for any compensatory time credits earned over forty (40) hours. The requests for cash payment shall be made on time and leave reporting forms and submitted to the appropriate DNR Payroll Office. The use, scheduling and cash-out of compensatory time credits earned shall be consistent with Article VI, Section 4.
The Union recognizes that employees engaged in fire control activities during high hazard periods are subject to flexible scheduling and overtime distribution shall be based on such emergency conditions. Standby will be offered to employees in the work unit who normally perform the anticipated work.
The Employer will provide a portable radio, pager or other electronic communication device for fire control heavy equipment operators and dispatchers who are on standby, unless such devices are unavailable due to repairs.
Management and the Union and the employees agree that all employees covered by this Agreement and this special agreement are not eligible for Unemployment Compensation while on compensatory time off scheduled by the employee.

SPECIAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR SELECTED CLASSES INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY BARGAINING UNIT
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES OVERTIME AND HOLIDAY COMPENSATION
A.	Conservation Wardens, Environmental Wardens, Safety Specialist Wardens and Special Investigative Wardens shall be granted overtime credits for all hours in pay status beyond eighty (80) hours in each biweekly pay period. Hours in pay status are defined as (1) hours worked during a pay period in accordance with the “Standards and Guidelines for Represented Warden Overtime” established by the Department of Natural Resources; and (2) paid leave time requested by an employee that has been pre-approved by the employee’s supervisor prior to the beginning of a pay period.
Overtime credits shall be granted in the following manner:
1.	Hours eighty-one (81) through the eighty-six (86) hours shall be credited on a straight rate, hour-for-hour basis.
2.	All hours in excess of eighty-six (86) shall be credited at the premium rate of time and one-half. All premium rate overtime credits shall be converted to straight rate equivalent credits.
3.	In each fiscal year, the first sixteen (16) hours of straight rate equivalent overtime credits shall be granted as compensatory time.
4.	In each fiscal year, the next four hundred four (404) hours of straight rate equivalent overtime credits earned shall be paid in cash on a biweekly basis. Such payments shall be eligible for payroll deduction at the employee’s request.
5.	All overtime credits earned after four hundred twenty (420) hours described in subsections A./3 and A./4, above, shall be granted in cash or compensatory time, or a combination thereof, as the Employer may elect.
232
6.	The supervisor of each Conservation Warden, Environmental Warden, Safety Specialist Warden and Special Investigative Warden will prepare a plan to allocate up to three hundred eighty (380) hours of overtime throughout the fiscal year. Forty (40) hours of overtime will remain unallocated for unanticipated needs and movement of personnel to respond to statewide enforcement priorities. This plan will be prepared with the input of the Conservation Warden, Environmental Warden, Safety Specialist Warden and Special Investigative Warden and must address both regional and statewide needs. The Chief Warden [or designee(s)] will give final approval of the plans for each Conservation Warden, Environmental Warden, Safety Specialist Warden and Special Investigative Warden. The plans will not be grievable. The chain of review for disputes on a work plan will initially be the immediate supervisor, and, if unresolved, a review by the Regional Warden will occur. If unresolved by the Regional Warden, the Chief Warden will make the final determination.
B.	Overtime hours resulting from complaints or requests which require immediate actions or investigations shall be self-ordered or scheduled according to the “Standards and Guidelines for Represented Warden Overtime” established by the Department of Natural Resources. Any complaints regarding these standards and guidelines may be appealed, in writing, to the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources, whose decision shall be final.
C.	Employees covered by these special negotiations who receive compensation for overtime credit in cash shall receive applicable sick leave credit at the time of payment, or .0625 hour for all compensatory time credit hours which are paid off in cash.
D.	Compensatory time credits earned for overtime work pursuant to subsections A./3 and A./5 above; for holiday premium work in accordance with Article XIII, Section 9, Paragraphs 13/9/5 and 13/9/6; and for work on a holiday of four (4) or more hours beyond the normally scheduled hours in accordance with Article XIII, Section 9, Paragraph 13/9/4, that is not used by December 31, shall be carried into the first four (4) months of the new calendar year. At the end of this four (4) month period, sixteen (16) hours of unused compensatory time, or the remaining balance if less than sixteen (16) hours, will be paid in cash the first pay period after May 1. An employee may request to either convert all or a portion of additional unused carried over compensatory time, in excess of the sixteen (16) hours automatically cashed out, to cash payment or continue to carry it as compensatory time. The Employer will take into consideration the employee’s wishes in making its decision. The Employer has the discretion, at any time, to cash out the unused compensatory time.
233
NON-CONTRACTUAL TRANSFER/DEMOTION
An Environmental Warden, Safety Specialist Warden, or Special Investigative Warden who submits a written request to the Chief Warden for a non-contractual transfer or voluntary demotion outside the provisions of Article VII will be considered for such transfer or voluntary demotion prior to consideration of candidates certified in accordance with Wisconsin Civil Service Statutes and Administrative Code. Decisions of the Chief Warden are final and not grievable.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
All Department Heads
The Department of Employment Relations supports and encourages the establishment of effective department Employee Assistance Programs as provided under Article XI, Section 22, of the Agreement between the State of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin State Employees Union (WSEU).
In this regard, I am encouraging agencies to seek a sufficient number of volunteer resource persons to meet the needs of state agencies. Where multi-shift operations exist, particularly in potentially high-stress areas, it is my hope that you can select, appoint, and train resource persons in sufficient numbers to have coverage on all shifts.
In exceptional cases where resource persons are not available at the work place for face-to-face consultation and they are contacted by other means about an acute situation, the resource person, in his or her judgment, may decide to volunteer his or her time to personally meet to provide resource referral services. In such instances where persons volunteer their services while not on their assigned work schedule, they should be allowed reasonable access to the workplace.
Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.
Sincerely,
234

TRAINING ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED
CENTER EMPLOYEES
During the term of this Agreement, the Employer agrees, within the limits of funds provided for this purpose, to provide assistance to permanent bargaining unit employees of the Department of Health and Family Services’ Centers for the Developmentally Disabled who have either received their notice of layoff or who voluntarily acquire other employment and, in so doing, prevent a layoff. In order for employees in the latter category (layoff prevention) to be considered eligible for assistance under this Agreement, they must meet the following eligibility requirements:
A.	They must be in a position which is included in the job classification(s) which has been identified for layoff as required under 8/3/1 of the Agreement.
B.	The employee must acquire other employment (either within or outside of state service) within the notice period required under 8/3/1.
C.	Only that number of employees required to meet the number of position reductions identified in the notice provided to the Union under 8/3/1 will receive assistance.
D.	Reimbursement will be made, per item C above, on a “first come, first served” basis until the specific number of position vacancies has been achieved. Additional vacancies, due to employee turnover, which occur beyond the pre-identified number of vacancies which has been met will not be reimbursed under the provisions of this Negotiating Note.
The following benefits shall be provided to employees meeting the eligibility requirements as noted
above:
235
A.
Where applicable, employees shall receive benefits under s. 20.917, Wis. Stats.
B.	The Department shall also provide the following supplemental benefits where provisions of s. 20.917, Wis. Stats., do not apply:
1.	All or a portion of one (1) month’s rent;
2.	All or a portion of a rental security deposit, not to exceed one (1) month’s rent;
3.	The cost of all or a portion of actual moving expenses, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000); and,
4.	The cost of transportation between the employee’s home and headquarters city, not to exceed the cost of two (2) round trips.
C.	The Department shall provide leave with pay and shall reimburse employees of the Centers once for travel, meal, and lodging costs associated with selection and participation in a pre-service training program under s. 46.057, Wis. Stats., if costs are not funded under s. 20.435(3)(jp), Wis. Stats.
D.	Each employee shall be eligible for up to sixteen (16) hours paid leave time (in addition to the time granted under item B above) for the purposes of attending interviews or examinations in state service.

From Labor Day until the conclusion of the bargaining session, the Employer and the Union agree to equally share the cost.
236
The shared cost will apply only to each of the thirty (30) employees of the six (6) bargaining units represented by the Wisconsin State Employees Union. The qualifying shared time will be recorded as time off without loss of pay.

20013 - 20035 AGREEMENT
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
During negotiations of the 1999-2001 WSEU contract, the Labor and Management bargaining team has become aware of the need to strengthen the communication process between supervisors and employees relative to the manner in which employees are advised of pending disciplinary actions.
It is often the case that supervisors verbally inform an employee that certain discipline will follow a specific act. However, because of the nature of the discipline and the level of management approval required, the time necessary to effect the discipline may be considerable.
In an effort to deal with this problem in a meaningful manner at the local level, we have agreed that supervisors and managers should provide formal notice of disciplinary actions to employees as soon as possible after the decision to discipline is made and announced to the employee. If there should be some unforeseen administrative problems that deter the processing of the official notice, the employee should be advised accordingly. Hopefully this process will relieve some of the anxiety which now exists among employees when they are verbally told a disciplinary action is forthcoming.

MEMO - PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
DATE:	July 19, 1985
TO:	Agency Personnel Managers
FROM:	Howard Fuller, Secretary
237
Department of Employment Relations
SUBJECT: Performance Evaluations
The performance evaluation process for employees is a necessary and important component of all wellmanaged organizations. The State is no exception. I believe strongly in the process and intend to see it develop in the coming years.
To this end certain questions have been raised during the current round of negotiations regarding the content of written performance evaluations. Specifically, concerns have been raised regarding direct references to department work rule violations which are occasionally contained in employees’ annual performance evaluations.
Under cover of this memorandum, I am directing State Agencies to advise their supervisors to refrain from quoting specific work rules in written performance evaluations. Since performance evaluations are not discipline, but are part of an employee’s permanent record, such evaluations could conceivably be misconstrued as disciplinary actions.
Performance should be discussed directly in the annual evaluations. Examples of good or bad performance can be made, and references to specific deficiencies are acceptable.
In closing, I would like to restate that my concerns lie with specific work rule references being included in the annual evaluations and the need to keep such references out of them. Even if the performance represents a work rule violation, only the description of the unacceptable performance should be included in the evaluation. I would appreciate your cooperation in insuring that this directive is implemented.

Division of Collective Bargaining
Department of Employment Relations
SUBJECT: Grievance Responses
During the course of negotiations, a problem was identified relative to the timely processing of contractual grievances at Steps 1 and 2 under the WSEU contract.
The purpose of this memorandum is to reiterate management’s position that all grievances must be processed promptly and within the limits prescribed by the contracts. I recognize that circumstances may arise which make it impossible to meet the time limits. In cases such as these, an extension of the time limit should be requested and handled as follows:
A.	Contact the local steward when an extension is needed to arrange for an extension.
B.	Management’s representative should contact the grievant’s supervisor to inform him or her of the extension.
C.	The steward will contact the grievant.
It is important that grievances be responded to in a timely manner and that the persons concerned are aware of the status of the grievance in order to resolve differences at the earliest possible time.

TO:	All Agency Heads

SUBJECT: Reimbursement of Travel Expenses
During the recent contract negotiations with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, there were discussions regarding the timely reimbursement of travel expenses. It was the understanding during the negotiations that travel expense reimbursement should be implemented as expeditiously as possible.
Similarly, if a specific reimbursement expense is in dispute, only that amount should be withheld pending resolution of the dispute. Those amounts not in dispute should continue to be processed in a timely manner.
I am asking all agencies to do their utmost to comply with this understanding.

MEMO - DNR USE OF PESTICIDES
October 29, 1985	IN REPLY REFER TO: 9500
TO:
Dear (to be determined at a later date):
This memo is in answer to your concerns about the use of pesticides or experimental chemicals by department employees. Russ Dunst, our Toxics Coordinator, looked into this and found there were actually three incidences in which the Department engaged in evaluation of pesticides.
The Department does cooperate with other agencies and researchers in evaluating “experimental” pesticides or pesticide usage. There are two types of evaluations:
1.	Evaluation of new pesticides, and
2.	Evaluation of new uses for existing pesticides.
The Department has participated in three new use evaluations in recent years. We do have a policy, however, against new pesticide evaluations.
The three “new use” evaluations were:
1.	Tydrin: Langlade County Forest, in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1983 (was actually not a DNR experiment).
2.	Bayleton: Hayward Nursery, 1984-1985 - A copy of this report is attached.
3.	Furadan: Avoca Wildlife Area, cooperation with U.S. Forest Service, 1984-1985 - A copy of that report is attached.
243
These pesticides are commonly used in many types of situations, and the evaluations were aimed at expanding the present EPA registration.
In addition to the above information, we have agreed to release to you the report and recommendations from the Committee on Pesticide Programs. A copy of that is attached. In addition to this, I commit to you that we will be glad to furnish you with any future reports and recommendations from this committee.

NEGOTIATING NOTE NO. 35
2001 - 2003 AGREEMENT
(SPS-DOC)
For purposes of this Agreement, “Light Duty” refers to an Officer who is absent from work due to s. 230.36, Wis. Stats., or Worker’s Compensation circumstances and who is medically certified to return to work with limitations that prevent him/her from performing his/her regular duties.
“Light Duty” issues will be Locally Negotiated with the following guidelines and considerations: Temporary assignment to a vacant position if appropriate; creation of a post to be used for “Light Duty” accommodations if resources are available; approval of a temporary agreement between two employees to exchange posts; or assignment of duties over and above the normal post orders.
Post orders or position descriptions shall not be changed or altered to include or accommodate “Light Duty”, unless mutually agreed between management and the local union.
Officers will not be reassigned from their regular posted positions until the above options have been considered and/or any other options locally negotiated to accommodate a “Light Duty” Officer. In the event a temporary reassignment is necessary to accommodate a temporarily disabled Officer, the reassigned Officer will retain his/her shift and work schedule. Any such reassignments will be by seniority within the same or lower level class of those Officers whose posted positions are appropriate for the particular accommodation.
For employees who return to work with “Light Duty” restrictions, the Employer agrees not to displace employees who are more senior than the employee who is returning to work with “Light Duty” restrictions. No Officer will be reassigned for more than thirty (30) days in any one calendar year unless otherwise agreed to in the Local Agreement.
254
Provisions for Officers who are medically certified to return to work with limitations due to other than s. 230.36, Wis. Stats., or Worker’s Compensation circumstances shall not displace Officers from their regular posted positions unless otherwise locally negotiated.
Prior to any reassignment for “Light Duty” purposes, Management will contact the local union president or his/her designee to discuss the matter.
2003-2005 AGREEMENT (PSS) LIGHT DUTY
Section 230.36, Wis. Stats.
For a s. 230.36 compensable injury, light duty refers to temporary alternate duties for an employee who is returning to work with medical limitations identified by the employee’s attending physician that prevent the employee from performing his/her regular duties.
The Employer will first give consideration to light duty assignments that are as closely related as possible to the employee’s normal duties and do not result in a significant impact on co-workers. Other possible options the Employer may consider include:
A.	temporary assignment to alternate job duties within classification;
B.	temporary creation of a post to be used for light duty accommodations if resources are available;
C.	approval of a temporary agreement between two employees to exchange job duties (posts);
D.	reallocation of time spent on duties normally assigned.
The Employer agrees not to displace employees with an employee returning to work with light duty limitations.
255
Local negotiations concerning s. 230.36, Wis. Stats., light duty shall be limited to procedures for implementing light duty pursuant to the options mentioned above.
Upon notification to the union, an employee may be required to submit to physical and/or medical examinations to determine the ability or inability to work light duty. Such examination shall be performed by a physician mutually agreed upon by OSER and Council 24. The costs shall be shared equally by both parties. If a physician cannot be mutually agreed upon within 30 calendar days of notification to the union, such examination will be at the expense of the Employer and performed by a physician selected by the Employer.
Worker’s Compensation
Worker’s Compensation is administered by the Department of Administration under the provisions of Chapter 102, Wis. Stats. The Department of Administration may delegate this responsibility to an agency (e.g. DOT, UW) but maintains statutory oversight. It is in the best interest of the employee and the Employer to return injured employees to work as soon as they are medically able. Light duty may allow injured workers to temporarily resume partial or alternate duties that accommodate their medical restrictions. Light duty opportunities are subject to the employee’s medical restrictions and the Employer’s ability to reasonably accommodate them.
Non-Work Related
When requested, employees with non-work related injuries will receive information on available benefits and possible light duty options. At management’s discretion, light duty will be provided when available. The decision to deny light duty shall not be arbitrary. Current local agreements and practices concerning light duty will be extended unless mutually agreed otherwise.
NEGOTIATING NOTE NO. 36 20013 - 20035 AGREEMENT
NOTICE OF SUSPENSIONS WITH PAY
The Employer agrees that when a written note of suspension with pay, pending an Employer investigation, is sent to an employee, a copy of the notice will also be provided to the Local Union president or his/her designee.

CORRESPONDENCE/MEMORANDUM
STATE OF WISCONSIN
DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS
DATE:	June 18, 1993
TO:	Agency Heads
FROM:	Jon E. Litscher, Secretary
Department of Employment Relations
SUBJECT: Layoff
During the course of the 1993-95 labor contract negotiations with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, prolonged discussion was held concerning the issue of Layoff and the provisions of Article VIII of the WSEU Agreement. The Union’s concerns centered primarily around the issues related to timely communication to employees of the Employer’s decisions to layoff employees and assistance to employees designated for layoff. To address these concerns while operating within the current language of the Agreement, it is recommended that agencies:
(1)	Provide maximum notice to employees designated to be laid off so as to allow them maximum time to explore alternative employment options. In many cases, this maximum notice may well exceed current labor agreement requirements; and
(2)	Provide for the appointment of an “Agency Coordinator,” when thirty (30) or more employees are designated for layoff, to assist those employees in exploring their options; and
(3)	Give serious hiring consideration to qualified employees of other agencies who have been designated in writing as “at-risk” of future layoff or have received notice of layoff, combined with the hiring of individuals from the Civil Service Certification Eligibility List(s).
257
Incorporating the above recommendations into your layoff and hiring plans and procedures will help your employees deal with the inherent uncertainties present when facing a layoff.

TO:	Agency Heads
FROM:	Jon E. Litscher,	Secretary
Department of Employment Relations
SUBJECT: Alternative Work Schedules
During the course of the 1993-95 labor contract negotiations with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, the issue of Alternative Work Schedules was raised by Union Representatives. More specifically, those Representatives indicated that it was their perception that requests for alternative scheduling arrangements were being rejected out-of-hand with little or no discussion between employees, union and supervisors.
The purpose of this memo is to remind all Employer representatives to review the provisions of Article VI, Section 15 (Alternative Work Patterns) and the intent of that provision. The intent was to reflect the Employer’s strong encouragement of Agencies to consider and work toward the development of such working arrangements. Due consideration should be given such requests and out-of-hand rejection should be avoided. Especially important is the serious consideration of such requests and an open and frank discussion with
258
employees and the Union. Keep in mind, also, that implementation of alternative work pattern arrangements is only with the mutual agreement of the Union.
The Union has also been advised that requests for Alternative Work Schedules that are not approved may be referred to Agency Employment Relations or Personnel Offices to assure such requests were handled in accordance with the intent of Article VI, Section 15.

RE:	1993-1995 Pay Progression Systems (Grids)
In negotiating pay progression systems (grids) under the 1993-1995 contract, it is the Employer’s intent to establish pay structures which can continue from one contract to another.

In that seniority pay grids have been negotiated for the 1993-1995 WSEU contract, the Employer will not implement RMRs or approved HAM requests for classifications covered under the contract for the life of the Agreement.

These pilots will be reviewed during the 19992001 set of negotiations by the parties.
There is no guarantee that these pilots will continue into the next collective bargaining agreement.

To:	Agency Heads

From:	Jon E. Litscher, Secretary
Department of Employment Relations
Subject:	Dues Deduction Collections (Article II, Section 2/7)
During the course of negotiations for the 1995-97 Master Agreement with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, the matter of adjustments to mistaken dues deductions was discussed. Specifically, it came to the attention of the Employer that in some cases, where an excessive amount of dues has been erroneously deducted from an individual’s wages, agencies have taken it upon themselves to correct the over-deduction by adjusting the deduction in the following pay period. There is generally no correction where an insufficient amount has been deducted.
The provisions of Article II, section 2/7 hold the Employer harmless for errors made in dues deduction, and are intended to prevent the excessive entanglement of the Employer in that process. Therefore, it is the purpose of this memorandum to remind Agency Business and Finance Departments and payroll officers not to unilaterally correct excessive dues amounts collected in error from WSEU-represented employees. The appropriate recourse for an employee who has had an excessive amount of dues deducted is for that employee to contact the Union directly.
Agencies should continue the practice of making no correction, except for future transactions where necessary for insufficient deduction amounts.

Subject:	Direct Deposit of Payroll Checks
During the course of discussions during the 1995-97 labor contract negotiations with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, problems with paycheck distribution were identified by both WSEU and Employer representatives. Items of concern identified by the parties include: security against lost or stolen checks, the considerable increase in the cost of postage and handling in recent years, paychecks which are lost in the mail cause significant delays in the availability of employee funds, the time and expense of canceling and reissuing checks to replace those that were originally lost (including remailing the replacement checks), and the need to maintain detailed records of reissues for reconciliation purposes.
It is recognized by the parties that it is in the best interest of both to minimize unnecessary delays and expenses related to the distribution of payroll checks. Therefore, both WSEU and DER strongly encourage all state employees to set up direct deposit of payroll checks with their financial institution(s).
Direct deposit would virtually eliminate problems that are currently being experienced by both the employees and the agency payroll offices.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 13
20013 - 20035 AGREEMENT
LAYOFF
The Employer and the Union agree that retaining career-oriented, permanent employees is in the best interest of the State.
The Employer believes that the State must protect the investment it has made in its work force. To this end, the Employer is committed to the notion that State agencies must maintain the most effective and efficient employees. In view of State budget reductions, the Employer will encourage and adopt innovative techniques that enhance the effectiveness of current civil service procedures. To that end, DOSER, DMRS and all State Agencies will use the Employee Referral Service (ERS) as outlined in DOSER Bulletin MRS-223/CLR/POL-70, dated February 13, 2002, to retain the most qualified employees.
During this biennium, agencies may be required to significantly reduce their budgets, resulting in the potential displacement of permanent employees. In order to protect the State’s investment and ensure the quality of State services, the parties agree to the following:
•	In those employing units affected by staff reductions, the Employer will review its staffing needs and allocation patterns to retain permanent employees where possible. The Union will make every effort to cooperate with the Employer in the mutual interest of maintaining employment for potentially displaced employees.
•	All State agencies will make every effort to accommodate and provide services to qualified permanent employees in layoff status prior to hiring non-state employees.
•	DOSER has implemented a system which will help achieve the State’s “no layoff’ goal and will continue to maintain the ERS for the life of this Agreement.
•	If operations, functions and employees are moved from one agency to another and as a result, layoffs are generated, the affected employees will have restoration and reinstatement rights as outlined in Article VIII, Layoff Procedure, of this Agreement.
•	The Employer will give consideration to accommodate qualified full-time permanent employees who are in layoff status from other employing units and agencies prior to utilization of the hiring process or engaging programs (i.e., Wisconsin Conservation Corps, Badger State Industries, etc).
309
•	The Employer and the Union will work together to secure funding for the purpose of establishing retraining programs focused on displaced state workers.
The above provisions will be in place for the duration of the 2001-2003 collective bargaining agreement.

•	If a caseload exceeds 215 points*, the supervisor will have five (5) work days to provide relief by considering a number of options, including assigning work to another agent or waiving standards. If the point total cannot be reduced in those five (5) work days, the agent will be allowed to work one (1) hour of overtime per week for every 5.5 points his/her caseload exceeds the 215 point* standard.
•	Some limited specialized work units will be excluded from the 215-point caseload maximum. Mutual agreement as to these work units will be worked out between the Secretary of the Department of Corrections, the Regional Chief(s), DOC Employment Relations, AFSCME Council 24 and the local union.

•	Telephone calls received under Article 6/16/2 (PSS) and Article 6/16/3 (PSS) of the labor agreement.
•	Employer directed work time outside of the approved work schedule. This is work time specifically
directed in advance by a supervisor and includes attendance at court hearings and revocation hearings.
•	Employer approved work time outside of the approved work schedule. This is work time (normally approved in advance) where the supervisor determines that the agent cannot flex his/her schedule in order to stay within a 40-hour work week due to workload demands.
311
•	Emergencies that occur during non-work hours. An emergency is defined as an offender related incident that poses a threat to the public safety which, if not immediately addressed, may result in irreparable harm to the community or the offender.

In response to the Union’s concerns that Social Workers in the Milwaukee Child Protection Services Program, and the Department of Corrections Clinical Service Staff employees, because of the nature of their positions, are required to carry “beepers” during off-duty hours and respond to work-related calls, the Department of Health and Family Services, and the Department of Corrections, through this Memorandum of Understanding agrees that:
A.	Those Social Workers and Clinical Service employees, required to respond to contact by beepers or pagers during off-duty hours, shall be informed of this requirement by their supervisor.
B.	A Social Worker or Clinical Service employee, required to respond to contact by beeper, or pager, during off-duty hours, shall be entitled to the following compensation:
1.	A fee equal to one (1) hour of pay at the employees current hourly rate of pay for each regularly scheduled day of the work week that the employee is required to respond to contact by beeper or pager during off-duty hours with a maximum of five (5) hours of pay per work week. This payment, or fee, shall not increase the employees hours for the purpose of the calculation of overtime.
312
2.	A fee of twenty-four dollars ($24.00) for each regularly scheduled off day of the week that the employee is required to respond to contact by beeper or pager during off-duty hours with a maximum fee of forty-eight dollars ($48.00) per calendar week.
The above provisions will be in place for the duration of the 2001 20032003-2005 WSEU collective bargaining agreement.

2001 2003 2003-2005 AGREEMENT
During the course of negotiations for the 1997-99 Agreement with the Wisconsin State Employees Union, Local 2748 raised concerns regarding the perception that some Probation and Parole Agents were being required to carry “beepers” during off-duty hours and respond to work-related calls.
In regards to this concern, the Department of Corrections, through this Memorandum of Understanding, would like to clarify the use of beepers and/or pagers by Probation and Parole Agents during off-duty hours.
The Department agrees that Probation and Parole Agents will not routinely be required to respond to contact by beepers or pagers during off-duty hours. Should a supervisor believe that it is necessary for a Probation and Parole Agent to respond to contact by a beeper or pager during off-duty hours, the decision to authorize such a requirement shall be made by the Division Administrator. In the event that a Probation and Parole Agent is required to respond to contact by a beeper or pager during off-duty hours, the agent shall be informed of this requirement in writing.
313
Once a probation and parole agent is informed in writing of the requirement to respond to contact by beeper or pager during off-duty hours, he/she shall be entitled to the following compensation:
X A fee equal to one (1) hour of pay at the employee’s current hourly rate of pay for each day of the week (Monday - Friday) that the employee is required to respond to contact by beeper or pager during off-duty hours. This payment shall not increase the employee’s hours for the purposes of the calculation of overtime.
X A fee of twenty-four dollars ($24.00) for each Saturday and/or Sunday that the employee is required to respond to contact by beeper or pager during off-duty hours with a maximum fee of forty-eight dollars ($48.00) for the weekend.
The above provisions shall be in place for the duration of the 2001 2003 2003-2005 collective bargaining agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 19
2001 - 2003 2003-2005 AGREEMENT
During the course of negotiating the 1997-1999 Agreement, there were discussions regarding the mutual benefit of the development of an electronic contractual transfer system. Both the Union and the Employer recognized that many factors would affect the development of such a system and that establishing a deadline for implementation was unrealistic. Both parties agreed to recommend that steps be taken when possible toward the development of an electronic transfer system. The recommendations of the Transfer Committee will be
314
incorporated in a letter to Robert Lavigna, Administrator of the Division of Merit Recruitment & Selection. The letter would contain the following language:
The Transfer Committee of the 1997 State of WI/WSEU bargaining team devoted a great deal of time to the electronic posting of transfer opportunities throughout Wisconsin state civil service. We recognized that technology is not yet standardized among all state agencies and that many other factors would impact the development and use of such a system. Rather than pursuing contract language requiring the development of a system now, the committee unanimously opted to recommend to OSER that steps be taken toward the development of an electronic transfer posting for all civil service transfer opportunities.
We were particularly impressed with the existing Layoff Referral System, and believe that it could easily be the foundation for electronic transfer postings. Stan Rogers, from the Wisconsin Department of Administration, met with our committee and suggested that a relatively small amount of programming would be needed to expand the Layoff Referral System to include the features we would like the future Electronic Transfer Posting System to contain.
Due to the short posting periods for transfer eligibility, and the mail service delays experienced by many rural Wisconsinites, the committee would like the future Electronic Transfer Posting System to be an interactive system, which would permit candidates to apply or respond directly from the posting. Building on the current Layoff Referral System’s interactive features with participating agencies, we would like each listing to contain a button to click on which would bring up an electronic application form. Candidates should be able to complete their individual information and electronically send it to the sponsoring agency. The sponsoring agency should be able to preselect where transfer responses arrive--a particular Personnel Specialist, or a dedicated electronic mailbox. Additionally, since some transfer postings require submission of a resume, we would like a template to be available with the click of a button for candidates to complete and send electronically.
Lastly, we would expect the future Electronic Transfer Posting System to be accessible by Email, the Internet and Usenet. Since not all candidates are computer-literate or have access to a connected computer, we would expect the future system to be supplemental to existing agency contractual transfer procedures.
In summary, we urge you to incorporate the building of an Electronic Transfer System into your business plans as soon as possible. The system should:
315
•	Build upon the existing Layoff Referral System structure and procedures
•	Be interactive with the use of “hot buttons”
•	Contain user complete & send application forms
•	Contain user complete & send resume templates
•	Contain pre-targeted response buttons for easy, accurate applications
•	Automatic purging of listings at expiration
•	Remote access for direct uploading of vacancies by sponsoring agency
•	Accessible by Email, Internet and Usenet
•	Be complementary to existing agency transfer procedures
This provision will sunset on June 30, 20032005 unless mutually agreed to extend.

Parking and Transit
(AS, BC) During the course of the 1999-2001 negotiations, the Union and the Employer attempted to address mutual concerns regarding parking and transit issues. These included, but are not limited to costs to all parties, pollution, inefficient land use and wasted time and resources. It was agreed to encourage the establishment of a Joint Committee to consider parking and transit problems and recommend solutions. The Committee is particularly encouraged to examine existing programs such as the “Commuter Value Pass” at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, the “Transit Pass/Fare Cutter Card” at the University of Wisconsin -Madison, etc. The Committee should include at least one (1) Union representative who works in such a program.

TEMPORARY TRANSACTION RATE FOR SELECT VOLUNTARY DEMOTIONS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, TRADE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
The parties agree that during the course of the 2001-2003 Labor Agreement, the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection will continue a pilot program that will allow employees classified as Food Safety Inspector-Objective and Meat Safety Inspector-Objective to voluntary demote as follows:
•	Voluntary demotion to a different geographic headquarters location.
318
•	Employees classified as a Food Safety Inspector-Objective who request and are appointed on a voluntary demotion to a Meat Safety Inspector-Entry position will maintain their current rate of pay for one year (temporary transaction rate).
•	Employees classified as a Meat Safety Inspector-Objective who request and are appointed on a voluntary demotion to a Food Safety Inspector-Entry position will maintain their current rate of pay for one year (temporary transaction rate).
If, at the end of that one year, management determines that the employee has not met the criteria to be reinstated to the objective level of their current Entry level classification, the temporary transaction rate will cease and the employee’s base pay will be set at the grid rate that corresponds to the employees grid seniority in their current Entry level classification.
Exercising the voluntary demotion procedure outlined in this memorandum of understanding does not supersede the provisions of 7/1/1.
The above provisions will be in place for the duration of the 2001-2003 collective bargaining agreement. The parties agree to review this memorandum of understanding during the next contract negotiations and by mutual agreement may extend the provisions outlined above.

INJURED WORKERS RE-EMPLOYMENT
It is mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of the State to retain capable, trained employees and to protect the investment it has made in its workforce.
IfWhen the Employer determines an employee has a bona fide worker’s compensation or s. 230.36 claim, and the employee can no longer perform the essential functions of his/her current position, the Employer, prior to medical terminationprior to medical termination, in accordance with s. 230.37(2), Wis. Stats., will make a good faith effort to do the following: transfer the employee to a position which requires less arduous duties; demote the employee; place the employee in a part-time position; or as a last resort, dismiss the employee. Prior to dismissal, the Employer will refer the employee to the State Injured Worker Reemployment Program, which will assess the employee’s skills and work with the Employer to evaluate reasonable accommodation options that may avoid the medical termination. The referral to the program may occur at the employee’s request when the Employer receives medical verification that the employee may no
319
longer be able to perform the essential functions of the position at the end of healing. The referral shall occur at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the medical termination.
When an employee is notified that medical termination is being considered, the local union president will be notified. Within ten (10) calendar days of this notification (unless mutually agreed to otherwise), at the Union’s request, the Employer and the designated union representative will meet to discuss the employee’s options.
Prior to medically terminating the employee, the Employer will make a good faith effort to meet or teleconference with the employee to discuss the employee’s options. The employee will be offered a designated union representative to be present at the discussion. Inability of the designated union representative to be present shall not unduly delay the discussion.
A grievance filed in response to a medical termination will be covered under 4/2/10 of this Agreement.
If the employee is medically terminated and is referred to the State Injured Worker Re-employment Program by a risk management examiner, the Program will provide information about vocational rehabilitation, including DVR programs, and on employment, including training and possible re-employment for vacant positions that may be suitable for the employee.
If the employee voluntarily accepts a position that results in a reduction in their rate of pay as a result of a s. 230.36 injury, his or her pay shall be set in accordance with section E./2. of Appendix 5 of the Agreement.

During negotiations on the 1999-2001 WSEU Collective Bargaining Agreement, an issue was raised by the WSEU regarding the DNR’s use of limited term employees in the LTE Ranger classification to perform law enforcement duties and the impact of this LTE use on the ability of bargaining unit employees in the RangerOperations (formerly Ranger 1) classification to be reclassified to the Ranger-Law Enforcement (formerly Ranger 2) classification.
Beginning in calendar year 2000, the DNR agrees to address this issue by reviewing and implementing increases in their percentage of law enforcement duties assigned to bargaining unit Rangers in order to facilitate their reclassification. These actions will be taken starting in 2000 to the extent practicable depending on commitments already made to the hiring of limited term employees and the willingness of bargaining unit Rangers to work during the hours when the law enforcement need is greatest.
The parties agree that representatives of DNR management and the Union will meet at mutually agreed times as necessary to further discuss this issue Up to three (3) bargaining unit employees will participate in any meetings without loss of pay.

20013 - 20035 AGREEMENT
The Employer and the Union agree that it is in their mutual interest to create and maintain a strong relationship between Labor and Management at all levels of state government at work sites across Wisconsin.
It is further agreed that the Union and Management will cooperate in a supportive environment to achieve mutually agreed upon results. It is clearly understood by the parties that people want to cooperate and work more effectively and that productivity, performance and effectiveness will improve as the result of improved cooperation. Such cooperation is intended to create opportunities for each employee (whether Union official or Manager, represented or non-represented employee) to work individually and collectively to strengthen and change state government for the better.
It is agreed that the emphasis will be on achieving mutual gain through working together by separating people and personalities from issues and problems, focusing on “interests” rather than “positions” and emphasizing objective rather than personally subjective criteria and data to evaluate and select options.
325
Finally, it is agreed that in the interest of fostering a strong Labor/Management relationship, all employees will be treated with dignity and respect.
It is with these goals in mind that we ask all appointing authorities and Union officials to take steps toward “institutionalizing” cooperative and collaborative work improvement projects at all levels of state government. It is expected that the parties will identify mutual problems and concerns and will mutually develop action plans for their resolution. Further, it is recommended that project teams, committees, or work groups be created as the need arises to facilitate the problem solving process.
Upon the mutual request of the appointing authority and the local Union, the Employer and AFSCME Council 24 staff will provide technical assistance to local employing units by providing training and on-site assistance to Union/Management teams at specific work sites. The Employer and AFSCME Council 24 may also agree to pilot unique solutions not specifically authorized by other language of this contract, to solve workplace problems.

20013 - 20035 AGREEMENT
The grievance process is the formal method the parties have adopted for the resolution of contractual disputes. Pre-Filing was developed in response to Union and Employer concerns that few grievances were resolved at the first-line supervisor level. In most cases, the inclusion of the supervisor in the formal grievance was ineffective in resolving disagreements, created frustrations and was unnecessarily time-consuming. It was agreed that the supervisor should not be by-passed in the process but should be given an informal opportunity to attempt to resolve the problem.
As a result of discussion during the 2001-03 negotiations, the parties agreed to the following clarifications as to how the Pre-Filing process will be handled:
1.	The grievance representative will contact the immediate supervisor identifying a potential grievance and discussing whether a potential solution is possible.
2.	The supervisor will attempt to resolve the problem. If no resolution can be reached, the supervisor will inform the grievance representative.
3.	If the supervisor seeks to resolve the problem, s/he will keep the grievance representative informed of progress and provide a prompt response.
4.	The grievance representative may file a Step One grievance anytime during the thirty (30) day time limit.
5.	The Employer may hold the grievance in abeyance until the Pre-Filing has been requested.
It is expected that grievance representatives will make a good faith effort to request Pre-Filing prior to filing a grievance and supervisors will make a good faith effort to determine whether a resolution is possible. It is also expected that, in fostering good labor/management relations, any resolutions reached at Pre-Filing will be honored by all parties.

2001-2003 AGREEMENT Department of Corrections Milwaukee Secured Detention Facility
During the course of 2001-2003 contract negotiations, there was a great deal of discussion regarding overtime assigned to the wrong employee at MSDF. The Employer and the Union recognize that errors in overtime can occur despite the most carefully designed overtime system.
When assigning overtime, it is the Employer’s responsibility to review the daily schedule, master agreement and local agreement to ensure the correct employee has been assigned to work. When an employee believes he/she has been wrongfully ordered to work overtime, the employee must notify their supervisor so he/she can make a reasonable effort to allow the employee relief from the wrongful order prior to it taking place. If it is determined that an employee has been wrongfully ordered, it is then the Employer’s responsibility, when possible, to assign the correct employee. Additionally, an employee who believes he/she is being wrongfully assigned to work overtime shall have a reasonable amount of time to use a state phone to 328
attempt to secure a relief worker. Wrongful order is defined as when the Employer forces an employee to work overtime when the employee was not scheduled or previously assigned to work it. If more than five (5) instances of wrongful orders occur in a particular pay period, the appropriate remedy shall be as follows:
The employee will have the option of choosing cash or compensatory time for the ordered time. If it has been determined that the employee was wrongfully ordered to work after the employee has been paid, the employee will have the option of cash or compensatory time for his/her next overtime opportunity of an equivalent pay period. Additionally, the employee will have the option to receive cash or compensatory time at the base rate for every hour the employee worked the forced overtime. Once there are more than five (5) instances of wrongfully ordered overtime, this provision will apply to all further instances including the first five (5) within a particular pay period.
Grievances generated by the application of this MOU will be processed through the umpire arbitration process and will be handled by an arbitrator who has significant experience with overtime grievances and who is mutually chosen by WSEU and DER.
This Memorandum of Understanding applies only to Correctional Officers and Correctional Sergeants at the Milwaukee Secured Detention Facility and will sunset on June 29, 20035, unless mutually agreed to extend it.

2001-2003 AGREEMENT
During the course of the 2001-2003 agreement, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) issued a decision in the following unit clarification actions involving the Wisconsin State Employees Union (WSEU) AFSCME, the State Engineering Association (SEA), and the State of Wisconsin: Case 11, No. 50909, SE-12, Decision No. 11245-S; and Case 36, No. 50935, SE-13, Decision No. 11667-C.
The WERC decided that due to the great variance in educational background, engineering work experience, and position descriptions and summaries for Engineering Specialists at identical classification levels, it was unwilling to assess the professional status of positions for which testimony was not taken and evidence not submitted. However, the WERC believed the guidance provided in the decision should enable the parties to resolve any remaining issues. Using the guidance provided by the WERC, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began a review of all affected positions to provide a recommendation as to the appropriate classification level. After DOT completes its review of affected positions, it will submit recommendations to the Department of Employment Relations (DER) for a final determination. As of the date of this MOU, DOT’s review is still pending.
The parties agree that any employee whose base pay rate would be reduced as a result of movement from SEA to WSEU due to the above review will have his or her base pay rate red-circled for the duration of this Memorandum of Understanding.

As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed that all issues in the ULP would be settled during the negotiations for the 2001 2003 Agreement. The parties have now agreed that effective the
330
first pay period following the effective date of the 2001 2003 Agreement, the ULP settlement will be implemented, with agreed upon lump sum payments being made to affected employees as soon as administratively feasible.—This M.O.U will expire upon completion of the ULP settlement payments, and be deleted from subsequent Agreements.

OSER agrees to explore the feasibility of providing this information on future lists provided under those sections. If it becomes feasible to provide such information in the appropriate format, OSER will make that information available to the Union.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 43 2003-2005 AGREEMENT Agency State-Wide Employing Unit Layoffs
This memorandum of understanding applies only to those employees in state-wide employing units.
When a position in the bargaining unit held by an employee who is not the least senior employee in the classification is eliminated or involuntarily reduced in FTE, the employee whose position is being eliminated will have one of the following options:
a Accept the reassignment to the least senior employee’s position in the layoff group.
b.Separate from employment with the guarantee that the Employer will not challenge eligibility for unemployment compensation unless the employee, at a later point in time, refuses a reasonable offer of re-employment.
c If the least senior employee’s position is more than forty (40) miles away from the assigned
headquarters and the employee does not accept the reassignment, the separation will be considered a layoff and the employee will be afforded the options outlined under 8/5/1.
This Agreement will sunset on June 30, 2005, unless the parties mutually agree to extend.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 44 2003-2005 AGREEMENT
Contracting Out Procurements Under Ch. 16, Wis. Stats.
During the course of negotiations for the 2003-2005 Agreement, concerns were raised by the union regarding contracting out for services under chapter 16 procurement procedures. As part of ensuring fiscal responsibility in state government, the state is committed to managing contracts for services in a manner consistent with the best interests of the state as a whole. It is essential that the state and the University of Wisconsin System comply with relevant statutes, administrative rules, DOA procurement policies, and collective bargaining agreements when contracting for services. The state wishes to give effect to the letter and intent of those statutes, rules, procedures, and agreements while continuing to streamline procurement procedures so as not to unduly delay the performance of state services. In an effort to address these concerns, the parties agree to the following:
1)	DOA will develop a shared format to be used by all agencies to track the purchase of contracted services. If a centralized, electronic procurement system becomes available during the biennium, that system may be substituted. Information gathered in this manner will be shared by agencies with the union on an annual basis. This shared format will be developed and distributed to agencies not later than March 1, 2004.
2)	State agencies will abide by current state procurement policies and collective bargaining agreements regarding notice of contracting out to unions. In addition to providing notices currently required by existing statutes, rules and procedures, a notice will be issued to the union for all vendor-managed service contracts no later than five (5) working days prior to each service engagement. This notice will include the type of services to be performed and a justification of need consistent with the requirements of the DOA Procurement Manual. If unforeseen circumstances prevent the issuance of the notice five (5) working days prior to the service engagement, a notice will be issued as soon as possible consistent with business needs.
3)	DOA will issue a memorandum to agencies by January 2, 2004, clarifying the process that is required to be followed when a request for purchasing authority is issued and when the delegated contract process is followed, consistent with relevant statutes, administrative rules, procurement policies, and collective bargaining requirements. This memorandum will emphasize the importance of providing timely notice to affected labor organizations at the appropriate points in the process, and the importance of preparing a justification of need for contracted services that includes a statement showing why the services can be performed more economically or efficiently by contract rather than by state employees.
332
4)	Over the term of this contract, DOA will coordinate a review of two specific contracts that are for work performed by this union and that are identified by the union. Master vendor contracts will not be eligible for this review, although individual hires off of the contract may be reviewed. This pilot review will analyze available documentation regarding the procurement process used, scope, term, and cost of the contract, information submitted by the union that bears on the contract, and other relevant factors. Upon completion, DOA will meet with the union to discuss the results of its review.
5)	An advisory group will be established and comprised of three management members and three union members for the purpose of advising the DOA secretary, by July 1, 2004, on the procurement of services that are normally performed by bargaining unit members. Advisory group members will attend meetings of the group without loss of pay. The advisory group may forward consensus recommendations to the DOA secretary on the following issues:
a)	the relevant factors to be considered in preparing the justification of need required under current procurement procedures;
b)	the preparation of accurate, economical, efficient and effective analyses;
c)	consideration of whether procurement statutes, rules, policies and procedures need to be modified to ensure that appropriate analysis can be performed without unduly delaying the performance of state services;
d)	procedures to ensure agency compliance with union notification requirements; and
e)	operational issues created by movement of employees between state service and contract service firms.
The advisory group may provide consensus recommendations, if any, to the DOA
secretary by July 1, 2004. The DOA secretary will meet with the advisory group to discuss its recommendations.
This memorandum of understanding sunsets on June 30, 2005, regardless of contract extension, unless the parties mutually agree to extend.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 45 2003-2005 AGREEMENT
With Act 33, Laws of 2003, the Employer was required to reduce the number of positions in the civil service. This memorandum identifies an option available to employees who have been formally notified of layoff due to either the reductions in work force initiated under Act 33 or other layoffs executed during the term of this Agreement. This MOU is effective on the effective date of the Agreement and applies only to employees who are formally notified of layoff on or after that date. These provisions do not apply to employees notified as being at risk of layoff.
The following option is available to employees after application of the options available to employees upon notification of layoff identified under Article VIII, Section 5, of the Agreement.
The Employer agrees that prior to filling a vacancy with an individual other than a current state employee or an individual with a restoration right to the vacancy, agencies will select the most senior eligible employee from the list of interested employees, from any other state agency, who have applied for the vacancy on a transfer basis.
An eligible employee is defined as an employee who:
•	has received formal written notification of layoff; and
•	currently holds a position in any classification assigned to the same pay range as the vacancy, and the current position and the vacancy are in the same bargaining unit; and
•	is not on a concentrated performance evaluation program as defined in Article IV, Section 13 of the Agreement and as approved by the department head or his or her designee; and
•	is qualified to perform the work after being given the customary orientation provided to newly hired workers in the position.
The employee’s pay on transfer will be set in accordance with applicable pay administration language.
334
Note for Informational Purposes: Employees transferring between agencies under the provisions of this memorandum of understanding may be placed on permissive probation at the discretion of the appointing authority. If an employee is terminated while on permissive probation, the termination will be considered a layoff except that the employee’s right of restoration will be to the agency from which s/he transferred.
This memorandum of understanding sunsets on June 30, 2005, unless the parties mutually agree
to extend.

APPENDIX 5
2001-2003 2003-2005 AGREEMENT
PERSONNEL TRANSACTION PAY ADJUSTMENTS
AH-Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all personnel transaction pay adjustments for employees moving to, between, or within positions allocated to classifications in any of the WSEU bargaining units will be determined in accordance with the following provisions. The changes to these provisions will be effective the day of the FY 2001 2003 2003-2004 wage adjustments provided in Article XII of this Agreement.
A.	DEFINITIONS. The definitions set forth in the rules (ss. ER 1.02 and ER MRS. 1.02, Wis. Adm. Code) will be used in determining all personnel transactions with the following exceptions/additions:
1.	For pay schedules included in this Agreement, “higher pay range” means the pay range with the grid endpoint rate that has the greater dollar value, when comparing pay ranges not designated as counterparts. (Replaces definition for “higher pay range” in ss. ER 1.02 (13) and ER MRS. 1.02(9), Wis. Adm. Code)
2.	For pay schedules included in this Agreement, “lower pay range” means the pay range with the grid endpoint rate that has the lesser dollar value, when comparing pay ranges not designated as counterparts. (Replaces definition for “lower pay range” in ss. ER 1.02(19) and ER MRS. 1.02(16), Wis. Adm. Code)
3.	For pay schedules included in this Agreement, “same pay range” means a pay range with a grid endpoint rate that has the same dollar value, when comparing pay ranges not designated as counterparts. (Supplementary definition)
4.	For pay schedules included in this Agreement, “pay range maximum” means the grid endpoint of a pay range. (Supplementary definition)
5.	“Grid rate” means the rate of pay associated with a grid point in a pay range. (Supplementary definition)
359
6.
a.
Grid seniority” means an employee’s or former employee’s full years of
seniority on the date used to determine seniority level for purposes of implementing the most current grid for the applicable pay schedule. (Supplementary definition)
b. (SPS, LE) Where an employee is rehired and the date of hire begins the employee’s seniority date in accordance with 5/1/3 of this Agreement, the date of rehire will be used to determine the employee’s seniority level for purposes of determining the pay adjustments set forth in this Appendix until such time as the next grid is implemented for the applicable bargaining unit.
B.	PAY ON COMPLETION OF ALL PAY TRANSACTIONS (MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN TRAINEES). In general, on completion of any personnel transaction, an employee will receive a base pay rate equal to the minimum rate for the class if the employee is serving a probationary period.
C.	PAY ON COMPLETION OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF AN ORIGINAL PROBATION. There will be no increase upon completion of the first six months of an original probation.
D.	PAY ON ALL UPWARD MOVEMENTS (PROMOTION; REGRADE ON RECLASSIFICATION TO A HIGHER CLASS OR REALLOCATION TO A HIGHER CLASS; AND MOVEMENT BETWEEN LETTERED LEVELS OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION).
(For Correctional Officer, Sergeant, Psychiatric Care Technician, Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor-Advanced classifications, see Negotiating Note #61)
An employee’s base pay will be set at the greater of the following rates:
1.	the grid rate for the new class that corresponds to the employee’s grid seniority;
2.	the employee’s current base pay rate; or
3.	if the employee’s current base pay rate is greater than the grid endpoint of the old class, the employee’s current base pay rate plus the difference between the grid endpoint rate of the new class and the grid endpoint rate of the old class.
360
E.	PAY ON DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS
(For Correctional Officer, Sergeant, Psychiatric Care Technician, Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor-Advanced classifications, see Negotiating Note #61)
1.	VOLUNTARY DEMOTIONS OTHER THAN DEMOTION IN LIEU OF LAYOFF. An employee’s base pay will be set at the grid rate for the new class that corresponds to the employee’s grid seniority. If the employee’s grid seniority level is greater than or equal to the seniority level corresponding to the grid endpoint for the new class, the employee’s base pay will be set at the greater of the following rates:
a.	the grid endpoint rate,
b.	the employee’s current pay rate, decreased by $1.00 for each pay range the employee is demoting.
2.	ALL OTHER DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS (INVOLUNTARY DEMOTIONS, VOLUNTARY DEMOTIONS IN LIEU OF LAYOFF OR AFTER BEING DESIGNATED AS AT RISK OF LAYOFF UNDER 8/2/1, AND REGRADE ON RECLASSIFICATION OR REALLOCATION TO A LOWER CLASS). An employee’s base pay will be set at the greater of the following rates:
a.	the grid rate for the new class that corresponds to the employee’s grid seniority; or
b.	the employee’s current base pay rate.
If the downward movement results in the employee retaining his/her current base pay rate, such a rate will remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from the transaction effective date (“temporary transaction rate”). Upon expiration of the temporary transaction period, a personnel transaction that provides a higher base pay rate, or upon the employee’s separation from state service movement out of the WSEU bargaining units, whichever occurs earlier, the employee’s current pay will be set in accordance with the provisions for demotion under E/1, of this Appendix. Upon termination of the temporary transaction rate for any of the reasons identified above, the adjusted current pay rate will be used when determining the appropriate pay rate i'or-oU the subsequent personnel transaction, unless otherwise provided in this Appendix.
F.	PAY ON LATERAL MOVEMENTS
(For Correctional Officer, Sergeant, Psychiatric Care Technician, Youth Counselor and Youth Counselor-Advanced classifications, see Negotiating Note #61)

If the employee’s grid seniority level is less than the lowest seniority level for the new class and the employee previously attained permanent status in class, the employee’s base pay will be set at the minimum rate for the new class.
3.	TRANSFERS BETWEEN BARGAINING UNITS INVOLVING INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS, TRANSFERS IN LIEU OF LAYOFF OR TRANSFERS AFTER BEING DESIGNATED AS AT RISK OF LAYOFF UNDER 8/2/1. An employee’s base pay will be set at the greater of the following rates:
a.	the grid rate for the new class that corresponds to the employee’s grid seniority; or
b.	the employee’s current base pay rate.
If the lateral movement results in the employee retaining his/her current base pay rate, such a rate will remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from the transaction effective date (“temporary transaction rate”). Upon expiration of the temporary transaction period, a personnel transaction that provides a higher base pay rate, or upon the employee’s separation from state service movement out of the WSEU bargaining units, whichever occurs earlier, the employee’s current pay will be set in accordance with the provisions for transfer under F/2, of this Appendix.
