For the purposes of this Agreement, the Unit shall be understood to consist of:
All full-time and regular part-time administrative, clerical and technical employees of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst; excluding regular part-time employees who are expected to work less than 50 percent (50%) of the hours in a work year of a full-time employee in the same title; managerial and confidential employees within the meaning of M.G.L. Chapter 150E; students; employees paid on an hourly basis; supervisory employees and all other employees.
Should any new classified classification(s) be added to the work force, the appointing authority shall notify the Association of such new classified classification(s). The appointing authority shall determine if such new classified classification(s) shall be added to the bargaining unit and the appointing authority shall notify the Association of its determination. If the Association disagrees with the appointing authority's determination, the matter may be referred to the State Labor Relations Commission by the Association with a request that the Commission make a determination. In the event it shall be finally adjudicated that the classified classification(s) be added to the bargaining unit, the classified classification(s) shall then be subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
Should the appointing authority determine that a position or positions in a classification included in the Unit at the time of the execution of the April 28, 1981 Memorandum of Understanding concerning the exclusion of confidential/managerial employees as most recently amended by the parties, is no longer appropriately included in the Unit, it shall notify the Association of such determination. In the event the Association does not agree to the exclusion(s), the matter shall be referred to the State Labor Relations Commission for determination. Upon notification to the Association, any employee determined by the appointing authority to be excluded shall pay into an escrow account the equivalent of the Association's dues or agency fee. Said moneys shall either be returned to the employee or tendered to the Association, depending upon the outcome of the parties' discussions or the determination of the Labor Relations Commission.
The appointing authority agrees that when an employee in the bargaining unit is promoted, transferred, successfully applies for or otherwise moves from his/her unit position to a position excluded from the bargaining Unit by virtue of the April 28, 1981 Memorandum of Understanding, as most recently amended by the parties, the appointing authority shall so advise the Association.
The Employer will not aid, promote or finance any labor group or organization which purports to engage in collective bargaining, or make any agreement with any such group or individual for the purpose of undermining the Association or changing any condition in this Agreement. The Employer agrees to apply applicable provisions of this Agreement to those employees who receive all contractual benefits, whose funding source is derived from institute, grant or contract funds, and who perform the function of those positions covered by
3
this Agreement to the extent that the terms of their respective institute, grant or contract funding source and the level of funding thereunder so allow, as determined by the CEO.

ARTICLE 7 ANTI-DISCRIMINATION, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Section 1.
The Employer and the Association agree not to discriminate in any way in violation of applicable law or University policy, against employees covered by the Agreement on account of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, mental or physical disability, political belief or affiliation, or membership or non-membership in any organization.
Section 2.
The Association and the Employer agree that when the effects of employment practices, regardless of their intent, discriminate against any group of people on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, age, sex, national origin, or mental or physical disability, specific positive and aggressive measures must be taken to redress the effects of past discrimination, to eliminate present and future discrimination, and to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of hiring, upgrading, promotion, transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rate of compensation, and in-service or apprenticeship training programs. Therefore the parties acknowledge the need for positive and aggressive affirmative action. To accomplish these goals certain positions may be designated as affirmative action target positions in accordance with the Employer's Affirmative Action Plan filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. The President of the Association shall be informed of such targeted positions simultaneously with the Division of Human Resources.
Section 3.
No employee shall participate directly in any decision or recommendation relating to appointment, promotion, retention, or other condition of employment at the University of any parent, child, spouse, sibling, parent-in-law, sibling-in-law, child-in-law, or stepchild of such employee, or supervise the performance of any such person except under such circumstances as the CEO may determine as warranting waiver of this prohibition in the best interests of the University.
Section 4.
The Employer and the Association acknowledge that sexual harassment is a form of unlawful sex discrimination, and the parties mutually agree that no unit employee should be subjected to such harassment. The term sexual harassment as used here is conduct such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which constitutes sexual harassment when:
A.	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
B.	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
14
C.
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
Section 5.
Any charges of discrimination in violation of this Article shall be subject to the Campus Affirmative Action Grievance Procedure, and applicable State and Federal Laws under which the Association may represent the employee. Such charges shall not be subject to the contractual grievance and arbitration procedures.
15
ARTICLE 8 WORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES
Section 1.	Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday
A.	Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for fulltime employees shall be thirty-seven and one-half (37 1/2) hours per week excluding meal periods.
B.	The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and Association stewards.
C.	When the appointing authority desires to change the work schedule and/or work week of an employee, a discussion shall be held with the affected employee prior to the issuance of a written notice. Such written notice shall be given to the affected employee at least ten (10) working days in advance of the date of such contemplated change. If requested by the affected employee, written reasons for the change shall be provided within seven (7) calendar days of the request. Any such request must be made prior to the effective date of the schedule change. In no event shall such request for written reasons operate to forestall the effective date of the schedule change. In cases of emergency involving the protection of the property of the appointing authority or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the appointing authority, such discussion and/or written notice shall not be required unless such emergency continues to exist for more than five (5) working days. After that time, written reasons for the change in the work schedule and/or work week will be provided to the affected employee in the most practicable manner.
D.	To the extent practicable, the normal workweek shall consist of five (5) consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable, employees in continuous operations shall receive two (2) consecutive days off in each sevenday period. This subsection would not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours program.
Subject to the needs of the department, the department head may offer to employees the opportunity to schedule working hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., provided that the total number of each employee's working hours per day remain unchanged. However, all major departmental offices must remain open between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Upon request of a bargaining unit member, the supervisor may grant, for a specific period of time, a flexible personal work schedule, so long as the bargaining unit member can demonstrate that the proposed schedule will not interfere with or detract from the delivery of services provided or the day to day operation of the department. Request for a flexible work schedule shall not be unreasonably denied.

An employee may not accrue more than two hundred and forty (240) hours of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. Employees who have accrued the maximum amount shall be paid the hourly rate authorized for overtime work. Upon termination or prior to termination, an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the employee's final regular rate of pay.
E.	With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on paid leave status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation. If sick leave is taken in a week of mandatory overtime, an employee may substitute three (3) days per year of alternate time (vacation, holiday, compensatory, or personal) time and up to two (2) days per year of sick time (with medical evidence provided). However, this will not be implemented until the Labor/Management Committee develops guidelines.
F.	There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of the premium pay for overtime work provided for in this Agreement.

18

2.	When the spouse, child, or parent of either an employee or their spouse or their domestic partner or a relative living in the immediate household of an employee is seriously ill, the employee may utilize sick leave credits up to a maximum of sixty (60) days per calendar year except that in cases of demonstrated medical emergency or life threatening/terminal illness, the sixty (60) day maximum may be waived by the CEO or designee;
3.	When through exposure to contagious disease, the presence of the employee at his/her work location would jeopardize the health of others;

E.
1.	Whenever the Appointing Authority has reason to believe that sick leave is being abused, the Appointing authority may require satisfactory medical evidence from the employee. This request shall be reduced to writing and shall cite specific reasons for the request. When medical evidence is requested, such request shall be made as promptly as possible. To the extent practicable, the employee shall receive prior notice that the Appointing Authority believes the employee is abusing sick leave and may be required to produce medical evidence for future use of sick time.
2.	Satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by a licensed Physician, Physician’s Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Chiropractor or Dentist that he/she has personally examined the employee and shall contain the nature of the illness or injury, a statement that the employee was unable to perform the duties of the job due to specific illness or injury on the days in

In cases where the employee is absent due to a family or household illness or injury, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by the medical personnel mentioned above indicating that the person in question has been determined to be ill and needing care on the days in question. In the case of a child who is sent home from school or day care, a statement provided by a licensed day car provider, a school nurse, if there is no nurse, a school official will be sufficient to excuse the first day of absence.
3.	A medical statement provided pursuant to this Article shall be on the letterhead of the attending physician or medical provider as mentioned above and shall list an address and telephone number.

3.	Injury while in the employment of the Employer in the line of duty, and for which said employee would be entitled to receive Workers' Compensation benefits.

K.	Notification of absences under this Article must be given to the designated representative of the appointing authority prior to the beginning of the scheduled tour of duty and if the department head requires, at least one-half (1/2) hour prior to the beginning of the scheduled tour of duty. If such notification is not made, such absence may, at the discretion of the appointing authority, be applied to absence without pay. Where the department head requires a half-hour notice, each unit member will be duly informed of the person to be notified or the telephone number to be called. This notification period may be waived in extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the employee.
L.	No employee shall be entitled to a leave under the provisions of this Article in excess of the accumulated sick leave credits due such employee (including any sick leave bank provisions).

Any employee, upon retiring, may donate up to ten (10) days to the sick leave bank.
N.	Sick leave credits earned by an employee following a return to duty after a leave without pay or absence without pay shall not be applied retroactively to such period of leave.
O.	An employee who while in the performance of his/her duty receives bodily injuries resulting from acts of violence of patients or prisoners in his/her custody, and who as a result of such injury would be entitled to benefits under Chapter 152 of the General Laws, shall, if entitled under Chapter 30, Section 58 of the General Laws, be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he/she would be entitled under said Chapter 152 and his/her regular salary without such absence being charged against available sick leave credits, even if such absence may be for less than six (6) calendar days.

ARTICLE 10 SICK LEAVE BANK
A Sick Leave Bank shall be maintained at the University, if 50% of the unit members subscribe to such bank or a minimum of one hundred (100) days is donated by the unit members, whichever is less. Such bank shall be maintained for the benefit of all those members of the bargaining unit who shall have chosen, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to become a member thereof. Any employee who is a member of this bank on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain a member thereof subject to the terms and conditions of this section. A unit member from UMass Extension, who was a member of the Non-Unit Sick Leave Bank on October 4, 1995, shall automatically become a member of the USA/MTA Sick Leave Bank without further contribution.
During the months of October, February and May, an employee who is not already a member of the Sick Leave Bank may become a member by assigning one (1) or more full days of his/her personal sick leave accumulation to the Bank; provided, however, that on the date of making such assignment the employee shall have accumulated not fewer than three (3) days of personal sick leave.
A member of the Sick Leave Bank shall be eligible to draw upon the Bank five working days after the exhaustion of the member's personal sick leave, personal leave, and any compensatory time accumulation, and all but ten (10) days of accrued vacation leave. Once an employee has used up leave in accordance with this section, they shall immediately be eligible to draw days from the Sick Leave Bank.
The Sick Leave Bank shall be administered by a joint labor-management committee with equal representation between unit members and the administration. In order to maintain membership in the Sick Leave Bank, members must donate one (1) or more full days each year if the balance in the Sick Leave Bank is less than two (2) times the number of Sick Leave Bank members. If, however, the balance of days in the Sick Leave Bank is greater than two (2) times the number of members in the Sick Leave Bank, the annual assessment of days shall cease until such time as the balance of days in the Sick Leave Bank is less than the number of members. Any member of the Bank wishing to remain a member thereof and who has exhausted his/her personal sick leave accumulation shall assign such additional full day or days as of the date on which such member is next entitled to personal sick leave. The Sick Leave Bank Committee shall be authorized to establish the schedule for determining if and when the annual assessment will occur.
To be approved to draw from the Sick Leave Bank, a Sick Leave Bank member must submit a completed Sick Leave Bank Application form completed and signed by a physician, which states the nature of the employee’s illness or disability and its anticipated duration. The Sick Leave Bank member must also submit a written statement requesting to use the Sick Leave Bank.
After review and a majority affirmative vote by the Sick Leave Bank Committee, a unit employee may draw upon the Bank. The Sick Leave Bank Committee shall determine the period of time the member may draw from the Bank. After an employee has drawn from the Bank for the approved period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, his/her case shall be reviewed by the Sick Leave Bank Committee upon the written request of the employee. The employee must provide additional medical documentation to support the continuation of Sick Leave Bank use. The Sick Leave Bank Committee may, by majority affirmative vote,
28
authorize the employee to continue drawing on the Bank. The duration of each participation shall be determined by a majority affirmative vote of the Sick Leave Bank Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee drawing on the Sick Leave Bank may at any time be disqualified from continuing to draw on the Bank by majority vote of the Sick Leave Bank Committee.
Any personal vacation leave, sick leave or personal leave which accrues to an employee during a period in which he/she is drawing on the Sick Leave Bank shall be credited automatically to the Sick Leave Bank.
The Sick Leave Bank is intended to be used for short term disabilities where the employee has a reasonable expectation of returning to work. It is not meant as a substitute for long term disability income protection.
An employee who is hired into the unit covered by this Agreement, from a position at another Institution of Higher Education where he/she was an active member of the Sick Leave Bank may, within thirty (30) days of the date of such hire, become a member of the Bank at the University by assigning one or more full days of personal sick leave to the Bank.
Benefits under this Article shall be prorated for part-time employees.

ARTICLE 17 VACANCIES AND PROMOTIONS
Section 1.
A.	The appointing authority is recognized as the sole authority to appoint an applicant to a vacant position. When the appointing authority determines that a vacancy is to be filled, it will be published in the "Yellow Sheet" as outlined in Article 17D.
Appointments shall be published within ten (10) calendar days following the appearance of the appointee's name on the payroll register and in accordance with the further provisions of Article 17D. The appointing authority will not be obligated to consider an application for a position from an employee who has not submitted his/her request, nor registered under the current blanket policy of the appointing authority, on or before the seventh (7th) calendar day after the vacancy is posted.
B.	For the purpose of this Article, promotion shall be defined as an appointment to a position of a higher job grade; a change in job title without a change in job grade shall be considered a lateral appointment.
Section 2.
All applications for a vacant position shall be divided into priority subgroups a, b, c, and d respectively. The University Employment Office shall send at one time all groups of applicants for a vacant position to the appointing authority. Only after the review, which will include interviews where appropriate, of each group has been completed and no sufficiently qualified candidate has been selected, may the appointing authority look at and review the applications of the next group. The appointing authority shall hold the applications and shall consider each group in the following order of priority:
Subgroup a- The applications of bargaining unit employees and other applicants within the targeted pool as defined by the appointing authority’s affirmative action program, only if the position has been targeted by the appointing authority’s affirmative action program.
Subgroup b - The applications of non-probationary employees within the bargaining unit.
Subgroup c - The applications of probationary unit members.
Subgroup d - The applications of non-bargaining unit persons.
In making selections from within a priority sub-group, campus seniority will govern where upon review by the appointing authority ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. Any determinations made by the appointing authority concerning the filling of vacancies from among bargaining unit applicants in subgroups a, b, and c shall be grievable to Step 4, but shall not be arbitratable. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of another bargaining unit employee then the reason for bypassing the bargaining unit employee's seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only bargaining unit members in subgroup a may grieve appointments to targeted positions.
44
Section 3
In filling vacancies campus seniority will govern where, upon review by the appointing authority, the ability, experience, training, and education of the applicants are equal. In the event the appointing authority fills a vacancy by appointing a non-bargaining unit applicant and such appointment results in bypassing the campus seniority of a bargaining unit applicant then the reasons for bypassing the bargaining unit employee's seniority, if requested, shall be given in writing to the employee. Only a senior bargaining unit member who has been bypassed shall have the right to request such information. Under these circumstances, the appointing authority's determination may be grieved and processed through arbitration. In the event arbitration is invoked hereunder, the arbitrator's authority shall be limited to reviewing, consistent with the criteria set forth herein, the appointing authority's determination that the qualifications of the successful and unsuccessful candidates are not equal. In no event shall an arbitrator have authority to review or reverse the appointing authority's determination under Section 2 hereof that applicants within a particular priority subgroup are not sufficiently qualified. A unit member may grieve his/her non-selection for a position only to Step 4 of the grievance process if such position was awarded to another unit member.
Section 4.
The Employer shall use reasonable efforts to answer requests for information regarding the search and selection procedure submitted by the senior unit member who has been bypassed and makes such request pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 and requests made in the investigation of a grievance filed under Section 2 or Section 3.

A.	An employee who is appointed to a different position shall serve a three (3) month trial period from the effective date of the appointment. In no case, however, shall this trial period expire prior to the completion of six (6) months of continuous employment from the most recent date of hire.
B.	During this trial period, if the employee's work performance in the new assignment is not satisfactory to the CEO said employee shall revert back to his or her former position. This matter may be a proper subject for the Grievance procedure.
C.	If the employee is not satisfied with the new position, he/she may elect to return to the former position within thirty (30) days after said new appointment.
D.	All appointments made related to this section shall be temporary or provisional appointments at least until the completion of the trial period. All vacancies resulting from an employee's appointment pursuant to this section shall be filled temporarily or provisionally at least until the appointed employee has completed his/her trial period. The employer shall notify all employees of this provisional appointment trial period.

B.	A temporary employee who has completed their term of appointment before three (3) years have elapsed may be separated from the University without recourse to Articles 22, except as provided herein, and Article 26.

Whenever an employee requests a change of workweek schedule or shift, approval of such request shall not be unreasonably withheld if a vacancy exists in the classification on a workweek schedule or shift other than that which he/she is then working, provided the employee has sufficient classification seniority and, in the judgment of the appointing authority, is able to adequately perform the duties of the vacancy.
51
ARTICLE 18 CONTRACTING OUT
When the contracting out of work which will result in the layoff of employees, who perform the function that will be contracted out, is contemplated, but prior to its implementation, a Special Labor Management Committee will be established to advise the CEO on the contracting out of personnel services.

Said Committee shall examine cost effectiveness, quality of work, impact on career development, availability of positions within the University for which any laid-off employee may be qualified and the availability of applicable training programs and make appropriate recommendations to the CEO.
When the decision to implement the contracting out is finalized, the appointing authority will notify the Association and discuss the decision and the availability of positions within the University for which the laid-off employee is determined to be qualified and the availability of any training programs which may be applicable to the employee. In reviewing these placement possibilities, every effort will be made to seek matches of worker skills and qualifications with available, comparable positions.

CLASS REALLOCATIONS
Section 1.
Class reallocations may be requested by the Association whenever it believes a reallocation is justified by the existence of an inequitable relationship between the positions covered by the reallocation requests and other positions covered by this Agreement.

If, however, the parties are unable to reach agreement, the matter shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 2.
The appointing authority and the Association agree that the procedure provided in Section 1 shall be the sole procedure for class reallocation for all classes covered by this Agreement and no other class reallocations shall be granted.

ARTICLE 22 LAYOFF AND RECALL
Section 1. Definition of Layoff
A.	Layoff shall be defined as the reduction of the work force due to lack of work, lack of funds, or curtailment of programs and shall not mean a termination. The appointing authority agrees that no unit employee will be laid off in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Employees hired with a minimum commitment of thirty-five (35) weeks per year shall be laid off in accordance with their employment agreement. The terms of this Article shall not apply to employees paid from grant, contract or institute funds. Such employees, however, shall receive a thirty day notice of impending layoff unless a predetermined date for the end of employment has been established and shall be placed in the on campus call back pool for two years pursuant to section G. The terms of this Article shall not apply to probationary employees.
B.	The appointing authority agrees that it will hold a layoff meeting with the Association to discuss the impact of pending layoffs and to explore alternatives for laid off employees. Upon notification, the Association shall make itself promptly available for such meeting.
Layoffs shall be conducted by job classification on the basis of the employee's campus seniority provided the employee retained has the ability to perform the job. In the event of a layoff within a job classification, probationary employees within that job classification shall be laid off first with regard to their individual periods of employment. Non-probationary employees shall be next to be laid off.
D.
a)	Employees who are on layoff shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employee recalled has the ability to perform the job.
b)	Employees who would have been laid off except that they exercised their options under Sections F and G and accepted positions in lower graded classifications from the one they held before the layoffs shall be recalled to available jobs in their classification in accordance with their campus seniority, in the reverse order from which they were laid off provided the employees recalled have the ability to perform the job. Said employees shall retain the right to be recalled for one year from the date of their layoff.
E.	Layoff in excess of three (3) continuous months shall not be credited or accrued towards seniority for any purpose.
F.	In the event a non-probationary employee is scheduled to be laid off, and there exists a position in an equal or lower- graded classification which either the employee has previously held on campus, or where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the requirements of the employee in his/her present position and which the employee can perform after a standard orientation period, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such employees to bump one of the three least senior individuals in such a classification covered by this Agreement provided that
57
that individual’s seniority does not exceed that of the employee scheduled to be laid off.
a)	An employee scheduled to be laid off from a clerical unit position shall first seek to bump one of the three least senior individuals in his/her current classification. If there is no position available or if the bump is denied, he/she may next seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump one of the three least senior employees in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal requirements of the employee’s present position.
b)	An employee scheduled to be laid off from a technical or administrative unit position may initially choose to bump one of the three least senior individuals who is either in his/her current classification, in a lower graded position he/she has previously held on campus or who is in a position where the regular duties of the position are basically similar to the normal duties of the employee’s present position. If a position in the selected category is not available or the bump is denied, he/she may then choose to bump one of the three least senior employees in his/her choice of the two remaining categories. If that position is unavailable or the bump is denied, he/she may seek to bump the least senior employee from the remaining category.
c)	For purposes of this Article, the regular duties of a position are those listed on the Form 30 for that position provided the duties described on the Form 30 do not exceed the level, tenor and complexity of the state specification. The University shall provide Form 30’s when the Association makes a specific request for good reason.
G.	In the event an employee is scheduled to be laid off, or is on layoff status as set forth in Article 23 (D) and there exists a vacant position in the bargaining unit which has been certified for filling in an equal or lower-graded classification, campus seniority shall prevail in permitting such an employee to fill such position, provided the employee can perform the work. Any employee in such category shall have their name forwarded for any vacant position prior to Article 17 being applicable.
H.	Employees to be laid off will be notified of such layoff in writing, as soon as practicable, but in no event less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the layoff. The Association will be sent a list, from the appointing authority, of the employees being laid off at the same time as the written notices are given to the employees. The University will provide, within five (5) calendar days, the Form 30’s and other information necessary for an employee scheduled to be laid off to make an informed decision on bumping options.
I.	In the event of layoff, the Division of Human Resources shall make every reasonable effort to obtain preferential treatment during the layoff period for the affected employee(s) in enrolling in training courses offered by the University.
58
J.	Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, Association stewards, in the event of a layoff, shall be offered the first open job in the bargaining unit which they can perform in their specific district. Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, eleven Association officials, including the grievance officer, chief stewards and the most senior stewards shall, in the event of a layoff, continue to be employed at all times, provided they can perform the duties of any available bargaining unit positions.
59
ARTICLE 23 SENIORITY
Section 1.	Definition of Seniority.
Seniority is defined as the length of time an employee in a full time or regular part time position has been continuously employed from the last date of hire by the campus notwithstanding the source of funding.
Section 2.	Extension of Seniority.
In the case of institute, grant or contract employees, seniority for the purpose of applying for vacant positions shall be extended two (2) years beyond the actual expiration date of the then current funding source.
Section 3.	Termination of Seniority.
An employee's seniority shall be terminated and his/her rights under this Agreement forfeited for the following reasons:
A.	Discharge for cause, resignation or retirement.
B.	Exceeding an authorized leave of absence unless excused by the appointing authority.
C.	Failure to return to work within three (3) calendar days after notification of recall from layoff by the appointing authority. Such notice shall be by registered mail to the last address furnished to the Campus by the employee.
D.	If an employee is laid off for a continuous period of two (2) years or his/her length of service, whichever is less.
E.	If an employee gives a false reason for a leave of absence.
F.	Acceptance of a settlement for total and permanent disability.

A grievant shall institute the grievance procedure
70
of this Article by filing at the appropriate level a written notice that a grievance exists.

Section 5.	Waiver, Admission and Termination
A.	Waiver - Failure of a grievant to comply with any of the provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to seek resolution of the grievance under the terms of this Agreement. In determining whether there has been any such failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Article, time shall be deemed to be of the essence, and any failure of the grievant to comply with any of the time limits prescribed herein shall be deemed to be such failure to comply with the provisions of this Article; provided, however, that the time limits prescribed herein may be extended in any specific instance by mutual written agreement of the parties.

73
of the Employer/University Administration to respond to any grievance within the specified time limits of this Article shall mean that the grievant(s) or the Association may take the grievance to the next level of the grievance procedure.
B.	Admission - The resolution of a grievance by the Immediate Supervisor, the department head, the CEO, the Chancellor, or any of their designees, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to be an admission by the Employer that the grievance has, for any other purpose or proceeding, standing as a grievance or constitutes an admission of any violation or breach of the terms of this Agreement, or is cognizable or justiciable according to any applicable provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth.
C.	Termination - If any party to this Agreement or any employee shall initiate any proceeding relating to a grievance in any administrative or judicial forum, or pursuant to any administrative procedure adopted from time to time by the Board of Trustees , while a proceeding relating to such grievance is pending under any provision of Section 3 of this Article, such Section 3 proceeding shall terminate as of the date of the initiation of such other proceeding and the grievance procedures aforesaid shall be inapplicable to such grievance.

Section 7.	Application
The parties hereby agree that the provisions of Section 53 of Chapter 30 of the General Laws are, in their entirety, hereby rendered of no force and effect in their application to members of the bargaining unit.
74
ARTICLE 28 PERSONNEL RECORDS
Each employee shall have the right, upon request, to examine and copy all material except that covered by waivers, including any and all evaluations, contained in the official personnel records maintained by the Division of Human Resources concerning such employee. The Association shall have access to an employee's records upon written authorization by the employee involved. Whenever any evaluative material is inserted into the personnel file or records of an employee, such employee shall be promptly notified and given a copy of such material. The Association or any employee may challenge the accuracy or propriety of a personnel evaluation by filing a written statement of the challenge in the personnel file. An employee may file a grievance based on a personnel evaluation which results in a negative action. Upon determination at any Step of the grievance procedure that such material is improperly placed in such employee's personnel records such material shall be removed.
An employee who wishes to have adverse material removed from their University Personnel File may make a written request for such removal to the Labor Relations Administrator. In making a decision as to whether material will be removed, the Administrator shall consider the time which has elapsed since the material was placed in the employee’s file, the employment record of that employee prior to and after the material was placed in the file, and the importance of the material to maintaining necessary information about an employee’s University service. In the case of material that is more than three (3) years old, the decision of the Administrator shall be subject to review through the grievance arbitration procedure as to whether the decision to not remove material was arbitrary and capricious.
A copy of any evaluative or disciplinary material that comes into the campus Human Resources Office for an individual’s personnel file and which does not indicate that a copy was provided to the bargaining unit member or contained the bargaining unit member’s signature, will be sent to the bargaining unit member.
75
ARTICLE 29
EMPLOYEE EVALUATION
Section 1.
Performance evaluations are designed to serve the needs of both the employee and employer. An organized program for employee performance evaluation will:
A.	Improve employee satisfaction and potentially reduce employee absenteeism, turnover, and grievance;
B.	Serve as an important motivational tool and improve the quality of job performance;
C.	Enhance the ability to achieve Affirmative Action goals through improved
supervisor-employee communication;
D.	Base personnel actions on objective, accurate and fair performance appraisals;
E.	Monitor the performance of probationary employees on a timely basis. Performance evaluation is the review and rating of all factors relevant to an employee's effectiveness on the job. It involves observation, guidance, training and open communication between the employee and supervisor. For it to be of significant benefit to both the individual employee and the employer, it should be a continuous process. Performance evaluation should be seen primarily as a developmental tool. It's purpose is to assess an employee's job related strengths and weaknesses and develop his/her competence to the fullest. In a correctly executed evaluation, the supervisor and the employee work together to find the means by which the employee's ability can be strengthened and directed.
Section 2.
A Performance evaluation of an employee shall be made annually by the supervisor within sixty (60) days prior to the anniversary date of initial hire or appointment to the employee’s present position with the exception of a probationary employee who shall be evaluated at the completion of the first three (3) months of probationary service and within one month prior to the completion of the probationary period. For any bargaining unit position in which an employee’s immediate supervisor is not a University employee, the employee’s evaluation shall be independently reviewed by the employee’s University-employed intermediate supervisor. Such evaluation will be recorded in writing on the form attached hereto, as Appendix A and shall be made on the basis of the following criteria:
76
A.	Quality and quantity of work;
B.	Work habits;
C.	Work attitudes;
D.	Working relationships with others;
E.	Supervisory ability (if employee supervises others).
Failure to conduct an evaluation in a timely fashion shall be deemed to mean “Meets Expectations.”
Section 3.
A.	To the extent possible, an employee who may be nearing a “Fails to Meet Expectations” rating shall be counseled by his/her supervisor at least three months in advance of the final stage of the evaluation as to the specific areas that must be improved and what he/she must do to attain a “Meets Expectations” rating.
B.	Each employee shall receive a written copy of his/her evaluation and shall be entitled to discuss the evaluation with his/her immediate supervisor and, if requested, with the supervisor of the next higher level than the immediate supervisor who has been assigned to review the performance evaluation. For the purpose of this article, the term immediate supervisor shall mean an individual who is outside of the bargaining unit.
Upon receipt of a “Fails to Meet Expectations” evaluation the employee shall receive a remedial plan on how to reach a “Meets Expectations” rating.
The re-evaluation period shall be up to 180 days in length. An employee may request to have his/her re-evaluation done at any time during the re-evaluation period with thirty (30) days notice to the supervisor to determine if a “Meets Expectations” rating has been achieved. If an employee receives a “Meets Expectations” evaluation during the re-evaluation period, he/she shall be eligible for the denied Step and/or denied salary increase effective the first full payroll week after the date of receiving the “Meets Expectations” review.
E.	An employee’s rating during the re-evaluation process shall not retard his/her anniversary date for Step purposes.
Section 4.
The Personnel Administrator shall receive all evaluations from the immediate supervisors and shall retain such evaluations, together with any recommendations made on the basis of any such evaluation, and any evidence or materials submitted
77
in support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator or designee shall determine whether a rating of "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations" or "Fails to Meet Expectations" shall apply.
Section 5.
The Personnel Administrator shall receive all evaluations from the immediate supervisors and shall retain such evaluations, together with any recommendations made on the basis of any such evaluation, and any evidence or materials submitted in support of such evaluation, in the respective personnel file of each employee. Upon receipt of an employee's evaluation, the Personnel Administrator and/or designee shall determine whether a rating of "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations" or "Fails to Meet Expectations" shall apply. The point average of an employee, who is eligible to receive a salary rate increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 1, B and C, or a step increase pursuant to Article 14, Section 3, shall be compiled as follows:
-	For a rating of Superior, four (4) points should be granted;
-	For a rating of Above Standard, three (3) points shall be granted;
-	For a rating of Good, two (2) points shall be granted;
-	For a rating of Fair, one (1) point shall be granted;
-	For a rating of Unsatisfactory, zero (0) points shall be granted.
The total number of points shall then be divided by the number of categories rated (exclude not applicable). The result shall be the employee’s point average for salary purposes. A point average of 2.0 or higher shall indicate the employee “Meets Expectations.”
Section 6.
Any evaluation so retained in respect of any employee may be reviewed by such employee in the office of the Personnel Administrator at any reasonable time upon prior written notice. Such employee shall have the right to file a written statement in response to any such evaluation.
Section 7.
A. An employee may not grieve the substance of his/her evaluation, except where such evaluation results in a negative action. A negative action shall include denial of a pay raise or a step increase. Thirty days after the execution of this Agreement, the Labor/Management Committee will meet to discuss alternative ways to appeal a negative evaluation.
78
Employees may grieve the evaluation procedure, as set out in the preceding Sections of this Article, to step four (4) of the grievance procedure.
79
ARTICLE 30 LABOR/MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
There shall be established a Committee at the University to be known as the Labor/Management Committee. Such Committee shall be comprised of six (6) members: three (3) representing the campus administration and three (3) representing the Association. Such representatives shall respectively be appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the campus and the Association. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer of the campus shall designate the chairperson for the local campus administration and the Association shall designate the chairperson for the Association. The purpose of said Committee shall be to discuss matters of mutual concern to the campus and the Association and discussions shall include professional training and career ladders and the impact on employees of technological changes in the workplace. The Labor- Management Committee shall meet within sixty (60) days of the execution of this Agreement and shall meet every other month, unless mutually agreed otherwise, with the position of chairperson alternating between the campus administration and the Association. Both parties may submit items for the agenda to the chairperson at least two (2) weeks in advance of any scheduled Committee meetings. The agenda shall be distributed one (1) week in advance of any scheduled Committee meetings. It is understood that said Committee shall not discuss pending grievances and shall have no power to negotiate, alter, or amend the terms of this Agreement.
80
ARTICLE 31
NO STRIKES/NO LOCKOUT
Section 1.
Neither the Association nor any employee shall engage in, induce, support, encourage, or condone a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by employees.
Section 2.
The Association shall exert its best effort to prevent any violation of Section 1 of this Article and, if such action does occur, to exert its best effort to terminate it.
Section 3.
The Employer agrees not to engage in the lock-out of unit employees.
81
ARTICLE 32
PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION
Section 1.
Proper parking facilities shall be available to the employees covered by this Agreement within reasonable proximity of their regular work location in accordance with the provisions of the University Transportation and Parking Program. The appointing authority shall endeavor to maintain adequate lighting in all parking areas and shall endeavor to maintain adequate security to insure the safety of all employees using campus parking facilities. The appointing authority agrees to discuss with the Association any proposed changes in the Parking and Transportation program and will inform the Association and all employees prior to implementing any such change.
82
ARTICLE 33 SAVINGS CLAUSE
If any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in any manner conflict with, or contravene any federal or state law, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, such provisions shall be considered null and void and shall not be binding on the parties hereto; in such event, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the Employer agrees to reopen negotiations on said issue(s). The provisions of this Article notwithstanding, the parties may, by mutual agreement, upon the request of one or both parties, reopen negotiations on the provisions of this Agreement prior to the expiration date as provided in Article 34.
83
ARTICLE 34 DURATION
This Agreement shall be for the three (3) year period from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2004 and terms contained herein shall become effective on the date of its execution by the parties unless otherwise specified. At the written request of either party, negotiations for a subsequent agreement will be commenced on or after March 1, 2004.
This Agreement will remain in full force and effect until a new Agreement is executed or an impasse in negotiations is reached.

The parties agree that unit members who work for Campus Services (Copy and Label Center, Duplicating Services, Distribution Services, Mail Services, Office and Classroom Supplies, Parking Services and Transit Services) shall be required to wear identification badges during working hours.
Badges need not be worn during meal or rest breaks or while at attendance at campus-wide meetings. Such badges shall have a picture of the employee with his/her first name and department name on the front. The address of the department shall be on the back.
Unit members, in other departments, who currently are required to wear identification badges shall continue to wear such badges in their current format during working hours.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
The University of Massachusetts and the University Staff Association/Massachusetts Teachers Association are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides for employees covered by the terms and conditions of the Agreement to have their salaries directly transferred electronically. Whereas the Association has expressed concern that not all members would be able to avail themselves of the electronic transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:
1)	The University and the Association agree that all employees will have their net salary checks electronically forwarded to an account or accounts selected by the employee.
2)	In the extraordinary event that the Association alleges that an employee cannot comply with the agreement relative to transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or there is no ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employees' work site or home, the Association shall petition the University Human Resource Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption.
3)	The University Human Resource Division shall review the request for Direct Deposit Special Exemption and will notify the Association of its finding.
4)	The parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or the Association relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and, further, that the terms of this Memorandum are not grievable and are not arbitrable.
For the University:
For the Association:
Date_____________________________
Date_______________________________
101
SIDE LETTER 1
The University acknowledges receiving the Association's demand to reopen the prior collective bargaining agreement due to raises given other Unions. The University agrees with the Association to continue to discuss this re-opener during the life of this Agreement. The University agrees to discuss the issue of vacation payment upon death or termination with the Association during the life of this Agreement. If it is determined the limitation on such payment is violative of law the University will amend the contract in accord with such determination.
102
SIDE LETTER 2
ADMINISTRATIVE COMPUTING AND PAYROLL SYSTEMS
The parties acknowledge that the University will be implementing new administrative computing and payroll systems. To ensure that the changes required by these systems are introduced and implemented in the most effective manner, the Union agrees to accept the University’s implementation and changes to business practices, procedures, and functions as are necessary to achieve such implementation (e.g. the change from a weekly to biweekly payroll system). The University and the Union will establish a Special LaborManagement Committee made up of an equal number of Union representatives and Management representatives. This committee shall be the sole forum for the parties to discuss any issues of impact to the bargaining unit arising from the implementation of the systems. The parties will reopen negotiations subject prior to implementing any change which has the effect of reducing a unit member’s pay in any fiscal year.
103
SIDE LETTER 3
PARKING
The University agrees to enter into multi-union negotiations, after the execution of this Agreement, on Amherst campus parking rates. If, in these negotiations, no agreement is reached by May 1, 1999, the University can implement its last best offer without the Union filing a grievance or other action before an administrative agency. If the multi-union negotiations do not take place, the parties to this Agreement agree to resume negotiations on this issue.
