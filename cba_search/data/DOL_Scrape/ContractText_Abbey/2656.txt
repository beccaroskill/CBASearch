104	DUES DEDUCTION
Employees desiring to have the Association dues or agency fees deducted from their paychecks shall sign an authorization for payroll deduction and submit it to the District Payroll Office, with a copy to the Association, no later than September 30. The authorization shall continue in effect from year to year, unless revoked in writing by the employee. Once authorized, the dues or fees shall be deducted from the
6
employee's salary in sixteen (16) equal installments beginning with the second salary paycheck in October of each year.
Teachers hired after September 30 may also authorize dues or agency fees to be deducted in equal installments from their paychecks through the balance of the school year.
The District shall deduct outstanding dues or agency fees from the final paycheck of a teacher terminating his/her employment early.
The Association agrees to indemnify and save the Board harmless against any liability arising from any action taken by the Board to comply with the provisions of this article including reimbursement of any legal fees, back pay, or expenses incurred. This indemnification shall not apply to any claim, demand, suit, or other form of liability which may arise as a result of negligence or willful misconduct by the Board.
105	CONTRACT EXTENSIONS, SPECIAL PROJECT CONTRACTS, AND STIPEND RATES
I.	Compensation for contract extension, for work within the professional training and competence of teachers, shall be calculated at the regular per diem rate of the teacher. Fringe benefits shall accrue at the regular rate. Teachers working less than a standard workday shall be paid an hourly rate. If any hourly rate calculation is required, it shall be determined by dividing the per diem rate by the number of hours in a standard teacher workday (Article 506).
II.	Teachers teaching a classroom of students, within a classroom setting, in a District approved curriculum at an extended day program (e.g., night school, Saturday school) or an extended year program (e.g., regular education summer school), established by the District on or after September 1, 1998, will be paid at the B+O rate of the salary schedule for hours worked. Selection of teachers for extended day/year programs will be made exclusively by the District; however, the District will give first consideration to qualified teachers who submit a letter of interest. The District will pay TRS benefits for all hours worked by bargaining unit members when performing duties under special project contracts.
III.	If participation at a District initiated activity or meeting is voluntary, the District will identify the teachers who will be invited to participate. The District will inform all potential participants in advance of the compensation (if any) and voluntary nature of the activity. If the District offers an amount (stipend) to teachers who voluntarily participate in the activity, it will be fifteen dollars ($15) an hour. The parties agree that this language is not intended to encompass work that has not been considered bargaining unit work in the past practice of the District.
IV.	When the District authorizes payment for teachers to participate in setting up their work areas due to the opening or remodeling of a school, or other significant change in their work area, teachers shall be paid a stipend of fifteen dollars ($15) an hour.
106	PART-TIME TEACHING CONTRACTS
Part-time teachers shall receive the following benefits:
1.	All leave shall be prorated for part-time teachers.
2.	Part-time teachers shall be eligible for prorated insurance coverage.
3.	Part-time teachers shall have the following options for insurance coverage:
7
a.	Elect to be covered full-time by the District health insurance plan and pay a prorated monthly premium for said coverage. The monthly premium shall be the negotiated monthly employee cap plus the employee's share of the monthly cost exceeding the cap; or
b.	Decline to be covered full-time by the District health insurance plan.
4.	For the term of this contract, the District will employ no more than seven (7) part-time teachers working less than half-time.
5.	Part-time teachers hired prior to July 1, 2000, who work half-time or more will not have insurance benefits reduced as a result of this article.
107	STUDENT ACTIVITY SPONSORSHIP
I.	Definition
Student activity sponsorship (SAS) is defined as a separate contract for direct supervision outside of the workday for an activity, club, or sport. There will be no payment for any student activity conducted solely during the duty day.
II.	Conditions
A.	Acceptance of an SAS contract is voluntary. Refusal to accept, or ability or willingness to perform, an SAS contract shall have no bearing on continued building assignment or formal evaluation.
B.	A job description will be developed by the building principal prior to the posting of the position. The job description will be as specific as necessary to meet the needs of the particular building and/or position. A job description will be written for each activity, specifying the qualifications required of the coach or sponsor.
C.	Activities listed in this Agreement are for the purpose of assuring equitable compensation for activities requiring comparable time requirements. Actual activity sponsorships shall be predicated on funds available for student activities and individual building interests.
D.	The SAS sponsor shall be immediately made aware of any formal complaint related to the activity sponsor, activity, and/or its operation.
A teacher may be released from an SAS contract for reasons of health, just cause, or for any reason which is mutually agreed to by the teacher and the building principal. Termination from an SAS contract initiated by the District before completion of the contract is subject to the grievance procedure.
III.	Vacancies and Hiring
Known SAS vacancies for the upcoming school year will be posted no later than May 1, for a minimum of ten (10) workdays. The vacancy may arise due to added positions, resignations, terminations, or the principal's decision not to renew a contract. Should a vacancy occur during a school year, the position may be filled by the building principal on an interim basis and then posted as a vacancy for the upcoming school year.
8
If possible, SAS contracts for the upcoming school year will be signed prior to the end of the current school year. Contracts for new hires will be signed as soon as possible after the beginning of the school term.
When it is not possible for SAS contracts to be signed before the end of the current school year, the principal shall provide prior to the end of the current year, a letter of intent to those SAS sponsors whom the principal intends to retain for the following year. The letter of intent shall include that the retention is expressly contingent upon the continuation of the SAS activity. Absent a letter of intent or a signed contract, nothing herein shall require an SAS sponsor to be retained.
SAS positions will be offered first to qualified, certificated teachers who volunteer. When more than one (1) qualified teacher volunteers for a student activity sponsorship, the principal shall issue the contract to the teacher the principal determines is best qualified to sponsor the activity.
IV.	Contracts
An SAS contract shall be written for each activity. Except in circumstances beyond the District's control, a copy of the completed, signed contract shall be given to the activity sponsor prior to the beginning of the activity.
Contract payments will be made within two (2) District paydays following the completion of services as outlined in the job description, but no later than the last day of the school term. If the contract is for an activity that lasts the entire school year, payment will be made in two (2) equal installments: the first within two (2) District paydays following the end of the first semester and the second within two (2) District paydays following the completion of services as outlined in the job description, but no later than the last day of the school term. Assistant sponsors shall be paid as determined by the building principal. The number of assistants shall be determined by the building principal based upon program needs and budgetary restrictions.
V.	Expense Reimbursement
Activity sponsors shall be reimbursed for all approved expenses incurred on trips related to their activity duties. Activity sponsors shall be provided with a travel advance for all reimbursable expenses to be incurred on District-approved trips related to their activity duties provided the request for the advance is received by the Administrative Services within five (5) working days in advance of the travel. The sponsor shall provide receipts verifying all expenditures to the Administrative Services within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the travel. The sponsor shall refund any money advanced in excess of the amount for which receipts are provided within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the travel. Any reimbursable expenses beyond the amount shall be paid to the sponsor within five (5) working days after the receipts are received by the Administrative Services.
Reimbursement, not to exceed District guidelines for travel, will be made within two (2) District paydays following the presentation of receipts by the sponsor to the immediate supervisor.
VI.	Elementary

The District shall cover all costs of physical examinations required as a condition of employment and that are identified by the District's approved "Physical Examination Record" form. Teachers may go to the physician of their choice, but reimbursement by the District will be limited to costs negotiated between the District and local clinics.
Only a statement of ability to perform teaching duties will go into the teacher's medical file. The teacher's exam form shall be kept on file at the doctor's office.
109 HEAD TEACHER REIMBURSEMENT
Head teachers shall be compensated six hundred dollars ($600) for each, plus one (1), certificated employee. The compensation rate shall be prorated in accordance with the time the certificated employee is assigned to the building, e.g., a half-time certificated employee would result in a compensation rate of three hundred dollars ($300).
110 PAYMENT OPTIONS
I.	Paydays
Teachers will be paid on either the first or second Friday districtwide payday, as determined by the District, following the beginning of the school term and on subsequent districtwide paydays [every two (2) weeks].
If a payday falls on a holiday or districtwide inservice day, the payday will move to the preceding workday.
If a payday falls within winter break, payment will be deposited/mailed to the employee on the regularly scheduled payday.
If a payday falls within spring break, payment will be deposited no later than the regularly scheduled payday, or delivered to the work location that following Monday.
II.	Nine (9) or Twelve (12) Month Pay Option
Teachers may choose to be paid in equal installments in a manner reflecting a nine (9) or twelve (12) month division of pay.
Teachers must indicate their choice on a form provided by the District and may review their selection annually. Teachers wishing to change their choice must fill out a District form and submit it to the Payroll Office the week prior to the start of school. When the twelve (12) month option is chosen the balance of the teacher's contract shall be paid on the last districtwide payday of the school term.
III.	Automatic Deposits
All teachers hired after June 30, 2005, will have their paychecks automatically deposited in one or more financial institutions of their choosing. Teachers hired before July 1, 2005,
11
may maintain their present method of payment. The request will be made on a form provided by the Payroll Office. Provided all information on the auto deposit form is validated by the financial institution(s), the automatic deposit should commence the second payday following the submission of the request. Teachers wishing to change the automatic deposit arrangement must notify the Payroll Office by using an approved form. Changes are subject to the same validation process discussed above and should commence on the second payday following submission of the change request.
111	HEALTH INSURANCE
Subject to any changes which may be implemented by the Joint Committee, as defined herein, the District agrees to provide the health insurance coverage in effect July 2005 for each employee and dependents beginning the first day of the month following employment and continuing until employment termination. It is further agreed that the same coverage will be extended until August 31 for any terminating teacher who holds and completes a full year contract.
Terminating teachers who qualify for health coverage under the Alaska Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) do not qualify for health coverage under the District's plan.
An employee has the option to continue health insurance coverage at his/her own expense during a longterm leave of absence. Nothing in this provision is intended to supersede provisions of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as it applies to the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District.
A Joint Committee on Health Benefits shall be composed of three (3) representatives selected by the Fairbanks Education Association, three (3) representatives selected by the Education Support Staff Association, one (1) representative selected by the Fairbanks Principals' Association, the Fairbanks North Star Borough Risk Manager as a non-voting member, and three (3) representatives selected by the Superintendent. The Joint Committee shall select a chairperson from its membership. A quorum for the meetings shall require no fewer than seven (7) committee members. The Committee will conduct a formal vote on any proposed changes in benefits. Minutes shall be taken of the meetings.
The Joint Committee shall be empowered to determine health care benefits to be provided, which shall be formalized through memorandum of agreement between the District and a designated representative of each affected employee group. "Health care benefits" shall include dates of eligibility for coverage, benefit schedules, deductibles, co-payment provisions, preferred provider programs, wellness programs, and other options designed to enhance benefit options while containing costs. The District shall not be required to adopt changes made by this committee which would:
a.	result in violations of established laws or regulations;
b.	alter the administration or management of health care benefits and life insurance benefits;
c.	result in a cost increase to the District of more than five percent (5%) over the negotiated
per month per employee figure; or
d.	be detrimental to the financial interests of the District, as determined by the Superintendent.
The Joint Committee shall be subject to the further limitation that for the 2005-06 school year the District agrees to pay up to five hundred forty dollars ($540) per month per employee, and for the 2006-07 school year the District agrees to pay up to five hundred fifty dollars ($550) per month per employee, and for the 2007-08 school year the District agrees to pay up to five hundred sixty dollars ($560) per month per employee for health care benefits and life insurance benefits.
Except for the transition period, the negotiated monthly cap of a prior fiscal year will be used to determine the employee contribution to insurance costs for the following plan year, i.e., the 2005-06 negotiated monthly cap will be used to calculate the amount of the employee’s monthly contribution in the plan year beginning January 1, 2007. Should the average monthly rate per employee exceed the
12
monthly cap, for a July to June twelve (12) month period, the additional cost shall be borne equally between the employee and the District over nineteen (19) pay periods.
Transition Period: The 2004-05 negotiated monthly cap of five hundred forty dollars ($540) will be used to determine the monthly employee contribution to insurance costs from September 2005 through December 2006. Any amounts due shall be deducted in nineteen (19) equal installments during the months of September 2005 through May 2006 and nine (9) equal installments during the months of September 2006 through December 2006.
Health care costs are composed of claims paid, the costs of administering the health care plan by the third party administrator or its successor(s), aggregate and specific stop-loss premiums, utilization review fees, case management costs, independent medical examinations, health program audit rewards, Tanana Valley PA Clinic, PATH initiative costs, COBRA premium receipts, refunds, consultant fees, life and accidental death insurance premiums, and any added costs resulting from changes in the administration of the health and life insurance program agreed to by the parties during the term of the collective bargaining agreement or due to any requirement imposed by state or federal law. For purposes of calculating costs above the monthly cap, the employee monthly rate shall be determined by a three (3) year average of the actual plan expenses reported to the plan administrator, Welfare and Pension Administrative Services, Inc. or its successor.
The District agrees to work with the Joint Committee to provide reasonable time for meetings and provide adequate support, including an expert health care consultant for plan design. Administrative leave will be provided for all participants. Should health care costs for the District remain below the negotiated monthly cap per employee for a July to June twelve (12) month period, any such savings shall be applied as the Joint Committee may determine to offset future year expenses and/or provide additional benefits.
The District shall provide each employee with a copy of the Summary Plan Description for health care benefits and shall inform employees of any changes in benefits.
112	LIFE INSURANCE
The District shall provide group life insurance for each member of the bargaining unit in an amount equal to the teacher's annual salary rounded up to the nearest thousand. The policy shall include a double indemnity provision.
A teacher has the option to continue life insurance coverage at his/her own expense during a long-term leave of absence.
200	UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE
201	GENERAL PROVISIONS
I.	Unpaid leaves of absence are: 202 Disability Leave; 203 Child Care Leave;

Deadlines for applying for leave are set forth in Articles 202-205 of this article, under each specific leave.
II.	Conditions
A.	All leaves shall be without pay or fringe benefits, provided however, that the District will maintain a teacher's health insurance coverage if required to do so by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). A teacher on unpaid leave may purchase health and life insurance to the extent allowed by the District's insurance
13
carrier. There is no intent that a teacher on unpaid leave apply for or receive unemployment insurance benefits.
B.	Seniority shall accrue as if the teacher remained on paid status.
Salary increments and sick leave will accrue or not accrue in accordance with this collective bargaining agreement.
III.	Return Provisions
A.	Short-Term Leave
If unpaid leave of absence is thirty (30) or fewer working days of one (1) school year, then the following return provision shall apply:
The teacher shall return to work on the next working day following the expiration date of the leave to the position he/she held prior to the commencement of the leave.
B.	Long-Term Leave
If an unpaid leave of absence extends for more than thirty (30) working days to two (2) school years, then the following return provisions shall apply:
1.	The teacher shall return to work on the first teacher workday of the school year as established by the Board following the school year in which the leave was taken, except for disability leave when the teacher shall return on the date established by the doctor's statement.
2.	The teacher shall notify the Human Resources Department of the District in writing by February 15 of the school year in which the leave was taken, if he/she wishes to return to active employment with the District on the first teacher workday of the following school year. If the unpaid leave commenced after March 1 then the notification date shall be June 1. Failure to give such notice shall be treated as a voluntary resignation.
3.	Teacher Returning from a Leave of Absence of One (1) or Two (2) Years or Limited Term Assignment
a.	Should the District be aware on or before May 15 of the need to reduce the staff in a particular building for the following year, the District will contact any teacher who has been granted leave to determine whether the teacher wishes to rescind his/her leave request. If the teacher does not wish to rescind his/her leave, the teacher may apply for a voluntary transfer for the following school year or the District will place the teacher in a position.
b.	A teacher who gives written notice, prior to February 15 of his/her intent to return to active status for the forthcoming school term shall be entitled to reclaim the position he/she had prior to the limited term assignment or leave of absence provided that the limited term assignment or leave of absence has been for a period of one (1) school year or less, and provided that the building staff has not been reduced and the District has been able to fill the position through a one (1) year only assignment during the
14
teacher's leave. A returning teacher is no more or less subject to involuntary reassignment than any other teacher.
c.	A teacher who returns from a leave of absence or limited term assignment longer than one (1) school year may apply for voluntary transfer. If a position is not obtained through voluntary transfer, the District will place the teacher in a position for the following school year.
202 DISABILITY LEAVE
Upon the recommendation of the teacher's physician, a leave of absence shall be granted for up to one (1) school year, plus any unfinished school year. The request for leave shall be in writing and be accompanied by a physician's statement setting forth the specific illness or disability, the date the teacher's disability commenced, or will commence, and the expected length of the absence. If an employee has already been on leave without pay status due to the same disability, the disability leave will commence on the date the employee went into leave without pay status. Prior to the commencement of a disability leave a teacher's sick leave benefits under this contract must have been exhausted. If a teacher requesting disability leave is considered an eligible employee under FMLA, the District will maintain the teacher's health insurance coverage consistent with the FMLA, for up to twelve (12) weeks of the disability leave. The twelve (12) weeks of paid health insurance coverage will be reduced by any weeks of sick leave that the employee has taken for this same purpose.
203 CHILD CARE LEAVE
A leave of absence without pay may be requested and shall be granted to a teacher for the purpose of caring for a newborn or newly adopted child. The leave of absence without pay for a newly adopted child may include such time as may be necessary, as approved by the Superintendent, to finalize the adoption and/or to have the child placed in the care and custody of the adopting teacher.
Requests for child care leave shall be made thirty (30) days prior to the expected date of the birth or adoption of the child. If the date of birth or adoption requires leave to begin in less than thirty (30) days, the teacher shall provide notice as soon as practicable. Child care leave shall begin when the child is born or received unless the employee is eligible for sick leave under Article 306 of this Agreement, in which case child care leave will begin following the period of sick leave.
Child care leave must be taken within twelve (12) months after the child's birth or placement, in a single block of time. If a teacher requesting child care leave is considered an eligible employee under FMLA, the District will maintain the teacher's health insurance coverage consistent with the FMLA, for up to twelve (12) weeks of the child care leave. Spouses who are both employed by the District will be limited to a combined total of twelve (12) weeks of paid health insurance coverage within any twelve (12) month period, for purposes of leave taken for child care. The length of the child care leave shall be for twelve (12) weeks, or the teacher may continue child care leave for the balance of the first semester or the balance of the current school year. When less than thirty (30) days remain in the balance of the current school year, then the teacher may request the leave be extended through the entire first semester of the next school year or the entire next school year. Such request shall be granted if made at the commencement of the teacher's leave.
204 LEAVE TO HOLD ELECTED OFFICE
Leave requests to hold elected office must be submitted by the employee by the date of required filing to run for public office. The leave shall not exceed two (2) complete school years.

300	PAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE
301	LEGAL LEAVE
A teacher called for jury duty shall be granted leave with pay. A teacher subpoenaed during the school year by a court or administrative agency or for an informal dispute resolution hearing appointed pursuant to court order to give testimony in a criminal or civil case in which the teacher is a victim of an alleged felony or to which the teacher is not a party will receive full compensation at the employee's contracted per diem rate.
A teacher subpoenaed during the school year by a court or administrative agency or for an informal dispute resolution hearing appointed pursuant to court order to give testimony in a criminal or civil case to which the teacher is a party will receive leave without pay.

Any witness or jury fees received will be remitted to the District.
Should the teacher be released by the court prior to the end of his/her duty day and if a meaningful portion of the teacher's duty day remains, the teacher shall return to his/her place of duty.
302 SABBATICAL LEAVE
The District agrees to grant at least one (1) sabbatical leave for one (1) full school term or two (2) consecutive semesters or for one (1) semester, if at least one (1) is recommended by the sabbatical leave committee and is approved by the Superintendent. The sabbatical leave committee will include the FEA President or his/her designee. Request for sabbatical leaves must be submitted to the District Human Resources Department by October 15 prior to the school year for which the leave is requested. All sabbatical leave recipients shall be paid by the Board one-half ('/z) of their regularly scheduled salary during the term of such leave.

3.	The employer TRS contribution based on one-half (^) of the regularly scheduled salary. (The employee may pay to the Alaska State Department of Administration the outstanding TRS amounts for both employer and employee so as to attain a full year of TRS credit towards retirement.)
The teacher shall retain sick leave and personal leave accumulated prior to his/her sabbatical, but shall not accrue sick leave or personal leave while on sabbatical.
In the case of sabbatical leaves the teacher must return to duty no later than the start of the semester following completion of the sabbatical year and must fulfill at least one (1) year of duty thereafter or be subject to repayment of sabbatical leave funds.
Upon return from sabbatical leave, the employee may be assigned to district-wide duties for one (1) semester, so that the expertise acquired during his/her sabbatical year may be used as a resource.
303 PERSONAL LEAVE
Three (3) days of personal leave per year, accumulative to a maximum of ten (10) days, shall be granted to all teachers. No more than six (6) days of personal leave may be used in any school year.
Except in emergencies, teachers shall give at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice to their immediate supervisors of their intent to be absent on paid personal leave. In order to assure continuity of the educational program, principals may deny requests for paid personal leave if the number of teachers requesting such leave for any day exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the teaching staff in any one (1) building. Personal leave shall not be approved for: days scheduled as teacher inservice days; district-required, standardized testing days during the second semester; or for parent-teacher conference days. The Superintendent, at his/her sole discretion, which shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration, may grant an exception for personal leave use during parent-teacher conference days. Personal leave may be used, subject to the above conditions, on days scheduled as teacher workdays only when all required grades or required paperwork has been completed and turned in to the responsible authority.
In small schools at least one (1) teacher may be absent on personal leave. [Definition: A small school is fewer than five (5) teachers including head teacher.]
At the end of the school year, at the teacher's option, a teacher may be paid two hundred dollars ($200) for each day of unused accrued personal leave. Each day cashed in shall then be deducted from the teacher's account. Teachers who provide irrevocable notice of retirement or resignation prior to February 15 may cash in all accrued personal leave at his/her per diem rate. Cash-in shall be for full workdays only. A teacher must notify the District's Payroll Office in writing by May 1 of his/her desire to cash in personal leave.
304 TRAVEL DELAY
When a teacher is on a personal trip outside of the Fairbanks North Star Borough and his/her return to the Fairbanks North Star Borough is delayed by transportation difficulties beyond his/her control, no disciplinary action may be taken against the teacher. The burden shall be upon the teacher to establish that the delay was beyond his/her control. The teacher's absence under these circumstances will be charged to personal leave. If the teacher has insufficient personal leave to cover the absence, the time will be charged to administrative leave and the teacher shall pay the District for the cost of any substitute used to cover the teacher's absence.
When a teacher on District authorized business is delayed by transportation difficulties beyond his/her control, time absent from the job will be charged to administrative leave.
17
305
MILITARY LEAVE
The District shall grant leave to teachers who are ordered to training duty (as distinguished from active duty) in the National Guard or other military reserve units, if postponement to the summer months is not possible.
A teacher on military leave shall receive his/her regular pay for a period not to exceed two (2) weeks within a given school year and shall remit to the District any stipend received as compensation for such duty.
Military leave in excess of two (2) weeks shall be considered as leave without pay.
306 SICK LEAVE
I.	Allocation
All regularly contracted certificated personnel working full-time in the District are entitled to sick leave with pay during the school term. The District shall advance the anticipated entitlement of sick leave at the beginning of the school year. Sick leave days used in advance and not earned to date shall be deducted from the teacher's last paycheck should the teacher not fulfill the teaching contract for any reason. Sick leave may be cumulative without limit and is earned at the rate of one and one-third (1 1/3) days per school month, with the last day of each month, the major portion of which the employee has served, considered the sick leave accumulation date.
II.	Transfer of Sick Leave Within Alaska
All newly hired teachers shall be notified that accumulated sick leave from other districts in Alaska is transferable and shall be informed of the procedure to effect such transfer. It is agreed that transfer of earned sick leave within the state of Alaska is a teacher's responsibility and that the District will be held harmless from the results of any unintentional omission of notifications stated above.
III.	Documentation of Need
A.	Required Statement
The District may require that the employee provide, at his/her expense, a licensed health care provider's statement setting forth the date on which an absence due to illness or disability will commence or has commenced and the expected length of the absence, consistent with provisions of FMLA. In the case of a medically related absence due to pregnancy, it is expected that a teacher will comply with this section by providing notice to the District at least one (1) month before the expected date of birth.
B.	District Oversight
If the District has cause to suspect sick leave abuse, or if the District wants to verify that a teacher is sufficiently well to perform teaching duties, the District may require a licensed health care provider's statement, e.g., when sick leave is used in conjunction with weekends or vacation periods or during parent-teacher conferences. In accordance with 4 AAC 15.040, a false statement by a teacher regarding sick leave is sufficient grounds for cancellation of a teacher's contract and recommendation for revocation of his/her teaching certificate.
18
Compensation for sick days shall only be paid the teacher if he/she would have been otherwise scheduled to work, but for the illness or disability.
IV.	Family Leave Provisions
A.	Bereavement for Extended Family
Teachers shall be granted during a school year up to twenty (20) days of accumulated sick leave in any one (1) school year in case of death(s) within the extended family, with no more than ten (10) days of sick leave being used for each such occurrence. The Superintendent, at his/her sole discretion which shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration, may grant sick leave to a teacher upon request, in the case of the death of a person not defined as extended family.
B.	Serious Illness in the Immediate Family
Teachers shall be granted during a school year up to twenty (20) days of accumulated sick leave in any one (1) school year in case of serious illness or accident requiring hospitalization of a member of the immediate family, which requires the presence of the employee, as certified by the attending physician.
C.	Residential Care for Immediate Family
Teachers shall be granted during a school year up to ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave in any one (1) school year in order to place a member of the immediate family in a residential care facility.
D.	Sick Leave for Immediate Family at Home
Teachers shall be granted a maximum of thirty (30) days of sick leave per school year when a member of the teacher's immediate family is ill, and the teacher's presence is required at home. Within the first thirty (30) days of an adoption, a teacher on child care leave under Article 203 of this Agreement may take sick leave if the adopted child is ill and the teacher's presence is required at home. Sick leave for the adoptive parent on child care leave may not extend beyond the initial thirty (30) day period following adoption. Immediate family illness and sick leave for an adopted child under this paragraph may not exceed a total of thirty (30) days.
V.	Family Medical Leave Act Provisions
If a teacher is considered an eligible employee under FMLA and under the Alaska Family Leave Act (AFLA), the teacher will be granted a leave of absence without pay for medical reasons, for up to eighteen (18) weeks during any twenty-four (24) month period as provided in the AFLA, or for up to twelve (12) weeks during a twelve (12) month period as provided under the FMLA. This unpaid leave will be approved upon the occurrence of a serious health condition of the employee or to care for the employee's child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition. During this time, the teacher's health plan coverage will be maintained as if the employee was in paid status for up to twelve (12) weeks of leave, including any sick leave the teacher has taken for the same purpose. Any time the leave extends beyond the twelve (12) weeks, then the employee is subject to pay the monthly premium if the health insurance coverage is continued. Spouses who are both employed by the District will be limited to a combined total of twelve (12) weeks during a rolling twelve (12) month period for purposes of leave taken to care for a child or parent
19
with a serious health condition. The Association and District agree that the provision of health insurance coverage for employees on unpaid leaves for family and medical reasons and all procedures are to be interpreted and applied consistently with the legal duties and responsibilities imposed by state and federal law and regulation, and are no greater.
VI.	Definitions
A.	The "immediate family" is defined as the teacher's spouse, parent, child, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, legal guardian, legal ward, or household member.
B.	The "extended family" is defined as the teacher's spouse, parent, child, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, sibling-in-law, grandparent, grandparent-in-law, grandchild, legal guardian, legal ward, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, household member, or extended family of the household member.
307 SICK LEAVE BANK
I.	Bank Establishment
There is hereby created a Sick Leave Bank which shall be administered by the FEA. The FEA shall indemnify and save the District harmless against any claim by any person or entity arising out of any use or claimed misuse or nonuse of the Sick Leave Bank. This provision shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
II.	Bank Membership
Any teacher is eligible to become a member of the Sick Leave Bank. A teacher may elect to join the Sick Leave Bank by informing the FEA in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of initial employment for newly hired teachers, or during the first thirty (30) days of the school year for current bargaining unit members who are not continuing members of the Sick Leave Bank. Membership in the Sick Leave Bank shall continue from year to year after initial enrollment unless a teacher notifies the District and FEA in writing no later than May 31 regarding his/her intent to withdraw from the Sick Leave Bank for the following school year. An employee electing not to join the Sick Leave Bank shall not be eligible for Sick Leave Bank donations until he/she becomes a member during the next annual Sick Leave Bank enrollment. The Bank shall be administered through the same administrative channels and regulations as for sick leave except as noted in this article.
III.	Bank Enrollment
Teachers will be permitted to transfer a maximum of two (2) days of sick leave during any school year. Unless otherwise specified by the parties, the annual enrollment period shall be the first thirty (30) calendar days of each school year. Following enrollment, one (1) day of sick leave shall be transferred automatically from each member's sick leave account into the Sick Leave Bank. If, at the time of a required contribution, a teacher does not have a day to contribute, the next available day shall be transferred. All leave transferred to the Bank by a teacher is final and not recoverable for recredit to his/her personal sick leave account.
20
IV.	Depletion and Emergency Transfer
During the school year, should the Bank become depleted, FEA will notify the District and all Sick Leave Bank members in writing. Within thirty (30) days after such notice of an emergency Sick Leave Bank drive, one (1) day of sick leave shall be transferred automatically from each member's sick leave account into the Sick Leave Bank. Teachers shall not have the opportunity to initially enroll in the Sick Leave Bank during emergency drives. If at the time of a required contribution a teacher does not have a day to contribute, the next available day shall be transferred.
V.	Year-End Bank Status
If at the end of each school year the remaining number of days in the Bank exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the number of teachers who are members of the Sick Leave Bank, only newly hired teachers and those who were not Bank members the prior year will be permitted to transfer leave to the Bank at the beginning of the following school year.
VI.	Retiring Teacher Contributions
A teacher retiring or resigning may contribute up to six (6) unused sick leave days to the Sick Leave Bank.
VII.	Bank Withdrawal Provisions
A.	Withdrawal Limits
In any school year, a teacher will be permitted to withdraw twenty-four (24) days or twice the number of days of sick leave the teacher has accrued before the start of that school year, whichever is greater. No teacher may withdraw more than sixty (60) days in any school year.
B.	Committee Approval
1.	Requests for withdrawal from the Bank may be approved by the Committee when the following conditions have been satisfied:
a.	All of the teacher's personal sick leave has been exhausted.

D.	Minimum Qualifications
Except in extenuating circumstances, "minimum qualifications" as used herein means possessing a proper endorsement, meeting any applicable legal requirements, and
26
having adequate professional preparation for the position to be filled. Teachers employed to teach courses which lead to student licensing or certification will be required to hold the license or certification as a minimum qualification.

511 BUILDING ACCESS
A procedure shall be developed in each building for teachers to sign out keys or door access cards.
The procedure shall include, as a minimum, a method whereby teachers, upon giving at least three (3) hours notice for school days, or by 1 p.m. on Fridays for weekends, can obtain access to their rooms after school hours.
The principal of each building will determine the number of keys/access cards available to ensure that each teacher desiring building access has access. Reasonable access will be maintained as much as possible; however, the district reserves the right to restrict building access for security needs.
512 WORK RELATED INJURY
I.	Injury Sustained by Assault
Any teacher who has suffered assault* either directly or while intervening in the assault of students of other staff, and incurred in the course of performing employment duties is required to complete an Employee First Aid Injury Report form provided by the District and give to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible. The employee is required to complete a Report of Occupational Injury or Illness form.
Whenever a teacher is temporarily absent from school and temporarily unable to perform his/her duties as a result of an assault either directly or while intervening in the assault of students of other staff, and incurred in the scope and course of employment, the teacher will be paid full salary and benefits less the amount of any workers' compensation payments or payments made for temporary disability. The District's payments will continue for a period equivalent to that of a full contract year beginning on the date of the injury. Such temporary absence will not be counted against accrued sick leave.
*Assault is any willful attempt or threat to inflict injury upon the person of another, when coupled with an apparent present ability to do so, and any intentional display of force such as would give the victim reason to fear or expect immediate bodily harm.
36
II.	Workers' Compensation
An employee who is injured in the course of performing employment duties is required to complete an Incident Report Form provided by the District and Workers' Compensation Claim. The District shall provide workers' compensation benefits prescribed by statute to an employee who sustains an on-the-job injury. Absences caused by job-related injuries shall be charged as sick leave, if sufficient sick leave has been accrued, until such time as the employee qualifies for workers' compensation. For the first sixty (60) days after an employee begins receiving workers' compensation benefits, the employee shall be permitted to use sick or personal leave, if sufficient leave has been accrued, for up to twenty percent (20%) of the employee's guaranteed hours per pay period. In no case shall an employee be entitled to receive an amount that exceeds his/her normal gross pay. The length of time a teacher is in a leave without pay status due to the specific disability shall be up to one (1) school year, plus any unfinished school year. Should the disability continue beyond this time the teacher may, as determined by the District and consistent with applicable law, be terminated, nonretained, or dismissed. Incident Report Forms and Workers' Compensation Claims are to be submitted to the employee's supervisor.
III.	Length of Leave
To determine the length of time during which a teacher is temporarily unable to perform duties and in determining that a disability is attributable to the specific injury involved, the District shall have the right to have a teacher examined by a physician of its own designation. In the event there is an adjudication of the period of temporary disability in the appropriate workers' compensation proceedings, the District may adopt such adjudication.
513 PARKING
Where possible, the District will provide a parking space with a headbolt plug-in for employees. Nothing herein shall require, however, the District to expend money to provide new headbolt plug-ins.
Exterior lights shall normally be on during the hours of darkness when activities and/or a significant number of staff are scheduled to work. Decisions of when to light parking lots will be made with energy management and employee safety as strong considerations.
It is the intention to have building entrances lit when employees are in the building. It is recognized, however, that since teachers may have access to their building during non-custodial hours, building entrance lights and/or parking lot lights may not be lit at all times when teachers are in their buildings.
514 USE OF BREAK AIDES OR VOLUNTEERS
When possible, in the District's determination, the District shall encourage the use of break aides or family and community volunteers to perform traditionally non-instructional duties and provide supervision of students.

37
516
EMERGENCY SCHOOL CLOSURE

517 CLASSROOM USE
Whenever possible, teachers who are assigned to one (1) classroom for the majority of the workday will be given twenty-four (24) hours advance notice when the room will be used by non-District personnel.

II.	Incidents of verbal and/or physical assault of teachers shall be documented by the principal. Principals will report the incident to law enforcement authorities as appropriate.
III.	Teachers shall be informed of assigned students who have a documented history of violent behavior that poses a threat to students and/or staff.

Acting principals or acting head teachers shall not be responsible for evaluation of teachers.
605 SPECIAL EDUCATION MEETINGS
Intervention, eligibility, and Individualized Educational Program (IEP) team meetings for all team functions, shall be scheduled during the teacher workday, excluding preparation time, whenever possible. If parents/guardians cannot attend such meetings during the teacher workday, then the teachers involved will be allowed "time off" equal to the extra time spent for such meetings conducted outside of the teacher workday so long as:
1.	Advance, written notice of such meetings has been given to the teacher's principal. The invitation to the meeting is an acceptable notice.
2.	Within two (2) days after the meeting, the teacher submits to his/her principal written notice of its duration. Email notice may be used.
Failure to provide either notice shall cause the teacher to lose his/her right to any compensatory time off. The teacher and principal shall mutually agree when compensatory time may be taken. A teacher may
39
take compensatory time on building inservices with the agreement of the principal, but compensatory time shall not be used on districtwide inservice days. In addition, a teacher may take compensatory time off on a scheduled workday without student attendance only when all required reports and/or grades have been completed and turned in to the responsible authority.
On the scheduled workdays without student attendance, teachers shall not be required to attend intervention, eligibility, or IEP meetings.
The parties agree that any compensatory time accrued during one (1) school year must be used before the end of the following school year or shall expire.
If a teacher accrues more than fourteen (14) hours of compensatory time during any school year and has not been able to take compensatory time off, the teacher may ask the District's Labor Relations Department to review the feasibility of the teacher using compensatory time. If it is not found to be feasible for the teacher to use compensatory time within a reasonable time, the District will grant the conversion of compensatory time to personal leave on the basis of two (2) days of compensatory time for every day of personal leave.
Converted personal leave days may be cashed out in accordance with Article 303 of this Agreement.

D.	Nothing contained herein shall deny to any teacher his/her rights under the State or Federal Constitution and laws.
V.	Procedure
Informal
The parties in interest acknowledge that it is usually most desirable for a teacher and his/her supervisor to resolve problems through free and informal communication. Accordingly, within ten (10) working days of the time a grievance arises, the teacher, either individually or accompanied by an Association representative, will present the grievance to his/her supervisor. Within five (5) working days after the presentation of the grievance, the supervisor shall give his/her answer orally to the teacher and the Association.
Step 1
1.	Within three (3) days of the oral answer if the grievance is not resolved, it may be stated in writing and lodged with the supervisor who shall arrange for a meeting with the grievant within five (5) days.
2.	The statement of grievance shall name the teacher involved, shall state the facts giving rise to the grievance, and shall state the contention of the teacher and the Association with respect to any violation of this Agreement or the individual employment contract and shall indicate specific relief requested. Within three (3) days after the aforementioned meeting, the supervisor shall communicate his/her answer to the grievant and the Association in writing.
Step 2
1.	If the grievance is not resolved in Step 1, the grievant may, within five (5) days of receipt of the supervisor's answer, submit to the Superintendent or his/her designee a written statement of grievance by the grievant. A copy shall be given to the supervisor involved at the same time.
2.	The Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee shall arrange for a hearing with the grievant to take place within five (5) days of his/her receipt of the appeal. The parties in interest shall have the right to include in the representation any witness necessary to develop facts pertinent to the grievance.
42
3.	Upon conclusion of the hearings, the Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee will have ten (10) days to provide an answer in writing, together with the reasons for the decision to the grievant and the Association.
4.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2 and is an alleged violation of the terms of the individual employment contract, Step 3 may be followed. If the unresolved grievance relates to the terms of the Negotiated Agreement, Step 3, Binding Arbitration, may be followed.
Step 3 Binding Arbitration
1.	If the Association or the Board determines that the grievance involves the interpretation, meaning, or application of any provision of this Agreement, within fifteen (15) school days after the receipt of the decision by the Superintendent or his/her designee in Step 2, Item 3, the Association or the Board, upon written notice to the other, may submit the grievance to arbitration under and in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. If any question arises as to the arbitrability, such questions will first be ruled upon by the arbitrator selected to hear the dispute. In the event that a case is appealed to an arbitrator on which he/she has no power to rule, it shall be referred back to the parties without decision or recommendation on its merits.
2.	Within ten (10) days after such written notice of submission to arbitration, the Board and the Association will attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator or to obtain such a commitment within a ten (10) day period, a request for a list of arbitrators will be made jointly to the American Arbitration Association.
3.	The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decisions which require the commission of an act prohibited by law or which violates the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to make any decision which modifies, alters, or amends the terms of this Agreement. He/she shall have no power to change any practice, policy, or rule of the Board nor to substitute his/her judgment for that of the Board as to the reasonableness of any such practice, policy, rule, or any action taken by the Board.
4.	There shall be no appeal from an arbitrator's decision if it is within the scope of his/her authority. It shall be final and binding on the Association, its members, the teacher or teachers involved, and the Board. The Association shall discourage any attempt of its members and shall not encourage or cooperate in any appeal to any court or labor board from a decision of an arbitrator.
5.	The costs for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, and his/her travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne equally by the Board and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them, and neither party shall be responsible for the expense of witnesses called by the other.
6.	The arbitrator shall award no punitive damages.

TEACHER NARRATIVES ON STUDENT REPORT CARDS GRADES K THROUGH 6
It is understood that report card narratives are part of a student's permanent record and are an important means that teachers use to communicate with parents or guardians about student performance at school. Teachers take care to express their knowledge of the classroom experience, the curricular goals and their thoughtful insight into the student's participation in the classroom to inform parents about the strengths, talents, interfering factors, and needs of students. Principals recognize the essential importance of the teacher's time, effort and talent used to create report card narratives. Teachers recognize that principals advocate for schools and they work to achieve the highest professional standards as the school personnel communicates with the school's community.
To ensure that report card narratives receive positive attention and quality results, the District and FEA agree the following statements provide guidance to principals and teachers should there be a disagreement about the content of a narrative on a student report card.
1.	After a teacher submits student report cards to the principal at the close of business as referenced in Article 508, the principal may review each student report card.
2.	If the principal wishes to suggest a correction or change in the narrative, he or she will do so by attaching a note to the original indicating the suggested change.
3.	If the subject of the suggested correction or change is a minor oversight (for example a space, comma, omitted letter) that does not detract from the meaning of the narrative, it is understood the teacher will use his or her discretion as to whether or not to correct the narrative.
4.	If the subject of the suggested correction or change is an egregious error that impacts the reader's ability to decode the meaning of the word or sentence, or if the content of the narrative, in tone or meaning, risks violation of standards regarding confidentiality, ethics, or professional judgment, it is understood that the principal, through consultation with the teacher, may require a change in the narrative.
