When position openings are created as the result of the impending graduation of a cadet class, the Employer shall post an "open bid" period for transfer requests. The Employer shall state the graduation date of the cadet class, and the effective date of position openings as the result of the graduation. The Employer shall then receive and consider all transfer requests of incumbents prior to assigning cadets to positions. Transfer requests may list up to five posts.

For all employees entering this bargaining unit after March 29, 1989, any time previously served as an employee of any state agency shall not count toward the employee's continuous service.
In the event of a layoff or a reduction in position, a Sergeant who enters this bargaining unit shall have the seniority to which his/her length of continuous service with the Highway Patrol Division as a law enforcement employee entitles him/her.
36.02 Identical Hire Dates
When two (2) or more employees have the same seniority dates, seniority shall be determined by length of service at the facility. Should a tie still exist, seniority shall be based on the Civil Service examination taken by the employees. The employee having the highest examination score shall be considered the most senior.

The Agency Head or designee shall be available and receptive to a request for an Employee Assistance Program in accordance with Article 41 (EAP). If the above does not produce the desired positive change in performance, the Agency Head or designee will proceed with progressive discipline up to and including termination.
C.	Pattern Abuse
If an employee abuses sick leave in a pattern, per examples noted in the section under definitions (not limited to those listed), the Agency Head or designee may reasonably suspect pattern abuse. If it is suspected, the Agency Head or designee will notify the employee in writing that pattern abuse is suspected. The Agency Head or designee will use the "Pattern Abuse" form for notification. The notice will also invite the employee to explain, rebut, or refute the pattern abuse claim. Use of sick leave for valid reasons shall not be considered for pattern abuse.

An employee who is re-employed or recalled from lay off and who received a lump sum payment for unused sick leave may have such days restored by returning the amount paid by the Employer for the number of days to be restored.
Employees hired after July 1, 1986, who have previous service with political subdivisions of the State may use sick leave accrued with such prior employers but shall not be permitted to convert such sick leave to cash.
An employee who transfers from one bargaining unit to another shall be credited with the unused balance of his/her sick leave balance up to the maximum sick leave accumulation permitted in the bargaining unit to which the employee transfers.
48.	07 Leave Donation Program
Employees may donate paid leave to a fellow employee who is otherwise eligible to accrue and use sick leave and is employed by the same Agency. The intent of the leave donation program is to allow employees to voluntarily provide assistance to their co-workers who are in critical need of leave due to the serious illness or injury of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family. The definition of immediate family as provided in rule 123:1-47-01 of the Administrative Code shall apply for the leave donation program.
A.	An employee may receive donated leave, up to the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work each pay period, if the employee who is to receive donated leave:
1.	Or a member of the employee's immediate family has a serious illness or injury;
2.	Has no accrued leave or has not been approved to receive other state-paid benefits; and
3.	Has applied for any paid leave, workers' compensation, or benefits program for which the employee is eligible. Employees who have applied for these programs may use donated leave to satisfy the waiting period for such benefits where applicable, and donated leave may be used following a waiting period, if one exists, in an amount equal to the benefit provided by the program, i.e. fifty six hours (56) pay period may be utilized by an employee who has satisfied the disability waiting period and is pending approval, this is equal to the seventy percent (70%) benefit provided by disability.
B.	Employees may donate leave if the donating employee:
1.	Voluntarily elects to donate leave and does so with the understanding that donated leave will not be
38
returned;
2.	Donates a minimum of eight hours; and
3.	Retains a combined leave balance of at least eighty hours. Leave shall be donated in the same manner in which it would otherwise be used except that compensatory time is not eligible for donation.
C.	The leave donation program shall be administered on a pay period by pay period basis. Employees using donated leave shall be considered in active pay status and shall accrue leave and be entitled to any benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Leave accrued by an employee while using donated leave shall be used, if necessary, in the following pay period before additional donated leave may be received. Donated leave shall not count toward the probationary period of an employee who receives donated leave during his or her probationary period. Donated leave shall be considered sick leave, but shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
D.	Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
1.	The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
2.	The type of leave and number of hours to be donated;
3.	That the employee will have a minimum combined leave balance of at least eighty hours; and
4.	That the leave is donated voluntarily and the employee understands that the donated leave will not be returned.
E.	Appointing authorities shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate leave. Appointing authorities shall respect an employee's right to privacy, however appointing authorities may, with the permission of the employee who is in need of leave or a member of the employee's immediate family, inform employees of their co-worker's critical need for leave. Appointing authorities shall not directly solicit leave donations from employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a strictly voluntary basis.
ARTICLE 49	- LEAVES OF ABSENCE
49.01 Requesting Leave of Absence Without Pay
The Superintendent of the Highway Patrol may grant a leave of absence without pay to a member of the bargaining unit. A member must request in writing all leaves of absence without pay. The request shall state the reasons for taking leave of absence and the dates for which such leave is being requested.
49.02 Length of Leave
Upon written request, leave may be granted for any personal reason for a maximum duration of six months. Leave granted for family care is not in addition to the twelve (12) weeks provided by the Family Medical Leave Act. Leave of absence without pay may be granted for a maximum period of two years for purposes of education or training which would be of benefit to the Highway Patrol. Renewal or extension beyond the two (2) year period shall not be allowed.
49.03 Abuse of Leave
If it is found that a leave is not actually being used for the purpose for which it was granted, the Superintendent of the Highway Patrol may cancel the leave and direct the employee to report for work by giving written notice to the employee.
49.04 Failure to Return
An employee who fails to return to duty within three working days of the completion or a valid cancellation of a leave of absence without pay without explanation to the Superintendent or his representatives, may be removed from the service.
An employee who fails to return to service from a leave of absence without pay and is subsequently removed from the service is deemed to have a termination date corresponding to the starting date of the leave of absence without pay.
49.05 Return to Service
Upon completion of a leave of absence, the employee is to be returned to the classification formerly occupied, or to a similar classification if the employee's former classification no longer exists. The employer has the right to fill the position formerly occupied when the employer feels it necessary. An employee may be returned to active pay status prior to the originally scheduled expiration of the leave if such earlier return is agreed to by both the employee and the Superintendent.
49.06 Service Credit
Time spent on authorized leaves of absence without pay will count towards seniority, including service credit for annual step increases, layoff purposes, and for computing the amount of vacation leave, provided the employee is properly returned to service and is not serving a probationary period.
39
Employees that do not return to service from a personal leave of absence shall not receive service credit for the time spent on such leave.
49.07 Family Leave
Any employee may be granted a leave of absence without pay for purposes of family care. All requests for leave of absence without pay for purposes of family care shall be considered on a non-discriminatory basis without regard to the sex of the employee, and shall not be unreasonably denied. An adoptive parent's request for leave of absence for purposes of child care shall be considered on the same basis as that of a biological parent under similar circumstances.
49.08 Paid Adoption/Childbirth Leave
A.	Eligibility
All employees who work thirty (30) or more hours per week are eligible for paid Adoption/Childbirth leave upon the birth or adoption of a child. No minimum length of service is necessary to establish eligibility for this leave. Eligibility for leave is established on the day of the birth of a child or the day upon which custody of a child is taken for adoption placement by the prospective parents. To be eligible for leave an employee must be the biological parent; or in the case of adoption the employee must be the prospective adoptive parent. An employee may elect to take two-thousand dollars ($2,000) for adoption expenses in lieu of the leave benefit. Payment may be requested when the court has awarded permanent custody of a child to the prospective parents. Whenever an employee adopts multiple children, the event shall be considered as a single qualifying event and will not serve to increase either the length of leave for an employee or the two-thousand dollar ($2,000) limit.
B.	Waiting Period
To qualify for paid Adoption/Childbirth leave under this section, an employee must complete a fourteen (14) day waiting period, which commences on the date eligibility is established. An employee may work at the discretion of the employee’s appointing authority and/or take unpaid leave or any form of paid leave or compensatory time for which he/she is qualified during the fourteen (14) day waiting period. The fourteen (14) day waiting period under this section shall satisfy the waiting period under Ohio law and the Administrative Rules of the Department of Administrative Services in effect as of July 1, 1997 for employees who qualify for additional leave due to disability, provided the employee does not work during the two (2) week waiting period.
C.	Leave Benefit
Leave under this section shall be limited to six (6) weeks, the first two of which shall be the unpaid waiting period, and the remaining four weeks shall be paid at 70% of the employee's regular rate of pay. An employee may utilize any other form of paid leave or compensatory time to supplement Adoption/Childbirth leave, up to a maximum of 100% of the employee's regular earnings. Adoption/Childbirth leave shall not affect an employee's right to leave under other provisions of this agreement, except that such leave shall be included in any leave time provided under the FMLA.
D.	Part-Time Employees
The average regular hours worked (including holidays and paid leave) over the preceding three month period shall be used to determine eligibility and benefits under this Section for part-time employees, provided that such benefits shall not exceed forty (40) hours per week. If the employee has not worked a three (3) month period, the number of hours for which the employee has been scheduled per week will be used to determine eligibility and benefits.
E.	Coordination with Disability Leave
Employees who are receiving disability leave prior to becoming eligible for Adoption/Childbirth leave shall continue to receive disability leave for the duration of the disabling condition or as otherwise provided under the disability leave program. In the event that the employee's disability leave benefits terminate prior to the expiration of any benefits the employee would have been entitled to under Adoption/Childbirth Leave, the employee will receive Adoption/Childbirth Leave for such additional time without being required to serve an additional waiting period.
F.	Coordination with Bereavement Leave
In the event an infant child dies while an employee is using Adoption/Childbirth leave for that infant, Adoption/Childbirth leave terminates on the date of the death. Requested Bereavement leave may begin on the day following the death of the child. Bereavement leave will be granted in the case of a stillbirth conditioned upon the tendering of a death certificate.

Effective July 1, 2005 any trooper with ten (10) years of qualifying seniority shall advance to step 6 of pay range 11.
60.09 Performance Evaluation
A. Use
All non-probationary employees shall be given an employee performance evaluation during the sixty (60) day period immediately preceding the anniversary date of the end of the employees probationary period. Those employees who are at the top step shall be evaluated annually, thereafter.
Employee performance evaluations shall be used for all purposes for which employee evaluations are normally used, including but not limited to, merit based incentive programs designed to award employees for specific forms of job performance. The performance evaluation shall include a summary conclusion section for the supervisor to rate the employee’s overall performance as either “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory.” B. Limits
Employees shall receive and sign a copy of their evaluation forms after all comments, remarks and changes have been noted. A statement of the employee’s objection to an evaluation or comment may be attached and put in the personnel file. Employees are not entitled to union representation during performance reviews. C. Appeals
An employee may appeal his/her performance evaluation, by submitting a “Performance Evaluation Review Request” to the management designee (other than the Employer representative who performed the evaluation) within seven (7) days after the employee received the completed form for signature. A conference shall be scheduled within seven (7) working days and a written response submitted within seven (7) working days after the conference.
If the employee is still not satisfied with the response, the employee may appeal his/her performance evaluation to the Agency designee (e.g., Human Resources, Labor Relations). This level of appeal shall not be available to any employee who has received a rating of “Meets” or “Above,” in all categories.
The appeal shall contain a reason and/or documents to identify why the performance evaluation is not accurate. Any documents used by the Employer in evaluating an employee’s performance shall be furnished by the Employer to the employee upon request. The Agency designee may hold a conference or do a paper review of the performance evaluation. A written response will be issued within fourteen (14) calendar days after the appeal is requested. The performance evaluation appeal process is not grievable except as outlined below:
If an employee is denied a step increase because his/her overall performance is rated “unsatisfactory,” the employee may appeal such action directly to Step Two (2) of the Grievance Procedure. If the grievance is unresolved at Step Two (2), appeal may be taken to Step Three (3) of the Grievance Procedure, The Office of Collective Bargaining. No further appeal may be taken. Should the appeal be successful, the step increase shall be retroactive to the date on which it was due.

Less than full-time employees shall receive a pro-rated amount based on the number of hours worked in the twenty-six (26) pay periods preceding November 14, 2004. This payment shall not be subject to PERS or OSHPRS withholding.
ARTICLE 61	- ERRONEOUS WAGE PAYMENTS

This amount will be added to the step rate of pay.
Longevity adjustments are based solely on length of service excluding any service time earned between July 1 2003 and June 30, 2005, inclusive. The granting of longevity adjustments shall not be affected by promotion, demotion, or other changes in classification held by the employee.

ARTICLE 70	- DOG HANDLER DRUG TESTING POLICY
Definitions:
Critical Incident: A situation which results in extensive damage to property or which causes or has the immediate potential of causing serious physical injury or death to any person, on or off duty.
Drug Abuse: The use of cannabis or any controlled substance which has not been legally prescribed and/or dispensed, and/or the misuse of legally prescribed drug(s) or overuse or inappropriate use of non-prescription drug(s).
Drug Misuse: The overuse or inappropriate use of any legally obtained prescription or non-prescription drug.
49
Drug Test: A urinalysis test consisting of an initial screening step and a confirmation step employing the gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) utilizing urine samples collected according to procedures and a chain of custody established by Highway Patrol protocol equivalent to procedures for the handling of evidence in criminal cases.
Felony Drug Abuse: Any drug abuse that would constitute a felony under the laws of the State of Ohio. Illegal Drug: Any substance for which the possession, sale distribution, manufacture, or use by unlicensed persons is prohibited by law.
Illegal Drug Usage: Includes the use cannabis or any controlled substance which has not been legally prescribed and/or dispensed.
Non-Prescription Drug: Any substance which is not legally controlled and is available without a medical prescription, but which, when improperly or inappropriately used, may hamper the ability to perform assigned duties or impair judgment, alertness, and any other physical, emotional or mental capacities.
Prescription Drug: Any controlled substance for which possession and use is legal when prescribed by licensed medical personnel.
Random Test: Random or periodic testing whereby employees are ordered to submit to a drug test without any basis to believe the employee has used drugs.
Reasonable Suspicion: Means suspicion based on knowledge sufficient to induce a prudent and cautious man to believe a member has engaged in illegal drug usage. Reasonable suspicion of drug abuse or misuse is based upon behavioral and/or performance factors which include, but are not limited to, a decrease in work performance level, misconduct, excessive absenteeism, tardiness and/or sick leave use.
Basis for Ordering a Dog Handler to be Tested for Drug Abuse
In addition to random testing, Dog Handlers may be tested for drug abuse when there is reasonable suspicion to believe the member to be tested is using or abusing drugs. Such reasonable suspicion must be based on specific articulable facts, which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant drug testing. In addition, members may be tested for drug abuse during working hours under any of the following conditions:
1.	Prior to transfer to K-9 positions.
2.	Upon return to duty after participation in a drug abuse rehabilitation program regardless of the duration of the program, the member shall be required to undergo three (3) urine tests within the one-year period starting with the date of return to duty.
3.	Following any critical incident in which the employee was a party.
Urine Samples
Each step in the collecting and processing of the urine specimens shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of evidence.
Specimen samples shall be sealed, labeled and checked against the identity of the employee to ensure the results match the employee tested. Samples shall be stored in a secure and refrigerated atmosphere until tested or delivered to the testing lab representative.
Testing Procedure
Testing of samples will only be conducted by National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) certified laboratories.
The testing or processing phase shall consist of a two-step procedure.
1.	Initial screening step, and
2.	Confirmation step.
The urine sample is first tested using a screening procedure. A specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. An initial positive report will not be considered positive, rather it will be classified as confirmation pending. Where a positive report is received, urine specimens shall be maintained under secure storage for a period of not less than one (1) year. Any sample which has been adulterated or is shown to be a substance other than urine shall be reported as such. All test results shall be evaluated by suitably trained medical or scientific personnel prior to being reported. All unconfirmed positive test records shall be destroyed by the laboratory. Test results shall be treated with the same confidentiality as all medical records under the laws of the State of Ohio.
Disciplinary Action
Dog Handlers who are found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. Refusal to submit to a drug test, or adulteration of, or switching a urine sample, may be independent grounds for termination.
50
Voluntary Participation in a Dependency Program
Dog Handlers who may be drug dependent are encouraged to voluntarily seek professional assistance through a treatment program supervised by the Employee Assistance Program. Voluntary assistance should be sought BEFORE the drug abuse affects job performance and/or endangers fellow employees or members of the public.
1.	Participation in the Employee Assistance Program is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in Article 41 of this agreement.
2.	Should permission to return to duty following rehabilitative treatment be granted, the member shall be required to actively continue in a recognized abuse program monitored by the Employee Assistance Program and/or another qualified medical professional and shall be required to undergo three urine tests within the one-year period starting from the date of return to duty.
3.	Dog Handler who returns to duty following rehabilitative treatment is ever again found to be in violation of this policy he/she shall be terminated. The right to appeal shall be limited to due process and not the level of discipline imposed.
Drug abuse, or participation in any drug abuse rehabilitation program will not preclude disciplinary action against members for any law or rule violation which may be connected in part with drug abuse, even if a rehabilitation program is voluntarily undertaken.
ARTICLE 71 - DURATION
This Agreement shall become effective on July 1, 2003 and shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. on June 30, 2006.

APPENDIX D	- DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
Section 1.	Statement of Policy
A.	Both the State and the Union desire a workplace that is free from the adverse effects of alcohol and other drugs. As such, both parties acknowledge that substance abuse is a serious and complex, yet treatable, condition/disease that adversely affects the productive, personal and family lives of employees. The parties further acknowledge that substance abuse may lead to safety and health risks in the workplace, for the abusers, their co-workers, and the public-at-large. Accordingly, the State and the Union pledge to work collaboratively in programs designed to reduce and eradicate the abuse of alcohol and drugs.
B.	The Union recognizes the need to address problems associated with having on-duty employees under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The Union also recognizes the State's obligations under the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and other Federal laws and regulations concerning the controlling of substance abuse in the workplace. At the same time, the State recognizes employees' rights to privacy and other constitutionally guaranteed rights, as well as the due process and just cause obligations of this Agreement. Both parties agree that the emphasis of any drug-free workplace programs shall be to prevent and rehabilitate employees and to abate risks created by employees who are on duty in an impaired condition.
C.	The State will periodically provide information and training programs concerning the impact of alcohol and other drug use on job performance, as well as information concerning the State's Employee Assistance Program and any other resources that an employee or his/her family may contact for assistance in overcoming an alcohol and/or other drug problem. All bargaining unit employees shall be furnished with a copy of the Employer's drug-free workplace policies within thirty (30) days of initial employment with a state agency. Additionally, each employee will similarly be provided with a written description of the Employer's drug testing policy, including the procedures under which a test may be ordered, procedures for obtaining samples for testing, how testing will be conducted and reported to the Employer and employees; and the potential consequences of refusing to submit to testing or of positive test results. In addition, managers and supervisors shall be provided training about the Drug-Free Workplace Policy and alcohol
55
and the drug-testing program in order to ensure that the policy and program are administered consistently, fairly, and within appropriate Constitutional parameters.
Notice of these procedures will be provided to all employees covered by the testing no later than May 31, 1998. Training will be provided to all covered employees prior to implementation based upon agreement of the parties, joint training by the parties can be provided on an Agency basis. New employees who are covered will be provided notice and training prior to testing.
D.	Any employees suffering from a substance abuse problem shall receive the same careful consideration and offer of treatment that is presently extended under the State's existing benefit plans to those employees having other mental health and substance abuse conditions, as well as under the Employee Assistance Plan established under Article 41 of this Agreement. The same benefits and insurance coverages that are provided for all other illnesses, diseases, and/or physical or psychological conditions, under the State's established health insurance benefit plan, shall be available for individuals who accept medically approved treatment of alcoholism or drug dependency.
E.	An employee's refusal to accept referral for diagnosis or to follow the prescribed treatment will be handled in accordance with other policies relating to job performance, subject to the contractual grievance/arbitration procedures and other provisions of this Agreement. No person with a substance abuse problem shall have his/her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by a request for diagnosis and/or treatment. Continued unacceptable job performance, attendance, and/or behavioral problems will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
F.	The confidential nature of the medical records of employees with substance abuse problems shall be maintained pursuant to both Ohio and Federal laws. Similarly, all records relating to drug tests and their results shall be maintained in accordance with Ohio and Federal laws.
G.	All Department heads, managers, and supervisors are responsible for adherence to, and implementation, enforcement, and monitoring of, this policy.
Section 2.	Drug-Testing Conditions
A.	State Testing
1.	Reasonable Suspicion
Employees covered by this Agreement may be required to submit a urine specimen for testing for the presence of drugs or a breath sample for the testing of the presence of alcohol:
Where there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee, when appearing for duty or on the job, is under the influence of, or his/her job performance, is impaired by alcohol or other drugs. Such reasonable suspicion must be based upon objective facts or specific circumstances found to exist that present a reasonable basis to believe that an employee is under the influence of, or is using or abusing, alcohol or drugs. Examples of reasonable suspicion shall include, but are not limited to, slurred speech, disorientation, abnormal conduct or behavior, or involvement in an on-the-job accident resulting in disabling personal injury requiring immediate hospitalization of any person or property damage in excess of $2,000, where the circumstances raise a reasonable suspicion concerning the existence of alcohol or other drug use or abuse by the employee. In addition, such reasonable suspicion must be documented in writing and supported by two witnesses, including the person having such suspicion. The immediate supervisor shall be contacted to confirm a test is warranted based upon the circumstances. Such written documentation must be presented, as soon as possible, to the employee and the department head, who shall maintain such report in the strictest confidence, except that a copy shall be released to any person designated by the affected employee.
2.	Random Testing
All employees covered by this Agreement shall be subject to random drug testing.
B.	Federal Testing
Employees who are required to be tested pursuant to Federal laws and/or Federal regulations shall be tested in accordance with those laws and regulations.
Section 3.	Testing Procedures and Guarantees
A.	State Testing
1.	Procedures and protocols for the collection, transmission and testing of the employees’ samples shall conform to the methods and procedures provided by Federal regulations pursuant to the Federal Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.
2.	Employees shall have the right to consult with a Union representative, if one is available one hour prior to testing, and a Union representative may accompany the employee to the specimen collection site as long as reasonable suspicion is called for by the Employer.
56
3.	The random testing pool shall be maintained and administered by the Drug-Free Workplace Services Program of the Department of Administrative Services. The percentage of employees to be tested annually will vary during the first two (2) years of the Agreement, the percentage of the employees to be tested annually at up to 30% of the random testing pool. During the last year of the agreement, the percentage of the employees to be tested annually can vary from 10% to 30% of the average total of the random testing pool.
4.	The Drug-Free Workplace Office of DAS may issue the random testing list to the Ohio Highway Patrol Central Office. The agency Central Office shall issue a list of employees to the appropriate Facilities/Institutions. Any employee included on the list who is subject to a random test shall be tested within seven (7) days after the Facility/Institution has received the random list. Any employee who is not tested within seven (7) days after the Facility/Institution receives the list shall not be tested as a result of that list.
5.	A test result which indicates a .04% blood alcohol level will be considered a positive test. No consequences will attach to any result below a .04% level.
6.	The employee shall be responsible for the cost of all follow-up alcohol and drug tests that are ordered by the Employer.
B.	Federal Testing
1.	The Employer will comply with all provisions of the Federal Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 and any other Federal laws and regulations covering the control of substance abuse in the workplace. Any proposed policies or guidelines proposed by the Employer to comply with these regulations will be provided to the Union. The Employer will comply with any bargaining obligations as required by law.
2.	The random testing pool shall be maintained and administered by the Drug Free Workplace Services Program of the Department of Administrative Services.
Section 4.	General Provisions Applicable To All Testing
A.	Subject to the reasonable requirements of the laboratory, the Union shall have the right, upon reasonable request made to the laboratory, to inspect and observe any aspect of the drug testing program, with the exception of individual test results. The Union may inspect individual test results, if the release of such information is authorized, in writing, by the affected employee.
B.	Covered employees will be selected from the random selection pool by a computer-driven random number process based upon the position control numbers of all positions for which testing is required. Procedures will be developed by each Agency and work site with the approval of the Drug Free Workplace Services pursuant to state wide policy.
C.	Periodically, at the Union’s discretion, the Union shall have the opportunity to audit the State’s sampling and testing procedures.
D.	If the employee is sent home after notice is received by the Employer that he/she tested positive the Employer shall place the employee on administrative leave with pay pending notice of the pre-disciplinary meeting. If the employee does not waive the 72 hour pre -disciplinary meeting requirement, the employee shall be placed on approved administrative leave without pay and may use any accruals to cover the time off.
E.	All sample collection shall be conducted off-site by professional non-state personnel subject to the requirements of the testing lab unless the parties on a facility-by-facility basis mutually agree to an alternative sample collection process.
F.	Travel time and testing are to be considered “time worked” for compensation purposes.
Section 5.	Notice of Drug-Related Convictions
As required by the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, each employee covered by this Agreement is required to notify his/her agency head or his/her designee, within five (5) days after he/she is convicted of a violation of any federal or state criminal drug statute, provided such conviction occurred at the workplace or any location where the employee is working at the time of the incident which led to the conviction. Each agency is required to notify any federal agency with which it has a contract or grant, within ten (10) days after receiving notice from the employee, of the fact of such conviction. Any employee's failure to report such a conviction will subject such employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination consistent with the just cause standards set forth in Article 19 of this Agreement. An agency head or his/her designee may refer such employees to the Employee Assistance Program for referral and treatment.
57
Section 6.	Disciplinary Action
On the first occasion in which any employee who is determined to be under the influence of, or using, alcohol or other drugs, while on duty, as confirmed by testing pursuant to this policy, the employee shall be given the opportunity to enter into and successfully complete a substance abuse program certified by the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services. No disciplinary action shall be taken against the employee, provided he/she successfully completes the program. Last chance agreements shall not be effective for longer than five (5) years, except if any of the following situations led to the drug or alcohol testing, in which case the last chance agreement shall be of an unlimited duration:
1.	Any accident involving a fatality;
2.	Any accident in which there is disabling damage to the vehicle(s) requiring tow-away; or
3.	Any accident in which off site medical treatment was required.
Any last chance agreements entered into during the term of the last contract shall be subject to the above provision.
Employees on their initial probationary period who test positive for drugs or alcohol from either a random or reasonable suspicion test shall not be eligible for a last chance or EAP Agreement. The probationary employee shall be terminated on the first occasion in which he/she tests positive for alcohol or other drugs.
APPENDIX E - CLASSIFICATION REVIEW
The DAS Classification and Compensation Unit shall conduct an audit of the Electronic Technicians, Communication Technicians and Radio Operators. For the initial study, all Electronic Technicians, Communication Technicians and Radio Operators shall complete a Position Description Questionnaire (“PDQ. The PDQ shall be completed within sixty (60) days of distribution. The state shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to complete the study. The study shall consist of the following:
•	PDQ’s for Electronic Technicians, Communication Technicians and Radio Operators shall be used to develop a composite specification for each classification.
•	The specification shall be reviewed under the state’s point factor system to determine the appropriate pay
range.
•	When reviewing the specifications, the state analysts shall take into account the effects of hazard pay.
•	If it is determined by the compensation analysts that a higher pay range assignment is warranted, the current hazard pay will be used to offset any pay range increase, and the current amount of hazard pay shall be eliminated in lieu of the higher pay range assignment. The employee shall be placed at the step in the new pay range closest to the current step that does not result in a reduction.
•	No employee will be reduced in pay as a result of this study.
•	If the pay range for either Electronic Technicians, Communication Technicians or Radio Operators is recommended for reduction, the hazard pay amount shall not be reduced, and employees will be placed at the step in the new pay range that is closest to the current step assignment. Employees with steps above the new pay range will be placed in Step X without loss of pay.
•	Any pay range increase resulting from this study shall become effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year following completion of the study, and step assignments shall be made to the step in the new pay range that most closely matches the employee’s current rate of pay that does not allow for a decrease. Step assignments shall be made only to the maximum level of current pay ranges within the contract.
