THIS AGREEMENT made by and between PSI ENERGY, INC., (hereinafter called the "Company") a wholly owned subsidiary of Cinergy Corp., and its successors and assigns, and LOCAL UNION NO. 1393 of the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS (hereinafter called the "Union"), covering, except as herein otherwise provided, the Employees of the Company (hereinafter called the "union Employees") who are from time to time engaged in performing the different classifications of work herein scheduled, WITNESSETH:
That for and in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows in respect of the union Employees:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
1.1	BARGAINING AGENT - The Union is hereby recognized as the exclusive collective bargaining representative with respect to rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment for the Employees of the Company who are from time to time engaged in performing the different classifications of work covered by Articles 31,32, and 33 hereof, all of which Employees are herein called the "union Employees."
1.2	AGREEMENT TO MEET AND DEAL - The Company and the Union agree to meet and deal with each other through their duly accredited officers, representatives and committees on matters covered by the terms of this Agreement.
1.3	ACQUISITION OF OPERATING UTILITY - If the Company at any time shall acquire an operating utility property, and a majority of the employees thereof, who are at such time working in the classifications listed in this Agreement or engaged in performing the same class of work as union Employees, shall desire the Union to represent them, and such representation is not in conflict with any contractual obligations taken over by the Company in connection with such acquisition, then such employees may become union Employees. The Company agrees that in each case where it proposes to acquire an operating utility property it shall on the day on which it files with the appropriate governmental regulatory authority its petition for approval of such acquisition or makes its initial public release of such proposed acquisition, whichever day shall first occur, give the Union written notice of the Company's intention to acquire such operating utility property.
1.4	CREATION OF NEW JOB CLASSIFICATIONS - Whenever the Company desires to create a new job classification covering work of a kind or character similar to the work being performed by C-138	union Employees, the Company shall give the Union written notice of its intention to do so, after
C-168	which the Company and Union will jointly select not more than two union Employees if such new
job classification involves a single job series, and not more than three union Employees if it involves multiple job series, to serve on a Job Creation Committee. The Job Creation Committee will make recommendations regarding job duties and qualifications and the manner of filling the new job. The Company will make the final decision regarding the contents of the job specification, after which it may proceed to evaluate such new job classification and fill the same in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall, forthwith after such evaluation is completed, give the Union written notice thereof and of the labor grade (which determines the wage scale rate) within which such new job classification falls, and shall promptly review such evaluation with the Union unless the Union in writing waives such review.
C-I48	1-4.1 RE-EVALUATION OF EXISTING UNION JOB CLASSIFICATIONS - When the Company
C-3	desires to re-evaluate a job classification covered by this Agreement, the Company shall give the
Union written notice stating the reason for such re-evaluation and including a copy of the revised job specification. After such re-evaluation the Company shall promptly notify the Union as to the change, if any, in the labor grade of the re-evaluated job classification and the effective date of implementation. Within 21 calendar days of notification, the Union may request, in writing, a review of the re-evaluated job classification. Such review may be waived by the Union.
a. Re-evaluation Committee: The Union may designate one employee from each union job classification being re-evaluated to serve as a member of the job re-evaluation committee for the re-evaluation of his job classification. The committee will interview incumbents in each job classification re-evaluated. The Company will provide the Union with any market data used in the re-evaluation process.

•	Effective May 1, 2005 and for the term of the Labor Agreement, the substantive plan design of the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ Pension Plan and the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ 401 (k) Plan, as in effect on the date of this letter, will not be amended or modified as they apply to the Union Employees (as defined in the Labor Agreement) except (i) as set forth on the attached Exhibit A, and (ii) to reflect operational changes or to secure or maintain qualification as appropriate from the Internal Revenue Service or to comply with applicable laws, regulations or orders. For purposes of clarity, during the term of the Labor Agreement, the Company matching contributions under the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ 401 (k) Plan will be equal to 100% of the first 3% of base pay contributed on a before-tax basis by each eligible employee and 50% of the next 2% of base pay contributed on a before-tax basis by each eligible employee, with a potential 401(k) incentive match that slides with corporate goals.
•	Effective May 1, 2005 and for the term of the Labor Agreement, the substantive plan design of the Cinergy Corp. Welfare Benefit Program (excluding post-retirement welfare benefits), as in effect on the date of this letter, which includes the applicable medical plans, the dental plans, the life insurance plans, the long-term disability plan, and the health care and dependent care spending account plan, will not be amended or modified except as permitted under the Labor Agreement, including Article 29.13 Administration; provided, however, that the Company is permitted to amend the medical and dental plans during 2006-2007, 2008 and 2009-2010 in a manner consistent with Exhibit B, Exhibit C and Exhibit D, respectively. Notwithstanding the above, the commitment contained herein shall not require the Company to offer or maintain any particular options (i.e., health insurance providers or administrators) for the provision of benefits under the above-

Mr. Thomas J. Bailey April 18,2005 Page 2
mentioned plans; provided, further, that on no date during the 2006-2010 period will the deductibles, co-payments, annual maximums or out-of-pocket maximums applicable to Union Employees under the medical and dental plans available under the Cinergy Corp. Welfare Benefit Program be less favorable than the deductibles, co-payments, annual maximums or out-of-pocket maximums applicable on such date to non-union employees of the Company. Furthermore, if the Company, its parent or any subsidiary thereof, reaches agreement with JBEW Local 1347, UWUA Local 600, USWA Local 5541-06, or USWA Local 12049 (each individually referred to herein as “Other Union”) during the 2009-2010 period of the Labor Agreement (“Applicable Period”) that provides for deductibles, copayments, annual maximums or out-of-pocket maximums that are more favorable than those applicable to the Union Employees on such date, then for the remainder of the Applicable Period, only if the Union agrees to modify its Labor Agreement with the Company in the manner required to incorporate (i) the total medical and dental package agreed to by such Other Union and (ii) any other documented concessions that are made in exchange for lower deductibles, co-payments, annual maximums or out-of-pocket maximums agreed to by Other Union, the Union Employees will be provided the same deductibles, co-payments, annual maximums and out-of-pocket maximums as Other Unions’ members are provided during the Applicable Period; provided, however, in the event the Union does not agree to either item (i) or (ii) above, then this provision (i.e., this sentence) shall not apply.
•	For the term of the Labor Agreement, no later than October 1 of each calendar year, the Company and Union will meet to discuss medical and dental claims and other areas of interest relating to the medical and dental plans.
•	The Company will investigate programs that offer employee-paid vision insurance. The Company will discuss any vision coverage program with the Union prior to offering the program to Union Employees.
Sincerely,
Jglm E. Polley
General Manager

EXHIBIT A1
I.	Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ Pension Plan:
•	Effective for Union Members whose Severance from Service Date occurs on or after June 1, 2005, the multiplier under the traditional program shall be increased from 1.4 percent to 1.55 percent for years of Participation in excess of 35.
•	Effective for Union Members whose Severance from Service Date occurs on or after January 1, 2006, in the event that the highest average annual Earnings of a Union Member who participates in the traditional program occurs other than during his last 36 months of Participation, which determination shall be made after assuming that Accrued Vacation Pay was received during the month in which the Union Member’s Severance from Service Date occurred, the Union Member’s Highest Average Earnings shall be calculated as if the Accrued Vacation Pay, if any, that was received by the Union Member was received during the last month that occurs during the period that is used for purposes of determining the Union Member's Highest Average Earnings.
•	Effective with respect to each Plan Year (or portion thereof) that occurs during the period commencing on January 1, 2006 and ending on April 30, 2010, the "interest credit percentage” under the Balanced and Investor Formulas shall in no event be less than 3.5 percent.
II.	Cinergy Corp. Union Employees' 401 (k) Plan:
•	Effective January 1, 2006, Union Members who satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements may elect to make Deferred Compensation Contributions (401 (k) contributions) from overtime pay. For purposes of clarity, overtime pay will be excluded from the match calculation.
•	Subject to other limitations contained in the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ 401(k) Plan, the cap on annual Deferred Compensation Contributions (401(k) contributions) shall continue to be increased as the limit under Internal Revenue Code Section 402(g) increases (e.g., from $14,000 to $15,000 for 2006).
•	In the event the Cinergy Corp. Non-Union Employees' 401 (k) Plan is amended to allow participants to move matching contributions out of the Cinergy Stock Fund prior to attaining age 50, the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees' 401 (k) Plan shall be amended to allow the same.
1 Capitalized terms contained in this Exhibit A shall have the meanings given to them in the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees' Pension Plan or the Cinergy Corp. Union Employees’ 401 (k) Plan, as applicable; provided, however, that the term "Union Members)” shall refer only to those employees whose terms of employment are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between PSI Energy, Inc. and Local Union No. 1393 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

ADDENDUM TO THE LABOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN PSI ENERGY, INC. AND
LOCAL UNION NO. 1393 OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS
It is agreed by and between PSI Energy, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company ") and Local Union No. 1393 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (hereinafter referred to as the "Union”} that a post-retirement health reimbursement account (hereinafter referred to a “HRA ”) option (the "HRA Option ”) will be offered to all current, full-time employees represented by the Union as follows:
1.	In 2004, all current, full-time employees represented by the Union were offered a one-time choice between continuing in the current traditional post-retirement medical option (the “Traditional Option'*) or electing to participate in the new HRA Option described below; additionally, in spring 2006, an additional opportunity to enroll in the HRA Option will be offered to all then current, full-time employees represented by the Union who, in 2004, defaulted into the Traditional Option because they did not make an affirmative choice during the 2004 choice period.
2.	All employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2005 will participate in the HRA Option. Each employee who elects to participate in the HRA Option, and each employee hired on or after January 1, 2005, will hereinafter be referred to as a “HRA Participant."
3.	Under the Traditional Option, eligible retirees (those who retire after attaining age 50 with five (5) years of Service, as defined in the applicable Pension Plan) are provided access to group medical coverage and a premium subsidy (hat varies based upon the retirees’ service and classification (Attachment “B”).
4.	Subject to any collective bargaining obligation set forth in paragraph 6 hereof, the Company reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Traditional Option and/or the HRA Option at any time. However, amounts already credited to a HRA Participant's account will not be reduced by amendment, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with changes in the law.
133
5.	The benefit under the HRA Option is based on a bookkeeping account that can grow like a savings account with service and interest credits as described below. An employee who elects the HRA Option will start with an opening balance that is equal to l/12th of $1,000 for each prior calendar month in which the HRA Participant worked at least one day for die Company. In the future, the Company will credit eligible HRA Participants with an additional 1/12th of $1,000 for each calendar month in which the HRA Participant works at least one day for the Company. Each month, the Company will also credit each eligible HRA Participant’s bookkeeping account with an interest credit. Interest will be credited at the same interest rate as the cash balance updates as determined in August of each year, except that for the term of the current labor agreement, the interest rate will not be less than 3.5%; for 2004, the rate was 5.31%, for 2005, the rate is 5.06%. Except as discussed below, only HRA Participants who are active, full-time employees and work at least one day in the month are eligible for the monthly service credit. As with retirees in the Traditional Option, HRA Participants will have access to group medical coverage only if they retire after attaining age 50 with five (5) years of Service (as defined in the applicable Pension Plan), however, there will be no subsidy. Please note the following regarding the HRA Option:
a.	If a HRA Participant retires after attaining age 50 with five (5) years of Service (as defined in the applicable Pension Plan), the amounts credited to the HRAs generally can be used for the qualified medical expenses, as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, of the retiree and the retiree’s spouse and eligible dependents (see IRS publication 502 for examples of qualified medical expenses). To the extent permitted by applicable law and as is otherwise practicable, the HRA option is intended to provide a tax-free benefit. Due to future law changes, however, there can be no assurance of favorable tax treatment.
b.	Except as provided below, if the employment of a HRA Participant terminates prior to attaining age 50 with five (5) years of Service (as defined under the applicable Pension Plan), the HRA Participant forfeits all amounts credited to the HRA Account.
c.	If a HRA Participant dies while actively employed prior to attaining age 50 with five (5) years of service (as defined in the applicable Pension Plan), the HRA Participant forfeits all amounts credited to the HRA Account.
d.	If a HRA Participant dies while actively employed after attaining age 50 with five (5) years of Service, his/her spouse and eligible dependents will be entitled to use amounts credited to the HRA to pay qualified medical expenses immediately.
134
e.	In the event of disability or leave, the Company will continue monthly service credits for the first 12 months. Ilie Company will continue interest credits while the HRA Participant is disabled or on leave (and prior to recovery or retirement). For HRA Participants on a military leave, service credits and interest credits generally will continue for the full qualified leave period.
f.	If the employment of a HRA Participant is involuntarily terminated in connection with an involuntary reduction in force and such termination is in no way related to performance deficiencies, the HRA Participant will be eligible to maintain his/her HRA balance as of termination.

Frequently asked questions regarding the HRA Option:
1.	Will an employee be able to elect the HRA Option upon retirement?
A. No. A one-time election took place in 2004. A second choice window will be offered in the spring of 2006 for employees who defaulted into the Traditional Option because they did not make an affirmative choice during the 2004 choice period.
2.	Can a HRA Participant withdraw amounts credited to his/her HRA account in cash upon retirement? Can the Company pay the amount out in a lump sum?
A. Money may be withdrawn from the HRA account only for paying qualified medical expenses. The account will not be paid out in cash. Favorable tax treatment is available for a HRA only if the HRA reimburses medical expenses as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. As stated below from IRS Notice 2002-45, any right to receive cash will disqualify the HRA from receiving favorable tax treatment.
“An HRA does not qualify for the exclusion under § 105(b) if any person has the right to receive cash or any other taxable or non-taxable benefit under the arrangement other than the reimbursement of medical care expenses. If any person has such a right under an arrangement currently or for any future year, all distributions to all persons made from the arrangement in the current tax year are included in gross income, even amounts paid to reimburse medical care expenses. For example, if an arrangement pays a death benefit without regard to medical care expenses, no amounts paid under the arrangement to any person are reimbursements for medical care expenses excluded under § 105(b)... Arrangements formally outside the HRA that provide for the adjustment of an employee's compensation or an employee's receipt of any other benefit will be considered in determining whether the arrangement is an HRA and whether the benefits are eligible for the exclusions under §§ 106 and 105(b). If, for example, in the year an employee retires, the employee receives a bonus and the amount of the bonus is related to that employee's maximum reimbursement amount remaining in an HRA at the time of retirement, no amounts paid under the arrangement are reimbursements for medical care expenses for purposes of § 105(b)...”
3.	What happens to the HRA balance upon disability or extended leave from the Company?
A.	See Paragraph 5(e) of the Agreement
136
4.	What happens to the HRA balance in the event of a termination of employment?
A. See Paragraph 5 of the Agreement
5.	What happens to the HRA balance if I die while actively employed?
A. See Paragraphs 5(c) and 5(d) of the Agreement. Currently, the spouse and eligible dependents of an employee who dies while actively employed with Cinergy can elect to become covered under the non-union medical plan and receive subsidized coverage at the active employee rate until death or a disqualifying event (for the spouse, this would include, but not be limited to, remarrying or becoming Medicare eligible; for an eligible dependent, it would include, but not be limited to, ceasing to qualify as an eligible dependent due to age).
6.	Will the Company contributions be indexed in future years (e.g., indexed to the trend line for health care costs)?
A. No. At this time, we do not plan to align our service credit or interest credit to any index. However, the Company will continue to evaluate its crediting levels. Subject to any collective bargaining obligations, the Company reserves the right to make adjustments, including increasing, decreasing or discontinuing credits unilaterally.
7.	Will the opening HRA balances be calculated with retroactive interest crediting?
A. No. Making retroactive interest credits would be cost prohibitive from the Company’s perspective.
8.	How can HRA Participants use amounts credited to the HRA?
A. Money credited to a HRA can be used to reimburse the HRA Participant for medical expenses as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. See IRS publication 502 for examples of qualified medical expenses.
9.	Who will administer the HRA account balances?
A. Currently, Hewitt Associates is administering HRA account balances. The Company reserves the right to change administrator’s at any time.
10.	Will the HRAs be protected/guaranteed?
A. The benefit under the HRA option is based on a bookkeeping account and is not funded like a 401(k) plan. See Paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Agreement regarding the Company's ability to amend.
137
11.	If the Company decides to eliminate the Traditional Option at a later date, would employees be allowed to get in the HRA?
A. The Company periodically evaluates its benefit programs and would determine the appropriate course of action at that time.
12.	Would interest on the HRA account continue to accrue after an employee retires?
A. No. Interest credits cease upon retirement.
13.	If two Cinergy employees are married, can they make different elections with
respect to the HRA Option?
A. Yes, one could elect to remain in the Traditional Option, and the other could elect the HRA Option; if they remain married during retirement and so elect, they would receive subsidized coverage under the Traditional Option and have access to amounts credited to the HRA on behalf of the other spouse. Regardless, the elections are independent of each other.
