6.	In no case may an employee's work schedule be changed during the workweek when the purpose of such change is to avoid overtime compensation.

B.	Upon recommendation of the Human Resources Director, the Board may, by minute order, authorize that a particular position be filled at any step within the range. When the Board authorizes the filling of the position at a step which is higher than the recruiting step of the salary range, it may, by minute order, advance the salary of incumbents of positions in that class or related classes in order to retain equitable relationships.
C.	The Agency or Department Head may authorize the appointment of employees at any of the first eight (8) steps of the salary range. Such appointments shall be made only when the Agency or Department Head makes a determination that there is a direct and measurable benefit to the County from such appointments and makes a determination that the applicant's previous training and experience enables him or her to make a greater contribution than a less experienced employee.
D.	Upon recommendation of the Agency or Department Head, the County Executive Officer may authorize the appointment of employees beyond step eight (8) of the salary range when there is a direct and measurable benefit to the County for such appointment.

Section 3.	Merit Increase Within Range
A.	Extra help employees shall not be eligible for merit increases within range.
B.	Salary increases within a range shall not be automatic. They shall be based upon merit and granted only upon the affirmative recommendation of the Agency/Department Head.

A new or reemployed employee in a regular or limited-term position shall have a merit increase eligibility date which shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of the first twenty-six (26) weeks of service within that class. The granting of an Official Leave of Absence (other than a Military Leave) or the imposition of a suspension shall cause the merit increase eligibility date to be extended a number of calendar days equal to the Official Leave or suspension. The extended merit increase eligibility date will be effective the first day of the pay period after said date. Subsequent merit increase eligibility dates shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of fifty-two (52) week intervals subject to the same postponement for Official Leaves of Absence or suspensions.

E.	1. Merit increases may be granted for one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4) steps within the salary range based upon the employee's performance. A performance rating of “meets performance objectives” shall earn a two (2) step increase.
2. For any employee hired on or after July 15, 1977, the determination as to whether or not to grant merit increases beyond Step 10 and if granted, in what amounts, shall be solely within the discretion of the Agency/Department Head and shall be based on merit.
S - 15
F.	If, in the agency's/department's judgment, the employee's performance does not merit a salary increase on the merit increase eligibility date and a deferral of decision accompanied by an intensive effort at improved performance might be productive, the agency/department shall complete the structured merit rating and defer a decision regarding the merit increase any number of pay periods, but not to exceed thirteen (13) pay periods. A deferral of less than thirteen (13) pay periods may be further extended not to exceed thirteen (13) pay periods from the original merit eligibility date. The employee may be reevaluated at any time, but in any event shall be reevaluated on the structured merit rating prior to the end of the thirteenth pay period. The employee's merit increase eligibility date shall not be changed by such deferral.

B.	Any employee who is promoted to a class from which the employee was previously reduced without a salary decrease shall be placed at a salary step no higher than the step which the employee would have achieved if the employee had remained in the class to which he or she is promoted and had demonstrated at least standard performance. The employee's merit increase eligibility date shall be reestablished in order to credit the employee with any time formerly served in the higher class.
C.	Upon recommendation of the Agency/Department Head, the County Executive Officer may, based on consideration of such factors as external market data, internal salary relationships, position responsibilities and sound management principles, approve a rate of pay on promotion not to exceed the top of the pay range to which the employee is being promoted.

c.	In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of Article XVII, NONDISCRIMINATION, and also finds that the violation was a substantial cause of the probationary release of the employee, the arbitrator's award shall depend upon the significance of the violation and shall be in keeping with the following alternatives:

2.	Grievance/Appeal hearings by an arbitrator shall be private.
3.	Arbitration appeal hearings of suspensions of less than forty (40) hours shall be limited to two (2) days unless both parties agree that a longer hearing is necessary. Both parties shall be allotted equal time during arbitration hearings involving such suspensions. The two (2) day limitation for arbitration appeal hearings shall not apply to suspensions imposed by the County Executive Officer.
S - 68
4.	The arbitrator shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, a list of seven (7) arbitrators shall be obtained from the California State Conciliation Service, the American Arbitration Association or some other agreed upon source and each party shall alternately strike one (1) name from the list until only one (1) name remains.
5.	Upon written request by the opposing party in a pending hearing given at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing date, the party requested shall supply to the party submitting the request copies of all documentary evidence to be used by that party at the hearing. Such evidence shall be provided no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing date. Any evidence not so provided may not be admitted or offered as evidence at the subsequent hearing except that any such documentary evidence discovered by a party after such a request for copies but not soon enough to comply with the above time limits may be admitted providing it could not have been discovered sooner by reasonable means and provided further that a copy or copies of such evidence be afforded the requesting party as soon as practicable after such discovery. Nothing contained herein shall operate to prevent either party from presenting additional documents by way of rebuttal.
6.	An employee shall not suffer loss of pay for time spent as a witness at an arbitration hearing held pursuant to this procedure. The number of witnesses requested to attend and their scheduling shall be reasonable.
7.	At the hearing, both the appealing employee and the County shall have the right to be heard and to present evidence. The following rules shall apply:
a.	Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.
b.	Each party shall have these rights: to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination, to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify and to rebut the evidence against the witness. If the employee does not testify in his or her own behalf, the employee may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.
8.	The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might have made
S - 69
improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
9.	The County shall be allowed to have one (1) employee, who may be called upon to testify as a witness, present at the arbitration hearing at all times.
10.	The parties agree to forego the use of briefs and transcripts whenever practicable.
11.	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties.

A request for mediation may be presented in writing to the Chief of Employee Relations within seven (7) calendar days from the date a decision was rendered at Step 2. A request for mediation will automatically suspend to normal processing of a grievance until the mediation process is completed or the request is denied. The County shall respond to a request for mediation within thirty (30) calendar days. The mediation process shall be optional, and any opinion expressed by the mediator shall be informed and shall be considered advisory. Within seven (7) calendar days after completion of the mediation process or denial of a request for mediation, an arbitration request may be filed pursuant to Section 8.A. or B., above.

agencies/departments shall be subject to layoff if one is necessary.
D.	Section 7., Reemployment Lists, and Section 8., Status on Reemployment, of this Article, shall not apply if the County has a written agreement with an employer, public or private, which guarantees the County employee an offer of reasonably comparable employment with the new employer who is taking over a function formerly performed by County employees and the new employer makes such an offer in writing to the employee.
Section 2.	Order of Layoff
A.	When a reduction in the work force is necessary, employees in regular positions and those occupying limited-term positions at the direction of their Agency/Department Head shall be laid off in an order based on consideration of:
1.	employment status,
2.	past performance,
3.	length of continuous service with the County.
B.	Layoffs shall be made by class within an agency/department except that:
1.	Where a class has a dual or multiple concept, the Chief of Employee Relations may authorize a layoff by specialty within the class.
2.	Where appropriate, the Chief of Employee Relations may authorize a layoff by division or smaller unit of an agency/department.
S - 71
C.	Within a class, employees shall be subject to layoff in the following order:
Employment Status
First - Temporary Promotion
Agency/Department
Layoff Order
Determined by
Second - New Probationary
Determined by
Agency/Department
Third - Regular/Promotional
Layoff Points Probationary
After all new probationary employees and employees on temporary promotion have been removed from a class within a layoff unit, the employee with the lowest number of layoff points shall be subject to layoff first. When two (2) or more employees have the same number of layoff points, the agency/department shall determine the order of layoff for these employees.
D.	If a layoff is going to be made in a class from which an employee has left through a temporary promotion, the employee on temporary promotion shall be returned to his or her former class and shall be subject to layoff in accordance with this procedure.
E.	OCEA may designate employees who are regular OCEA officers or grievance representatives to receive special seniority for purposes of layoff. The number of employees so designated shall not exceed two (2) percent of the employees in the Representation Unit. Employees so designated shall receive two hundred sixty (260) layoff points in addition to layoff points computed pursuant to Section 3., below.
Section 3.	Computation of Layoff Points

The equivalent of each year of full-time continuous service with the County shall earn two hundred sixty (260) seniority points.
The equivalent of each regularly scheduled full day of continuous service of a partial year shall earn one (1) seniority point.
S - 72
Demerit Points:
For a rating of “does not meet performance objectives” on the last "Performance Evaluation Report," for the class currently held by the employee, the employee shall earn two-hundred sixty (260) demerit points. Demerit points shall only be used in the currently held class of an employee. Demerit points shall not be applied to an employee seeking to enter a lower class through voluntary reduction in lieu of layoff.
Layoff Points:
Layoff points shall be computed by subtracting demerit points, if any, from seniority points.
Section 4.	Notification of Employees
A.	Written notice of layoff shall be given to an employee or sent by mail to the last known mailing address at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff. Notices of layoff shall be served on employees personally at work whenever practicable.
B.	It is the intent of the parties that the number of layoff notices initially issued shall be limited to the number of positions by which the work force is intended to be reduced. Additional notices shall be issued as other employees become subject to layoff as a result of employees exercising reduction rights under Section 5.
C.	The notice of layoff shall include the reason for the layoff, the proposed effective date of the layoff, the employee's hire date, the employee's layoff points, a list of classes in the employee's occupational series within the layoff unit, the employee's rights under Sections 5. and 6. and the right of the employee to advise the County of any objection to the content of the layoff notice prior to the proposed effective date of the layoff.
Section 5.	Voluntary Reduction in Lieu of Layoff
A.	A promotional probationary or regular employee who is subject to layoff may request a reduction to a lower class within the same occupational series in the layoff unit provided the employee possesses the minimum qualifications for the class and passes any required performance tests. The reduction shall be made if there is a vacant position in the layoff unit or an incumbent in the lower class in the layoff unit has fewer layoff points than the employee requesting the reduction. In the latter case, the incumbent in the lower class with the fewest number of layoff points shall be subject to layoff.
S - 73
B.	1. Employees who receive notice of layoff by personal service at work shall have until the end of their third regularly scheduled day of work following actual receipt of the notice to notify their agency/department in writing of their intent to exercise rights under this Section. Employees whose third regularly scheduled day of work is more than three (3) calendar days after receipt of the notice shall have three (3) calendar days, excluding weekends and holidays, to notify their agency/department of their intent to exercise rights under this Section; and where such notification is not in writing, the employee shall confirm the notification in writing as soon as practicable.

Employees who receive notice other than by personal service at work shall have five (5) calendar days, excluding weekends and holidays, following the date the person is personally served, or if service is made by mail, five (5) calendar days, excluding weekends and holidays, following date of proof of service by mail to notify their agency/department of their intent to exercise rights under this Section. Where such notification is not in writing, the employee shall confirm the notification in writing as soon as practicable.
3.	Failure by an employee to respond to his or her agency/department pursuant to this Section shall result in a rebuttable presumption that the employee does not intend to exercise any right of reduction to a lower class and that the employee's hire date stated in the layoff notice was correct.
4.	No employee action or inaction referred to in this Section shall be considered a waiver of an employee's right to file grievances concerning any matter within the scope of the grievance procedure.
Section 6.	Voluntary Reduction from Classes Designated as Vulnerable to Layoff
An employee in a class designated by the County as vulnerable to layoff may request a voluntary reduction to any class provided the employee possesses the minimum qualifications and has passed any required performance tests for the class to which reduction is requested.

2.	A person who on three (3) separate occasions declines referral for interviews in a particular class shall be removed from the lists for that class.
D.	In the event two (2) or more agencies/departments are consolidated while AGENCY/DEPARTMENTAL REINSTATEMENT LISTS are in effect, such lists shall be combined and treated as one (1) list in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section. When a transfer of one (1) or more functions of one (1) agency/ department to another agency/department occurs, employees previously laid off from such function(s) who are on an AGENCY/DEPARTMENTAL REINSTATEMENT LIST for the agency/department losing such function(s), shall be removed from such list and shall be placed on a reinstatement list for the agency/department acquiring such function(s) and treated in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section.
