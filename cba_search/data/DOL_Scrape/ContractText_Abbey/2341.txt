(c)	Layoffs and/or Reduction in Hours During a Defined Time Period. Notwithstanding paragraph 7.03(a) above, before layoffs and/or a reduction in hours is implemented for a defined time period, the Employer shall institute the following procedures:
1.	Employees and Union Representatives shall be informed of the Employer's need to reduce the workforce for a defined time period. The defined time period shall not exceed five (5) weeks.
2.	Volunteers shall be solicited through a posting sheet to encourage employees to sign up for time off during the defined time period. Full-Time employees may take time off PTO or as an unpaid personal leave.

4.	After completing Steps 1-3 above, Full-Time employees may choose five (5) shifts per week in order of House Seniority, with the understanding that normal days off may be changed to accommodate the operational needs of the Employer during the defined time period. The procedures set forth in this paragraph 4 shall not be utilized if the layoff and/or reduction only occurs during one (1) workweek.
5.	If further reductions in the work force are necessary, Article 7.03(a) and 7.03(b) shall be in effect.
(d)	When a layoff occurs and positions are to be eliminated, the senior employees whose shifts are to be eliminated shall displace the junior employees on that shift. Then the junior employees on that shift shall replace the junior employee overall. This shall be done by house seniority.

1)	Those Full-Time shifts that match the new schedule will not be altered or affected.
2)	Those Full-Time shifts that do not match the new schedule will be altered by up to two hours from the employee’s current shift either way to match the new schedule based on classification seniority.
3)	Those Full-Time shifts that do not match the new schedule will be altered by changing days off (remain consecutive days off) to match the new schedule based on classification seniority.
4)	The remaining positions that cannot be altered to match the new master schedule using the process outlined above will be required to bid. The department will post any vacant new master schedule shifts for bid using classification seniority. An employee that fails to bid a posted Full-Time shift will be assigned any remaining shift by management

7.04. Transfers and Promotions.
(a)	Transfers. When a job vacancy arises, it shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours in the department where the vacancy has occurred. If the vacancy is for a Full-Time position, or an On-Call position of at least ninety (90) days, employees in the same job classification may apply to transfer to the vacancy.
Full-Time employees shall have transfer bidding rights over On-Call employees. Employees shall be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority (or in the case of On-Call employees, their On-Call classification seniority), unless a junior employee has significantly greater skills and/or qualifications to perform the work.

If the employee's former shift, station (if applicable) position is no longer available, the employee shall be entitled to the next opening in the former classification for which the employee is qualified.
(b)	Promotions. The Employer reserves the right to post every third job vacancy as a promotion, rather than a transfer, to increase opportunities for employees interested in transferring out of their current classifications. If a job vacancy is not filled by a transfer under Section 7.04(a), and/or it is the third (3rd) job vacancy in a particular classification that is not filled by the transfer of a Full-Time employee is reserved by the Employer to be posted as a promotion, the vacancy shall be posted Company-wide for seventy-two (72) hours as a promotional opportunity. A “promotion” shall be a transfer from one classification to another, regardless of any change in compensation. All employees are eligible to apply. Promotional decisions shall be based on an applicant’s qualifications, ability to perform the work in the new classification, prior performance and seniority. When skills and/or qualifications are relatively equal among applicants, the employee with the greatest house seniority shall be promoted.
An employee who is promoted under this Section who cannot satisfactorily perform the work of the new position may be transferred back to his or her former position within thirty (30) shifts after the date of the promotion. If the employee's former position, shift or station is no longer available, the employee shall be entitled to the next opening in the former classification for which the employee is qualified, and/or placed on the top of the On-Call list.

(b)	Leaves of absence without pay for a bona fide medical disability or serious health condition not compensable under the EICON shall be granted for periods not to exceed six (6) months total during any 12-month period, except that an employee on a leave of absence under this subsection because of pregnancy or complications arising from pregnancy may supplement the 6-month leave provided here with a borrowing of part of the leave to which the employee would become entitled under subsection 16.01(d) after birth of the employee's child.
(c)	Leaves of absence without pay shall also be granted for reasonable periods for death or serious health condition in the employee's immediate family (spouse, child, parent, grandparent, brother or sister). As soon as possible, the employee shall provide, upon request, all proof or information available as to the need for such a leave.
(d)	Leaves of absence without pay for a period of up to twelve (12) months shall be granted for the birth and caring of employees' children or for the placement of a child with an employee for adoption or foster care. Eligibility for the leave ends one (1) year after the date of birth or placement of the child, or, if the employee has borrowed leave pursuant to Section 16.01(b) for pregnancy related disability, leave under this subsection shall be shortened by the same amount of time borrowed.

(i)	Upon return of an employee from a leave of absence provided in this section, the employee
shall be returned to his or her regular job classification shift and station (or station rotation) (if applicable) on the day the employee is to return to work.

(j)	The Employer shall make contributions for up to twelve (12) work weeks to the Health and Welfare Fund under Article 12 of this Agreement (for those who participate in the Health and Welfare Fund) for an employee who is on leave of absence because of a serious health condition, or to care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious health condition, or for the birth or caring of a child or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”).

Time spent at administrative hearings and/or court proceedings will be used for purposes of calculating overtime pay.
ARTICLE 19:	DISCIPLINE
19.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a)	No regular employee, after having completed the introductory period under Section 7.01, shall be disciplined and/or discharged except for just cause. The Employer shall follow a system of progressive discipline. The parties agree that progressive discipline normally requires, prior to suspension or discharge, that an employee be given a written opportunity to correct the deficiency, but that within the principle of progressive discipline, the Employer may impose immediate suspension or discharge for dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, insubordination, discourteous conduct toward a guest or owner, failure to report to work without just cause, walking off the job during a shift, or drinking alcohol or use of controlled substance, or being under the influence thereof, during the employee’s shift.
When an employee who has completed the introductory period is disciplined and/or discharged, the reason therefore will be given to the employee in writing. When an employee is discharged, copies of the written notice to the employee will be sent to the Union upon request within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relevant to discipline or discharge, including videotapes, shall be provided to the Union.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level at or in excess of the limit prescribed by Nevada State Law constitutes an absolute presumption that the individual is under the influence of alcohol. A positive GC/MS blood test result for a controlled
1
33
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
substance provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of the identified controlled substance.
(c)	An On-Call employee may be terminated without recourse to Article 20, because the employee refuses and/or fails to report for work more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the shifts offered and/or scheduled in any 60-day period.
19.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter.
A copy of any written warning notice shall be issued to the employee. The employee shall be required to sign all notices for the purposes of acknowledging receipt. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of die Employer’s own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
19.03. Time of Discharge.
No employee shall be discharged on his or her day off or while on PTO or leave of absence.
19.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
19.05.
Signature will not require or request employees to take a lie detector test.
19.06.
Signature will not require or request an employee to resign, or to sign a confession or statement concerning his or her conduct, unless the employee is first given an opportunity to have a Union representative present if the employee so requests.
ARTICLE 20:	DISPUTE RESOLUTION
20.0	1. Disputes.
For purposes of this Agreement, a grievance is a dispute or difference of opinion between the Union and the Employer involving the meaning, interpretation, application to employees covered by this Agreement. Any violation or alleged violation of Article 25 shall not be subject to the Dispute Resolution procedure.
The parties agree to utilize the following procedures for resolving the disputes of employees:
20.0	2. Step One Process and Time Limit for Filing Grievance.
(a)	Step One Process. The Employer and the Union agree to implement a Step One Process for complaints and disputes related to individual disputes raised by an employee. The Step One
34	1
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
Process gives responsibility to employees, union shop stewards and front line management to resolve problems directly, quickly and cooperatively. The Step One Process is designed to reduce the level of formalism in the grievance procedure.
Under the Step One Process, an employee with a complaint or dispute shall use his or her best efforts to, within five (5) calendar days of the incident or circumstances giving rise to the dispute, or within five (5) calendar days of the time the employee reasonably could have acquired knowledge of the event, present the matter to his/her immediate supervisor. An employee has the right to request the involvement of the shop steward in this Step One Process. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to secure the presence of a union steward if he/she wishes to have the steward present during the discussion with the employee’s immediate supervisor.
The supervisor involved in the Step One discussion shall use his/her best efforts to respond to the employee within five (5) calendar days of such discussion. Such response may be in the form of a proposed resolution of the matter or may be a communication to the employee scheduling a meeting to further discuss the matter.
Settlements reached during the Step One Process shall be considered non-precedent setting, unless the Employer and the Union expressly agree that the settlement shall be reduced to writing and may be used as precedent in the future. However, the Parties agree that if a resolution is reached during the Step One process, documentation of the resolution shall be prepared and signed off on by the Employer, the Employee and the Steward (if involved).
The Parties agree to provide jointly the required Step One Process training to current management personnel (including third party operators involved in the administration and application of this Agreement) and shop stewards by April 1,2018. Refresher training will be scheduled at eighteen (18) month intervals for new management and shop stewards.
(b)	If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute or complaint in the Step One Process, such dispute or complaint may be reduced to writing as a formal grievance and shall proceed to a Board of Adjustment as provided in Section 20.03 of this Article.
20.03. Step Two Process — Procedure for Adjusting Formal Grievances.
All grievances shall be adjusted exclusively in the following manner:
(a)	No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is received in writing by either party within twenty (20) calendar days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or after the aggrieved party hereto acquires knowledge of the occurrence of such event, whichever is later. The written grievance shall set forth the provision(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated, and every effort will be made to set forth all of the known facts allegedly constituting the violation. At the time it submits a grievance to the Employer, the Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of any written statements, reports or documents relied on by the Union or the grievant to support the grievance (but not including the employee’s written grievance submitted to the Union).
(b)	Board of Adjustment. Any unresolved grievance shall be reduced to writing and scheduled
for a hearing by a Board of Adjustment within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the
35
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
grievance. The Board of Adjustment shall be comprised of not more than three (3) representatives of the Employer and three (3) representatives of the Union. For the purpose of attempting to resolve grievances prior to arbitration, the parties, at any meeting prior to the Board of Adjustment hearing and at that hearing, shall make full disclosure to each other of all facts and evidence then known to them that pertain to the grievance.
(c)	Formal Arbitration.
If the matter is not resolved pursuant to the grievance procedure set forth in Section 20.02 and 20.03 (a) and (b) above, and is not submitted to Expedited Arbitration under section 20.03(c)(i), either party may submit the matter to final and binding arbitration within twenty (20) days of the BOA.
Representatives of the Employer and the Union may agree to select an arbitrator, but if they are unable to do so, the arbitrator shall be chosen from a panel of seven (7) arbitrators, received from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service ("FMCS"), who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators and who reside in California or Nevada. No arbitrator shall be chosen to serve in two (2) consecutive arbitrations unless by mutual consent of the parties. The arbitrator shall be notified in writing of his or her selection, and shall have no authority, jurisdiction or power to amend, modify, nullify or add to the provisions of this Agreement. No evidence shall be introduced as to the withdrawal, during negotiations, of a proposal to change the Agreement. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Employer, the Union, and the employee(s) involved. Except in separation cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Employer and the Union. In separation cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, and of the court reporter, if any, shall be paid by the party losing the arbitration. Where, in a separation case, reinstatement is ordered by an arbitrator, with less than full back pay, the costs of arbitration shall be divided evenly between the parties.
(i)	Alternative Dispute Resolution
(1)	Coverage.
A grievance challenging disciplinary action or termination issued to an employee, that is not resolved through the Step One or BOA processes, may be subject to the Program. A grievance meeting the criteria set forth in this paragraph herein may be submitted to the Program if a timely demand for arbitration is made by the Party who filed the grievance and use of this Program is indicated in the demand.
The non-filing Party may object to the submission of the grievance to the Program, by providing written notice to the other Party within twenty (20) calendar days of the receipt of the demand for arbitration. In such event, the grievance shall proceed under Section 20.03(c)(ii) of this Article.
(2)	Structure of the Program.
The Parties shall submit the grievance to a three person panel for a final and binding decision.
(a)	Panel and Hearing Dates.
36	*
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
A panel of three (3) persons shall be established (“Panel”). One member of the Panel shall be selected by each Party. The person selected by each Party shall hold a high level position with their organization, shall commit to participate in the Program for the entire period of the pilot program, and shall be given full authority to act as a neutral decision maker relative to any grievance presented to the Panel. The third member of the Panel shall be the Panel Chairperson and shall be selected jointly by the Parties. The Parties will share equally in the costs associated with engagement of the Panel Chairperson. The Panel Chairperson shall be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators and shall be someone who agrees to serve as the Panel Chairperson for the entire period of the Program.
Each month, the Parties will select up to two consecutive days (based upon the number of grievances) on which the Panel will hear cases covered by the Program.
(b)	Presentation of Cases.
a.	Scheduling of Cases.
The Panel representatives for the Parties shall work together to identify the cases which are ready for presentation to the Panel and shall create the monthly agenda of cases.
b.	Exchange of Written Materials and Information.
One week prior to the monthly hearing date the Parties shall exchange the following:
-	all written documentation which they anticipate presenting to the Panel for each case scheduled to be heard by the Panel; and
-	a list of witnesses each Party anticipates it will present at the hearing.
If one Party objects to the use of an identified document, it shall notify the other Party immediately and the Parties shall attempt to resolve such dispute prior to the date of the hearing. If the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the Parties shall present the dispute to the Panel and the Panel shall have the authority to determine whether such document may be used during the Panel Hearing.
The Panel Chairperson shall have the authority to issue subpoenas (at the request of either party) requiring production of documents or other information and requiring witnesses to appear for the Panel hearing.
(c)	Opening Statements,
The Parties shall each have an opportunity to present an opening statement to the Panel. The Company shall present first, followed by the Union, unless a different order of presentation is requested by the Panel.
37
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
During opening statements the Union and Employer representatives shall identify those persons who may offer relevant testimony and are available to testify before the Panel. The Panel shall identify those witnesses which it wishes to have testify and in what order. Witnesses will be questioned by the Parties, but shall be allowed to provide testimony in narrative form. All Panel members shall be allowed to ask questions of the witnesses and each Party’s representative shall also be provided with an opportunity to ask questions of the witness, following their initial testimony.
(d)	Panel Assessment
Once the Panel has determined that all witnesses and other information has been provided to it, the case will be submitted to the Panel for evaluation and decision. All panel deliberations and individual panelists’ decisions shall be absolutely confidential. The Panel shall determine the outcome of the case. The decision shall be made by a majority vote of the panelists. The Panel Chairperson shall prepare a draft of a written decision on each case and forward the draft to the two other panelists for review and comment Within two (2) weeks of the presentation to the panel, a single decision will be issued to the Parties and no dissenting opinion or comment will be made or issued. Decisions issued by the Panel will not be published and will not be considered to be precedent setting.
(3)	Participants.
Union presentations shall be conducted by Union Grievance Specialists and/or Stewards. Employer presentations shall be conducted by Human Resources/Labor Relations personnel, operational or management personnel. Attorneys and other legal representatives will not be used by either Party to conduct the presentation of its case. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit or restrict the right of either Party to seek legal assistance in the preparation of its presentation. The Parties agree and understand that during the first six (6) months of the Pilot Program the Parties may elect to have legal assistance during the Panel hearing.
(4)	Procedures.
Prior to the presentation to the Panel, the Parties will discuss and prepare a joint submission of documents to the Panel which will include (but is not necessarily limited to) a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (or all relevant provisions), a copy of any Step One and/or Step Two documentation, a copy of the discipline(s) or termination challenged and a copy of any statements relied upon by the Employer in making its decision.
The Parties may use documentary and/or demonstrative evidence in the presentation of cases, including but not limited to copies of personnel and/or disciplinary records, policies and procedures, correspondence between die Employer and the Union, statements, investigative records and/or grievance process records, video tapes or other records which relate to the case presented. The only objection which is properly made to
38
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
the presentation of such documentation is that a document is not authentic or is not appropriately presented under a provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If a dispute arises regarding the presentation of evidence, such dispute shall be resolved by the Panel Chairperson.
(5)	Decision by Panel.
The Panel’s decision shall be final and binding on both Parties.
(d) Extension of Time Limits. The time limits and other provisions set forth in this Article may be extended or waived by mutual agreement of the Parties.
20.04. Mitigation of Damages.
If an employee is discharged by Signature, and the employee disputes that his or her discharge was not for just cause, the employee must mitigate any potential damages Signature may eventually owe that employee. In any dispute over the amount of back pay due to an employee under an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee for any period of time since his/her discharge unless it is reasonable to do so taking into account the efforts by the employee to fulfill his/her duty to mitigate damages with respect to that period of time.
20.05.
Employees with less than two (2) years* service maybe offered by the Company, no later than thirty (30) days following Employer’s receipt of the Union’s demand for arbitration two (2) months' pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating the discharge. In the event the employee declines this offer when made by the Employer, the Union will not arbitrate the discharge unless it objectively determines that, in its judgment, the discharge constituted a flagrant miscarriage of justice.
ARTICLE 21:	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
21.0	1. Rights to Manage.
Both parties agree that Signature has the right to manage, direct, plan and control its business and its operations, including matters that are not covered by this Agreement.

21.0	2. Rules and Posting.
The Employer may establish and administer reasonable rules, regulations and procedures governing the conduct of employees, provided that such rules, regulations and procedures are not inconsistent with any provisions of this Agreement. The Employer shall post and maintain any such rules in such places within its establishment so that all employees affected thereby, and
’	39
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
business representatives of the Union, may have an opportunity to become familiar with them. The reasonableness of any rules, regulations and procedures provided for herein, are subject to the grievance procedures of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 22:	SUBCONTRACTING, SUBLEASING AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW EQUIPMENT AFFECTING BARGAINING UNIT JOBS
22.01.
(a)	It is recognized that the Employer and the Union have a common interest in protecting work opportunities for all employees covered by this Agreement and employed on a regular basis. Therefore, no work customarily performed by employees covered by this Agreement shall be performed under any sublease, subcontract, or other agreement unless the terms of any lease, contract or other agreement specifically state that (a) all such work shall be performed only by members of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, and (b) the Employer shall at all times hold and exercise full control of the terms and conditions of employment of all such employees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The provision of this Article apply to all operations on the Employer’s premises covered by this Agreement, regardless of location or displacement of employees or prior use of the area occupied by such operations. Any sublease, subcontract, or other agreement for the performance of cleaning or janitorial services shall first require the approval of the Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, the Employer may purchase from outside sources for use in its establishment convenience foods, prepared foods, baked goods, pre-mixed salads and peeled vegetables.
The Employer and the Union may enter into an memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) concerning the operation of any food and beverage venue by a third party but the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to such venue until such MOU is signed, provided however, that Article 12 shall always apply to the venue from the first hour worked by any employee in a bargaining unit position. Prior to any such work being performed, the Employer, the Union and the third party operator shall enter into an agreement solely requiring timely compliance by the third party operator with Article 12.
(b)	The Parties agree that, as an exception to Section 22.01 of the Agreement, the Employer may operate a fast food court or fast food outlets without regard to the provisions of Section 22.01, so long as there is no significant negative impact on bargaining unit employment or income. No room service or deliveries to banquet events shall be provided by any such outlet with non-union employees. The parties agree that the Starbucks located at the Condominium Facility is not a “fast food outlet.”
(c)	Reserved Rights.
(i)	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, the parties recognize that services have been performed by third parties at the Condominium Facility pursuant to agreement with the Employer, and the Employer may continue the services of any current independent outside contractor or entity which is providing the Condominium Facility with any services with persons employed by such contractor as of the date of this Agreement, and any subsequent independent outside contractors or entities providing the Condominium Facility with the same services with persons not employed by the Employer, provided that the provision of such
1	40
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
services by each contractor or other outside entity may not be expanded beyond the types and departmental and overall levels currently being done under such agreements. The Employer agrees to provide the Union with a list of any currently contracted work and to notify the Union in writing prior to any agreement with a new contractor or entity providing such services.
(ii)	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, the parties specifically agree and acknowledge that the Employer does not manage, maintain or operate all of the Condominiums, and that the Condominium Owners may have work performed in their Condominiums which is customarily performed by bargaining unit employees, and the terms of this Agreement shall not apply.
22.02.
Whenever the Employer proposes to introduce new equipment which may affect the terms and conditions of work or the wages of employees in classifications covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall advise the Union in writing sufficiently in advance of the proposed date of introduction of such equipment to enable the Union, if it so desires, to discuss with the Employer the possible effects of the introduction of such equipment upon such employees. Upon request by the Union, the Employer will meet with it for the purpose of discussing the possible effects of the introduction of such equipment on such employees. The Employer will not introduce any such new equipment until it has afforded the Union a reasonable opportunity to discuss with the Employer all aspects of the possible effects upon such employees of the introduction of such equipment, including the possibility of alternative bargaining unit employment for the affected employees.
ARTICLE 23:	DUES CHECK-OFF
23.01.
The Check-Off Agreement, attached as Exhibit 2 of this Agreement, and the system established by Signature and the Union for the check-off of Union dues by voluntary authorization shall remain in effect for the term of this Agreement.

1	41
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
Such conduct includes verbal and non-verbal conduct which denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his or her protected status or that of his or her relatives, friends or associates.
ARTICLE 25:	NO STRIKES - NO LOCKOUTS
25.0	1. No Strikes.
The parties agree that they have created a system for resolving all problems that may arise during the term of this Agreement. Therefore, there does not exist the need for either party to resort to practices intended to coerce the other party in order to resolve a problem or achieve a goal.
Therefore, neither the Union collectively nor employees individually will call, engage in or sanction any no-work stoppages, picketing, sympathy strikes, strikes, slow down, sit-down, sit-in, boycott, handbilling, refiisal to handle merchandise, protest, demonstration, or any other form of economic action or interference with the Employer’s business, or an owner or guest. Among other things, the Union expressly agrees that neither the Union collectively nor individual employees will engage in any conduct, activities, protest, or other efforts that are intended to or have the effect of disrupting the quiet enjoyment of any guest, owner, or third parties doing business with the Employer, a guest or owner, and/or at the condominium facility, including but not limited to owners, tenants, joint venturers, third party management companies or their assignees or replacements or guests, in or about the premises of the condominium facility, or directed at guests, owners, customers of the Employer or of other businesses at the condominium facility, or using the name of the Employer.
25.0	2. No Lockouts.

42
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
Agreement. In addition, the Employer shall be responsible for accrued vacation payments for each employee covered by this Agreement.
(b)	The Employer further agrees that as a condition to any such sale, assignment or transfer of ownership of its business, the Employer will obtain from this successor or successors in interest a written assumption of this Agreement and furnish a copy thereof to the Union.

If ownership of the operation is transferred in an involuntary transaction, the Employer shall deliver to the Union copies of the entire contents of the personnel files (excluding attorney-client privileged documents, investigatory materials and medical records) of all bargaining unit employees except those files which are delivered to the transferee because it has employed or has made a legally-binding commitment to employee the employees to whom the files pertain.
(c)	The Union shall not be required to post a bond or other security as a condition to obtaining
an injunction or other equitable relief against a violation or threatened violation of this Section.
ARTICLE 27:	IMMIGRATION
27.01.
In the event that the Employer determines a post-introductory employee cannot or has not provided acceptable documentation of the employee’s right to work in the United States, the Employer shall notify the Union by facsimile or electronic email. Upon the Union's request, the Employer shall meet with the Union to discuss the nature of the issue to see if a resolution can be reached. Whenever possible, the meeting shall take place before any action is taken by the Employer, provided, however, the Union acknowledges and agrees that the Employer may take any action at any time which is required to ensure the Employer’s compliance with any and all immigration and/or employment authorization statutes, laws and regulations.
Effective June 1,2014, the Employer will provide an employee with a least sixty (60) days’ notice that the documents provided by the employee demonstrating work authorization are scheduled to expire and that the employee will need to re-verify their 1-9 documentation and provide valid evidence of continued work authorization. Such notice will be provided to an employee through an electronic message to the employee's Workday account. If Workday is unavailable, the Employer may provide notice to the employee at the time clock and/or by direct communication from the employee’s manager.
27.02.

43
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
27.03.
Upon request, employees shall be released for up to five (5) unpaid working days during the term of this Agreement in order to attend to United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) proceedings and any related matters for the employee only. The Employer may request verification of such absence.
27.04.
A post-introductory employee who is not authorized to work in the United States and whose employment has been terminated for this reason shall be immediately reinstated to his or her former classification without loss of prior seniority, provided the employee produces proper work authorization within twelve (12) months of the date of termination, and to his or her former shift and station if the employee produces proper work authorization within ninety (90) days of the date of termination. The Employer may fill this vacancy on a temporary basis not to exceed the ninety (90) day period. If the employee produces proper work authorization after ninety (90) days, but within twelve (12) months from date of termination, the employee would return, without loss of prior seniority, to his or her former classification displacing the least senior employee in that job classification. Employees do not accrue PTO or other benefits based upon particular Plan policies during such absences.
27.05.
If the employee needs additional time, the employer will rehire the employee into the next available opening in the employee's former classification, as a new hire without retaining seniority, upon the former employee providing proper paper work authorization within a maximum of twelve (12) additional months from the date the employee notifies the Employer that he or she needs additional time.

ARTICLE 28:	PAST PRACTICES
28.01.
Signature and the Union agree on the goal that nothing in this Agreement is intended to diminish the benefits, rights, and privileges of employees. Signature and the Union have also sought to write an Agreement that will be a living document, not a rigid set of rules that could unintentionally inhibit Signature and employees. Therefore, both parties agree that, unless they have explicitly agreed to a change, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to diminish existing Signature practices regarding the benefits, rights, and privileges of employees. In the event of a conflict between a past practice and an explicit provision of this Agreement, this Agreement will govern.
ARTICLE 29:	SAVINGS CLAUSE
29.01.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement should be rendered invalid by applicable legislation or be declared invalid by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction, such
44
SIGNATURE CONDOMINIUMS, LLC
action shall not invalidate the entire Agreement, it being the express intention of the parties hereto that all other provisions not rendered invalid shall remain in full force and effect. Both parties agree that the subject matter of any provision found to be invalid shall be renegotiated.
ARTICLE 30:	NON-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
30.01.
In recognition of the fact that the job duties of the employees covered by this Agreement, as well as the mere presence of employees at Signature, will provide them with access to certain information concerning owners, guests, the Employer and its operations, the employees agree that they shall not disclose any classified, confidential or proprietary information, or any other information, the disclosure of which is limited by the Employer, concerning owners, guests, the Employer or its operations, except information having to do with wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, to any person not authorized to have access to such information, and that they will sign a statement to that effect. All employees covered by this Agreement shall be fully and exclusively responsible for any violations of this Article 30, and shall not only be subject to discipline up to and including discharge by the Employer for such a violation, but shall be subject to any criminal, civil or other penalties and/or liability resulting from their violation of this Article 30.
ARTICLE 31:	BANQUETS
31.01. Definition.
A banquet shall be deemed to be any function which has been regarded and paid at the banquet rate according to the custom and usage of the trade, including cocktail parties. Part- time banquet employees are banquet employees carried by the Employer on its regular payroll and used by the Employer as needed. Part-time banquet servers shall be covered by the provisions of this Article 14 and, in addition, by Articles 6, 7,11, 12, 19 and 20; provided, however, that (1) vacation pay under Article 6 shall be prorated on the basis of the time actually worked for the Employer by such employees, and (2) seniority under Article 7 shall be for the purpose of layoff and recalls only, and shall be applicable only as among the Employer’s part-time banquet employees.
