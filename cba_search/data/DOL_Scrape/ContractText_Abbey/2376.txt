In making the selection of an employee to fill such vacancy, the Company and at least two (2) members of the Grievance Committee shall meet in an effort to agree upon the name of the employee entitled to be awarded the vacancy. Should the parties fail to agree upon a selection, the matter may be referred to the Grievance Procedure.

4.	In order to maintain efficient operation of the plant, job vacancies occurring in the classifications of Electrician, and Maintenance Mechanic will be filled by the most senior employee bidding for such job provided that such employee has the skill and ability to perform the job in a satisfactory manner.

2.	Employees may, if they so desire, accept layoff in lieu of bumping privileges, in which event they will advise the Company and the Union through an exit interview, as to their choice of Job Classifications to which they will accept recall. At the time of acceptance of layoff, such employees shall execute and deliver to the Company forms indicating their acceptance. Such acceptance of layoff shall not jeopardize their regular Job Classifications to which they have indicated they will acceptrecall. It is agreed that this provision applies, for any employee, only in those cases when the immediate effect of a workforce reduction would be the layoff of another employee.
40
3.	When it has been determined that a layoff will exceed two (2) days, the Company will, wherever possible, give forty-eight (48) hours written notice to the Union and employees to be affected. Any employee eligible to exercise his/her plant seniority for bumping purposes must do so within five (5) days from the date he/she become eligible. If he/she fails to exercise such right, he/she shall automatically waive his/her right to bump until such time as he/she may again qualify to bump as specified in Article XI of the Article of Agreement.

However, if after an agreement has been reached based on the seniority records being correct, and they are found incorrect and a mistake in selection of an employee has been made based on incorrect records, the mistake will be corrected and the Company will be liable for retroactive pay.
6.	In cases of layoffs and recalls from layoffs, the Company shall make every effort to avoid layoff or recall during the period in the work week when such action will not afford the employee work for at least thirty-two (32) hours during the week.
7.	As herein set forth, it is the obligation of the Company to recall from layoff first, the employees with the greatest plant seniority, provided such employees have the required ability and skill to perform such jobs as may be available.
8.	When reducing working forces on any Job Classification, except those listed
41
in paragraph b(7) below, the following procedures shall apply:
a.
b.

(2)	The Human Resource Department and the Grievance Committee shall temporarily assign employees removed from their jobs to other jobs on the basis of seniority and their skill and ability. Such temporary assignment shall not exceed a period of seven (7) calendar days, except as provided in paragraph (6) below.

(5)	No employee while working on a temporary job by virtue of being bumped or accepting transfer to avoid layoff shall acquire permanent claim to such temporary job.
(6)	Temporary job openings due to sickness and disability shall be filled by temporary placement of available and/or qualified
42
employees on a week to week basis. When such openings exceed eight (8) weeks duration, the Human Resource Department and the Grievance Committee shall investigate the situation and determine whether the opening should be subject to the bumping procedure.
(7)	In no event shall senior employees be laid off while junior employees are retained, provided that such senior employees can satisfactorily perform the jobs involved after two weeks on the job, except that for the following job classifications such employees must be able to satisfactorily perform all aspects of the job immediately:
Tapper-Furnace Helper	Furnace Operator Combined
Electrician	Charger Craneperson
Maintenance Mechanic	Lab Helper/Foss

b.	To exercise this preference the employee must notify the Human Resource Department within seven (7) calendar days of his/her desire to do so. Such request will be applicable for a period of two (2) years from the date of layoff.
c.	Employees hired under this provision will not be required to serve the
customary probationary period or work at a probationary rate of pay. However, they will serve the normal trial period, not to exceed thirty

e.	Plant seniority in the new plant shall begin with the date of lure upon
successful completion of the trial period.
f.	This provision applies only when there is a bargaining unit vacancy to
be filled by a new hire and no requirements are established herein which limit or change the Company's luring rights beyond that expressly stated.
10.	In cases involving bumping, layoffs, and recalls, if, after applying the provisions of Section 11-6, the seniority of employees involved is equal, family status shall be the governing factor. If tire family status is equal, tire employees shall draw lots.

Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), all employees who have been employed for at least twelve (12) months and have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours during tire past twelve (12) months, are entitled to an unpaid leave of absence of up to twelve (12) weeks for the following reasons:
1.	Birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child; (leave must be taken before the end of the first 12 months following the date of birth or placement);
2.	Serious health condition of a spouse, child or parent of the employee, (i.e. inpatient care, continuing treatment by a health care provider, etc. as defined by the Act and its Regulations); or
3.	Employees own serious health condition.
Before taking any unpaid leave, an employee must use any accrued sick days, personal days and vacation he/she has available. His/her total leave however, paid and unpaid, cannot exceed the limits set forth in the collective bargaining agreement with the Union. If an employee and his/her spouse both work for Cambridge-Lee Industries, Inc., the combined total amount of leave they both can take is twelve (12) weeks for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a sick family member.
56
An employee must notify the Human Resource Department at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date Inis/her leave is to begin. Such advance notice is not required in cases of medical emergency or other unforeseen events. In the event of an unforeseen situation (i.e. medical emergency), documentation pertaining to said situation will be required no later than seven days (7) after the incident. In those cases, an employee should provide as much advance notice as is practical. A Doctor's Certificate is required for all leaves due to the serious health condition of the employee, or the employee's spouse, child or parent.

Employees will not receive a point for FMLA leave and they will not receive perfect attendance for the month. The Company will continue to cover an employee under the Group Health Insurance Plan while he/she is on a leave pursuant to this Act under the same conditions that coverage would have been provided if an employee had not taken a leave. If an employee does not return to work after a leave, tire Company is entitled by law to recover from an employee the premiums it paid to continue his/her Health Insurance benefits. An employee will not be obligated to repay this amount if an employee can not return to work due to his/her serious health condition, the need to care for the serious health condition of a family member or due to other circumstances beyond his/her control. Documentation will be required if an employee can not return to work due to one (1) of these reasons.
To insure adequate manpower needs, it shall be tire policy of the Company to hold a vacancy created by an employee who remains on Family Medical Leave, regardless of whether or not it is job related, for a period not to exceed that which is provided for in the Seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The employee will have the right to return to the same position or, if same position is not available, to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits and working conditions at the conclusion of the leave.
The time limits may be greater than is required by law due to the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Union, but at no time can this policy afford less protection to the employees than is provided by the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
The Company shall assign maintenance and/or electrical employees among all of its currently operating (as of May 15, 2012) Berks County facilities, as needed. Before requiring such employees to move from the facility where they hold seniority rights, volunteers will be sought. Employees volunteering must have required skills to perform required tasks. If sufficient volunteers are not obtained, employees will be forced to accept such assignments by reverse seniority (junior employees), again, provided such employees have the skill and ability to perform required tasks.
Staffing levels at the Plants will be determined by the Company based on operational needs, project and breakdown requirements and manning required for normal maintenance tasks. Movement among the Plants will be kept to a minimum to accomplish these goals. A centralized maintenance shop may be established.
Prior to working alone in an unfamiliar situation, maintenance and/or electrical employees will work with other skilled trade employees to insure that safety issues are addressed.
It is not the Company’s intention to purposely use its ability to layoff skill trade employees at one facility to later transfer them to another facility to deny premium pay opportunities to those employees who normally perform such tasks at said other facility.
