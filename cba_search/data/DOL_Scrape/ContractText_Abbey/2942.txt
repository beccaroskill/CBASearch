Each permanent employee* in this unit who is not on unpaid leave of absence shall, as a condition of continued employment, become a member of the appropriate local union represented in negotiations by the ACEA, Local 3090, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (hereinafter referred to collectively as Union), or pay said Union a service fee in an amount not to exceed periodic dues and general assessments of the Union for the term of this MOU, or a period of three (3) years from the operative date of this article, whichever comes first; provided, however, that said fee shall not be assessed in any biweekly pay period in which the affected employee is not paid a minimum of 38 hours. Such amounts shall be determined by the Union and implemented by the City in the first payroll period, which starts 30 days after written notice of the new amount is received by the Controller. (*A permanent employee is defined as one who has completed six continuous months of City service from his/her original date of appointment.)
3
b. Notwithstanding any provisions of Article 2, Section 4.203 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) to the contrary, during the term of this MOU, payroll deductions requested by an employee in this Unit for the purpose of becoming a member and/or to obtain benefits offered by any qualified organization other than Union, will not be accepted by the Controller. For the purpose of this provision qualified organization means any organization of employees whose responsibility or goal is to represent employees in the City's meet and confer process.
2.	The CAO and the Union shall jointly notify all new members of the representation unit that they are required to pay dues or a service fee as a condition of continued employment and that such amounts will be automatically deducted from their paychecks. The religious exclusion will also be explained. The cost of this communication and the responsibility for its distribution shall be borne by the City.
B.	EXCEPTIONS
1.	Management, Supervisory or Confidential Employees
In accordance with Section 3502.5(c) of the Government Code, the provisions of this article shall not apply to management, confidential, or supervisory employees.
a.	Management and confidential employees shall be as defined in Section 4.801 and designated in accordance with Section 4.830.d. of the LAAC.
b.	Supervisory employees shall be defined as follows:
"Supervisory employee" means any individual, regardless of the job description or title, having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if, in connection with the foregoing, the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment. Employees whose duties are substantially similar to those of their subordinates shall not be considered to be supervisory employees.
4
Management shall designate supervisory employees. Said designation or claim shall be reviewed jointly by the City and the Union. Any dispute shall be referred to the Employee Relations Board for resolution.
2.	Religious Objections
Any employee who is a member of a bonafide religion, body, or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting public employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support the organization. Such employee shall in lieu of periodic dues or agency shop fees, pay sums equal to said amounts to a nonreligious, non-labor charitable fund exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which has been selected by the employee from a list of such funds designated by the parties hereto in a separate agreement. Such payments shall be made by payroll deduction as a condition of continued exemption from the requirements of financial support to the Union and as a condition of continued employment.
C.	MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
1.	The Controller shall cause the amount of the dues or service fee to be deducted from twenty-four (24) biweekly payroll checks of each employee in this unit as specified by the Union under the terms contained herein. "Dues," as distinct from "service fee," shall be the result of voluntary consent in the form of a payroll deduction card signed by the individual employee.
a.	Remittance of the aggregate amount of all dues, fees and other proper deductions made from the salaries of employees hereunder shall be made to the Union by the Controller within thirty (30) working days after the conclusion of the month in which said dues, fees and/or deductions were deducted.
b.	A fee of nine cents ($.09) per deduction shall be assessed by the City Controller for the processing of each payroll deduction taken. The City Controller will deduct the aggregate amount of said fees on a biweekly basis.
2.	The Controller shall also apply this provision to every permanent employee who, following the operative date of this article, becomes a member of this representation unit, within sixty (60) calendar days of such reassignment or transfer. Such deduction shall be a condition of continued employment.
5
3.
Management will provide the Union with the name, home address, and employee number of each permanent employee.
4.	The Controller shall provide the organization, at least monthly, a status report showing all changes in the employment status of employees in this unit which affect the applicability of the provisions of this Article to those employees.
D.	UNION RESPONSIBILITIES
1.	The Union shall keep an adequate itemized record of its financial transactions and shall make available annually to the City Clerk, and to all unit employees, within sixty (60) calendar days after the end of its fiscal year, a detailed written financial report thereof in the form of a balance sheet and an operating statement, certified as to its accuracy by its president and the treasurer or corresponding principal officer, or by a certified public accountant.
2.	The Union certifies to the City that it has adopted, implemented and will maintain constitutionally acceptable procedures to enable non-member agency shop service fee payers to meaningfully challenge the propriety of the uses to which service funds are put. Those procedures shall be in accordance with the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1, AFT, AFL-CIO, et al. v. Hudson, 106 S. Ct. 1066(1986).
3.	Except for claims resulting from errors caused by defective City equipment, the Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City against all other claims, including costs of suits and reasonable attorney’s fees and/or other forms of liability arising from the implementation of this Article. It is also agreed that neither any employee nor the Union shall have any claim against the City for any deductions made or not made, as the case may be, unless a claim of error is made in writing to the Controller within thirty (30) calendar days after the date such deductions were or should have been made.
6
E.
RESCISSION
The agency shop provisions herein may be rescinded in accordance with the procedures contained in Rule 12 of the Employee Relations Board adopted January 11, 1982.

ARTICLE 8	REST PERIOD
Each employee shall be granted a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes rest period in each four (4) hour period; provided, however, that no such rest period shall be taken during the first or last hour of any employee's working day nor in excess of fifteen (15) minutes without the express consent of the designated supervisor.

ARTICLE 9	EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

ARTICLE 11	USE OF CITY FACILITIES
Union may use City facilities, on prior approval, for the purpose of holding meetings to the extent that such facilities can be made available, and to the extent that the use of a facility will not interfere with departmental operations.

ARTICLE 12	SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS
Section I
Safety clothing and devices currently provided by Management shall continue to be provided, as long as the need exists; Union will encourage all members of the Unit to utilize said safety clothing and devices to the fullest extent possible.
Section II
Management will make every reasonable effort to provide safe working conditions. Union will encourage all members in the Unit to perform their work in a safe manner. Each employee should be alert to unsafe practices, equipment and conditions, and should report any hazardous condition promptly to his/her immediate supervisor. Said supervisor must:
A.	Correct or eliminate the hazardous condition if correction or elimination thereof is within the authority and capability of the supervisor; or
B.	Safeguard a hazardous condition in such a manner as to preclude injury to personnel and/or property damage, and promptly report the nature and location of the hazardous condition to the next level of supervision designated by departmental
8
management for said purpose, if elimination of the hazardous condition is not within the immediate supervisor's capability.
If elimination of the hazardous condition is not within the capability of the second level of supervision to correct, he/she shall promptly report the problem to the next designated level of supervision or inform the Departmental Safety Coordinator about the problem.
Section III
If the procedures for handling a reported hazardous condition are not initiated, or if initiated, fail to effect a satisfactory solution of the problem within a reasonable time, the employee or his/her representative may call the City Occupational Safety Office and report such hazard.
Unresolved complaints hereunder may be referred to the State Safety Engineer for processing under the CAL/OSHA rules and regulations.
Section IV
Any pregnant employee whose job duties require frequent and extended operation of a video display terminal (VDT) may request a temporary reassignment of duties, if the employee’s treating physician certifies in writing that discontinuance or reduction of the employee’s operation of such VDT’s is medically indicated. In such event, Management will make a reasonable effort to realign the duties of the employee to perform other available and necessary duties, within the specifications of the employee’s class in the department in order to avoid such operation of VDT’s to the extent recommended by the treating physician.
Section V
Any employee in this Unit who is a frequent operator of VDT equipment may request Management to provide applicable accessories for the workstation (i.e. copy holder, separate lamp, non-reflective glare filter and/or a hood to be attached to the display unit screen). Management will evaluate the request and will provide the necessary item(s) for the workstation, subject to availability from City Stores and budgeted funds for this purpose.

Whenever written departmental working rules are established or changes are made to existing written departmental working rules which affect conditions of employment, Management shall, prior to the proposed implementation date, notify Union in writing and offer the opportunity for Union to meet and discuss the changes with Management.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as a limitation of the right of Management to implement new written department working rules or make changes in such existing rules in cases of emergency. Provided, however, when such new work rules or changed existing work rules, as the case may be, must be adopted immediately, without prior notice to Union, notice shall be given and the opportunity for discussion shall be given at the earliest practical time following the adoption of such new work rules or changes in existing written department work rules, as the case may be.
Union agrees to notify Management promptly of its intent to exercise its rights granted under this Article.
ARTICLE 14	PERSONNEL FOLDERS
An employee shall be entitled to review the contents of his/her official departmental personnel folder at reasonable intervals, upon request, during hours when his/her personnel office is normally open for business. Such review shall not interfere with the normal business of the department, office or bureau.
No disciplinary document shall be placed in an employee's official departmental personnel folder without providing said employee with a copy thereof. This provision shall not apply to documents placed in said folder prior to April 17, 1979.
After a disciplinary or adverse document has been in an employee's personnel folder for a period of one year, Management will look favorably upon the employee's request to place
10
a statement in the employee's personnel folder, showing that the employee's performance has improved.
A written reprimand or "Notice to Correct Deficiencies" may be sealed upon the written request of an affected employee if he/she has not been involved in any subsequent incidents that resulted in written corrective counseling or other management action for a period of four (4) years from the date the most recent notice was issued or management action taken. (It is mutually understood that in the Police Department a "Notice to Correct Deficiencies" is not considered a form of discipline and a copy is not placed in the departmental personnel folder. Written reprimands will not be sealed in the Police Department. Employees may request, instead of sealing, that such documents be stored separately from the official departmental personnel folder. These documents shall be accessible only to selected departmental personnel.)
If sealing or removal to separate storage is not approved, the reason for denial of the request shall be discussed with the employee. Written requests and responses, and the reasons for not sealing the document(s) shall not be placed in the personnel folder and shall not be grievable.
The existence of all documents, including sealed or separately stored documents, must be acknowledged by the department and be available upon subpoena or other appropriate request.

An impasse in meeting and conferring upon the terms of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding is not a grievance.
Section II	- Responsibilities and Rights
A.	Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed to apply to matters for which an administrative remedy is provided by the City Charter. Where a matter within the scope of this grievance procedure is alleged to be both a grievance and an unfair labor practice under the jurisdiction of the Employee Relations Board, the employee may elect to pursue the matter under either the grievance procedure herein provided, or by action before the Employee Relations Board. The employee's election of either procedure shall constitute a binding election of the remedy chosen and a waiver of the alternative remedy.
B.	No grievant shall lose his/her right to process his/her grievance because of Management-imposed limitations in scheduling meetings.
15
C.	The grievant has the responsibility to discuss his/her grievance informally with his/her immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will, upon request of a grievant, discuss the grievance with him/her at a mutually satisfactory time. The grievant may be represented by a representative of his/her choice in the informal discussion with his/her immediate supervisor, and in all formal review levels provided, however, that when more than one employee is aggrieved and the facts and issues of the alleged grievance are the same and if all affected employees agree to waive their right to discuss the grievance with their immediate supervisor, a single immediate supervisor will be designated to discuss the grievance at the informal level with one affected employee and the employee's representative. Such grievance will be processed as a single grievance through all formal levels of review.
All affected employees involved in the action must waive their respective right to discuss the grievance at the informal level with their immediate supervisor on a form provided by Management prior to the discussion with the designated supervisor.
D.	The time limits between steps of the grievance procedure provided herein may be extended by mutual agreement, or by mutual agreement, the grievant and Management may waive one level of review from this grievance procedure.
E.	Management shall notify Union of any formal grievance filed that involves the interpretation and/or application of the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding, and a Union Staff Representative shall have the right to be present and participate in the discussion at any formal grievance meeting concerning such a grievance. If Union Staff Representative elects to attend said grievance meeting, he/she shall inform the head of the department, office or bureau of his/her intention. Union is to be notified of the resolution of all other formal grievances.
Section III	- Procedure
The grievance procedure for employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding shall be as follows:
Step 1 - Informal Discussion
The grievant shall discuss his/her grievance with his/her immediate supervisor on an informal basis in an effort to resolve the grievance and said grievance shall be considered waived if not so presented to the immediate supervisor within ten (10) calendar days following the day during which the event upon which the grievance is based occurred.
16
The immediate supervisor shall respond within five (5) calendar days following his/her meeting with the grievant. Failure of the immediate supervisor to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next step.
Step 2 - First Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on a form provided by the department, office or bureau upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 2 within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance response at Step 1. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and his/her representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next level of review.
Step 3 - Second Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on said form upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 3 within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the Step 2 grievance response. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and his/her representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process his/her grievance at the next level of review.
Step 4 - General Manager/Commission Review (Third Level of Review)
If the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on said form upon his General Manager or designee within seven (7) calendar days following receipt of the grievance response at Step 3. Failure of the grievant to serve such notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance. If such notice is served, the grievance shall be heard by the General Manager or his/her designee, or in the case of departments under the administrative control of a board of commissioners, by the Commission or the General Manager or their designee, as shall be determined by the head of the department involved. The General Manager/Commission or their designee will afford the parties an opportunity to present oral and/or written arguments on the merits of the
17
grievance and shall render to the grievant and his/her representative, if any, a written decision within thirty (30) calendar days from the date said arguments were submitted.
Step 5 - Mediation
If the written decision at Step 4 does not settle the grievance, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such response, the grievant and Union jointly may request mediation by letter to the Employee Relations Officer. This step is optional. Either the grievant/Union or Management may waive mediation and proceed directly to arbitration. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a request for mediation, the Employee Relations Officer shall either return the request without action or request that the Employee Relations Board appoint a mediator. The Employee Relations Board shall attempt to obtain the services of a mediator from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. If a State mediator is unavailable, Union and Management may jointly agree to a mediator selected by the Executive Director of the Employee Relations Board. The fees of such mediator shall be shared equally by Union and Management.
The primary effort of the mediator should be to assist the parties in settling the grievance in a mutually satisfactory fashion. The mediation procedure shall be informal. Court reporters shall not be allowed to be present, the rules of evidence shall not apply and no record shall be made. The mediator shall determine whether witnesses are necessary in the conduct of the proceedings.
If settlement is not possible, the mediator may be requested to provide the parties with an immediate oral opinion as to how the grievance would be decided if it went to arbitration. Such opinion shall be advisory only. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, the mediator may be requested to furnish such opinion in writing, along with a brief statement of the reasons for the opinion. Such opinion as well as anything said by the parties during mediation shall not be used during any subsequent arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, and Section 4.865 of the Employee Relations Ordinance, the parties may, upon mutual agreement, agree to accept the opinion of the mediator as binding, in lieu of arbitration.
Step 6 - Arbitration
If the written decision at Step 4 or mediation does not settle the grievance, the grievant and Union jointly may serve upon the head of the department, office or bureau a written notice that a written request for arbitration has been filed with the Employee Relations Board. The request for arbitration must be filed with the Employee Relations Board within fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of service of the written decision of the General Manager/Commission or their designee. Failure of the grievant and Union jointly to serve a written request for arbitration with the Employee Relations Board within said period shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
18
If such written notice is served, the parties shall meet for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator from a list of seven arbitrators furnished by the Employee Relations Board, within seven (7) calendar days following receipt of said list.
A.	Arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be limited to the formal grievance as originally filed by the employee to the extent that said grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved. The proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with applicable rules and procedures adopted or specified by the Employee Relations Board, unless the parties hereto agree to other rules or procedures for the conduct of such arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties involved, it being mutually understood that all other expenses including, but not limited to, fees for witnesses, transcripts, and similar costs incurred by the parties during such arbitration, will be the responsibility of the individual party incurring same.
B.	The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be binding upon the parties concerned, except for grievances involving the Harbor Department, Library Department and Department of Pensions, which shall be advisory only.
C.	The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of grievances hereunder shall not add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of this Memorandum of Understanding.
ARTICLE 20	GRIEVANCE REPRESENTATION
Union may designate a reasonable number of grievance representatives who must be members of the Unit, and shall provide all departments, offices or bureaus with a written list of employees who have been so designated. Management will quarterly accept changes to the list presented by the Union. A grievance representative, if so requested, may represent a grievant in the presenting of grievances at all levels of the grievance procedure.
The grievant and his/her representative may have a reasonable amount of paid time off for this purpose. However, said representative will receive paid time off only if he/she is a member of the Union and the same Unit as the grievant; is employed by the same department, office or bureau as the grievant; and, is employed within a reasonable distance from the work location of the grievant.
If a grievance representative must leave his/her work location to represent a grievant, he/she shall first obtain permission from his/her supervisor on a form provided for such purpose. Permission to leave will be granted unless such absence would cause an undue interruption of work. If such permission cannot be granted promptly, the grievance
19
representative will be informed when time can be made available. Such time will not be more than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding scheduled days off and/or legal holidays, after the time of the grievance representative's request unless otherwise mutually agreed to. Denial of permission to leave at the time requested will automatically constitute an extension of time limits provided in the grievance procedure herein, equal to the amount of the delay.
Time spent on grievances outside of regular working hours of the employee and/or his/her representative shall not be counted as work time for any purpose. Whenever a grievance is to be presented during the working hours of the grievant and/or his/her representative, only that amount of time necessary to bring about a prompt disposition of the grievance will be allowed.
ARTICLE 21	EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
Meetings at reasonable intervals will be scheduled at the request of a designated Union representative (paid Union staff representative or executive board member) or the Management representative of a department, office, or bureau, for the purpose of informally discussing employer-employee relations problems.

Management agrees to contribute a monthly sum not to exceed $471.94 per month per fulltime employee, effective the beginning of the pay period in which the Kaiser yearly premium rate change is implemented, toward the cost of a City-sponsored health plan for employees who are members of the Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System (LACERS).
Effective January 1,2002, Management agrees to contribute for each full-time employee who is a member of LACERS a subsidy equal to the cost of his/her medical plan, not to exceed $524.66.

During the term of this MOU, Management's monthly subsidy for full-time employees shall increase by the increase in the Kaiser Permanente family rate. Increases in this monthly
23
subsidy shall be effective at the beginning of the pay period in which the Kaiser Permanente yearly premium rate change is implemented.

I.	An employee who works on any holiday above will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (154) for each hour worked, in addition to his/her regular compensation for the day, provided, however, that the employee has (1) worked his/her assigned shift immediately before and his/her assigned shift immediately after the holiday, or, (2) prior to such holiday Management has authorized the employee to take paid leave time off in lieu of the requirement to work said shifts. Any employee who fails to meet these requirements will be paid at the rate of one hour for each hour worked.
J.	For each holiday listed above which results in time off with pay for employees working a Monday through Friday work week, employees who are scheduled to work other than the Monday through Friday work week shall be entitled to such day off with pay or shall be compensated in accordance with all pertinent provisions (B through I above).

29
transfers to intermittent without having taken any unspecified holiday shall not be entitled to such holiday while in intermittent status.

ARTICLE 33	OVERTIME
A.	Assignment of Overtime
Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work location. In the assignment of overtime under this provision, however, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular work. The parties understand that no employee shall work overtime without prior approval from his or her supervisor and that unofficial overtime “white time” is absolutely prohibited; all hours worked by FLSA non-exempt employees shall be recorded on their time sheet. FLSA non-exempt employees may not work outside of scheduled working hours, or during unpaid meal periods, without the prior approval of a supervisor consistent with department policy. Failure to secure prior approval may result in discipline.

B.	Non-emerqencv Overtime
Whenever Management deems it necessary to perform non-emergency work on an overtime basis, employees required to work will be given at least forty-eight (48) hours notices whenever possible.
C.	Rate and Method of Overtime Compensation - (FLSA) Non-Exempt Employees
Compensation for overtime shall be for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek including all absences with pay authorized by law.

D.	Compensated Time Off
Employees may, subject to Management discretion, be permitted to accumulate up to 80 hours of compensatory time off (CTO). On occasion, employees may accumulate CTO in excess of 80 hours for a temporary period of time. If an employee does not schedule and take CTO over 80 hours prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the overtime was worked, Management may require employees to use CTO prior to the end of the fiscal year; require employees to use such time in lieu of vacation (unless the mandatory use of CTO would result in the loss of vacation accumulation) or other leave time; or authorize cash payment. In the event sufficient funds are not available to provide cash compensation for all or a portion of the CTO hours in excess of 80, Management may extend the time limit for a period not to exceed one year. Notwithstanding the above, departments may exceed the overtime limits specified above during the term of this MOU only; departments must be in full compliance with these provisions by June 30, 2004.
In accordance with FLSA, no employee shall lose CTO. Employees shall be permitted to take CTO for overtime worked upon request unless granting of such time would “unduly disrupt” the operations of the City department. This standard does not apply to non-FLSA overtime (i.e. overtime earned pursuant to this agreement that does not meet the FLSA definition of overtime).
Under no circumstances shall compensated time off (CTO) in excess of 240 hours be accumulated.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.110 of the LAAC, the following provisions shall apply to part-time employees covered by this MOU.
General Provisions
1.	Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.117 of the LAAC and in any Departmental Personnel Ordinances to the contrary, a work schedule of less than the number of hours of full-time employment shall be considered part-time employment. The following categories of part-time employment are hereby defined:
A.	Half-time: Half-time employees are employees regularly assigned to a work schedule of half-time (1040 hours) or more in any calendar year, but less than full-time. Compensation shall be prorated on the basis of the total number of hours scheduled to be worked in relationship to the total number of hours required for full-time employment in the class of position. Benefits for such half-time employees provided in this MOU apply to these employees on a prorated basis.
Note: Only civil service half-time employees are eligible to work more than a half-time schedule in any calendar year.
47
B.	Intermittent: Intermittent employees are employees assigned to a regular or on-call work schedule of less than half-time of the available working time (less than 1040 hours) in a service year. Compensation as established in Appendices A through E of this MOU shall be considered full remuneration for intermittent employees defined by this Article. Employees who are compensated by the session and employees who hold more than one intermittent position concurrently, regardless of total number of hours scheduled, shall be considered intermittent employees.
2.	It is hereby agreed that all part-time employees that are hired after July 24, 1989, into classifications in this bargaining unit shall be notified at the time of hire whether such appointment is half-time or intermittent. Half-time employees shall be advised of their eligibility for prorated benefits, and intermittent employees shall be notified that they shall not be entitled to benefits, except as described in paragraph 7b below.
3.	It is understood that Management has the right to determine the work schedules and hours of all intermittent and half-time employees. However, when an employee has been working a consistent half-time or more work schedule, departments will provide reasonable opportunities for the employee to make up unpaid absences due to authorized leave or holidays in order to maintain half-time status. Such accommodation shall be subject to budgetary and workload considerations.
4.	Any changes to sick leave, vacation, and holiday benefits for part-time employees contained in this MOU shall apply to employees hired subsequent to July 24, 1989. Intermittent employees receiving such benefits prior to July 24, 1989, shall be eligible to continue to receive them, as long as these employees retain their intermittent status without a break in service.
Benefits for Half-time Employees
5.	Benefits of half-time employees are normally calculated on the basis of the number of hours an employee is regularly assigned to work. Civil service half-time employees may be assigned to work and be compensated for hours in excess of those regularly assigned. Such hours are referred to as extra-time hours. Half-time employees shall receive prorated benefits for extra-time hours under the following conditions:
48
a.	Prorated extra-time benefits are additional sick and vacation leave for regular civil service half-time employees who are compensated in excess of their regularly assigned 1040 hours during the year but less than full-time. The year is defined as the Controller’s 12-month W-2 calendar year.
b.	Extra-time benefits shall only be calculated for employees who remain in halftime status for the entire year. Employees who change between half-time and full-time during the W-2 year shall not be eligible for extra-time benefits.
c.	Employees shall not receive more than ninety-six (96) hours of 100% sick leave and forty (40) hours of 75% sick leave in any W-2 calendar year, regardless of status or number of hours worked.
d.	In accordance with Administrative Code Section 4.254, employees are permitted to accumulate vacation not to exceed two (2) annual vacation periods, and all accumulated vacation not to exceed two (2) annual vacation periods, and all accumulated vacation leave in excess of such amount shall be deemed waived and lost. Employees will be notified of their extra-time vacation two pay periods prior to the actual accrual.
Employees who are awarded additional vacation time benefits as a result of extra-time worked will be responsible for the monitoring of their time. All awards in excess of maximum accumulation will be lost and cannot be reinstated.
e.	All prorated sick and vacation leave benefits will be determined by reports prepared by the Controller’s Office following the end of the Controller’s W-2 calendar year. The implementation of all benefits will be subject to the receipt of the required reports from the Controller’s Office to determine the appropriate benefits for all affected employees.
f.	Extra-time benefits shall become effective upon the date the MOU is implemented. Under no circumstances will there be any benefits provided for extra-time hours worked prior to that date. Prorated extra-time vacation and sick leave benefits will not be awarded until the Controller has provided sufficient documentation for the departments to verify extra time vacation and sick leave benefits.
6.	Half-time employees who immediately prior to such appointment were on intermittent status, and who completed six consecutive months of City service and were compensated for less than 2,000 hours during the preceding two years, shall be allowed to carry over into the 100% sick leave bank up to a maximum of 16 hours
49
of unused compensated personal time off (CPTO). Any unused CPTO in excess of 16 hours shall be deemed waived and lost. Such employees shall immediately begin accruing vacation and sick leave and become eligible to use sick leave and holiday benefits at the appropriate prorated rate. Employees shall not be eligible to use vacation benefits until one year from their anniversary date. Their anniversary date shall be based upon the date they were designated as half-time employees. No such benefits shall be provided retroactively. This paragraph shall not preclude an appointing authority from changing an intermittent employee’s status to half-time anytime following appointment.
Benefits for Intermittent Employees
7.	a. Effective January 1,2000, intermittent employees, except those employees who were receiving benefits in accordance with Section 5f of this Article,_shalI be eligible to accrue compensated personal time off (CPTO) at a rate of 2.75 minutes for every hour compensated. Employees must complete a period of six consecutive months of City service and must have been compensated for at least 500 hours before qualifying to use the CPTO. This benefit may be used in no less than one-hour increments for the following:
1.	Sick leave;
2.	Personal business, subject to approval of the supervisor;
3.	Holidays assigned off. When a holiday falls on an employee’s assigned schedule and the employee is not required to work on that holiday, an employee may request to use CPTO. If the qualifying employees choose not to use CPTO for the holiday, the employees may be allowed, subject to the approval of the supervisor, to adjust their work schedules and make up the time in full not later than the next succeeding payroll period.
CPTO may be accumulated for up to a maximum of 48 hours. Any time accumulated in excess of such amount shall be deemed waived and lost.
There shall be no payment of any form for unused personal time upon separation from City service for any reason.
Employees who hold more than one intermittent position concurrently shall be eligible to accrue CPTO in only one position. Employees should designate a primary employing department in writing with their primary and secondary employing departments and with the Controller’s Office. If an employee fails to designate a primary employing department, the Controller’s Office will designate the first department to hire the employee as the primary employing
50
department. Employees may change their designated primary department during the Open Enrollment period of October 1 - 31. If an employee changes departments outside the Open Enrollment period, the Controller’s Office will designate the first department to hire the employee as the primary employing department, unless the employee notifies the Controller’s Office otherwise within 30 calendar days of the effective date of the change.
Employees who are paid per diem or by the session shall not be eligible to accrue CPTO.
7. b. Notwithstanding paragraph 2 above, an employee hired on an intermittent basis who, following two consecutive years of City service, has been compensated for 1000 or more hours during each of the two consecutive service years shall be considered a half-time employee and become entitled to qualify for prorated benefits provided to half-time employees. Upon designation as half-time under these circumstances, such employees shall be allowed to carry over into the 100% sick leave bank up to a maximum of 16 hours of unused CPTO. Any unused CPTO in excess of 16 hours shall be deemed waived and lost. Such employees shall immediately begin accruing vacation and sick leave, and become eligible to use vacation, sick leave and holiday benefits at the appropriate prorated rate. Their anniversary date shall be based upon the date they are designated as half-time employees. No such benefits shall be provided retroactively. This paragraph shall not preclude an appointing authority from changing an intermittent employee’s status to half-time anytime following appointment to an intermittent position.
ARTICLE 50 SCHEDULE CHANGES FOR PERSONAL BUSINESS
Management may allow an employee time off with pay, not to exceed eight hours in any one payroll period for personal business (except for changes on the 9/80 day off or the split day) provided that such time off so allowed shall either be made up in full within the same workweek that time is taken or charged against the employee’s accrued and unused vacation or overtime bank on an hourly basis. Employees on a FLSA 7(b) work period shall either make up this time in full within the same pay period that the time is taken (as long as hours worked do not exceed 56 hours in a workweek or 12 hours in a day) or charged against the employee’s accrued and unused vacation or overtime bank on an hourly basis.
51

Therefore, any use of FLSA compensatory time off under this Section shall extend the employee’s family or medical leave by the total amount of FLSA compensatory time off used.

A.	Absence at Higher Level Position
Whenever Management assigns an employee to perform the full range of duties of a higher level position (in a class for which the duties and responsibilities of the current class would provide qualifying experience for the higher level class*) due to the temporary absence of the higher level incumbent, such employee shall become eligible for additional compensation upon completion of a qualifying period of fifteen (15) consecutive working days in such assignment at his/her regular rate of compensation. Such additional compensation shall begin on the 16th consecutive working day in such assignment. For employees assigned to a modified work schedule, such as 9/80 or 4/10, compensation shall begin on the next day following the completion of 120 consecutive hours of assignment.
Approved leave time off taken during a qualifying period shall extend the 15-day (or 120 hour) qualifying period by the length of absence. All other absences shall constitute a disqualifying break in the qualifying period requirement, necessitating the initiation and completion of a new qualifying period.

C.	Compensation
An employee qualifying for additional compensation as stated above shall receive salary at the second premium level above the appropriate step rate of the salary range prescribed for his/her class, for each day on duty in an acting assignment. However, the maximum pay rate for such duty shall be limited to the top step of the salary range that has been established as compensation for the higher level position to which the employee has been assigned.

ARTICLE 57	WORKERS’ COMPENSATION
Management shall provide Workers' Compensation benefits in accordance with Section 4.104 of the LAAC, except that salary continuation payments during absences for temporary disability conditions shall be in an amount equal to the employee's regular biweekly, take-home pay at the time of incurring the disability condition. For purposes of this Article, take-home pay shall be defined as an employee's biweekly gross salary rate
61
less the mandatory deduction for Federal and State income tax withholding and employee retirement contributions.

ARTICLE 58	EXPANDED SERVICE HOURS - LIBRARY DEPARTMENT
The Library Department will expand hours of operation on an agency-by-agency basis and maintain the expanded hours in a manner consistent with the terms as set forth in the agreement. The resources that will be used on a system-wide basis may include, but not be limited to, agency regular staffing, use of substitutes, part-time employees working extra time, and the use of overtime for regular full-time employees. Under the expanded hours of service proposed for the Los Angeles Public Library, all Clerical and Support Services Unit employees will be required to work no more than a one-in-four rotation of Sunday work assignments, except for emergency situations.
It is the understanding of the parties to this MOU that the Sunday work shift shall normally consist of five hours of work and that full-time employees scheduled to work the Sunday shift shall be compensated for a full workday (8 hours). Employees who work the reduced 72 hours per pay period schedule for the purpose of this agreement shall be considered full-time employees. Part-time employees shall be compensated for only the hours that they work. Sunday compensation shall not be considered as a premium or bonus compensation, unless it results in overtime as defined in Article 33 of this MOU, and the employee’s hourly rate shall not change as a result of the reduced hour shift. It is also understood that if an employee is required to work more than five hours on Sunday, no additional compensation for full-time employees will be provided, as long as the Sunday shift does not exceed eight hours.
The Board of Library Commissioners is committed to providing the fairest work schedules possible to its employees, while providing the highest level of public service possible with the resources available. However, notwithstanding any of the above stated terms and conditions, nothing contained in this MOU shall be construed to limit the Board or the Library Department’s ability to adequately staff and provide public service at all of its agencies. Nor shall it be construed that, by entering into this agreement, the Board or the Department will relinquish any of its management rights to assign staff as required to serve the needs of the City during the term of this MOU or after it has expired. Nor by this agreement shall it be construed that the Clerical and Support Services Unit has relinquished any of its rights under the City’s Employee Relations Ordinance or applicable law during the term of this MOU or after it has expired.
62
ARTICLE 59	AMENDMENT OF MOU TO INCLUDE NEW CLASSES
Upon written notification from the CAO to the Controller, this MOU shall be amended to incorporate the class and salary of any class accreted to this bargaining unit after the adoption of the MOU.
ARTICLE 60	WORK SCHEDULES
Pursuant to FLSA, employees shall have a fixed workweek that consists of a regular recurring period of 168 consecutive hours (seven 24-hour periods) which can begin and end on any day of the week and at any time of the day. The designated workweek for an employee may be changed only if the change is intended to be permanent and not designed to evade overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Management may assign employees to work a five/forty, four/ten, nine/eighty, or other work schedule. Employees may request modified work schedules, if such schedules are generally available in the employee’s department/work group. Management may refuse such requests, or require employees to revert to a five/forty work schedule, provided the exercise of this right is not arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. In the event Management’s actions are shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory before an arbitrator, the award of the arbitrator shall be to reverse the action of Management. However, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding or advisory, in accordance with Article 19 (Grievance Procedure).
Employees on a nine/eighty modified work schedule shall have designated a regular day off (also known as a 9/80 day off) which shall remain fixed. Temporary changes to the designated 9/80 day off at the request of Management or the employee is prohibited unless it is intended for the employee to work additional hours (overtime).

ARTICLE 62	FULL UNDERSTANDING
A.	This MOU sets forth the full and entire understanding of the parties regarding the matters set forth herein, and any other prior or existing understandings or agreements by the parties, whether formal or informal, regarding any such matters are hereby superseded or terminated in their entirety.
B.	Except as specifically provided for herein, the parties to this MOU, voluntarily and unqualifiedly waive their respective rights to meet and confer in good faith during the term of this MOU, with respect to any subject or matter covered herein, or with respect to any other matters within the scope of the meet and confer in good faith process. However, this Article shall not be deemed to preclude mutually agreed upon meet and confer in good faith sessions for the purpose of altering, waiving, modifying, or amending this MOU.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:
C.	No alteration, variation, waiver, modification or amendment of any of the Articles, terms or provisions requiring approval of the Council contained herein, shall in any manner be binding upon Union or Management unless and until jointly recommended in writing to the Council and approved and implemented in accordance with Article 2.
D.	The waiver of any breach, term or condition of this MOU by any party to this MOU shall not constitute a precedent in the future enforcement of all its Articles, terms and provisions.
ARTICLE 63	CONTINUATION OF MERIT PRINCIPLES
1.	Statement of Intent. At the time of execution of this MOU, applications for special reorganization of the City of Los Angeles have been filed in regard to the San Fernando Valley and Harbor Area and are being processed by the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission (“LAFCO”). The completion of these proceedings could result in bargaining unit employees being transferred to another public entity during the term of this MOU (hereinafter referred to as “Transferred Employees”). Former California Government Code §56844.2 provides:
Status of public employees under special reorganization; Collective bargaining agreement; Retiree benefits; Representation
(a)	This section shall only apply to a special reorganization.
65
(b)	All public employees to which Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3500) of Division 4 of Title 1 applies shall continue to be deemed public employees of the original local agency or of the newly incorporated local agency for all the purposes of that chapter, including, but not limited to, the continuation and application of any collective bargaining agreement that applies to these employees, and all representational and collective bargaining rights under that chapter.
(c)	Any existing collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect and be fully binding on the original local agency or on the newly incorporated local agency, and on the employee organizations that are parties to the agreement for the balance of the term of the agreement, and until a subsequent agreement has been established.
(d)	Any existing retiree benefits, including, but not limited to, health, dental, and vision care benefits, shall not be diminished.
(e)	Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an employee organization that has been recognized as the exclusive representative of local agency public employees affected by a special reorganization shall retain exclusive representation of the unit employees of the original local agency, or of the newly incorporated local agency.
In consideration of this provision of law, it is the intent of the parties to this MOU to provide in this article, to the extent permitted by law, that Transferred Employees will enjoy certain substantially similar civil service and other protections for the term of the MOU, as described in paragraph 2 below, as they would have enjoyed if they had not been transferred, without unduly constraining the operations of the new jurisdiction. In the event that this article, or any part of this article is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that event shall not affect the validity of enforceability of the other articles of this MOU. However, if any provision of this article is judicially determined to be invalid, said provision or part shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable but the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
2.	Merit Principles. If a new jurisdiction that has become subject to this MOU pursuant to former California Government Code §56844.2 fails to adopt or enforce laws which provide, in substance for the employment principles listed below, or those laws do not remain in effect for Transferred Employees during the entire term of this MOU, the following provisions shall apply to Transferred Employees:
A.	Examinations: All appointments shall be based on merit. All candidates taking a competitive examination shall be given a score and placed in a rank based
66
on the whole score. The appointing authority shall select from the top three ranks. Applicants who receive a passing score on the examination shall be given a 5% credit added to their whole score for military service, if such persons have served in the armed forces of the United States during time of war or armed insurrection, or during any time when the United States engaged in active military operations against any foreign power, provided such person has been honorably discharged from active service during the five years preceding the examination. All candidates taking a competitive examination for promotion shall receive a credit for past service, the amount of which may be determined by the new jurisdiction prior to the examination.
B.	Probation: The probationary period for persons appointed in the class of Police Officer shall be eighteen months, measured from the commencement of recruit training. The probationary period for persons appointed in management classes shall be twelve months. The probationary period for persons appointed to entry level positions shall be six months, except that the new jurisdiction may establish a longer period, not to exceed 12 months, if the period is set in advance of the examination and after public hearing. The probationary period for all other non-entry level positions shall be six months, except that the new jurisdiction may establish a shorter period, if the period is set in advance of the examination and after public hearing.
C.	Transfer: An employee shall be allowed to transfer into an equal or lower paying class without further examination, provided he or she possesses the minimum qualifications and the capability of performing the required duties, in the following situations: (a) the employee is incapable of performing his or her duties because of injury, sickness, or disability; or (b) the employee has completed a probationary period.
D.	Layoffs: Any layoff shall be based on seniority in that the employee with the least amount of seniority within the class-group shall be laid off first. Seniority shall be calculated as including all service within the class-group plus any service in a higher class. Any employee laid off shall have the right to revert to a vacant position or displace (“bump”) a person in a lower class-group if there are no vacant positions, provided the displacing employee has (a) prior service in the lower class-group and (b) greater seniority than the employee being displaced.
E.	Discipline: An appointing authority may suspend or discharge an employee but only for cause.
67
F.	Military Leave: An employee who leaves his or her position to serve in the armed forces of the United States shall be entitled to a leave of absence and, upon returning from military service, restoration to his or her position, subject to applicable state and federal law and as further provided by ordinance.
G.	Non-discrimination in benefits: There shall be no discrimination in the provision of employee benefits between employees with spouses and employees with domestic partners.
These provisions (A-G) shall be deemed to be modified to conform to Los Angeles City law in effect on the effective date of the special reorganization.
3.	Disputes. The grievance procedure shall not apply to disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this article, unless any such dispute would be grievable by a Los Angeles City employee as a matter of law. The new city may directly and immediately incorporate the limitation in the preceding sentence into its Employee Relations Ordinance or Resolution. Such incorporation does not preclude the Union thereafter from seeking its modification or removal.
4.	No Waiver. Except as provided in 1J3, this article shall not be construed as a waiver by the Union of any right it might have under law to meet and confer over the impact that any transfer of employees to another public entity may have on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.

SENIOR CLERK TYPIST AT EL PUEBLO
The undersigned parties agree to the following:
1.	The following salary note will be added to the MOU for the period indicated:
One position of Senior Clerk Typist at El Pueblo occupied by Julie Sandoval while she is regularly assigned to coordinate part-time staff and dissemination of El Pueblo Monument literature shall receive salary at the fifth premium level above the appropriate step rate of the salary range for the class, inclusive of all bonuses, for the period July 1, 2002, through December 31,2004.
2.	The grievance filed by Julie Sandoval is withdrawn without admission by either party as to the merits of its position.
3.	The CAO will draft a notification explaining that department personnel do not have the authority to promise employment in any job including promotions and pay grade advancements. These representations are contrary to the Charter mandated civil service system. Only the Civil Service Commission can make position allocation decisions and the CAO pay grade determinations. Consequently, employees may not rely on any such guarantees of employment or promotion in making employment decisions. AFSCME will publish the notification in a mutually agreed upon vehicle and format within 45 days of receiving it from the CAO.
4.	It is mutually understood that this agreement constitutes the full and entire understanding of the parties regarding this issue and shall not constitute a precedent in the future enforcement of any terms and provisions and shall not be used by either party in any grievance or arbitration.
