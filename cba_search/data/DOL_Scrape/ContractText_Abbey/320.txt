An employee shall not be eligible for classification under a classification description by reason of performing isolated or singular duties described In a classification description.
3.	Where work assignments are not adequately nor specifically described, such work assignments shall be appraised and accordingly classified as belonging under the most appropriate classification description, by considering the relative degree of complexity or level of difficulty of said work assignments in comparison with comparable work operations described in the classification descriptions. It is understood that each classification description is to be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a specification of job standards which are definitive of the Job requirements of that particular classification.
131
APPENDIX »A’
4.	An employee shall be entitled to a classification under a classification description when the employee is regularly required to perform work operations which meet the specifications described in paragraph (2) and supplemented by other paragraphs herein for a substantial portion of their working time.
5.	An employee normally performs some of the work of a higher classification in order to qualify for advancement and some of the work of lower classifications when required. The normal duties of any employee may include some of the work of related classifications when required. The normal duties of any employee may include giving assistance, guidance and instructions to other employees.
6.	A classification description shall not be construed so as to restrict in any manner the rights of the Company to assign work to employees nor to grant or concede an employee or group of employees any right to refuse to perform assigned work for the reason that such work is not described specifically in the classification description of their classification. Further, where operations or machines are referred to as a singular in a classification description it is not to be interpreted or construed as limiting the employee to a specific machine or operation described In his/her classification description.
7.	An employee is required to perform the work operations and duties described in or appraised as being covered by a classification description and shall receive that degree or amount of quality guidance or instruction which is considered usual and normal.
8.	When a work operation or function is described in the same manner in more than one classification description such work operation or function shall not be used to determine the proper classification of an employee. Such work operation is not a distinguishing element or a determinant of a level of difficulty but only stated for descriptive purposes or because It is such an integral and necessary part of the job that its omission would be undesirable from the standpoint of completeness. In determining the proper classification for an Individual employee, the determination of whether he/she is performing the work requirements or work operations set forth In the classification description shall be the controlling consideration.
9.	The duties of an employee in any classification or lead may include any of the functions In the classification, and will, as necessary, include the use of the hand and power tools, test or other equipment, jigs, fixtures, templates, or other tooling normally associated with or required In the performance of the duties set forth In the Classification Description; and include improvising shop aids, and rework and repair as required to accomplish the assigned work.
132
APPENDIX “A’
10.	Any employee so authorized may operate moving, handling or measuring equipment, such as fork lifts, power tugs, pendant cranes, transits, levels, etc. when used to accomplish work of his/her classification. Any employee whose principle assignment is to operate such equipment on a fiiU-tlme basis will be classified accordingly.
11.	The attached "Glossary" shall be used to establish the definitions and meanings of certain words and phrases used in the classification descriptions herein; for all other definitions and meanings of words, Merriam Webster's dictionary shall be used. These precepts and principles shall be used to interpret the Intent of any classification description and shall be followed when classification descriptions are revised and added to the Plan.
133
A GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND PHRASES AS USED IN THE DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT COMPANY CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTIONS
In the preparation and application of the classification descriptions, the following terms and words are given definitions and meanings in order to clearly indicate the common and consistent interpretation to be placed in them by al) persons using the classification descriptions:
1.	ADAPT TOOLING

2.	ANGLE. COMPOUND
Means the angle between the two non-coinciding sides of two oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side In common. Making a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from the bolding within tolerances of two adjoining component angles.
3.	AS DIRECTED
Means that some determinations connected with the work operation described are usually and normally made by others and are given or made known to the worker directly concerned with the assignment Use of this term does not mean that the details and determinations Involved need be repeated each time an identical or very similar work assignment is made or work operation performed, nor does it preclude use of independent judgment by the worker.
4.	AS REQUIRED
Means that the work operation function or job duty is usually and normally performed after or as a direct result of an order, work assignment or request from recognized supervisory personnel and/or is used to mean an occasional or incidental job requirement The intended meaning is evident from the nature of the job duty described.
5.	ASSEMBLY JIGS
Are those which facilitate holding and aligning a set of parts for fabrication or assembly operations.
6.	ASSISTS
Assist means to help or aid other employees in the performance of certain work where the higher graded employee assumes responsibility and where the assistance consists of performing certain portions of the assigned work either in direct coordination of carrying out details of the total assignment under the direct guidance of the higher graded employees. The worker assisted is held responsible for the satisfactory completion of such work assignment. The assisting worker Is not expected Io work wholly Independently but rather cooperatively and, further, is entilled to and should receive the guidance and instruction considered usual and normal under these circumstances.
134
7.	BLUEPRINTS. DETAIL
Are any class of blueprints which give necessary detailed information for fabricating one or more parts.
8.	BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL ASSEMBLY
Are blueprints which provide information for assembling parts together with the necessary information for making some or all of the individual parts.
9.	BLUEPRINTS, DETAIL PARTS
Are blueprints which give the necessary information for making one part in any required number, all of which must be interchangeable.
10.	BLUEPRINTS, MAJOR ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION
Are blueprints which provide information for the installation and/or assembly of fabricated and accessory parts into the airplane during final assembly, and for the construction of such major assemblies as fuselage, wing, empennage and engine control stand.
IL BLUEPRINTS, MINOR ASSEMBLY
Are blueprints which furnish the worker with information for assembling a number of parts; these blueprints frequently also serve to give information for routing the component parts into the assembly department
12.	CHECK, FUNCTIONAL
Means to determine or ascertain whether a unit of or portion of a system performs the function for which it is intended and if not, whether rework or alteration is required. Checks of this nature Include checking lines for leaks, wires for breaks by buzzer, bell or other continuity checks, and checking response to controls ns on landing gears.
13.	CHECK, OPERATIONAL
Means making a complete check of an entire independent system, after such system has been installed in its entirety Infor on the aircraft. Such systems to include the complete electrical system, beat and vent system, hydraulic system, engine controls system, surface controls system, radio and/or radar system. A thorough knowledge of the shop theory involved in the Individual system is required.
14.	CHECK, VISUAL
Means detecting with the naked eye, or with such aids as mirrors, obvious defects and imperfections. Its use implies sufficient knowledge and familiarity on the part of the worker to make the required identification. Such check would uncover incomplete assembly (missing parts or operations!, visible surface cracks, badly driven rivets, and similar conditions.
135
15.	CONTOUR
Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths all of which lie in parallel planes or the same plane, such planes being perpendicular to the curved surface, or means a curved Une having radii of different lengths all of which are in the same plane. The surface of a cone or section thereon, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the curved layout Une guiding the making of a router block are examples. Contour surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section of a circle are excluded since the radii are the same length.
16.	CONTOUR. COMPLEX
Means a curved surface of unusual intricacy and variability.
17.	CONTOUR, COMPOUND
Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths which He In non-parallel planes. Compound contours are typical of stretch press and drop hammer dies. The surface of a sphere or section thereon would be u regular compound contour and, in general, was meant to be excluded.
18.	CONTOUR, REVERSE
Means a compound contour that reverses Its curvature so that it has both concave and convex portions.
19.	COORDINATED TOLERANCES, COORDINATED
DIMENSIONS
These expressions arc used only when exacting tolerances are implied, i.e., exacting tolerances are to be associated always with "coordinated dimensions", "coordinated tolerances” unless modified expressly. 11 should be understood that the mere location of a point by two or more reference dimensions does not in itself mean that the dimensions themselves are coordinated. An example of truly coordinated dimensions is shown in the following: The precision dimensions between two holes must be held while al the same time the precision dimensions locating each of the holes must also be held with respect Io another reference point or line.
20.	DEVELOPMENTAL PARTS
Are parts which are intended for use on experimental or developmental aircraft (i.e., one or a few aircraft designated as being actually or potentially subject to major modification or change). These are usually produced singularly or in small lots using standard tooling, improvised tooling or newly constructed production tooling. Its use In a classification description does not imply a restricted level of difficulty unless such intention is clearly and specifically indicated.
21.	DRAW, DEEP
Means the relation of depth or draw to its other dimensions Is such that it is distinguished from moderate or shallow draws by custom.
22.	DRAW, DRAWING
Means the forming of sheet metal or other material by pressing it Into a die while al the same time retarding movement of the metal into the die by mechanical holding ns with draw rings.
136
23.	EXPERIMENTAL PARTS
Are parts which are intended for use on experimental or developmental aircraft. These are usually produced singularly or In small tots using standard tooling, Improvised tooling, or newly constructed production tooling. Its use in a classification description does not imply a restricted level of difficulty unless such intention is dearly and specifically indicated.
24.	EXPERIMENTAL WORK. DEVELOPMENTAL WORK (Does)
Means to experiment with the process or operation (assembly and/or fabrication) in order to develop new or Improved methods, or means to build or make new assemblies and installations where exercise of a thorough knowledge of the shop theory involved is necessary and further is a recognizably difficult assignment which is characterized by requiring ingenuity to accomplish the assignment satisfactorily. It does not include work done by a usual or established manner, process or operation on a part even when such part will later be used on an experimental or prototype aircraft
25.	FABRICATES COMPLETELY
Means to perform ail necessary fabrication operations required to produce a finished article ready for use in an assembly, aircraft or the plant
26.	FABRICATION FABRICATES
Means work operations on raw materials and partially manufactured parts which increase Its or their value and utility.
27.	HANDTOOLS
These include hand tools normally used by the workers in the performance of the classification, such as files, rasps, deburring tools, chisels, saws, hand drills, screw drivers, pliers, wrenches, hammers, mallets and punches.
28.	HAND TOOLS. MACHINISTS'
No definite distinction is implied by prefixing ''Machinists" to "Hand Tools*'. Use of this or other trades' names as Carpenters', Instrument Makers’, Electricians' and Masons' does not imply a strict limitation on Hand Tools used; e.g^ wire cutters (Electricians') might be used by a Mason laying wire reinforced brick or tin snips (Sheet Metal Workers') by a Carpenter to cut a square of sheet metal to cover a knot bole.
29.	HOLDING FIXTURES
Refers to tooling designed to hold the work so that machining installation, assembly or layout operations are facilitated.
30.	HOLDING FIXTURES, PRODUCTION
Are those designed to hold or align one part or one assembly. Holding jigs are included in this class.
31.	HOLDING FIXTURES. STANDARD
Are those which can be used on a wide variety of parts and which are usually found in all well equipped shops of similar nature. They are a portion of the Standard Tooling category concerned principally with holding the work.
137
32.	IMPROVISES AND ADAPTS STANDARD TOOLING
Means to use standard tooting (see definition) tn order to secure and align part or otherwise aid or expedite fabrication. It Implies that exercise of skill and ingenuity is required and the problems involved are not solved by standard or simple means.
33.	IMPROVISE TEMPORARY TOOLING
See "Improvise Tooling". Means, in addition, that the tooling ts intended for temporary use only and is made or adapted from equipment, material and tooling on hand.
34.	IMPROVISE TOOLING
Means that a worker, to accomplish a given task, recognizes the need for and exercises the ingenuity and skill to create a mechanical aid which will permit doing the work with greater exactness, rapidity and/or facility. The fact that tooling is improvised need not affect the classification since it might be simple or complex, necessary or unnecessary, authorized or unauthorized.
35.	LAY'OUT (nt, LAYS OUT (v)
Means the actual marking of locating and/or reference points and lines on the material, part, tool or assembly worked on. Layout in itself does not imply a high level of difficulty or skill since it can be a simple work operation such as measuring a length on a piece of lumber and making a line or point at which it is to be sawed, making lines on pavement with a chalk line preparatory to painting, or scribing around a furnished template laid on flat stock. On the other hand, layout can be a difficult work operation which requires much skill, knowledge and experience to make the necessary computations, part setup, precise measurements and markings, and interpretation of complex blueprints such as on a complex die or casting requiring layout to establish locations for coordinated hole patterns, compound angles and/or irregular contours.
36.	LAYOUT. PROGRESSIVE
Is the layout for a machining or other fabricating operation which is continued (or completed) after the fabrication operation has been performed. Progressive layout Is often necessary when initial machining operations would remove scribed reference marks for subsequent operations, or is advantageous when the machining operation produces a good reference plane or point for further layout operations.
37.	LAY.QUT OF EART
Means the marking of points and lines which will determine the exact nature and dimensions of the part after machining or fabrication operations have been performed, layout of this nature is an integral and necessary step in the fabrication of the pari.
38.	LAYOUT OF REFERENCE LINES AND POINTS
Means the marking of points and tines to aid or guide the worker In performing a given operation, it often indicates points and lines from which precision measurements will be taken although the points and lines themselves need not have been located exactly, layout of this nature s often optional rather than necessary as the purpose can be to reduce the number of measurements, limit gross errors, or to permit working to closer than specified tolerances.
138
39.	MANUFACTURING OUTLINE SHEETS
These sheets or cards furnish al) or some of the following information: the order or sequence in which operations are to be performed, the tools to be used, the production tooling available and its tooling identification number, machine feeds and speeds, and special manufacturing instructions, if any. This refers to operation sequence sheets, process sheets, operational sheets or cards, manufacturing operation cards, and other written information ftirnished the operator of the same nature and for the same use and purpose.
40.	MAY
When used, indicates a job requirement of some of the plants of the company and is considered to be of the same level of difficulty as other requirements not so qualified.
41.	PRODUCTION AIDS
Are devices initiated voluntarily and made by the worker to facilitate work operations, increase production or reduce elements of fatigue or strain. Such devices are usually simple but Ingenious in nature.
42.	PRODUCTION ILLUSTRATIONS
Are blueprints or sketches which are used as an aid in visualizing parts and/or their assembly and are usually isometric, perspective, pictorial or third angle projection drawings. Blueprint dimensions might be shown also.
43.	PICKUP WORK: PICKUP
Means the performance out of usual or normal sequence work operations which have been omitted by intention or of necessity (as part shortage or rushed schedule) or by oversight (as failure to drill a hole, make a cutout, or install a part). Pickup work does not of itself establish a high or higher level of difficulty since work done out of sequence is very often of the same difficulty or within the same level of difficulty as when done in sequence. Therefore, the level of difficulty intended is to be determined from the job description and compared with the actual pickup work in question.
44.	REPAIR
Means to restore a part or assembly to its original state or utility after It has been damaged by accident or by wear. It does not have the same meaning as "Rework".
45.	REWORK
Means to undo and then do over work previously accomplished (normally by others) in order to correct errors or make it conform to changed specifications. Rework can be simple or difficult according to its nature and variety; therefore, the level of difficulty intended is to be determined from the composite classification description. (See repair).
139
46.	SETUP (nk SETS UP(v)
Is a broad term which becomes specific only according to Its usage and application to machines and/or operations concerned. Il indudes the various necessary physical work operations or steps, (other than layout) which must be accomplished before actual fabrication can proceed. Setup of a machine might include securing material to machine bed at the proper angle for cutting, selecting, aligning and setting cutting tool, setting speeds and feeds, adjusting coolant flow. In most assembly operations, setup (e.g^ positioning parts, obtaining parts) is so closely intermingled with fitting and joining together that setup is not customarily designated as such (this is generally true of operations where machine operation is not the primary job factor).
47.	SHOP PRACTICE
Means the generally accepted method of performing a basic, common, or usual operation under specified conditions. It covers the knowledge which is common to the occupation Itself and to most manufacturing shops using the operation under consideration. Besides knowledge and ability to use required hand tools and equipment, it includes knowledge of general safety practices, conduct, rules of cleanliness, neatness, good housekeeping and care of equipment When used in the phrase "shop practices and procedures”, practice need not imply other than practices or methods teamed or acquired at any one shop.
48.	SHOP PROCEDURE
Means the way custom and management of the particular company require, wish or specify the work to be performed. It includes the departmental and company rules, procedures and policies made known to the employee for his/her Information and expected compliance. Il covers or implies having sufficient knowledge of organization, management, and physical details of the company to perform satisfactorily the required work in a generally harmonious manner.
49.	shqpthf,qry
Means the comprehensive craft knowledge and special skills associated with the particular trade and related trade without which advanced work of high quality, quantity, and uniformity may not be performed. A thorough knowledge of shop theory is considered necessary to accomplish the more difficult and diversified work of a classification and includes a real understanding of the capacities as well as limitations of the machines and skills used in the trade. Il implies a knowledge of "why" as well as "how" a given task should be done. It is acquired by a combination of observation, experience and schooling.
50.	y^NPARI)JN_t)t-;SIG,\
Means that construction and purposes are common to the company or shop. It implies that lower level of difficulty is involved than when "not standard In design" is used.
140
51.	TEND
Means that an automatic or almost automatic function is taking place which requires little or no direct control by the worker. To "tend" a machine would include watching its operation after the setup has been made (usually by others), periodically checking work produced, starting and stopping, loading material in machine, removing finished part, making minor adjustments to machine which do not involve extensive knowledge of setup, and notifying proper personnel when machine or part trouble develops.
52.	TOLERANCES, CLOSE
Means those tolerances which are held by the machine, operator and/or fixture without great or special care, effort or skill on the part of the worker. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement
53.	TOLERANCES, EXACTING
Means those tolerances which require special care and attention on the part of a skilled worker to obtain or hold. These tolerances would be difficult, If not impossible, for a semi-skilled or unskilled worker to hold consistently at a good production rate. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement
54.	TOLERANCES, LIBERAL
Means those tolerances which are left to the judgment of the worker and are of such nature that variation by the worker will not result in appreciable spoilage, damage or uneconomic operation. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement
55.	TQLER^NCE^MQDERATF,
Means those tolerances which must be observed to maintain proper standards of workmanship or economy, but which require only reasonable care or skill to hold. This term expresses a level of difficulty rather than a preciseness of linear, angular or other measurement
141
56.	TOOLING. PRODUCTION
Is specially designed tooling to facilitate production operations on any number of same or similar parts. This type of tooling is developed to hold regular and irregular shaped parts in proper machining position, and io minimize or eliminate setup and layout. This is a general term usually associated with machining operations on lot or mass production parts and assemblies.
57.	TOOLING STANDARD
Means those tools or tooling used on the same or different types of machines or operations, principally in making a setup for either layout or machining and occasionally for bench or assembly work and which further are found commonly in nearly ail shops and industries performing similar operations. In the machine shop it would include Vee-blocks, parallel bars, angle plates, chucks, collets, machine vises, a wide variety of damps, bolts, locks and wedges. In bench or assembly work It would include surface plates, table vises, and various common attachments used on portable and stationary tools to permit holding the work or increasing the scope of the tool.
58.	TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE
Training refers to time to acquire skill through instruction, demonstration and controlled or practice operation. Experience refers to time to acquire skill through actual performance of the work itself or of pertinent elements of closely related work. Training does not include schooling or forma) training in reading, writing and simple arithmetic since this is basic for al) aircraft occupations. More advanced formal training which would substitute directly for Job techniques normally acquired by actual experience on the Job such as shop algebra, shop geometry, shop trigonometry, blueprint reading, lofting practice and technical trade knowledge can be counted as equivalent training and experience in the case of an individual worker.
59.	UNUSUALLY AND IRREGULARLY SHAPED
Means that the parts deviate sufficiently from usual and standard parts as to require exercise of ingenuity and original thinking to properly and satisfactorily fabricate them.
60.	VARIABLE
Means a different degree or form of the same kind of thing.
61.	WHEN REQUIRED
Means that the work operation, function or Job duty is usually and normally performed after or as u direct result of an order or request from recognized supervisory personnel and/or means that it is required or necessary only rarely or when exceptional circumstances exist.
62.	LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
Means that where an employee is required by local, State or Federal law to possess a license and/or certificate to perform the required job duties, the said local. State or Federal law shall supersede the requirements expressed in Douglas Classification Description. Responsibility for obtaining said license or certificate shall rest with the individual performing such Job duties.

Updated: 4/24/95
During the recently concluded negotiations, the parties extensively discussed and negotiated provisions regarding the retention and/or accumulation of bargaining unit seniority when bargaining unit employees leave the bargaining unit and then return to the bargaining unit.
Since some misunderstanding has arisen with regard to Paragraph 707, the parties agree that this paragraph applies only to employees affected since the effective date of the new collective bargaining agreement - 2/24/75. It was not the intent of the parties that this paragraph affected employees who left and returned to the bargaining unit under prior collective bargaining agreements and were in the bargaining unit on 2/24/75 and subsequently remain in the bargaining unit
