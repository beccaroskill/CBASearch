LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
During the collective bargaining negotiations which preceded the 1997 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Union proposed that the term “necessary qualifications” be changed to the term 'capable” wherever that term was used in applicable seniority provisions of the 1992 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
43
The parties have agreed to make the language in the Collective Bargaining uniform by substituting in applicable places “capable” wherever “necessary qualifications” or “qualified" had been used.
In doing so, the parties agree that the appropriate interpretation of the word “capable” shall be as follows:
1.	With respect to selection of employees under Section 9 of Article Five (excepting those positions for which the Agreement sets forth other methods of selection), the term “capable shall be interpreted to mean that the employee has the appropriate physical fitness and agility to perform the work duties involved, and, after being placed on a job, demonstrates within a reasonable period of time that he or she has the capability to leant and perform the functions required of the job”.
2.	With respect to all provisions concerning layoff and recall from layoff, the term “capable” shall be interpreted to mean:
(a)	With respect to rolling into or being recalled to an equally rated or lower rated job classification that the employee has the appropriate physical fitness and agility to perform the work duties involved, and after being placed on the job, demonstrates during a trial period that he or she has the capability to leam and perform the functions required of the job.
(b)	With respect to rolling into or being recalled into a higher rated job classification, that the Company has determined that the employee has the necessary ability to perform the job functions.
It is understood that such determination by the Company shall not be made arbitrarily, and upon request, the Company shall explain all reasons for its determination that the employee is not capable to perform the job in question.
Local Union President	Director of H/R

CONTRACT ADDENDUM EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,2007 to End of 2nd Phase REGARDING BIR PROTECTION.TRANSITION
I,	BIR Job classifications affected:
(a)	The BIR job classifications subject to “Bump and Roll” include the following: Ills, 201s, 801s, PT ilrazers, 901 s(maintenance helpers). These same classifications in Air would not be required to choose to go to BIR until they an: actually affected by the layoff in their departments.
(b)	The BIR and Air classifications that an: exempt from the “Bump and Roll” include the following: PTs, TPTs, 501s, MFTs, TPT Brazers, W01 and Skilled Trades. Th:se same classifications in Air would not be required to choose to go to BIR until they are actually affected by the layoff in their departments.
(c)	Senior Air employees with BIR staying power (Excluding employees in protected jobs in Air and all BIR employees) will bump junior BIR employees according to the classifications allowed (see Article I.a.) as long as the opportunity to bump into the same classification is available. If the same classification is not available, 201s, 801s and PT Brizers will be allowed to choose to transfer to a 111 position.
45
1)	The Company recognizes the lack of incentive for PTs and TPTs to stay in Air and the risk it faces of possibly loosing several to jobs in BIR prematurely. This is a risk that the Company is willing to assume. The Company recognizes that PTs and TPTs have the option to voluntarily resign from the position at any time.
2)	The Company recognizes that senior Truckers could loose the opportunity to truck in BIR but is willing to minimize this possibility by allowing senior Air Truckers preference to bump junior BIR Truckers (per Article I.c.)
(d)	BIR employees that have plant wide seniority to remain as an active employee will retain their cunent classification and will not be subject to being bumped by a more senior Air employee.
II.	Senior Air transfer exceptions/conditions:
(a)	See Article I
(b)	Transfer begins effective 01/08/07
(c)	We will follow seniority order Most senior Air employees will bump junior BIR employees out of seniority order but limited to a group of junior BIR employees based ou a 3:1 ratio (BIR junior employees to senior Air employees) i.e., 15 junior BIR employees to 5 senior Air employees.
(c) If a senior Air employee’s time has come to transfer to BIR and they choose not to go, they must choose to take a voluntary layoff (they will be placed at the bottom of the senior list) but will forfeit any future right to bump junior BIR employees.
46
III.	L‘6 month clause” for Internal bids not applied:
(a)	Senior Air employees’ plant seniority will apply immediately at the time of transfer into BIR (BIT department seniority not applicable for this transition) effective 31/08/07.
(b)	A transfer from Air to BIR will be teated as a job bid per the current contract effective 01/08/07. H owever, employees will not be allowed to bid out of BIR until after the second phase of the transition is complete.
If a senior employee transfers to 3IR, displacing a junior employee, and chooses (per the contract) to bid back to Air (if opportunity permits after phase 2), thi: employee can only return to BIR by a contractual job bid. Tills employee will not be allowed to transfer using this process s gain. This employee may be subject to being laid off even if then: are 11 Is, 201s, 801s and PT Brazers that have less seniority in 3IR. This clause will not apply for PTs, TPTs, MFTs, and TPT Brazers.
(c)	All BIR internal job bids will be pasted plant wide effective 01/08/07, except for jobs involved in the BIR transition or agreed to by the Company and Union.
TV- Transfer plan/schedule:
(a)	We will start out with a transfer of 8 senior Air employees per week effective 01/08/07 using the 3:1 P atio (i.e., most senior Air employees will bump into a group of 24 least senior BIR employees). This process will follow firm a department layoff in Air.
(b)	The number of employees transferred each week will depend directly upon BIR operation performance. Poor quality and/or productivity may slow down this transition and/or put it on hold until the problems are resolved. If the transfer goes better than
47
expected, we will transfer more than 8 senior employees from Air per week.
(c)	The Union president, or designee, can choose to monitor the transfer process to better understand any transfer issues.
(d)	March 9th will be a target transfer completion date for phase one. We anticipate a second phase around August 2007 to be completed in the September - October time frame however, depending upon customer requirements, the Company will start the second phase whenever the first seasonal layoff begins. This transfer process will be used until all senior Air employees are given a chance to transfer. Employees will be required to complete a signed and dated form stating that they were offered a chance to go to BIR.
(e)	Company will train the newly transferred employees according to the following:
1)	The Company will identify senior BIR trainers for each job and use these trainers to train newly transferred Air employees (initially PTs).
2)	As a back up to plan “a” above, Company will use PTs and/or qualified GDWT members to train newly transferred employees.
3)	As a back up and last resort to plans “a" and “b" above, Company will use junior BIR employees (current job incumbent) to train newly transferred Air employees. NOTE: Initial training could last from 1-5 days.
48
V,	Physical Restrictions:
(a) Company will utilize current proc :ss to address medical conditions to include physical restrictions.
VI.	Voluntary Layoff:
(a) Company will eliminate voluntary layo :f clause for current recalls - allowing all employees currently or. layoff to be recalled in seniority order.
1)	The Company will no longer offer the ''oluntary Lay off process in accordance with the current contrict However, employees schedule to transition from Air to 3IR, per the protection transition plan, who choose to take voluntary layoff instead of being transferred to an open BIR positk n will go to the bottom of the recall list.
VII. Modification Clause (ref. Article 5, Sec. 1? current contract):
(a) If potential issues should change in the iiture that would warrant the need for jobs to be placed in the Whirlpool LaVergne facility and it is agreed to by the Company and the Union, then the Company will revert back to the job bid process used by the current contract.
