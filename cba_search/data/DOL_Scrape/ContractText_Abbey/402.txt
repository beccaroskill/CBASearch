Only in cases ofbona fide health and safety issues may a standby be justified. The Un ion pledges in good faith that health and safety will not be used as a gimmick. The employer shall have the option of having the men who raise a question of health and safety stand by until adecision is reached or “working around” thesit-uation until it can be resolved, and no further work shall be performed on that disputed operation until the health and safety issue is resolved.
11,42	Onerous workload exception. Longshoremen on cargo handling operations shall not be required to wotk when in good faith they believe that to do so will result in an onerous workload.

11.421 When a man is directed to take his own relief without a man being assigned to relieve him, this does not automatically present a question of onerousness of work or individual speedup for the men remaining on the job, regardless of the basic gang structure involved. A change in operations or manning to remove unnecessary men, or the handling of larger loads does not, in and of itself, automatically present any question of onerousness of work or individual speedup.

If claims of onerousness are presented in such cases, they shall be referred to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee.
11.4221 The foregoing Section 11.422 is intended to mean that agreements reached on changed operations or reduced manning in accordance with the Contract procedures shall not be challenged as being onerous operations if no further change has been made following such agreement.

CFS PROGRAM FUND
The parties acknowledge their mutual interests in developing productive work opportunities that preserve for dockworkers their work and living standards. Such a program will retain and attract to the industry responsible, reliable and skilled persons whose availability will assure astable work force and will minimize the costs of those industry programs that are now required when work is unavailable.
The parties recognize that the continued movement of container work from the docks jeopardizes their aforesaid mutual interests. They desire to reverse that movement and encourage the establishment, development and growth of efficient and productive container freight stations on the docks to preserve the work which has historically been performed by the longshore work force.
To achieve these ends they have agreed as follows:
(1)	The employers will expend annually during the term of this contract approximately S3 million to be raised upon containerized cargo tonnage. (The reference to a dollar expenditure is not a cap upon the sum the employers may be required to expend annually to achieve the objectives of this program.) The funds shall be managed by PMA and distributed by it to those of its members who operate CFS facilities, such distribution to be on a basis which will encourage the preservation, growth and increase of such container stuffing and unstuffing facilities. PMA will report periodically to the Union on the receipts and disbursements of the Fund.
(2)	The provisions ofthe Container Freight Station Supplement shall not be burdened by arbitration decisions or past practices prior to July 1,1984 whether
189
CFS PROGRAM FUNO
oral or written. Any restrictions on the employer that are in conflict with the provisions of the Container Freight Station Supplement will be considered null and void.
(3)	The partieswill henceforth commit themselves to increasing CFS productivity and the elimination of wasteful work practices.
(4)	The parties agree to set up a joint committee to report periodically to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee on the progress of this program and to make recommendations as to further implementation.
(5)	Disputes which arise with respect to this program shall be first referred to the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee for the port where the dispute may arise and, if necessary, may be referred by either party to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee and dien by either party to the Coast Arbitrator.
(6)	This program may be terminated with the mutual written consent of the parties upon 60 days’ written notice to all employers receiving distributions under this program and, in all events, this program shall immediately terminate if the provisions of CFS Sections 1.5 through 1.543 of the 1970-71 Container Freight Station Supplement and CFS Sections 1 .53, 1.54,1.55 and 1.57 of the amended Container Freight Station Supplement that were entered into February 10,1972 are determined to be legally enforceable.

A.	No Lay Offs
There shall be no reduction in registered longshoremen or clerks’ work force during the term of the Agreement except for normal attrition due to quits, deaths and retirements, and deregistration for cause. This does not preclude the parties from agreeing upon a reduction in force should unusual circumstances develop.

A “Low Work Opportunity Port" (LWOP) situation may include Class B men in a port, or Class A and Class B men in a port, and is described as follows:
1.	When the average Class B hours worked in a port are reduced to one-half or less of the 28-hour PGP guarantee for Class B men for a continuous 6-week period, such situation shall constitute a LWOP for Class B men in that port.
2.	When the average Class A hours worked in a port arc reduced to one-half of the 38-hour PGP guarantee for Class A men for a continuous 6-week period, such situation shall constitute a LWOP for Class A men in that port.

SKILLED HOLDMEN — HOLDMEN CAPABLE OF DRIVING LIFTS
CLRC No. 11, August 5,1966 (Item 2(e))
The Employers stated they will not pay the skill differential to men until they are capable ofdriving lifts.
The Union suggested the approach that where it is recognized at the local level that a gang does not have qualified machine operators therein, then prior to the 2 men receiving the differential, holdmen capable of driving lifts will replace them in the gang.
It is the dispatchers' obligation to make up gangs properly, and this now includes providing 2 holdmen capable of driving lifts.
It was further agreed as follows:
I.	In gang boss ports, it is the gang bosses ’ obligation to see to it the basic gang is properly constituted, and the holdmen capable ofdriving lifts are to be designated by him, where there
215
ADDENDA

are steady men in his gang. In making up gangs, it is the dispatchers' responsibility to see that the basic gang is properly constituted on dispatch;
2.	In all other ports the dispatchers shall dispatch the properholdmen;
3.	Should the employer find there are no holdmcn capable of driving lifts he may—
(a)	Swing in skilled men from the dock who are not on the old or disabled preferential list and swing out the holdmen who were dispatched as the men capable of drivinglifts,or
(b)	Discharge the gang, or
(c)	Cal) for replacements, or
(d)	Suspend the skill differential, and
(c)	Process the complaint through the grievance machinery.
4.	The local LRC's have the discretion of filling these skilled holdjobs with either Class AorClassB longshoremen, and such men are to be regularly attached to the gang.
CLRC No. 21, November 3,1967 (Item 2)
The Committee again discussed the issues in this case and agreed that if there are no lift drivers available, meaning if no lift drivers are employed by the employer in the dock or terminal area, skilled holdmen may operate the lift on the dock for the purpose of bringing or removing gear or other necessary equipment to or from the hatch when no productive work is being performed.

In Lieu of Time
The parties have discussed and have reached agreement on a general rule covering the assignment of work set forth in Sec-. tion 1.6 of the Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement. It was further agreed that the adoption of this general rule for assignment of work under Section 1.6 will not be interpreted to support claims for in lieu of pay for work performed by American * crews under the status quo understanding.
Subject to the foregoing understanding the parties agree:
(I)	Longshoremen shall be assigned to work covered by Section 1.6 commencing when the ship is tied up on arrival and ending when lines are let go for the ship to leave the dock, except for the purpose of shifting within a port. (Shifts between ports shall not be included in longshore work assignment.)
(2)	Exceptions to (1) above are as follows:
(a)	The crew may be used for the complete rigging ofthe jumbo gear.
(b)	The crew may secure gear, lower booms, and swing in bootnsalongside the dock.
(c)	Handling ship’s stores. If loads arc to be built on the dock and ship’s gear is to be used, longshoremen shall build the loads and handle gear to land such loads on deck. During a shift when no longshoremen are employed the crew may use ship’s gear to bring stores aboard.
The agreement to assign the above described work to longshoremen shall not result in the payment of in lieu of time to longshoremen ifsuch work is performed by crew members under the status quo for American ships.

(Reference is made to CLRC Meeting No. 7, May 4. 1961.
Item 3.)
The agreement reached on “In Lieu ofTime” in the meeting of the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee noted above is not to be interpreted so as to supportclaims forin lieu of pay for work normally andproperly performed by American crews under the status quo understanding or to alter such understanding. Thus, the agreement to assign work as described to longshoremen docs not result in payment of in lieu of time to longshoremen if such work is performed by crew members under the status quo for American ships.
Reference is made to thefollowing paragraph os contained in the above noted minutes:
(c) Handling Ship's Stores, if loads are to be built on the dock and ship's gear is to be used, longshoremen shall build the loads and handle gear to land such loads on deck. Duringa shift when no longshoremen are employed the crew may use ship’s gear to bring stores aboard.
The Committee agrees that the crew under the above language would not be used during meal hours or between shifts. Ship's stores may be hand-carried aboard by the crew. If no longshore gangs are on the ship during a shi ft, the crew can use the gear (includes conveyor or sideport operation) and load ship’s stores, including the building of loads.
It was further agreed that: .
I.	Ship’s stores that have been pre-palletized may be hoisted aboard ship (to be thereafter de-palletized and stowed by ship’s crew) by any longshore gang already employed on the
216'

ship providing such a gang has in its complement winch drivers and hatch tender, front men or swingmen to hook on the loads, and sufficient holdmen or swingmen as part of the gang on board to unhook said loads, A gang may be supplemented to reach this complement.
2.	Ship's stores delivered to ship’s side that are to be built into loads on the dock and then hoisted aboard ship to be thereafter de-palletized and stowed by ship's crew can be so built and hoisted aboard with a basic gang that is already employed. Two of the 4 holdmen will assist the front men in building the loads on the dock, and the other 2 holdmen will unhook the loads on the deck.
3.	If longshoremen are directed by an employer to stow the stores in the various appropriate lockers or compartments, the basic 4 holdmen gang must be supplemented by not fewer than 4 swingmen; however, the contractual exception in paragraph 23 of the October 18,1960 Memorandum of Agreement shall apply, and the gang may or may not be further supplemented on the ship or dock, based on the needs of the operation at the employer's option.
4.	Where standing gear is not being used to load stores, longshoremen when employed to load stores under these circumstances shall be employed in such numbers, skilled and unskilled, as required for the particular operation.
The parties agreed that in connection with the above understanding, the matter shall be reviewed by the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee in 90 days or during a subsequent wage review.

Amended in CLRC No. 12, June 23,1962 (Item 1)
The Coast Committee is aware that it has ruled on many disputes on this subject, but desired to define a job of short duration so that it would be clearly understood. The Committee agreed upon the following definition:
An operation of short duration is one which is comprised of the following elements and only when the order is placed for a man of short duration:
I.	It must be 6 hours or less with no meal.
2.	Itpenainstolhemanandnotthegang.
3.	It pertains to a man in a skilled classification (i.e., winch drivers, lift truck operators, bull drivers, etc.).
4.	ft pertains co a specific shift.
5.	It requires a 4-hour minimum guarantee.
6.	It allows a skilled man to be shifted to comparable work on the original ship or dock.
7.	A skilled man may be shifted to comparable work on another ship or dock but if this is done, such a man receives an 8-hour guarantee rather than the 4-hour guarantee.
8.	A skilled man of short duration shall be ordered at regular dispatch to start the job at any time. This does not preclude orders for jobs of short duration during the course ofthe shift where the need could not be foreseen at regular ordering time.
9.	A skilled man of short duration must be one supplementing askilled man ofthe same skill already on the job on the shift in which the requirement for the extra skill man occurs. Each shift stands on its own insofar as employment of short duration is concerned.

ADDENDA
Example 1.	A job of short duration beginning after the midshift meal but not completed by the end of that shift may be continued on the next immediate shift as day follows night or night follows day, with another man employed for a job of short duration.
Example 2.	A job ofshort duration during a given shift and completed before the end of such shift and with cargo operationsnot requiring the man of short duration occurring after his release, may be repeated on the next comparable shift and both such jobs shall be considered as jobs ofshort duration.
Example^, Ajobofshort duration during a given shift and completed at the end of such shift and with cargo operations not requiring a man of short duration at the beginning of the next comparable shift will permit the employment of a man ofshort duration on that next comparable shift.
Example 4. It is not permissible under the Agreement to consider as jobs ofshort duration work which takes a man of short duration to the end of one shift and the start of the next comparable shift. Employment on such a basis will require payment of 8-hour guarantees on both such shifts.

Il is important not to assume that the Employers, PMA or the ILWU know of particular incidents of discrimination or harassment. Discrimination and harassment can be eliminated from the workplace only if everyone working under the PCLCA who experiences or sees such problems files a grievance using the Special Section 13.2 Grievance Procedures for discrimination and harassment.

Physical Harassment.* Unwelcome touching or grabbing or sexual assault, blocking someone's movement, standing unnecessarily close.
Verbal Harassment: Racial or sexual jokes, name-calling, using slurs, derogatory terms, belittling remarks, or abusive language related to a person's gender, race or other defining characteristics.

CLRC No. 1, January 29,1954
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines: There was a general discussion of language pertaining to this subject, wherein the Union stated that they did not expect longshoremen to get paid for observing picket lines, but on the other hand, did not want longshoremen necessarily ordered day after day.

Men or gangs ordered prior to or within 2 hours of such written notice to PMA shall report to work without benefit of coverage of minimum report time as provided in the Agreement.
Men or gangs ordered later than 2 hours following such receipt but prior co the issuance of a determination by the parties through grievance machinery shall, if they accept the order and ■report, be covered by the minimum provisions of the Agreement, provided, however, that failure of the employer to place orders following such receipt shall not constitute any waiver of the employer’s position nor an acceptance of the union’s position, pending decision as hereinafter provided.
Following the establishment of any picket line about the premises of an employer affecting the work of employees covered by ILWU-PMA Agreements, either party may require a meeting of the Joint Labor Relations Committee of the port affected (or an Area Committee or the Coast Committee, if such is agreed to be appropriate) and such meetings shall be held immediately.
The Committee shall promptly examine the facts and issue its written decision as to whether the picket line is legitimate and bona fide under the Agreement. Should a Committee fail to reach such a decision, then either party may refer the matter to the Area Arbitrator for prompt interim decision.

The Employers stated they reviewed the matters discussed at the morning session and fee) the following proposal will meet the needs of both parties:
I.	A guarantee to skilled men regardless of category at a minimum of 173 hours per month at the 25jf’ differential shall be paid to steady employees. Such guarantee shall be paid irrespective of how long an individual is retained during any month as a steady skilled man; provided, however, that should such steady skilled man be released for cause during any month, the guarantee shall be prorated over the period such employee was retained as a steady man;
2.	Should a steady man be upgraded, he will receive the applicable higher skill differential for the balance of the shift regardless ofthe period of time of utilization on the equipment carrying the higher differential;
248
SAN FRANCISCO STEADY SKILLED MEN
ADDENDA
3.	All hours worked (including dead time hours under the 8-hour guarantee) by such steady man will count against his guarantee;
4.	Travel time will not be apart of the guarantee;
5.	The guarantee is not a limitation of the employers’right to work such steady men over and above such guarantee; i.e., the guarantee represents a minimum payment for the privilege of obtaining steady skilled men;
6.	It is not intended to allow an employer to hire steady skilled men so that he may then order longshoremen to make -up a basic gang, thus avoiding using a basic gang from the hall;
7.	Where a skilled man is required for a job of short duration the employer may use his steady skilled men.
The Union members of the Committee agree in principle with the above proposal and as a result thereof, it was agreed that with the above as the basis for the employment of steady skilled men, the employers may begin discussing such employment with the men and employing steady men. It was further agreed the Crane provisions of Section 14 on steady men are retained.

Based upon the common acknowledgment that trained skilled operators are essential to overall efficient longshore operations, the parties agree to the establishment of a Class A Semitractor Dispatch Board.
The creation ofthe Class A Semitractor Dispatch Boardis to assure the dispatch of longshoremen who have been trained to efficiently operate the semitractors which are essential to containeroperations in the port.
The Semitractor Dispatch Board shall be created with dispatch priority to be given to those on the Boards as follows:
I.	First priority shall be given to Class A longshoremen with over 5 years* experience, who volunteer to be on the Board.
263
LOS ANGELESA.ONG BEACH ITTR DAIVEflS
ADDENDA

3.	The next-in-line dispatch sequence for jobs not filled by the Class A Semitractor Board shall be under the principle of low’-man-first to be dispatched on the Jitney Board and then the Low Board dispatch sequence.
4.	The fourth priority shall be given to Class B longshoremen who have completed the ILWU-PMA Semitractor Training Program.
With respect to those Class A longshoremen in 2 above, it is understood that time on the Semitractor Dispatch Board shall count toward meeting the “5 years in the hold" requirement (subject to the necessary waiver being granted by the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee).
The Joint LLRC shall, in accordance with Section 9.4, provide for the appropriate numberofClassAlongshoremen (in 2 above) on the Semitractor Dispatch Board from longshoremen elevated to ClassAstatus after July 1,1987. Any disagreement shall be submitted to the Area Arbitrator for resolution.
Jobs dispatched from the Semitractor Dispatch Boards and semi tractor jobs from the Class B Board must be accepted or a flop shall be given.
The next-in-line dispatch sequence forjobs not filled by the above dispatch sequence shall then go to the next recognized procedure in the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach. Semitractor jobs shall be dispatched at least one-half hour prior to the normal shift starting time.
C.	Monthly Employment
L UTR’s shall, at the Employers’ option, be employed on a monthly basis. These operators can be used against all vessels’ operations as required by the Employer.

3.	These UTR operators shall report to the job one-half hourpriortothe start ofthe shift for workother than actual handling or moving of cargo. The phrase “other than actual handling or moving of cargo’’ is intended to permit the preparation of equipment including chassis for movement to or from the vessel so long as there is no actual movement of cargo directly to or from the vessel.
4.	Employers who elect to employ UTR operators on a monthly basis for both day and/or night operations may order up to 50% ofthe average daily number of UTR operators used against their operations during the previous payroll quarter as recorded by the Joint Dispatch Hall and PMA Allocations. New Employers or new container terminals may employ monthly UTR operators after a payroll quarter of operation, based on the foregoing formula.
5.	All ship operations with monthly UTR operators shall stan on time should the Dispatch Hal) on any given day or days be unable to fill the remainder of UTR operators from the Hall at the start of any shift.
6.	Monthly UTRoperators shall work against vessels as directed, on all UTR rated equipment, providing full flexibility as required by the Employer. Such flexibility shall include all work before vessel’s arrival and after vessel's departure on that shift. (This means cargo preparation for that vessel or dock storage of discharged cargo from that vessel.)
7.	Full flexibility includes the use of monthly UTR operators for utilization between the vesscl/CY and containermove-ments to or from Container Rail Transfer Yards. Other UTR dock work remains as per past practice (i.e., container move
265

ment from vessel toCY, vessel to Rail Container Transfer Yard, CY to Rail Container Transfer Yard and vice versa).
8.	First preference for monthly UTR work shall be given to those individuals checked in on the Dispatch Hall C/L/UTR Board; second preference - Secondary UTR Board; third * low boards; fourth - B Board. Dispatch shall be based on “low man out” (lowest sign-in hours dispatched first). Individuals will have a timely check-in procedure for the 30-day dispatch.
9.	Monthly UTR’s will be responsible for arranging their own relief in accordance with Section 2.3 and subsections of the PCLCD. This allows the Dispatch Hall to dispatch relief UTR jobs on the low-man-out principle.
10.	Four days prior to the end of each month, Employers will notify the Dispatch Hall of their requirement of monthly UTR operators for the subsequent month. The number of such jobs shall be posted by the joint Dispatchers in the Dispatch Hall 3 days prior to the end of the month. On the first day of each month, the dispatch of monthly UTR operators shall occur at a time so as to guarantee arrival of all monthly UTR operators to their Employer one-half hour prior to the start of the shift.
11.	This procedure for the employment and use of monthly UTR operators shall be effective September 1,1990.
12,	The JPLRC shall, after September 1,1991, review the foregoing conditions and consider expanding the utilization of monthly UTR operators by mutual agreement. Any such JPLRC agreement shall be subject to CLRC approval.
13.	Practices as of July 1,1990 with respect to the employment and the utilization of operators from the UTR category shall remain unchanged.
14.	For efficiency of dispatch, monthly employees may be dispatched individually or as units. The dispatching method
266

DISPATCH HAU. COSTS
shall in no way affect the Employers flexibility in utilizing UTR’s as provided for in this document.
DISPATCH HALL COSTS
Effective January 1, 1997, the PMA agrees to be obligated to pay 65% of all 1996 base year Dispatch Hall expenses and the Union agrees that each local will be obligated to pay 35% of all 1996 base year Dispatch Hall expenses. For the purpose of these obligations, the 1996 base year expenses of the Dispatch Halls shall be the January 1,1996, to December 31,1996, equally shared expenses which appear on the audited financial statements. Whenever, due to reduction in dispatch hall costs or increase in the PCL&CA holiday cost, the average cost of a holiday exceeds 15% of the 1996 base year expenses, the Union’s 3 5% share shall be reduced by a proportionate amount allocated to the local dispatch halls administratively by the JCLRC. All additional jointly agreed to expenses above the base year expenses shall be shared equally between PMA and the Local Union. The formula for sharing extraordinary capita! improvements shall be subject to mutual agreement of the parties.
(Notwithstanding the fact that PMA's contribution towards Dispatch Hall costs is by virtue of this Agreement greater than the contribution ofthe ILWU, nothing herein contained or otherwise shall in any way change or modify the basic principle and understanding of the parties as expressed in this Agreement that the Dispatch Halts shall continue in the future, as they have in the past, to be maintained and operated joint ly and equally by the ILWU and the PMA.)

To: Members
SUPERINTENDENTS
During the course ofthe ILWU/PMA1981 negotiations, the Union complained that Superintendents employed by stevedoring companies and steamship companies have been violating the ILWU/PMA Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement by performing work which is contractually defined as jurisdiction belonging to longshoremen and clerks.
We have an obligation under our contracts to refrain from such violations by our Superintendents or other management personnel.
Very truly yours,
Edmund J. Flynn
President
