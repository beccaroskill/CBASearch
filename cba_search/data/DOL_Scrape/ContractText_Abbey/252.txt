LETTER A
Letter of Understanding - Staggered Shift April 29, 2002
Ms. Crystal Harris
Unit President, Local Union 1999-07
United Steelworkers of America
Indianapolis, Indiana
Dear Ms. Harris:
To be able to effectively ship and efficiently manufacture products at the Indianapolis operations, some shift hours must be staggered. This practice will be kept at a minimum and it will not be done to avoid overtime. If problems develop because of a staggered shift, the committee will be expected to bring this fact to the attention of the appropriate manager for an explanation of the reason for the scheduled shift in question.
Very Truly Yours,
AGREED:

LETTER B
Letter of Understanding - Medical/Safety Department Policy April 29, 2002
Ms. Crystal Harris
Unit President, Local Union 1999-07
United Steelworkers of America
Indianapolis, Indiana
Dear Ms. Harris:
This is to confirm the agreements reached during our recent negotiation sessions concerning Medical/Safety Department policies:
Visits to Company Doctor for Non-Occupational/Retum to Work Physical; The Company agrees to the following regarding visits to the off-site Company doctor:
1.	Company medical papers will be given to the second shift employee prior to leaving the Indianapolis Carrier Plant facility if he is required to go to the Company doctor the following day.
2.	The nurse will inform the second shift employee that he can report to the Community Occupational Health Clinic at his convenience but prior to 4:00 pm the following day. However, the employee will be required to return to the plant Medical Department with the Company medical forms after each visit and prior to returning to work. Employees will be required to provide documentation of their arrival and departure in order to qualify for reimbursement as provided in 15.2.
3	A first shift employee requiring a revisit to the Company doctor will
75
be given the Company medical papers when he returns from his previous visit to avoid having to return to the Indianapolis Carrier Plant facility prior to going to the Company doctor on the next visit. However, the employee will be required to return to the Medical Department with the Company medical forms after each visit to the Company doctor.
4.	The Company will pay for parking expenses incurred on an authorized visit to the Company doctor upon presentation of a receipt of said expense.
Our medical policy requires that all employees must pass a physical examination by a Company physician before returning to work if they have been (a) absent for more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days because of personal leave of absence or on layoff because of lack of work or, (b) absent seven (7) consecutive calendar days due to an illness or injury. The Company reserves the right to require an examination even if the period of absence has been shorter than indicated above if die reason for his absence should so indicate.
The Company also agrees to have a qualified medical attendant present in the Medical Department whenever a major production line is running.
Safety Shoes: The Company has made arrangements for employees to purchase safety shoes direct from the shoe mobile, which comes to the plant once per year.
Prescription Safety Glasses: .
1	The Company, will pay for new prescription glasses every two (2) £ years. ;.	-	-
2	.- ■ THe’Company policy on prescription glasses does not apply when an eye examination reveals a change in the individual’s prescription. In
- those instences? the Company will pay for the new prescription with-
76
out regard to a time limit.
3.	Employees assigned to spot welding and/or departments having high metal pitting effect on glasses, the prescription eyeglasses will have plastic lenses. Because of the high risk of pitting to glass lenses and scratching to plastic lenses in spot welding departments, the Company will pay for new prescription glasses more frequently than the two-year period stated in Item #1. The employees, however, are expected to carry out reasonable precautions to prevent damage to the lenses.
4.	The Company will pay for all tinting of glasses, if required and so stated on the prescription, except the tinting known as “shadow gray.” Green tinted glasses (or equivalent (3.0) per the OSHA standard) will be furnished only to the employees required to work in spot welding/brazing areas.
5.	The Company does not pay for the eyeglasses examination.
