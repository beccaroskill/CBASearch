Re: Merchandise Returns and Calculation of Commissions
Dear Mrs. Torres:
This side letter of agreement is to reaffirm the parties* understanding wrh respect to when commissions are earned and how Bloomingdale’s factors in returns with respect to the calculation of commissions paid to employees who are on a commission pay plan. Since at least as far back as the 1950 collective bargaining agreement commissions have been calculated and paid only after “flgt” sales have been determined which is total sales minus returns (identified and unidentified) (1950 CBA, page 5, fD “all departments which presently pay 1% or 2% commission on net sales shall continue such commission payments;** 1974 CBA, p. 65:commission on 40% of net sales by Evening/Satw day employees to be shared by regular employees; 1976 CBA, p. 74: commission on 50% of net sales to be pro-rated; 1989 CBA, p. 17,1|7(a): “Total net sales means total sales (excluding fees and handling charges) net of returns.*^
Commissions are not earned at the point of sale or on sales made in excl uded departments. Examples of excluded departments include but are not limited to: applicable taxes, alteration fees, monogramming, back office discounts, handling fees, delivery fees and gifts with purchase. Commissions are only earned on sales made in non-excluded departments and only after all identified returns and allocated prorata portion of unidentified returns are processed and allocated against an employee’s sales in non-excluded departments for that pay period; and only after all draw/deficit calculations have been completed. Both identified and unidentified returns are allocated against sales during the pay period in which the returns are processed, regardless of when the returned merchandise was sold.
The parties also reaffirm their understanding that the amount (percentage) of returns (unidentified and identified) to be allocated against total sales of each commissioned employe:!! before commissions are calculated has always been a mandatory subject of bargaining and will remain so (1978 CBA, p. 78, p (66%); 1996 CBA, p. 18,2 (80%)).
