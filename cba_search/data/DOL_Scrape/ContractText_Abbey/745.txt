ARTICLE 6:	DISCIPLINE
6.01, Cause for Discharge,
(a)	No regular employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 20.01, shall be disciplined and/or discharged except for just cause. The Employer shall follow a system of progressive discipline. The parties agree that progressive discipline normally requires, prior to suspension or discharge, that an employee be given a written opportunity to correct the
6
Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino
deficiency, but that within the principle of progressive discipline, the Employer may impose immediate suspension or discharge for dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, insubordination, discourteous conduct toward a guest, failure to report to work without just cause, walking off the job during a shift, or drinking alcohol or use of controlled substance, or being under the influence thereof, during the employee's shift.
When an employee who has completed the probationary period is disciplined and/or discharged, the reason therefore will be given to the employee in writing. Based on the Union and Employer’s established practice when an employee is discharged, copies of the written notice to the employee will be sent to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relevant to discipline or discharge, including videotapes, shall be provided to the Union.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent, to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level of .10 provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol. In the event the State of Nevada lowers the legal presumption of intoxication below the .10 level, the contract shall automatically be amended to reflect the lower level.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or, action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter.
A copy of any written warning notice shall be issued to the employee. The employee shall be required to sign all notices for the purposes of acknowledging receipt. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer's own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
No employees shall be discharged on his/her day off or while on vacation.
6,04. Disciplinary Suspension.
Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.

Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino

7.01. Reasons for Payment
When the Employer or its representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report to work as previously scheduled, for any reason, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee's regular rate of pay for his/her scheduled shift, provided however, that where an employee is sent home -after commencing work because the Employer cannot present scheduled entertainment due to bona fide illness or disability of the entertainer or entertainers to perform, the employee shall be paid for the hours actually worked or four (4) hours, whichever is greater.
7,02. Voluntarily Leaving Work.
Employees who voluntarily leave work with the Employer's approval will be paid for the actual hours worked.
7.03. Notice by Employee.

The Employer will log and maintain a record of such calls.
ARTICLE 8:	DISCRIMINATION AND LIE DETECTOR TESTS
8.01, Prohibited Discrimination.
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer or the Union against any employee because of membership or non-membership in, or activity on behalf of the Union provided that an employee’s Union activities shall not interfere with the performance of his/her work for the Employer. In accordance with applicable laws, there shall be no discrimination against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, privileges of or opportunities for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, age, national origin or disability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Employer is permitted to take all actions necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including but not limited to, the authority to take actions deemed by the Employer to be necessary to effect reasonable accommodations.

Time spent working light duty shall not count as shifts worked for completion of the probationary period. However, the employee’s shifts worked, prior to and after assignment to light duty, shall be combined to complete the probationary period. Time spent working light duty shall not be considered a break in service when calculating seniority or vacation entitlement.
If the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty work, whether within or outside of the bargaining unit, the employee shall be subject to disqualification of benefits under the Employer’s Insurance Company of Nevada. However, if the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty work, the bargaining unit employee shall not otherwise be subject to discipline and shall continue to be entitled to leave for which the employee is eligible under 13.01(a).

If in the future they elect to return to the “B-l” list, they will be placed at the bottom of the “B-l” list regardless of the fact they may have an earlier seniority date.
