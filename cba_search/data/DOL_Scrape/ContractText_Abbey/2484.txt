Except as otherwise clear from the context, the term "employees" as used in this Agreement means employees in the bargaining unit.
In the event that work currently performed by the bargaining unit is transferred to another Company entity at Kirtland AFB, the same terms and conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement will apply as prescribed by law.
Section 1.2	Bargaining Units
a)	The Employer and Union agree that the employees covered by the agreement shall consist of the Contract Instructor classifications set out in this agreement employed by the Employer as described in the certification issued by the National Labor Relations Board Case #28-RC-5894 dated November 20, 2000.

Section 1.4	Agency Shop
Each employee covered by this Agreement shall be required, as a condition of employment, beginning 31 days after the date of hire to either become a member of the Union or, at a minimum, pay the Union monthly service charge for the administration of this agreement and bargaining and/or representation under the Grievance Procedure including arbitration. Such monthly service charge for non-members will be paid within the time constraints set forth for members under Article 1, Section 1.5.
Page 6 of 45
In the event an employee, who as a condition of continued employment is required to become a member of the Union or provide a monthly service charge, but in any such case does not do so, the Union will notify the Company in writing and through the Company manager of such employee’s delinquency.

In making deductions and remittances for reinstatement fees, initiation fees and dues to the Union, the Company is entitled to rely upon the notification of the Secretary-Treasurer of Local Lodge 794 of the amount of money due to the Union by an employee. The Union agrees to and does hereby hold and save the Company harmless from any and all liability, responsibility, or damage for deduction, payment authorization, or notification as provided for in this Article, specifically including, but not limited to, the Company’s agreement to deduct dues, initiation fees and reinstatement fees from the employee’s paycheck and the Union assumes full responsibility for the disposition of the funds so deducted when turned over to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. The Company will execute changes to dues identified by the Union within 30 days of notification.
The Company shall deduct a percentage of the union dues from each of the employees’ paychecks. The percentage will be based on the number of paychecks per month payable by the employee to the union. The Company shall remit all amounts to the Union on the 20th day of the month after the deductions are made.
For the purpose of implementing the payroll deduction described in this Article, the “authorization form” attached as “Attachment 1” will be used.

Page 12 of 45
ARTICLE 5	- GRIEVANCES
Section 5.1	Definition of a Grievance
A grievance is a dispute between the Company and the Union as to the interpretation, application, or violation of any term or provision of this Agreement. Should any employee have a grievance, an earnest effort shall be made to settle such grievance promptly in accordance with the following procedure. Each party acknowledges that it is in the best interest of both parties to settle disputes at the lowest possible level.
Time limits in this grievance and arbitration procedure may be extended through mutual written agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding any provision of Section 5.2, in any and all cases where disciplinary action, whether oral, written or otherwise, is contemplated to be taken by management, a Steward will be notified.
Section 5.2	Grievance Procedure
Step 1. Oral Discussion. The employee should first discuss his grievance with the supervisor of his section. If the supervisor, in collaboration with the Shop Steward, considers the grievance to be valid, then the employee and the Steward will contact the Manager (the Company) and attempt to settle the dispute at that time. An
Employee may contact the company directly if he so chooses. If the purpose of the employees’ contacting the company is to adjust the grievance, the Steward shall be given the opportunity to be present, and such adjustment shall be in conformity with this agreement. Grievances shall be brought to the Company within ten (10) working days of when the employee had knowledge of the grievance.
Step 2. Grievance Reduced to Writing. If no settlement is reached in Step 1, the Steward may, within ten (10) working days, reduce to writing a statement of the validated grievance or complaint. This statement, attested to by signature of the grievant, must contain the following:
1.	The facts upon which the grievance is based;
2.	Reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated (Step 2 will not be applicable in cases of dismissal or suspension for cause or of involuntary resignation);
3.	The remedy sought.
The Steward shall sign and submit the written statement of grievance through the section Lead to the Company Manager for his consideration, with a copy to the Company Program Manager. After such submission, the Company and Steward may within the next ten (10) workdays, unless mutually extended, conduct a meeting or teleconference to settle the written grievance and over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. If no equitable solution can be reached after such discussion, the Company and the Steward shall indicate over their signatures, that a settlement has not been reached.
Step 3. Written Grievance Handling at Union Representative-Company Representative Level. If no settlement is reached in Step 2 within the specified or mutually extended time limits, the Union Representative or his designee may, within ten (10) working days, submit
Page 13 of 45
the grievance to the Human Resource Manager of the Company. After such submission, the Human Resource Manager of the Company and the Union or designee thereof, shall, within the next ten (10) work days, unless mutually extended, conduct a meeting or teleconference to settle the grievance and, over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. Otherwise, promptly after the expiration of such ten (10) work day period, or mutually agreed extension thereof, the Human Resource Manager of the Company and the Union or designee thereof, shall sign the grievance and their signatures will indicate that the grievance has been discussed and reconsidered by them and that a settlement has not been reached.
Step 4. Arbitration. If no settlement is reached in Step 3 within the specified or mutually extended time limits, then either party may, in writing within ten (10) work days thereafter, request that the matter be submitted to an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to decide and rule on alleged violations of the National Labor Relations Act raised through the grievance process as a result of a deferral of an unfair labor practice charge by the National Labor Relations Board to the grievance process.
Section 5.3	Dismissal, Discharge, or Suspension or Involuntary Resignation
In cases of dismissal, discharge, or suspension for cause, or involuntary resignation, the employee shall be given a copy of the suspension, or termination of service, as the case may be, if he is available to be presented with such copy. If he is not available, copies will be sent to the employee and to the Union office via registered mail. The employee shall have the right to appeal the action shown providing the Union files a written grievance with the designated representative of the Company within ten (10) work days after the date of the receipt of the notification of discharge, dismissal, or suspension for cause or involuntary resignation. Written grievances processed under this section will be submitted directly to Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Section 5.4	Policy Grievances
Policy grievances shall begin with Step 3 and shall be limited to matters dealing with the interpretation or application of terms of this Agreement. Such grievances shall be submitted in writing to the designated 3rd step representative, and shall contain the following:
a)	Statement of the grievance setting forth the facts upon which the grievance is based.
b)	Reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated.
c)	The remedy sought.
The grievance shall be signed by the designated 3rd step representative. If no settlement is reached within ten (10) workdays, unless mutually extended, from the submission of the grievance, both sides shall sign the grievance and indicate that it has been discussed and considered and that no settlement has been reached. Within ten (10) work days thereafter, either party may submit the grievance to an arbitrator.
Page 14 of 45
Section 5.5	Selection of Arbitrator
Either party may request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to submit a panel of seven (7) arbitrators admitted into the National Academy of Arbitrators. Such requests shall state the general nature of the case and ask that the nominees be qualified to handle the type of case by subject matter. When notification of the names of the panel of seven (7) arbitrators is received, the parties in turn shall have the right to strike a name from the panel until only one-name remains. The right to strike the first name shall be determined by lot. The remaining person shall be the arbiter.
Section 5.6	Arbitration - Rules of Procedure
Arbitration pursuant to Step 4 shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
a)	The arbitrator shall hear and accept pertinent evidence submitted by both parties and be empowered to request such data as he deems pertinent to the grievance and shall render a decision in writing to both parties within thirty (30) days exclusive of weekends and recognized holidays, unless mutually extended at the completion of the hearing.
b)	The arbitrator shall be authorized to rule and issue a decision in writing on the issue presented for arbitration and such decision shall be binding on both parties.
c)	The arbitrator shall rule only on the basis of information presented in the hearing before him and shall refuse to receive any information after the hearing except when there is mutual agreement, in the presence of both parties.
d)	Each party to the proceedings may call such witnesses as may be necessary in the order in which their testimony is to be heard. Such testimony shall be limited to the matters set forth in the written statement of grievance. The arguments of the parties may be supported by oral comment and rebuttal. The parties may submit written briefs within a time period mutually agreed upon. Such agreements of the parties, whether oral or written, shall be confined to and directed at the matters set forth in the grievance.
e)	Each party shall pay any compensation and expenses relating to its own witnesses or representatives.
f)	Both the Union and Company hereby mutually agree to share, on an equal basis, the arbitrator’s fees and reasonable expenses.
g)	The total cost of the stenographic record (if requested) shall be paid by the party requesting it. If the other party also requests a copy, that party will pay one half of the stenographic costs.
Section 5.7	Agreement Not to be Altered
The arbitrator shall have only the authority to interpret and apply the provisions of this written Agreement. The arbitrator has no power to add to, detract from, or change in any way the provisions of this Agreement, or to establish new terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither party has the right to request arbitration on any subject matter not specifically covered in this written Agreement.
Page 15 of 45
Section 5.8	Conference During Working Hours
Conferences between representatives from the Company and Union that are mutually agreed to shall be held during paid working hours.
Page 16 of 45
ARTICLE 6	- SENIORITY
Section 6.1	Probationary Employee
For Contract Instructors, the probationary period is defined as a new employee during the first 180 days of employment and achieves certification to conduct training and/or classroom events in accordance with guidelines established in Article 7, Section 7.1. All other employees shall be considered probationary employees for the first 90 calendar days of employment. The probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. Employment of probationary employees is at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. An employee terminated for any reason during the probationary period has no mandatory seniority, recall or reinstatement rights. The Company may terminate or transfer probationary employees at its discretion and such actions are not subject to the Grievance Procedure.
Section 6.2	Application of Seniority
For the purpose of operating under this Agreement, employees shall be entitled to seniority in their respective Bargaining Unit in accordance with their date of hire into their Bargaining Unit in the KDAM (or any predecessor program ), herein called seniority date. The most senior employee (i.e. employee with the earliest prior contract service date of hire at Kirtland AFB, NM) shall be listed at the top of the Bargaining Unit Seniority List and the least senior employee shall be listed at the bottom of the Bargaining Unit Seniority List. All other employees shall be listed on the Bargaining Unit Seniority List in descending order based upon their prior contract service date of hire at Kirtland AFB, NM. Employees hired into the Bargaining Unit subsequent to this agreement shall be assigned a seniority date based on date of hire, or if hired on the same date, be assigned seniority based on the last four digits of their SSN - larger SSN number is more senior on the list.
It is recognized that CI's are/were hired based on customer pre-requisite qualifications specific to airframe, whether flightline or academic, and crew position expertise. Accordingly, the CI seniority is based upon seniority date and organized by airframe, with academic or flightline treated as separate airframes, and crew position would have the widest applicability. Within this context, and considering scheduling and training flexibility, this airframe/crew position seniority date list would be utilized to establish first rights of refusal in the determination of, but not limited to, training opportunities, advancement (i.e. to Lead) and layoffs/recall. If an instructor is hired to a new airframe, or to or from the flightline, their seniority date resets to the bottom of the list for that airframe. If movement to a new airframe is due to lack of work or loss of positions, seniority will reset to the bottom of the list for that airframe. If returning back to the original airframe filling an open position, seniority will revert to original airframe date. In the event more than one collective bargaining member is hired into a new airframe on the same date, site hire date will determine airframe seniority. In those instances that are non-specific to airframe and/or crew position qualifications, such as for CRM or IRC instructor opportunity, the site-wide seniority list would be applicable. Employees-entering a new program and designated as initial cadre will retain their original Company hire date for seniority purposes. Any employees subsequently deciding to enter a new program will assume that date as a new hire date for lay-off/recall, PTO, training opportunities (specific to the
Page 17 of 45
airframe), and advancement provisions. They will however, maintain their original Company hire date for non-airframe specific matters.
Section 6.3	Additional Training/Qualifications
The opportunity for any additional training/qualifications will be afforded to the most senior employee possessing the qualifications for the position. Qualifications for any new positions shall be determined by the Company based on requirements mandated by the Customer. Should training needs dictate, such additional training/qualification opportunity will be offered to the most senior qualified instructor.
Section 6.4	Layoff and Recall Procedures
Employees will be laid off due to lack of work and recalled based on the seniority principles of Section 6.2. If there are no senior employees volunteering for lay-off, layoffs shall occur in the following order based on seniority in accordance with Section 6.2: probationary employees, casual part time employees, regular part time employees, full time employees.
Contract Instructors notified of lay-off shall have the ability to bump into a SME position in the same type of airframe in which they currently instruct (Fixed Wing, Rotary Wing, or Tilt Rotor) at the SME rate provided he/she has greater seniority than the SME subject to being bumped.
Employees in the workforce, who have established seniority and are laid off through no fault of their own, will be recalled to the work force within a two-year period as openings occur. When the laid off individual is recalled, he shall be placed on the seniority list based on his original seniority date, if not laid off for more than two years.
Section 6.5	Additional Qualifications
