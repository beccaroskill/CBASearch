ARTICLES WORKFORCE ADMINISTRATION
Section 8.1 Employees to Whom This Article is Applicable.
8.1(a) This Article, subject to 8.8(c), applies and refers separately to employees within each of the four bargaining units described in Article I, except that (1) the provisions of Article 8 shall be applied separately to Edwards AFB, California and Palmdale, California combined, and fl) an employee at Edwards AFB or Palmdale who has transferred to either California assignment from a SPEEA-represented position in Washington will he treated for purposes of eligibility for retention at Washington as though surplused from the Major Organization with which the employee was identified immediately prior to transfer to Edwards AFB or Palmdale and in accord with the retention provisions of this Agreement.
8.1(b) The provisions of 8.6 will not apply ro employees placed on travel status by the Company, and such employees will not be laid off while on such status.
8.1 (c) The terms “employee” or “employees" wherever used in this Article will be subject to the foregoing limitations.
Section 8.2 Objective. The general objective of the procedure stated in this Article is to provide for the accomplishment of workforce reductions for business reasons, co the end that, insofar as practicable rhe reductions will be made equitably, expeditiously and economically, and at rhe same time will result in retention on the payroll of those employees regarded by management as comprising the workforce that is best able to maintain or improve the efficiency of rhe Company, further its progress and success and contribute ro the successful accomplishment of the Company’s current and forurc business. The location, occurrence and existence of any condition necessitating a workforce reduction, and the numbet of employees involved, will he determined exclusively by the Company. Following such determination, rhe Company will notify rhe Union of the location and the estimated size and job family and skills management code(s) involved in the anticipated workforce reduction. Wherever practicable, affected employees will be given two (2) weeks’ notice prior to layoff.
Ft is recognized by both parties char ir is necessary to work certain skills management coded employees overtime while at rhe same time workforce reductions involving the same skills management codes will be taking place. Management will review the use of overtime in any skills management code in which layoffs are contemplated with the intent of minimizing the use of such overtime. Management, at its sole discretion, will determine the level of overtime ro be worked.
Section 8J Terminology for Use in Procedure. Preliminary to, and as affording information necessary ro the application of the procedures stated in 8.6, employees will be classified in two ways:
8.3(a) Management periodically will make a comparative rating of each employee as provided in 8.4. The individual taring will be referred ro as a 'retention rating,” and the process of applying these ratings and compiling them in order of rating, as “retention indexing." Similar usage of these terms
11
is made herein. A retention index review wilt be held at least three (3) times during the term of this 1 Agreement and not less frequently than once each twelve (12) months following the execution date of 2 this Agreement, with the precise intervals to be determined by rhe Company.	3
4
8.3(b) Each employee will be assigned a job family and skills management code (SMC) as provided 5 in 8.5.	6
■	7
8.3(c) The term "Major OrganiiatiorC as used in this Article will mean a major organizational B element of the Company reporting to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or identified as 9 such by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The units described in 1.1(b), 1.1(c), and 10 1.1(d), although nor identified as Major Organizations, will be administered as such, with the	11
exception of 8.6(c). The Company shall provide to the Union in writing an up-to-date list of	12
Major Organizations and advise the Union as soon as practicable of changes made thereto.	13
14
Section 8.4 Retention Indexing/Rating. The comparative raring required by 8.3(a) will be accomplished 15 as herein described. Retention ratings assigned to employees prior to the execution dace of this Agreement 16 will remain in effect until changed under provisions of this Article.	17
18
8.4(a) Management will assign a retention rating by SMC to each employee to whom this Article	19
applies, with the basic objective of identifying those employees who, in the opinion of management,	20
are best able to maintain or improve the efficiency of the Company, further its progress and success	21
and contribute to the successful accomplishment of the Company's current and future business.	22
Consistent with this objective, management will consider each employee's competence, diligence and	23
demonstrated usable capabilities based upon the employee's current performance and a review of the	24
employee's previous performance. Employees on part-time work schedules as defined in Attachment	25
17 will be retention indexed with employees on full-time work schedules. Length of Company	26
service will be a positive factor to the extent that rhe experience so gained continues co be reflected	27
in increased capability.	28
29
8.4(b) Subject to 8.4(c) and 8.4(d), retention indexing will result in each employee being rated in 30 one of three (3) categories, hereinafter referred to as RI, R2 and R3.	31
32
8.4(c) It is recognized that any practical process of retention indexing cannot be completely free of 33 error as to method used or as to resulting retention ratings, taking into account; the targe numbers of 34 employees, skills, organizations, and requirements involved; the fact that numerous management 35 representatives necessarily must participate in the process; and the additional Facts that professional 36 employees are involved and many of the factor! that must be dealt with in rhe process are intangible 37 in nature. The Company will determine the retention raring of each employee, the times at which such 38 ratings will be assigned, the members of management who will determine ratings or participate in the 39 indexing process, the giuupings io be utilized and the other mechanics and details of such process. 40 The Company will instruct and periodically wilt teinsrnret members of management participating in 41 the process to assign retention ratings with the greatest possible care and objectivity, giving lull 42 Consideration to the objectives stated in 8.2. Such instructions will stress that retention indexing is to 43 be accomplished without regard to potential adjustments for Company service as provided for 44 in 8.4(e).	45
46
8.4(c)(1) Retention Rating Appeals. The retention indexing process will not be subject to the 47 grievance procedure, however, an employee who feels the assigned retention raring is inappropriate	48
may at any time discuss the matter with his or her immediate supervisor. If within thirty (30)	49
calendar days following notification of the assigned retention rating, rhe employee elects to appeal 50 the rating and discussion with the immediate supervisor has not resolved the employee's concern, 51 certain ratings may be appealed for further review as provided below;	52
53
8.4(c)(l)a The assigned retention rating represents a one {1) or more position drop from 54 rhe previous assigned rating and it is substantiated that the drop is not due to the effect of a 55 workforce reduction and/or consolidation of retention index groups.	56

11.1(b) The Company will establish three (3) selective adjustment funds in accordance with the dates set forth in Table 1):
TABLE II
SELECTIVE SALARY ADJUSTMENT FUND REVIEW PERIODS AND INCREASE PERCENTAGES
Review Period	Beginning Date	Fund Computation Date	Ending Date	Increase Effective Date	Increase Percentage	Minimum in crease
l	1212102	1/24/03	3/7/03	3/7/03	4.0%	1.5%

3	3/6/04	1/21/05	3/4/05	3/4/05	4.0%	1.5%
11.1(b)(1) Following the ending date of each of the three (3) selective salary adjustment review periods, tine Company will increase the base salaries of employees selected from among those who are eligible. The base salaries of eligible employees will be increased from a fund computed by multiplying the Increase Percentage by the total salaries of eligible employees. Minimum increases will be given as indicated in Table II. These increases will be effective on the Effective Date of the review period and will he rounded to the nearest S50. Eligible employees ate those who were in the bargaining unit and on the active payroll on both the fund computation dare and the increase effective dare.
For selective adjustment fund computation purposes described in 11.1(b), the units defined io 1.1(a), 1.1(b), 1.1(c), and [.1(d) will be treated as a single unit.
For any Review Perind identified in Table II, the Company may, at its discretion, increase the Increase Percentage, resulting in an equal decrease ro the Increase Percentage of a subsequent Review Period.
II.1(c) Cost of Living Adjustments.
11.1(c)(1) Employees eligible to participate in the selective adjustment funds under 11.1 (b) may alsn receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjustments become effective under and in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stated in 11.1(c). The terms, definitions, and limitations stared in 11.1(h) and 11.1(c) also apply to such adjustments. Cost of Living Adjustments would be delivered to each eligible employee separately from those selective adjustment funds derived in 11.1(b). Cost of Living Adjustments would be effective on the dates specified in Table Hi-
ll, 1 (c) (2) Determination of Cost of Living Adjustments shall be made in reference to the series U.S. city average '’Consumer Price Index Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers’ published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with the following base period: 1982.1984 = 100, such Index being referred to herein as the BLS Index.
11.1(c)(3) Computations will be made using the three {3) month average of the BLS Index for July, August and September, 2602 (176.6), as the base period.
11.1(c)(4) During the life of this Agreement, Cost of Living Adjustments shall be Computed using the three (3) month average of the BLS Index fot the periods specified in Table III and the corresponding BLS Index threshold values expressed as percentage increases over the 2002 base period. The formula will be: percentage of Cost of Living eqoals fifty (50) percent of the percentage increase in the BLS Index, from the 2002 base period to the BLS Index Comparison Quarter, that exceeds the BLS Index Threshold Percentage, as shown in Table III. In order to
21
I
preclude recognition, on more than one effective date, of the same percentage increase in the BLS Index, any recognition on one effective dace of a percentage increase over the applicable BLS Index Threshold Percentage will cause that percentage to beset aside and disregarded in ensuing computations. [E.g., if the BLS Index for October, November, December 2002 represented a 12 percent increase over the base period (yielding a 2.0 percent Cost of Living Adjustment effective 3/7/2003), no Cost of Living Adjustment would result for the 3/5/2004 effective dare unless, and to the extent, the BLS Index for October, November, December 2003 represented an increase in excess of 20,3 percent over the base period.] BLS Index three-month averages, BLS Index Increase percentages, and salary increase percentages will be rounded to the nearest tenth, with five hundredths rounded upward to the nearest tenth.

•	Breakthrough improvements in productivity and morale through effective utilization	4_
•	Retention and transfer of key knowledge	4‘
•	Restructuring and reorganizing our company and team	4

We have recently completed a study on external alignment with our BCA Landing Gear Design Center 5 ream. The engagement of the employees directly involved in the process under examination has provided 5 us with some key insights into both the benefits and obstacles to external alignment. One outcome is a 5 new plan to primarily align our teams with their true internal customers, and then consider external 5 alignment from a more strategic view when warranted.	5

In addition, we have been studying approaches co achieve dramatic improvements in productivity, again using employee engagement as the primary approach co change. This study has modeled the effects of normal attrition over the next five years, and confirms chat we must double our productivity over the next five years if we are to avoid another wave of significant employment increases as the airline industry recovers from the current downturn.
As we define and implement these key initiatives, our desire is that we use attrition whenever practical ro accomplish any further reductions in employment and avoid layoffs in the future- However, due ro rhe cyclical nature of our business, it is difficult ro predict and control conditions chat affect employment levels. Therefore, ro rhe extent practical, the Company will provide job transition support and services to the technical workforce affected by employment reductions through, but not limited to, the followings
•	Skills retraining (Ed Wells Initiative)
•	Career Transition Services
•	Career Counseling
•	Resume preparation
•	Boeing Enterprise Staffing System (BESS)
•	Intellectual capital management
•	Skills management through Process Councils and Skill Teams
•	Partnerships with local educational institutions
*	Financial counseling
•	Medical benefits continuation
■	Income benefits continuation (involuntary Layoff only)
Our plan is to begin implementation of key initiatives and process changes now. Concurrently, we will begin programs for knowledge retention & transfer and skill retraining to support employees as Boeing transitions over time. We have committed additional hinds ro the Ed Wells Initiative and expanded it ro include the joint partnership efforts. We will also re-energize our Joint Workforce Committee to allow continued discussion on these important topics.
Lastly, we will continue to work together ro build a positive and successful future for our company and our team.

Benefits under the Plan begin after the disability has lasted seven (7) consecutive days. Following this waiting period, the disabled employee receives a weekly benefit based on the employee’s weekly salary according to the schedule of benefits in the cable below,

Week 1 .............................. Waiting	period; no benefits paid under the Plan
Weeks 2 through 13.....................80%	of weekly salary
Weeks 14 through 26 ...................60%	of weekly salary
Short term disability benefits for full-time employees are determined using the weekly salary reflected in Boeing Service Center records at the time the disability first begins. Short tetm disability benefits for pan-time employees are based on the employee’s average weekly salary for the six weeks immediately preceding rhe dace of disability.
