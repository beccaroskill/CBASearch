FREIGHTSHIP AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT made this 16th day of June, 2001 between the American Maritime Association (“Association”) on behalf of itself and each member Company of the Association (Company or Companies) and the Seafarers International Union, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District/NMU, SIUNA AFL-CIO (“Union”).
ARTICLE I
EMPLOYMENT
SECTION 1.	The American Maritime Association (Association) on behalf of itself and each member Company of the Association recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all Unlicensed Personnel employed on board American-flag vessels owned or operated by such Company or its subsidiaries.
SECTION 2.	The Union agrees to furnish each Company with capable, competent and physically fit persons when and where they are required, and of the ratings needed to fill vacancies necessitating the employment of Unlicensed Personnel in ample time to prevent any delay in the scheduled departure of any vessel covered by this Agreement. To assure maximum harmonious relations and in order to obtain the best qualified employees with the least risk of a delay in the scheduled departure of any vessel covered by this Agreement, such Company agrees to secure all Unlicensed Personnel through the hiring halls of the Union. If, for any reason, the Union does not famish such Company with capable, competent and physically fit persons when and where they are required, and of the ratings needed to fill such vacancies, in ample time to prevent any delay in the scheduled departure of any vessel covered by this Agreement, such Company may then obtain members of the Unlicensed Personnel from any available source, in which case the Union shall be notified.
SECTION 3.	The Association and each member Company thereof agree that as a condition of employment all Unlicensed Personnel shall become members of the Union or agency fee payers within thirty-one (31) days after the execution of this Agreement, or within thirty-one (31) days after hire, whichever is later, and shall either remain members in good standing of the Union or up to date agency fee payer during the life of this Agreement. Such Company is not obligated to take steps to enforce this provision unless due notice is received in writing from the Union, to the effect that a member of the Unlicensed Personnel is not in compliance herewith.
SECTION 4.	(a) The Union agrees that each member Company has the right to reject (by written notation on the job assignment slip or by written notification at the time of assignment) any applicant for employment who such Company considers unsatisfactory or unsuitable for the vacancy, or to discharge any member of the Unlicensed Personnel who, in the opinion of such Company is not satisfactory. If the Union considers the rejection of any applicant for employment or the discharge of any member of the Unlicensed Personnel as being without reasonable cause, such action by such Company shall be dealt with under the grievance procedure and the Union agrees that any such rejection or discharge shall not cause any vessel to be delayed on her scheduled departure.
(b)	Unlicensed Personnel when applying for employment shall be required to be in possession of a valid S.I.U. Clinic Card indicating the person has a complete physical examination less than one (1) year prior to date of application; and may also be required to pass a physical examination as prescribed by such Company, and shall submit from time to time thereafter to such physical examinations as may be required by such Company. The fees and expenses, including transportation, associated with any such required initial examination shall be at the Company’s expense. Such Company shall have the right to reject an applicant for employment or to discharge any member of the Unlicensed Personnel who shall be determined by such Company’s medical examiner to be unfit for employment.
Any dispute with regard to the physical fitness of any such applicant or member so examined shall be resolved by such Company’s physician and the appropriate Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Clinic designated physician. If these two (2) physicians are unable to resolve the dispute, then they shall select a board certified physician of the appropriate specialty to make a final and binding decision. The fees and expenses of such third physician shall be shared equally by the parties.
(c)	All Unlicensed Personnel shall comply with all rules and regulations required by the Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard and/or Charter Parties relative to substance and alcohol abuse testing.
SECTION 5.	Each Company agrees not to discriminate against any member of the Unlicensed Personnel for legitimate Union activities, and such Company further agrees that no person referred in accordance with this Article, shall be discriminated against because of race, creed, color, sex, age, national or geographic origin, and status as a Vietnam vet

eran, when the same is required by Federal regulation. The employer agrees that it shall not discriminate against employees on the basis of a physical or mental disability. The Union agrees that employees dispatched from the hiring halls will be qualified to perform shipboard duties. The parties agree that in the event an employee suffering from a disabling condition should request an accommodation to enable him/her to perform essential functions aboard the vessel, every reasonable effort will be made to accommodate the employee. Such accommodation will not, however, be required if it would create an undue hardship or would represent a substantial threat to the safety and well being of the employer, the employee requesting the accommodation, or other Unlicensed Personnel.
In applying the protections of the ADA to any individual, the parties agree that the standards formulated in the Johns Hopkins Study shall be followed.
SECTION 6.	The term Unlicensed Personnel as used in this Agreement shall not include super-cargoes, cadets, pursers and livestock tenders.
SECTION 7.	Either party shall have the right, upon written notification to the other, to re-negotiate any part or all of Article I. Upon receipt of such notification, the parties to this Agreement shall meet within seven (7) days for negotiations of this issue.
SECTION 8.	(a) The Shipping Rules as prescribed in Article IX, incorporated and attached hereto, define the registration and shipping procedures for all Unlicensed Personnel seeking employment aboard vessels whose owners or operators are signatory to this Agreement. The Shipping Rules may from time to time be amended by Seafarers Appeals Board Actions promulgated by the Seafarers Appeals Board, a joint Labor-Management Committee selected by the appropriate parties.
(b)	The Union and the Companies pursuant to collective bargaining provisions established and maintain a training school facility for training and upgrading of the Companies’ unlicensed seamen. Such facility shall be the exclusive method utilized by the Companies for training and upgrading of Unlicensed Personnel, except as may be mutually agreed to between the Union and the Employer.
Contracted Employers shall meet, as necessary, with the Vocational Department at the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship to develop and modify training and upgrading programs to meet the needs of the Industry. An advisory board will be formed to review the criteria and curriculum of the courses offered at the school.
(c)	The Seafarers Appeals Board shall include in the Shipping Rules promulgated in accord herewith, reasonable rules of procedure to govern matters coming before it.
SECTION 9.	The parties hereto agree that the appropriate unit for representation purposes is the Unlicensed Personnel aboard the vessels owned, operated or controlled by all Companies who are members of the Association.
SECTION 10.	The Union shall protect and indemnify the Companies party to this Agreement in any cause of action based on improper application by the Union of the employment provisions of Article I of this Agreement. The Company shall protect and indemnify the Union in any cause of action based on improper application by the Company of the employment provisions of Article I of this Agreement.
SECTION 11.	The provisions hereof are subject to Federal and State Law and if any part hereof is in conflict therewith, such part shall be deemed inapplicable and to the extent thereof, shall be deemed severed from this Agreement, the remainder of which shall remain in hill force and effect.
SECTION 12.	Alien or non-resident seamen in the Far East may execute written authorizations to the Seafarers’ Vacation Plan, assigning to the Union vacation benefit payments which may be due such seamen, in discharge of their Union monetary obligations for initiation fee and dues, and the parties further agree that new seamen employed, or seamen who have not as yet paid their full initiation fee to the Union, may execute written authorizations to the Seafarers Vacation Plan, assigning to the Union vacation benefit payments which may be due such seamen in discharge of their Union initiation fee obligation. All of the foregoing authorizations shall be in accordance with the provisions of applicable law.

Vessels remaining in port on Sundays may hold these meetings as soon as possible after departure. At such meetings the Permanent Ship’s Chairman shall report to the Unlicensed Personnel all matters referred to them and shall receive any new and additional problems not previously raised. As compensation for the additional duties required by this section, the members of the Permanent Ship’s Committee and the Departmental Delegates shall each receive one (1) hour’s pay at their applicable Penalty Rate for each weekly meeting held.
SECTION 3.	PORT COMMITTEE.

If the port of payoff cannot provide the number of personnel required to establish the Port Committee, one will be established at such port or place as is mutually agreed to between the Company and the Union. In the event the Port Committee cannot resolve the issue or dispute, the matter shall be referred to an impartial arbitrator whose decision shall be final and binding. The Union and Management shall designate a panel of three (3) preferred arbitrators who shall be appointed to the panel for one (1) year terms by the Parties.

In the event either Party wishes to withhold a specific arbitration from the preferred panel, the Parties may request a panel of arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association, whose rules for the selection and designation of arbitrators shall then be followed. The three (3) arbitrators will hear cases in rotation. If an arbitrator cannot provide a hearing date for a grievance within thirty (30) days, that case, at the request of either Party, will be assigned to the next arbitrator in rotation.
In any specific case, if the Parties and the arbitrator agree, the arbitration shall be held within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, from the date of notification and selection of the arbitrator. By mutual agreement of the Parties, the time limits set forth in this Article may be extended.
In all arbitrations held pursuant to this Article, the expenses of the arbitrator shall be paid by the Party whom the arbitrator rules against. In all such arbitrations, the sole purpose of the arbitrator shall be to interpret the express provisions of the Agreement and apply them to the facts of the complaint, dispute or grievance. The arbitrator shall have no power to change, amend, modify, add/or to subtract from, or otherwise alter this Agreement.
All grievances must be submitted to the Union by the affected seaman within thirty (30) days from the earlier of the date the seaman leaves the vessel or the Ship’s Articles are terminated. Failure to file a grievance within this time period shall preclude an assertion of this grievance or its subject matter at any later date in any form.

Standard Freighlship Agreement 2001
SECTION 14.	REPATRIATION, UPKEEP AND TRANSPORTATION, (a) Where a crew member must leave a vessel because of illness or injury in any location outside the Continental United States, he shall be repatriated at Company expense as set forth herein, at the earliest date possible, and advances equalled to allotments, if any, shall continue during such repatriation, provided he has sufficient monies due him from the Company to cover such advances.
It is the purpose of the above paragraph to provide for the automatic payment of advances—in a sum equal to the agreed allotment—and to do this automatically, which advances are then to be charged against any claim for earned or unearned wages. The advances are to be paid in exactly the same time and manner and to the same person or persons that the allotment would have been paid had not illness or injury taken place. The term “repatriation” refers to the entire period for which unearned wages are due, and “advances” are made during the entire period, except in those cases where the law sanctions a refusal to pay unearned wages (which can be established under law to be gross negligence, willful misconduct, etc.).
If repatriated on a vessel of the Company, he shall be signed on as a nonworking workaway. If repatriated on a vessel of another Company, he shall be given not less than second class passage. In the event he is given less than second class passage on a vessel of another Company, he shall be given the cash difference between the passage afforded and second class passage. The seaman shall have the option of accepting repatriation by plane if such transportation is offered. Repatriation under this section shall be back to the port of engagement.
(b)	In the event a crew member must leave a vessel because of illness or injury incurred in the service of such vessel while in a location within the Continental United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Alaska and/or the U.S. Virgin Islands, and such illness or injury is known prior to his leaving, he shall be entitled to economy class air transportation to his original port of engagement in accordance with Article II, Section 59.
If the Company office or designated agents’ office is closed, transportation, if due, shall be paid by the Ship’s Master upon submitting medical proof from an accredited medical authority, specifying the nature of the illness or injury.
(c)	While awaiting repatriation under section (a) and (b) herein, the seaman shall be entitled to repatriation upkeep in the sum of eight dollars ($8.00) per day until afforded transportation as outlined in said subsections. Such upkeep shall be paid up to and inclusive of the day he is afforded the means of transportation by which he is to be repatriated. The Company or its Agents may make arrangements for meals and lodgings while the seaman is awaiting repatriation transportation, but in no event shall these arrangements be at a cost of less than eight dollars ($8.00) per day.
In cases where regular meals are not included in the transportation herein provided for, the repatriated seaman shall be paid meal allowance at the rates specified in Article II, Section 43 during the transportation period.
(d)	If a crew member’s medical records indicate a pre-existing medical condition and there were reasonable grounds for the crewmember to believe the condition might disable him during a voyage and that condition was concealed at time of a pre-sign-on physical examination or on joining the vessel and is the reason for the individual leaving the vessel, the costs of repatriation, upkeep, treatment and transportation shall be home by the crewmember.
(e)	Where a seaman leaves the vessel due to illness or injury and such illness or injury has been known prior to his leaving, he shall receive a full statement of his account showing wages due him. Where time does not permit the statement being given to the man before he leaves the vessel or before the vessel’s departure, the Master shall promptly advise the Company’s Agent and the home office of the status of the man’s account at the time he left the vessel.
Thereafter, when the seaman presents himself to the Agent at the port where he left the vessel, the maximum allowable payments shall be made to him by that Agent.
When the seaman presents his claim of wages to the Agent or office of the Company at the port of engagement or to the home office of the Company, he shall receive payment as promptly as possible.
Failure to pay the seaman wages within seventy-two (72) hours exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays after presentation of his claim shall entitle the seaman to eight dollars ($8.00) per day until the full wages due the man at the time he left the vessel are paid.
(f)	The original port of engagement as used herein shall mean the port in the Continental United States, Hawaii or Puerto Rico from which the crew member was dispatched by the Union.
(g)	The Company shall provide a record to the Union of all repatriated seamen, indicating the seaman’s period of employment and the nature of the illness or injury requiring repatriation. This notice shall be provided to the Union as soon as practical following the repatriation.
SECTION 15.	LOSS OF CLOTHING, (a) In the event a ship of the Company is lost, the Unlicensed Personnel shall be compensated for the loss of clothing in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and shall be repatriated to the port of engagement with subsistence, room allowance and wages as per Section 59 of this Article.
(b) In the event that personal effects of Unlicensed Personnel are damaged due to marine casualty, or an accident to the vessel or its equipment, they shall be compensated for the loss in the amount of such loss but not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).

SECTION 16.	WORK PERFORMED BY OTHER THAN MEMBERS OF THE UNLICENSED PERSONNEL AND SUBCONTRACTING, TRANSFERRING OR ASSIGNING UNLICENSED PERSONNEL WORK.
Any work performed by cadets, workaways, passengers, prisoners of war, staff officers, or any member of the crew other than the Unlicensed Personnel that is routine work of the Unlicensed Personnel shall be paid for at the overtime rate when such work is performed Monday through Friday and at the Overtime Rate when such work is performed on Saturdays, Sundays or Holidays. Such payment is to be divided among the Unlicensed Personnel ordinarily required to perform such work.
The Unlicensed Personnel shall continue to perform such work as they have heretofore customarily and traditionally performed, regardless of technological or other changes implemented or sought to be implemented aboard vessels operated by any of the Companies which are signatory to this Agreement.
The Company agrees that no sea-going work or services of the kind, nature or type historically or traditionally performed, or presently performed, or hereafter assigned to the Unlicensed Personnel covered by this Agreement will be subcontracted, transferred or assigned in whole or in part to any other person or entity. It is the purpose and intent of this clause to preserve the work of the Unlicensed Personnel covered by this Agreement and, accordingly, said clause shall not be applicable to work or services which historically and traditionally have been performed by other persons or entities.
SECTION 17.	CARRYING OF CADETS, ETC. IN LIEU OF CREW. No cadets, workaways or passengers shall be carried in lieu of the crew.
SECTION 18.	EMERGENCY DUTIES AND DRILLS, (a) Any work necessary for the safety of the vessel, passengers, crew or cargo, or for the saving of other vessels in jeopardy and the lives thereon, shall be performed at any time, and such work shall not be considered overtime.
In an emergency such as the above paragraph deals with, it is not necessary to call out all hands unless the Master of the vessel feels that it is necessary.
“Any work necessary for the safety of the vessel passengers, crew or cargo or for the saving of other vessels in jeopardy and the lives thereon, shall be performed at any time, and such work shall not be considered overtime” refers to instances when it is ordinarily necessary to muster the entire crew in order to assure the safety of the persons or property mentioned. Incidents of this kind should be recorded in the official Log.
Routine work for the safe navigation of the vessel refers to such operations as steering, standing a lookout, standing any regular watch on deck or in the engine room.
(b)	Whenever practicable, lifeboat and other emergency drills shall be held on weekdays, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Preparation for drills, such as stretching fire hose and hoisting and swinging out boats, shall not be done prior to signal for such drills, and after drill is over, all hands shall secure boats and gear. In no event shall overtime be paid for work performed during such drills, except as herein provided.
(c)	The Overtime Rates shall be paid for lifeboat and other drills held on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, except in instances where departure time and date do not permit required drills being held before the first Saturday, Sunday or Holiday after departure.
(d)	In port when such drills are held on Saturdays, Sundays or Holidays, the Overtime Rate shall be paid, except where such drills are held on days of departure, or required by regulatory agencies such as the US Coast Guard or IMO. All Unlicensed Personnel shall be given instruction on how to start the lifeboat engines.
SECTION 19.	SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. The employer shall furnish all required safe working gear and equipment. Unlicensed Personnel shall wear all furnished personal protective equipment (PPE) and utilize all required safety gear and equipment and follow all safety procedures. Whenever a seaman is required to obtain his own working gear, including safety shoes, he shall be fully reimbursed by the employer. However, reimbursement for safety shoes is limited to permanent personnel and personnel employed on a trip tour basis, and will be issued no more frequently than once a year, up to a maximum of $125.00. No man shall be required to work under unsafe conditions. Ordinary hazards of the sea shall not be considered unsafe conditions in applying this section. Unlicensed Personnel shall fully participate in the company’s Safety Management System.
Unlicensed Personnel shall not be required to work over the side or aloft when the vessel is loading or unloading explosives, except in case of emergency.
All off duty Unlicensed Personnel shall be required to attend shipboard safety meetings. Participation in such training or safety meetings shall be without additional compensation.
Survival suits shall be placed aboard the Company’s vessels pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulations. The seaman to whom such suit is issued, shall reimburse the Company for costs incurred in the repair or replacement of such suit as a result of its improper use, damage, or loss.
The Union and the Company shall cooperate in establishing and instituting a Shipboard Safety and Health Program as a means toward reducing the occurrence of shipboard injuries and limiting potential liability.
All unlicensed seaman shall renew their basic safety training (BST) certification in accordance with the regulations, but not less than every five (5) years.

Department heads shall collect and return overtime sheets to the Unlicensed Personnel no less than once a week, clearly indicating any disputed claims.
SECTION 26.	PAYMENT OF OVERTIME. All money due for crew overtime shall be paid at the signing off. In the event payment of overtime is delayed by the Company beyond the twenty-four (24) hours after signing off Articles, additional compensation shall be paid at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) a day for each calendar day or fraction thereof aforesaid payment of overtime wages is delayed.

Upon request, the Unlicensed Personnel shall be granted advances at least once every five (5) days, except on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, while the vessel is in port. Such advances shall be made available to the Unlicensed Personnel not later than 4:00 p.m.
Valid overtime and approved subsistence and lodging claims shall be included in computing the amount upon which the seamen may draw.
Procedures shall be established on all vessels on foreign or intercoastal Articles whereby allotments or remittances may be made at the behest of the Unlicensed Personnel not less than once every fifteen (15) days if so requested.
SECTION 29.	EXPLOSIVES. On vessels carrying explosives in excess of fifty (50) long tons as permitted by law, the Company agrees to pay each member of the Unlicensed Personnel, in addition to their regular monthly wage, ten percent (10%) per month of such wages from the time the loading of the explosive cargo is started until the explosive cargo

Due to new construction, vessel acquisitions, technological change and/or government regulations, these Rules may be suspended or modified for a period of six months to insure that the Unlicensed Personnel possess the experience and necessary skills to provide a high degree of safety and productivity during the course of their employment. This six month period shall be designated as Organizational Status.
It is agreed that for purposes of construction of these Shipping Rules, wherever the masculine gender is used, it shall include the feminine gender.

(d)	Any seaman who possessed Class “A” seniority prior to June 16, 2001, and who because of the Rules in effect at that time lost their seniority for failure to ship regularly, may obtain Class “A” seniority provided they ship regularly as defined herein in each of two (2) consecutive calendar years and submit such evidence of shipping regularly to the Seafarers Appeals Board.
(e)	Any Class “B” seniority seamen with a rating above the entry level and a U.S. Coast Guard lifeboatman endorsement, who has sailed two hundred and forty (240) days within a consecutive forty-eight (48) month period on the LMSR or Bob Hope Class Ships.

(d)	All unlicensed seamen who satisfactorily complete the entry rating training program conducted at the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship.

The ninety (90) day period of employment required of a seaman during any year constitutes shipping regularly within the meaning of these Rules, and it shall be reduced proportionately in accord with the amount of time spent by such seaman during that year as a bonafide in- or out-patient in the continuing care of an accredited hospital or doctor. (For example, four (4) months in- or out-patient time during a given calendar year reduces the ninety (90) days employment requirement for that year by one-third to sixty (60) days).
G.	In the event a seaman possessing less than Class “A” seniority rating fails to ship regularly within the meaning of these Rules during a particular calendar year, he shall lose all accumulated employment credit for that and all preceding years in his then current seniority rating.
H.	In the event a seaman’s covered employment has been interrupted by circumstances beyond his control,
Standard Freightship Agreement 2001
53
resulting in his failure to ship regularly within the meaning of these Rules, the Seafarers Appeals Board may, upon application of the affected seaman, grant such total or partial seniority credit for the time lost as the Board may deem necessary in its sole discretion to avoid undue hardship.
I.

(b) No seaman shall be registered for employment who cannot reasonably read, speak, and understand English; such proficiency shall be determined and established by the passing of a required English language exam which shall be administered at the SIU hiring halls.
(2.)	(a) All seamen possessing U.S. Coast Guard endorsements, verifying certified deck or engine ratings,
shall be registered in Group I or Group II of their respective Departments. In the Steward Department, seamen shall be registered in Group I-S, I or 11 upon presentation of their seniority identification card and providing proof of qualification for such registration. All other seamen who possess Class “A” or Class “B” seniority ratings shall be registered as “Entry Ratings-Steward” or “Entry Ratings-Other” as defined in Rule 3. A., Departments and Groups, and may bid for jobs in the classification in which they are registered. All other seamen who possess Class “C” seniority ratings shall be registered as “Entry Ratings,” as defined in Rule 3.A., Departments and Groups, and may register for only one Department, to wit. Deck (Ordinaries on Watch, OS Deck Maintenance); Engine (Wiper, General Utility Deck/Engine); and Steward (Utility Messmen, Waiters, Messmen, General Steward’s Utility). Upon attaining endorsements from the U. S. Coast Guard of certified ratings, in the Group I or II category, in either Deck or Engine Department as defined in Rule 3., Departments and Groups, or having sailed in the Steward Department for a minimum of six (6) months, application may be made to the Seafarers Appeals Board for consideration of permanent registration in.the Deck, Engine or Steward Departments.
(b) The Seafarers Appeals Board at its sole discretion may, upon review of the current Manpower needs, require that Q.M.E.D.’s only be registered in their current classification for a period of one (I) calendar year from the date they received said classification, at which time they must make application for and satisfactorily complete the course designated by the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship to attain the next highest classification. •
(3.) Shipping registration cards shall be non-transferable and shall be issued at Union hiring halls only upon application in person by seamen desiring same, except as provided in Rule 5.A.(2.)(a) and (b). However, resident seamen at the Seafarers International Union Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center, Piney Point, Maryland, who are not registered at a port prior to arrival at the Center may be registered at the port of their choice upon arrival at the Center. Shipping registration cards shall be time and date stamped when issued and shall show the registrant’s class of seniority rating, Department and Group.
(4.) Shipping registration cards shall be issued during the regular business hours of the Union’s hiring halls. Every seaman desiring to register must possess and submit all documents required by the United States Coast Guard including a valid STCW endorsement and by applicable law for employment as a merchant seaman aboard U.S.-flag vessels, and, in addition, a valid, current United States passport or evidence that a United States passport has been applied for within two (2) weeks of the date of registration and a Training Record Book (TRB). At the time of registration each seaman is responsible for producing sufficient evidence to establish his class of seniority rating. For this purpose an appropriate seniority identification card issued by the Union shall be deemed sufficient, although other official evidence of employment, such as legible U. S. Coast Guard discharges, may also be submitted.
Seamen seeking employment aboard LNG vessels, in addition to the documents heretofore specified, must also
54
Standard Freightship Agreement 2001
possess a certificate of satisfactory completion of the LNG program offered by the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship for the department in which such seamen regularly ship.
Seamen permanently employed aboard LNG vessels must register for re-employment aboard LNG vessels within seventy-two (72) hours following completion of their designated tour of duty. Said seamen must confirm their acceptance to return to a designated LNG vessel within seventy-two (72) hours prior to the scheduled arrival of the vessel.
Seamen permanently employed aboard LNG vessels also must possess a certificate of completion from the LNG recertification course offered at the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship. Such certificate must be obtained from the school within two (2) years of the effective date of the new agreement, or within two (2) years of a new employee receiving a permanent assignment in the LNG rotation. Failure, except for good cause, to obtain the certificate will result in forfeiture of the seaman's permanent assignment in the rotation.
(5.)	(a) In ports where the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan maintains a clinic, no seaman possessing a clin-
ic card that has expired shall be permitted to register for employment. However, no seaman shall be shipped unless he submits a valid Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan clinic card when competing for employment at any job call.
(b)	When an employee submits to a physical examination in order to obtain a clinic card, the employee shall disclose on the examination form and to the examining physician any: (I) known physical or psychological condition that bears upon his physical or mental fitness for employment as a mariner, and (2) all lost time injuries and illnesses, whether employment related or not within the preceding four years. Misleading or false statements on the examination form or a failure to disclose prior injuries or illnesses shall be considered willful misconduct and just cause for discharge and may result in loss of seniority.
(c)	If any employee in possession of a clinic card shall become unfit-for-duty for seven days or more during the indicated valid period of the card, such card may be invalidated by the office of the Medical Director of the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan and subject to surrender upon demand by an authorized representative of either the Seafarers International Union, AGLIWD/NMU or the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Plan.
(d)	No seaman shall be shipped to a contracted vessel without having passed the required pre-hire drug test pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulation, except those seamen who are granted an exemption in accordance with the regulations in effect at that time.
(e)	No seaman shall be shipped to a contracted tanker, tank vessel or barge, as specified in the U.S. Coast Guard regulations, without first providing a Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Benzene Clearance on their clinic card and a current Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan Benzene Certificate.
(6.) To remain valid, seniority registration cards must be stamped once each month in the port of issuance. The dates and times for such stamping shall be determined by the Port Agent for each port, and each registrant shall be notified of the dates and times for stamping when he receives his shipping registration card. A seaman who fails to have his shipping registration card so stamped during any month shall forfeit the same and shall be required to re-register. In the event circumstances beyond his control prevent a seaman from having his shipping registration card so stamped, the Port Agent may stamp such card as if the seaman had been present on the required time and date upon submission by the seaman of adequate evidence of the circumstances preventing his personal appearance.
(7.) Subject to the provisions of these Rules, shipping registration cards shall be valid only for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of issuance. If the ninetieth (90) day falls on a Sunday, a national or state holiday or on a day which the Union hiring hall in the port of registration is closed for any reason, shipping registration cards which would otherwise expire on such day shall be deemed valid until the next succeeding business day on which the said hiring hall is open. Shipping registration cards’ periods of validity shall also be extended by the number of days during which shipping in the port of registration has been materially reduced by strikes affecting the maritime industry generally or by other similar circumstances.
The ratings specified in Rule 5.A.(14.)(a) who have requested reliefs on vessels which because of operational necessity exceed the ninety (90) day registration period, preventing the rating from rejoining his vessel at the expiration of the relief time requested, shall be nevertheless considered in compliance with the period of registration.
C. The following Rules shall govern shipping of registered seamen through Union hiring halls:
Standard Freightship Agreement 2001
55
(1.) Seamen shall be shipped only through the hiring hall at the port where they have registered for shipping. No seaman shall he shipped on a job outside of the Department or Group in which he is registered except under emergency circumstances to prevent a vessel from sailing shorthanded, or as otherwise provided in these Rules.
(2.)	(a) Jobs referred to the Union hiring hall shall be announced and offered to registered seamen at the times
and according to the procedures set forth in Rule 4 hereof. At the time each job is so offered, registered seamen desiring such job shall submit their shipping registration cards, U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner’s documents, valid Seafarers Health and Benefit Plan clinic card, Training Record Book and any other documents required by law, regulations or the Shipping Rules herein, to the hiring hall dispatcher. Registration cards of seamen at the Seafarers International Union Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center, who have been registered in accordance with Rule 2.B.(3.), as amended, and are certified as ready for employment, shall be considered along with the registration cards of seamen who are present in the hiring hall at the time the job is called. The job so offered shall be awarded to the seamen in the appropriate Department and Group possessing the highest priority, as determined pursuant to Rule 2.C.(3.) hereof.
(b) Seamen competing for jobs requiring a valid passport must submit their passport at the job call for verification.
(3	.) Within each Department, seamen of higher seniority rating shall have priority for jobs over seamen of lower seniority rating, even if such higher seniority seamen are registered in a different Group from that in which the offered job is classified. As between seamen of equal seniority ratings within the same Department, priority shall be given to the seaman registered for the Group in which.the offered job is classified. In the event seamen of equal priority under this paragraph bid for the same job, the job shall be awarded to the seaman possessing the earliest dated shipping registration card.
For the purpose of this section, the departments shall only be: Deck, Engine and Steward.
Nothing contained in these Rules shall proscribe or prohibit as part of the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship program the employment of the program’s trainees aboard the designated vessels in the manner provided by the program, and such employment shall not be or constitute in any respect a violation or abridgment of the provisions of these Shipping Rules.
(4	.) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Rules, no job shall be awarded to a seaman who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time such job is offered; nor shall any seaman be awarded any job unless he is qualified therefore in accord with law or unless he submits, if necessary, appropriate documents establishing such qualifications.
(5	.) The seaman awarded a job under Rule 2,C.(2.) hereof shall immediately surrender his shipping registration card and shall receive two (2) job assignment cards containing his name and the details of the job. When reporting aboard his vessel, the seaman shall present one (1) job assignment card to the head of his department and the other to the Union department delegate.
D.	A seaman who quits or is fired from a job during the same day on which he reports for such job shall retain his original shipping registration card provided he has received no compensation for such day’s employment and promptly notifies the hiring hall dispatcher in sufficient time to fill the job and prevent the ship from sailing short handed.
E.	A seaman who receives job assignments pursuant to Rule 2.C.(5.) hereof and subsequently rejects or quits the same on two (2) occasions within the period of his shipping registration card’s validity shall forfeit his shipping registration card and shall secure a new shipping registration card.
F.	All seamen registered for shipping, other than those possessing Class “A” seniority rating, who are unavailable to accept or fail or refuse to accept three (3) jobs for which they are qualified during any one (1) period of registration, may forthwith be refused the right to register for employment under these Rules for a period of twelve (12) months. Upon application as provided in these Rules, the Seafarers Appeals Board may shorten or revoke such refusal of registration for good cause shown.
G,	(1 -)(a) Except where specifically provided for in these Rules, seamen with Class "A” seniority rating, shipped pursuant to these Rules, may retain such jobs for one (1) round trip or two hundred forty (240) days, whichever is longer. At the termination of such round trip or on the first opportunity following the two hundred fortieth (240th) day on the job, such seamen shall sign off their vessels, and the vacant job shall be referred to the Union hiring hall.
56
Standard Freightship Agreement 2001
(b) Such Class “A” seamen after having attained no less than two hundred forty (240) days of employment or one (1) round trip, whichever is longer excluding time off, shall be paid transportation, if applicable, subject to the provisions of Rule 2.1.
(2.) During the period of employment, qualified unlicensed personnel, excluding those employed on a trip tour basis, after having attained no less than one hundred twenty (120) days of employment, may request a relief of no less than thirty (30) days. This time off shall not exceed sixty (60) days. Transportation expenses, if any, will be borne by the seaman requesting the relief and transportation expenses for the relieving seaman shall be borne by the Company. Such Class “A” seamen shall be entitled to complete the balance of either two hundred forty (240) days employment or the designated trip tour excluding time off.
(3.) In the event the Union is unable to fill a request for a qualified certified rating, the Employer may agree to accept a seaman who does not possess the appropriate certified rating, if permissible by U.S. Coast Guard regulations on a temporary basis, regardless of his seniority classification for one (1) round trip or sixty (60) days, whichever is longer. The appropriate notification shall be specified on the seaman’s dispatch card.
Such reliefs can only be requested by seamen aboard vessels located in Continental U.S. ports, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.
(4.)	(a) If a vessel lays up during the period that a relief is provided, the seaman providing the relief shall
have the option of completing the relief period when the vessel is reactivated. If the remaining relief time is not accepted by a relief, the seaman who was being relieved must rejoin the vessel.
(b) If a vessel is reactivated within thirty (30) days from the date of lay-up, any seaman having the right to rejoin the vessel as prescribed in Rule 5.A.(2.) shall be allowed to complete the remaining portion of his specified period of employment according to his seniority classification.
(5.) Trip reliefs shall be provided only when a replacement is available. Seamen who leave a vessel without proper relief waive their right to rejoin the vessel pursuant to the trip off provisions.
(6.) Every effort will be made by the seamen rejoining the vessel to do so at the same port where the relief was provided.
(7.) Seamen being relieved shall register at a port in the Continental United States or Puerto Rico within forty-eight (48) hours after being relieved, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays.
(8.) Seamen who register after being relieved cannot compete for other jobs referred to the hiring hall. If they compete for other jobs, they waive any right to rejoin the vessel on which they were relieved unless doing so at the behest of the Union. Failure to return to the vessel from which they were relieved will result in the forfeiture of said registration card except in those cases beyond the seamen’s control such as sale, lay-up or scrap of the vessel.
(9.) Seamen shipped for relief trips shall be designated as “Temporary Relief’ by the Dispatcher.
(10.) Seamen requesting reliefs must advise the Ship’s Master, Ship’s Chairman, and departmental delegates of such intent seventy-two (72) hours prior to the vessel’s arrival in port.
(11.)	(a) The Union and the contracted Employers shall coordinate the dispatching of trip reliefs to avoid
duplication of pay. If not possible, the following procedure shall be implemented.
(b)	In American domestic ports, a seaman’s pay shall start as of the day in which he reports for work aboard the vessel, unless the seaman he is replacing is being paid for the same day. In such event both shall be paid for the day but contributions for fringes shall be paid to only the departing man.
(c)	Seamen accepting trip reliefs shall assume the watch and quarters of the seaman being relieved. At the conclusion of the relief trip, the seaman who was relieved shall return to his original watch and quarters.
(12.)	(a) It is the responsibility of the seaman having the right to relief to return to the vessel at the comple-
tion of the relief by claiming his position from the hiring hall shipping board no later than the day prior to the vessel’s arrival. On vessels arriving on a weekend, the re-ship assignment card must be picked up no later than Friday. If Friday is a recognized holiday in port, the re-ship assignment card must be obtained on the preceding Thursday.

(14.) All Port Agents shall maintain a detailed record of all vessels and personnel involved in the aforementioned procedures.
(15.) Seamen accepting relief trips will not lose their registration cards if the ninety (90) day period of registration has not expired at the completion of the relief trip.
(16.) Shipping of reliefs shall be in accordance with the provisions of Rule 6. A.
(17.)	(a) Except as specifically provided for herein or by SAB action, seamen with Class “B” seniority
ratings, shipped pursuant to these Rules, may retain such jobs for one (1) round trip or one hundred eighty (180) days, whichever is longer. At the termination of such round trip or on the first opportunity following the one hundred eightieth (180th) day on the job, such seamen shall sign off their vessels and the vacant job shall be referred to the Union hiring hall.
(b) Ordinary Seamen employed aboard cable ships, who have satisfactorily completed the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship entry training program, shall be permitted to remain aboard a cable ship for a total of two hundred forty (240) days with a sixty (60) day relief period after four (4) months of continuous employment i n order to obtain the necessary seatime required by the U.S. Coast Guard to obtain Able Seaman certification.

Such other schedule as may be established, however, shall be in writing and posted on the hiring hall bulletin board.
C.	Seamen holding Class “C” seniority rating shall not bid for a job offered pursuant to these Rules until the same has appeared on eight (8) job calls without being taken.

(2.) In the event that personnel are required by a cable ship to assist in the repair of a cable break, all jobs requested by the Employer shall be referred by Manpower to the port nearest to where the cable ship involved is located, for one job call only.

(b)	Seamen accepting temporary employment on cable ships and vessels assigned to a contracted Employer by any Federal Agency for assistance to the military on a limited basis, and whose employment is terminated before attaining thirty (30) days of employment, shall receive back the registration card on which he was shipped, provided the period of registration has not expired.
(2.) (a) If a laid up ship requires a crew to report for duty aboard a vessel within thirty (30) days following lay-up, the crew members at the time of lay-up shall have priority for all such jobs, provided that such crew members are registered at a Union hiring hall not later than 5 p.m. on the third day following the date of lay-up. If the third day following lay-up is a Sunday or a recognized Holiday in such port, the period in which registration must be completed shall be extended through the next business day. If a laid up ship requires a crew to report within three (3) days or less following the date of lay-up, the crew members at the time of lay-up may register up to and including the date the ship is recrewing. It is the responsibility of the crew members wishing to reclaim their jobs to maintain contact with the Port Agent where registered since such jobs are available to crew members employed at the time of pay off for a limited period of time, but not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours, if available.
