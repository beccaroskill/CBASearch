ARTICLE 16:	DEATH AND ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND
DISMEMBERMENT AND CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS BENEFITS
A.	Death benefits shall be provided in the amount of $17,630 or the employee's annual salary, whichever is greater. The death and dismemberment benefits for permanent part-time employees who work an average of 50% of a regularly scheduled work week shall be the greater amount of their annual salary or that percentage of $17,630 which corresponds to the percentage of the work year of a full-time employee which is represented by that part-time employee's regularly scheduled annual hours.
Dismemberment benefits shall be as follows:
1.	For the loss of a hand, foot, or the sight of an eye, the benefit will be one-half (1/2) the amount specified in A, above.
2.	For a double dismemberment, the benefit will be equal to the amount specified in A, above. Double dismemberment shall be defined as:
(i)	Both hands or both feet
(ii)	One hand and one foot
(iii)	One hand and the sight of one eye
(iv)	One foot and the sight of one eye
(v)	Sight of both eyes
B.	In the event of accidental death, the benefit payable shall be double the amount specified in A, above.
C.	The death benefit as stated in A, above, may be paid in advance to employees who are catastrophically ill. An employee who is catastrophically ill is characterized by the following: (1) he is totally disabled and therefore cannot work for the City or any other Employer in an active or limited capacity, (2) his medical prognosis shall state that the disabling illness which arose either suddenly or gradually is likely to cause the death of the affected employee within a two (2) year period, (3) the affected employee must apply for an ordinary disability retirement allowance or a service retirement allowance, if over age 60, to be eligible for the catastrophic illness payment.
The claim must be filed within six (6) months after the claimant has become incapacitated or disabled and is unable to return to work.
The Department of Human Resources shall be charged with administering the catastrophic illness benefit and determining the eligibility of the claimant for said benefit. Upon request, CUB or the employee shall furnish the Department of Human Resources with any and all data and documentation pertaining to each claim. The Department of Human Resources may order examination of the claimant by a physician of its choice. No benefits may be paid for injuries or disabilities for which compensation was paid under (1) Workers' Compensation laws
14
CUB FY 2004-05.doc
or (2) accidental disability provisions of the Employees' Retirement System. If the decision of the Department of Human Resources is unsatisfactory to CUB, an appeal may be made to the Catastrophic Illness Appeals Board. Said Board shall be comprised of three (3) members; one member chosen by the City, one member chosen by CUB, and a third member chosen by both parties to serve as impartial chairman of the Board. The impartial chairman must possess an M.D. degree. In its deliberations, the Board shall be furnished any and all data and documentation pertinent to the appeal by both parties. The Board may order examination of the appellant by a physician of its choice.
If the claimant should expire after it has been determined that his illness is catastrophic and before the catastrophic illness benefit is paid, the payment shall be made to the named beneficiary or guardian upon receipt of a valid death certificate showing that the illness which was previously determined as catastrophic contributed to or was directly responsible for the death.
D.	An employee’s coverage under this Article shall be terminated upon resignation or 39 days after the last day he was in pay status on the City payroll, except that employees represented by CUB shall be covered by a reduced death benefit of $5,000 if they retire from City employment. Retired persons so covered shall also be covered by the Accidental Death and Dismemberment provisions outlined herein above at the reduced rate.
E.	Beneficiary
The beneficiary of these benefits will be one of the following:
(a)	The beneficiary designated by the employee to receive retirement system benefits; or
(b)	A specifically designated beneficiary of the above benefits, in lieu of the beneficiary designated in (a) above.
If the employee so designates a beneficiary, he shall have the right to change the beneficiary at any time. The beneficiary change shall become effective on the date acknowledged by Employer.
F.	Employees of the Police Department shall remain eligible for the benefits of the Death Relief Fund as set forth in applicable State Law during the term of this Memorandum of Understanding.

2.	In those work sites in which the City has heretofore provided lunch facilities, the City will either provide adequate facilities or stagger lunch breaks where necessary to insure each employee a full forty (40) minute lunch period. With the approval of the appropriate supervisor, employees shall be allowed to leave the work premises during duty-free lunch periods. Approval will not be unreasonably denied.
3.	If an employee's unpaid, duty-free lunch is interrupted because of plant operations and the employee is not given time during his shift to finish lunch, the uncompleted portion of the lunch period shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate.

The employee shall then be paid for the balance of his regular work shift at the appropriate rate. Nothing herein shall be construed as to mean compounding of overtime. This four (4) hour minimum shall not be counted as time worked for overtime purposes.
16
CUB FY 2004-05.doc

B.	After forty (40) hours of work in a work week, non-exempt employees shall have the ability to receive overtime compensation as a cash payment or as compensatory leave. Eligible employees in the Police Department shall receive cash payment only. The maximum accumulation of compensatory time shall be two-hundred forty (240) hours.

The offering of overtime shall be equalized over each six (6) month period beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the effective date of this Agreement or on the first day of any calendar month this Agreement becomes effective. Insofar as practical on each occasion, the opportunity to work overtime shall be offered to the employee within the job classification who has the least number of overtime hours to his credit at that time. If the employee does not accept the assignment, then the employee with the next fewest number of overtime hours to his credit shall be offered the assignment. This procedure shall be followed until the required employees have been selected for the overtime work. A record of the overtime hours or overtime shifts offered to each employee shall be posted on the department bulletin board or in an overtime log book for employees access.
G.	Overtime work shall be voluntary except in the event of an emergency situation. There shall be no discipline against any employee who declines to work overtime, except in the event of an emergency. A record shall be kept for each employee, showing the number of hours

of overtime he was offered but refused to work. These hours shall be counted towards overtime hours offered as per Article 18F.
H.	Any assigned City vehicle should be returned to the City lot at the close of the work day. Any employee not allowed to leave the job site before quitting time will be paid for the period of time necessary to return the vehicle to the City lot, in accordance with the Employer's overtime policy.

J.	The Employer shall not vary or rearrange work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime. The Police Department may vary or rearrange work schedules of unit employees to accommodate court appearances and this shall not be considered varying or rearranging schedules to avoid the payment of overtime.

ARTICLE 19:	FLEXTIME
The Employer and CUB agree to cooperate in promoting the highest efficiency and productivity at the least cost to the taxpayer. In the pursuit of this objective the Employer and CUB shall establish a Joint Flextime Committee consisting of five (5) members appointed by each party for the purpose of studying the issue of flextime and composing recommendations which would lead to the implementation, where possible, of flextime rules. The Committee shall meet on a continuous basis upon request of either party. Any Committee recommendations will be submitted to the Labor Commissioner for appropriate action.
