YOUR RIGHT TO UNION REPRESENTATION
The U.S Supreme Court has affirmed a worker’s right io union representation anytime that woker reasonably believes a discussion he.she may be having with a supervisor could lead to disciplinary action.
BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT AND ASK FOR REPRE-SENAT1ON. "1 respectfully request union representation" is all you need tell the supervisor or other management representative.
YOURREQUEST CAN COME ANYTIME DURING THE MEETING - including the point where a “friendly chat" rums to questions on your job performance. It also may come before the start of a meeting if the intent of the meeting is announced or appears clear.
Following your request, the employer representative should permit you summon a shop steward or other union representative
IF YOUR REQUEST IS DENIED, YOU MAY END THE MEETING OR NOT ATTEND.
Don't try to be your own lawyer. Demand the rights guaranteed by your Guild contract and the National Labor Relations Act.

FOREWORD
This document is the text of the 2005-2008 News Media Guild Agreement with The Associated Press. It is a living document negotiated by the union and the company to set the terms and conditions of employment of the AP's employees who have a continuing relationship. It is like a constitution governing rights and obligations and regulating procedures. It is the ultimate authority in AP’s relationship with the approximately 1.700 employees represented by this union.
The contract details rights of the company and the employees—including holidays, vacations, overtime, sick leave, wages, advancement opportunities, health care benefits and pensions. AP’s responsibilities to the Guild-covered employees are minimal.
Nothing precludes AP from paying higher wages or providing better benefits or conditions of employment than the minimum specified. However, no employee is permitted to work for less than these minimum standards.
.Any benefits that the company provides its Guild-covered employees are required under this contract. The benefits and rights are the result of many years of dedicated service by countless AP Guild members—many of whom contributed time and money, in addition to their regular dues, to guarantee the benefits to employees in the Guild's jurisdiction.

Dental Plan - Buy-Un
The Buy-Up dental plan has the same coinsurance level for network and non-network physicians. The reimbursement schedule follows:

The coinsurance levels for the following services for in-network and non-network care is: Preventative: 100%, Basic: 80%, Major: 50%. Orthodontic services: 50%. All plan payments are subject to reasonable and customary limits.
Dental Plan - Core

The maximum plan benefit in a calendar year in-network is $1,000 and out-of-network is $750. Deductibles are for an individual $100, and family $200.

The coordination of benefit provision on all plans is non-duplication of benefits and tbe birthday rule.
Effective June 1, 2003, the plan began coverage of an employee's same-sex domestic partner at the rates established for employee and spouse. It is understood and agreed that such coverage is available only to same sex domestic partners who are precluded by statute from marriage in the jurisdiction of personal residency and, akin to the Plan’s requirement for proof of marriage, is further contingent upon the employee's submission of written evidence that a domicile has been established jointly with a same sex partner who shares the domicile's obligations for expenses and maintenance.
Regarding disputes that may arise concerning health insurance coverage for employees covered by the AP-NMG contract, the following applies: The present POS agreement with the insurance carrier includes a specific grievance and appeals system to handle employee problems and/or concerns
EU-66
regarding medical claims. Nothing herein is intended to supplant or alter those procedures.
The employer will actively participate as necessary in the appeals process to make certain that a fair and complete review is conducted by the earner on any employee grievances and that the employee's interests and rights are protected under terms of the plan.
The employer agrees to closely monitor the disposition of all such disputes on an ongoing basis. It is agreed that an annual dispute review meeting, with the carrier and the union present, shall be held. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss the operation of the plan and to uncover trends that may need to be addressed. In addition, the disposition of employee grievances and resolutions will be reviewed.
In those cases where the internal grievance process of the carrier has been exhausted, and the individual remains unsatisfied, he or she may bring the dispute to the company and the union for review and consideration al this meeting. However, nothing herein entitles the employee to pursue medical and benefits disputes through the arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement.
If this letter accurately sets forth our agreements on this subject, please countersign below- and return a signed copy of the letter to me.

Editorial Training Side Letter
December 21, 2005
Mr. Tony Winton, President
News Media Guild, Local 31222, TNG-CWA
424 West 33rd Suite 260
New York, NY 10001
Dear Tony,
To help our journalists maintain their prominence and viability in a rapidly changing industry, the AP remains committed to its longstanding tradition of providing training and education for its global staff, including those within the News Media Guild's editorial bargaining unit.
We start with the principle that employees who understand all aspects of media work are able to perform their own work better and are more capable of contributing to a fully integrated, collaborative and successful news report. The journalist's essential skills, job duties and responsibilities have not changed, but the tools necessary to do the job continue to evolve.
Therefore, in order to help our employees remain effective journalists with up-to-date skills, and to keep the AP competitive, the AP will continue to provide a broad range of training that includes but is not limited to work in multimedia formats.
The value of this training will be no less than SI million per year for the duration of the contract, barring exigent circumstances.
Training may be internal or external. To the extent possible, training will take place during regular working hours, or the AP will pay employees according to contractual overtime provisions. Employees will not be suspended. discharged, or otherwise disciplined because of their inability to perform new work for which they have not been trained.
Upon written request, the AP will meet with up to three (3) Guild representatives every six months to discuss employee concerns, preferences and inquiries on AP training programs. Employee participants in these meetings will not suffer a loss or reduction in regular wages because of time spent in such meetings with the AP’s representatives.
EU-68
Training will be provided to employees based on their current skills and assignments and strategic position of their bureau or department, as determined by the AP.
Sincerely.

Mr. Tony Winton
President
News Media Guild, TNG/CWA
Dear Tony,
This letter confirms that any Associated Press staff photographer may. in his/her sole discretion, offer the AP Images Catalogue stock-type photography. which is unrelated to the AP's normal news journalism work and which is shot by the photographer voluntarily during his/her off-duty hours from normal assignments. No photographer is required to shoot stock-type photographs and any time spent in such endeavors shall not be considered work time for any purpose. As always, employees who are off duty should consult with a photo or news editor regarding the coverage of spot news and. if authorized, will be compensated according to the collective bargaining agreement's wage and overtime provisions for all time spent in the coverage of that event.
A photographer may utilize the AP-owned cameras and photographic gear that has been issued to him/her in order to produce these generic stock-type images. It is understood and agreed, however, that a photographer may not otherwise use his/her AP issued equipment during off-duty hours or to cover news, sporting or entertainment events, unless it is for the coverage of an AP authorized work assignment.
If the AP. in its sole discretion, accepts the images for inclusion in the catalogue, then the AP will share thirty-five percent (35%) of the gross revenue derived, if any. from the sale of those images. Photographers will be paid monthly based upon payments actually received during the prior month. No revenue will be payable to the photographer unless and until the customer pays the AP for the images.
The AP will exclusively represent, license and sell the images through its global image licensing group for as long as the photographer remains employed by The Associated Press. Bargaining unit employees assigned to the sale of such images will continue to derive the commissions established for such sales under Article 11, Section S of the collective bargaining agree-
EU-70
merit.
Any photographer whose images have been selected by AP for inclusion in the catalogue will retain the copyright to any and all such images. Upon conclusion of employment with the AP. the AP agrees io continue to include and offer for sale those images within its catalogue and w ill continue to share thirty percent of the revenue with the former employee so long as he she continues to provide .AP with an exclusive license. After the conclusion of employment, should the photographer elect to sell the images independently or to offer a license for the sale of the photos to another stock photography catalogue or reseller, then the images shall remain available within the AP's catalogue and the revenue share from any sale of the image will be ten percent (10%) because of the withdrawal of the exclusive license for sale.

medical claims. Nothinghereinisintendedtosupplantoralterthoseprocedures.
The employer will actively participate as necessary' in the appeals process to make certain that a fair and complete review' is conducted by the carrier on any employee grievances and that the employee's interests and rights are protected under terms of the plan.
The employer agrees to closely monitor the disposition of all such disputes on an ongoing basis. It is agreed that an annual dispute review meeting, with the carrier and the union present, shall be held. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss the operation of the plan and to uncover trends that may need to be addressed. In addition, the disposition of employee grievances and resolutions will be reviewed.
In those cases where the internal grievance process of the carrier has been exhausted, and the individual remains unsatisfied, he or she may bring the dispute to the company and the union for review and consideration at this meeting. However, nothing herein entitles the employee to pursue medical and benefits disputes through the arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement.

The pop-up option allows an employee to elect a reduced joint and survivor benefit with a special provision; that should the spouse predecease the retiree, the pension “pops-up” to a higher level of benefit that has been actuarially determined.
