Eligibility for VER medical coverage will remain the same as stated In the Health Care Benefits Summary Plan Description referenced under Article XI,
The Hourly retiree VER medical coverage available will be Identical to the salary retiree VER medical coverage and will be subject to the same medical plan changes which affect the salary retirees.
The cost (premium) of the hourly retiree VER medical coverage will be calculated on an annual basis and will be based on the melded (average) utilization experience of all domestic hourly retirees, covered spouses and covered dependents (excluding Carrier) participating In this VER medical coverage.
The Company will offset (subsidize) a fixed portion of the cost of VER medical coverage, for those retirees who elect to participate, based on years of continuous service at retirement per the following schedule:
